00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,470
SUJU Rule

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,060
Hello~

Heechul arrives while applying cream saucily

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,840
Donghae arrives

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,840
Clad in boyfriend-look feel,

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,910
Everyone has arrived, Shindong being last!

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,910
Looking especially smart today

17
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,200
Everyone arrived completely on time

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,160
Sir, are you wearing a gown?

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,320
- EH: Hyung! Hyung! I think we have guests today

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,320
- LT: We have guests

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,220
Of course!

22
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,350
are prepared in the filming set

23
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,350
Total of 12 seats

24
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,160
There are lots of seats!

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay! Who will be the female guests for today?

26
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,270
Finally female guests~

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,860
There are prizes!

28
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,900
- LT: Here

29
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,900
- EH: Where? Where?

30
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,180
Anyone can see the display of prizes

31
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,140
It's a quiz battle then!

32
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,780
It's okay if it's like this

33
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,130
Female guests and a quiz show?

34
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,130
Is today's format

35
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,340
Hey! Who are the girl groups with 6 members?

36
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,460
[T/N: Gu means 9 and Yuk means 6]

37
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,460
Gugudan! If its Yukdan then it'll be six members

38
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,890
Looking

39
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,890
Good

40
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,060
- EH: Hyung! Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!
- SD: It'll be fun today!

41
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,800
- HC: Hey!
- EH: They have girl's underwear!

42
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,460
That's mine!

43
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,240
The guests for today are girls for sure! For sure!

44
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,010
A prize for female guests?

45
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,790
Today's guests are female?

46
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,700
- HC: Hey Hyukjae! Since there'll be 6 female guests for today,
- SD: The guests must be really girls

47
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,280
Let's try to finish before dinner!

48
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,980
If the filming carries on past 8pm then that's when I'll become a gangster!

49
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,780
I'll turn the studio into a wreck!

50
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,720
#A dream dinner date with girl groups

51
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,720
#More interested with the food

52
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,240
Let's start after clapping the slate

53
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,790
Dreaming of female guests

54
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,600
I'll clap the slate~ 1 2 3

55
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,840
Recording starts

56
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,340
When we come to film, we don't ever know anything about it right?

57
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,200
Is when the format is revealed

58
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,200
On the day of weekly recording

59
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,520
What kind of show will we be doing today?

60
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,140
It's inside

61
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,290
Is insde the blue box

62
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,290
Today's format

63
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,920
I can just pick from here?

64
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,400
This reminds me of watching the lottery when I was younger

65
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Get ready

66
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,040
Okay

67
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,960
Shoot!

68
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,220
Shoot! Tada~

69
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,360
- LT: Fail!
- EH: This will get better eventually, right?

70
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,300
Oh It's done, it's out

71
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,360
Just say the first syllable

72
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,550
And so today's format is?

73
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,100
Wait! This is the... We don't even need this, just by looking at the set, we know what it is!

74
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
- HC: It's a quiz
LT: That's right it's a quiz

75
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,680
Do you think we're dumb? It's obvious

76
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,520
We need to think about, what will happen when a quiz show meets with Suju?

77
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,790
Existing quiz program,

78
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,790
How will it change when it meets Super TV

79
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,600
If it's a quiz then you just ask questions and we answer it

80
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,480
A quiz is nothing...

81
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
There's nothing special though

82
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,460
I haven't heard anything about it

83
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,380
Today's format is a quiz right?

84
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,730
- PD: Super Junior is a global group, right?
- EH: How can we make a quiz different?

85
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
So we used that to change up the quiz format

86
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,660
Today's quiz is based on this attribute of them

87
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,660
Hallyu kings Super Junior,

88
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,620
- SD: Ah! It's Foreigners!
- LT: Maybe foreigners will be quizzing us

89
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,840
- EH: That's right! This!
YS: Will there be people from different countries then?

90
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,070
Foreign guests?

91
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,070
The world map is drawn on the set walls

92
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,880
They've coloured different areas

93
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,660
Guests~ Please come out now

94
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,510
Please come out, today's guests

95
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,880
The guests are coming?

96
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,580
Men

97
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,580
All

98
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,260
Hello

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
They're not

100
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
female guests...

101
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,510

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,560
Hello, I’m Zhang Yuan from China I will be the MC for today

127
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,460
- YA: We've brought various quizzes in different languages for the global group, Super Junior
- LT: Look at that, I knew it

128
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,420
I didn't know

129
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,840
ZEN

130
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,840
FRO

131
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,260
Now, let’s have both teams do a simple self introduction

132
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,940
Hello everyone, it’s Fabien Yoon

133
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,780
I come from Paris in France, the country of baguette

134
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,700
You're all people that can speak Korean! You know how to speak it!

135
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,650
Why are they doing this to us

136
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,120
Eunhyuk, please listen to me!

137
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,510
Automatically opens mouth in awe

138
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,140
Hello, my name is Lucky

139
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,640
I’ve been in Korea for 21 years

140
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
I’ve seen you guys a lot

141
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,960
I’m really happy to meet you for the first time

142
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,980
I think I’ll be taking a lot of presents home today

143
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,060
I think you need to shave first before coming here

144
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,980
That’s okay

145
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,480
'I know right' it was like he spoke Korean!

146
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,810
Thought iit was Korean

147
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,930
The moment 'Okay' turned to 'I know'

148
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,600
He said "I know right"

149
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,030
Zhang Yuan is also tricked

150
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,740
You can't speak Korean

151
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,800
He's speaking Korean himself!

152
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,060
The 6 of you need to speak Korean to understand each other

153
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,640
Calm down, don’t get excited. Let’s listen to the next participant’s self introduction

154
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,130
An Indian that knows(?) Chinese

155
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,780
Will this be okay?

156
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Hello, my name’s Prung or Tatchara Longprasert

157
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,640
I’ve been working for SM Entertainment

158
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,960
Oh~ SM!

159
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,430
I have no idea what you're saying

160
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh, is that it? Oh, I got it

161
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,690
Acts like he understands

162
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,300
EH: They can't even understand each other!

163
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,350
First, let's hug

164
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,900
What is this?

165
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,080
Next person

166
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,300
How are you all?

167
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,860
I'm really glad to see you today

168
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,980
And I'm specially happy because you have a lot of fans who love you in my country

169
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,240
They keep asking about Super Junior. Who do you like? Super Junior

170
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,310
Are you mad at me?

171
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,000
Have you seen Super Junior? Today I’ve seen Super Junior!

172
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,180
So I'm really really happy I've seen all of you today, really glad

173
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,820
Hello, how are you?

174
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,460
My name is Christian. I'm from Mexico

175
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,440
And I’ve come to show you a little about Mexican culture

176
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,310
Dazed...

177
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,300
To you, and you, and you, and you, and you AND you too!

178
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,700
What's 'a ti'?

179
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Ah! Uncle?

180
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,460
Like "Uncle, Uncle, Uncle and UNCLE!" Is that it?

181
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,960
(I'm really happy to see you<3)

182
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Ah! This is frustrating!

183
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,400
So are you going to continue using only your native languages?

184
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,940
Yes yes

185
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,000
Everyone gives a nod

186
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,300
Since we're Korean, we'll keep speaking Korean?

187
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,660
Lucky, how long has it been since you came to Korea?

188
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,760
It’s been 21 years

189
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,700
Ah! He said 2 years!

190
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,380
Ah~ He's been here for 2(?) years~

191
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,380
Acts like they understood

192
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,960
Have you all eaten today?

193
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,260
- SM: Yes! We already ate before coming. And you?
- LT: Yes, we've eaten

194
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,890
Answers in rough guesses~

195
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,420
They can understand Arabic?

196
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,180
What did you eat?

197
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,220
I drank buttermilk

198
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,130
Ah! He said he had lunch box meal

199
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,050
Completely misunderstood

200
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,050
Aha~ You had a packed lunch?

201
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,780
Ah, you ate a lunch box meal?

202
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,780
I heard Fabien is really good at taekwondo!

203
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,770
Taekwondo blackbelt holder, Fabien

204
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,980
Can you show us a kick?

205
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,620
Ah Taekwondo? I do practice Taekwondo a little, that’s true

206
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,760
Do you want to try Taekwondo with me?

207
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,540
What is this terrifying feeling

208
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,820
Hyung he's asking you to try it with him

209
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,540
Suddenly understanding what's happening

210
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,360
No! No! I can't go forward! No!

211
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,130
- LT: You learnt it too, you do it!
- EH: I never learnt it!

212
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,840
It's better for the younger to go first

213
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,060
- SD: Hyung, you're the one that said it!
- EH: Not me!

214
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,900
Trickster

215
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,300
No, no! I won't do it!

216
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,780
Ganging up on Eunhyuk, start

217
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,920
You're already out here!

218
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,160
Out

219
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,160
Freaked

220
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,680
Get ready 1 2 3

221
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,310
Fabien takes off in an instant

222
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,580
Wow! He's really fast!

223
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,210
I almost got hit

224
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,520
Hyung-ah I was so scared

225
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,220
Popular all around the world

226
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,220
Hallyu Kings Super Junior

227
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,150
Global idols'

228
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,150
Global quiz

229
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,300
A frugal way of living

230
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,300
Global Quiz

231
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,980
Please tell us something about what we're doing today

232
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,060
First you guys

233
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,180
Oh! you surprised me!

234
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,700
Surprised at his sudden Korean

235
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,260
Is there anyone out of you that's good at a foreign language?

236
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,260
I can speak a little bit of Chinese

237
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,180
What did you do yesterday?

238
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,680
I had a meal with my family yesterday

239
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,970
You sound good to me?

240
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,520
So you had dinner with your family, what about your girlfriend?

241
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
I don’t have one

242
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
You don’t have a girlfriend

243
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Competent in Chinese, Donghae

244
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
So you know Chinese!

245
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,260
You're better at Chinese than you are at Korean!

246
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,880
- ZY: Other members?
- LT: Eunhyuk

247
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
Another one who's good in foreign language, Eunhyuk

248
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,360
Thai

249
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,520
Do this first,

250
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,030
Properly greets Sawadeekrub~

251
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Sa-Wad-Dee-Krub (Hello in Thai)

252
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,240
Sa-Wad-Dee-Krub

253
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,140
My name is Eunhyuk

254
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,020
That’s correct

255
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,200
You do the 'sexy' thing as well, right?

256
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,060
Am I sexy?

257
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,720
Sexy, very very sexy. Can you show me how sexy you are?

258
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,180
The Thai fans would like it

259
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,660
Am I sexy?~

260
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,370
I can't watch

261
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,760
Why are you doing this?

262
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,860
Just gently moving around like this

263
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,200
[T/N: Yes, that's really what he's saying]

264
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,200
Horny~

265
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,130
All of a sudden

266
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,360
You should go there!

267
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,090
Shouts the only Spanish word he knows

268
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:24,920
When we went there I asked how to say I'm getting hyped and the translator said it's 'cachondo' (horny)

269
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
During his ment, he wanted to say 'I'm excited'

270
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
So Heechul asked how to say it in Spanish

271
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,700
So I kept saying to fans, 'cachondo, cachondo,' I even said it on SNS

272
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,760
I thought it was this kind of excitement like wow! But it wasn't that, it was a different kind of excitement

273
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,900
The meaning is so different...

274
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,460
That's right!

275
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,440
I even said it on SNS!

276
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,010
International humiliation

277
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,140
You're having fun on stage this and then all of a sudden you're like 'Ah, I'm all excited~'

278
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,800
Bad reenactment

279
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,380
Spanish~ Darling~ My queen~ Horny! Horny!

280
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,830
I'm really sorry to my fans

281
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,560
I learnt the wrong thing...

282
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
Heechul's excitement really suits Mexicans

283
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,320
Each country has different standards when it comes to looks right?

284
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,800
So I'm guessing who you think amongst us looks handsome or sexy will be different?

285
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,760
The member preferred in each country is?

286
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,240
I have a friend in France who really likes Yesung! It's that one friend

287
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,260
Just 1 person? Hyung! Congrats!

288
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,700
As expected!

289
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,140
1sung's entertainment ability is one,

290
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,140
maybe it's fate

291
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,880
As expected, 1sung!

292
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,730
- EH: We finally found someone!
- HC: Indeed the man of the number 1

293
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,010
As epected the Man of 1

294
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,240
It's not that! Fabien actually-

295
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,920
We finally found that one person

296
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,210
Loud

297
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,210
Very

298
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,960
Fabien's friend really likes me so they came to my cafe

299
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,410
Please listen to me

300
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,680
That one person

301
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,820
That friend came to Korea just to visit his coffee shop

302
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,140
So you're famous in Europe

303
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,420
How about India?

304
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,510
still not known in India?

305
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,780
We still haven't been to India

306
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,510
Is Super Junior

307
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,060
In India, K-pop still doesn't have much influence, I think it will if you're active there in future

308
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,090
Still doesn't have much influence in India

309
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,090
K-POP culture

310
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,820
But, what's your name?

311
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,040
Shindong

312
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,500
I think we need name tags

313
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,560
Please give us nametags

314
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,420
I think Shindong would be popular if he went to India

315
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,460
- SD: Is that so?
- LT: They must like that type

316
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,440
You have characteristics of a rich Indian person

317
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,330
Oh, really?

318
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,220
Indian richman

319
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,720
I should go into Bollywood and sing suddenly while acting

320
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,390
Can advance to bollywood

321
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,200
I should go to India

322
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,080
As for Egypt, we've not been there. It’s something new for us

323
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,740

I quite think "showing the question written down" would be good

481
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,360
Since a lot of us can read Chinese characters, since it's Chinese

482
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,000
- HC: I know some characters
- Right?

483
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,260
You know
Chinese characters?

484
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,430
- HC: Written down!
- DH: Yes, yes!

485
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,930
- EH: Will you know if you see?
- HC: I know!

486
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,760
- SD: Since we know some characters
- I know them, I'm an expert in them

487
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,800
We will use the "see it written down" hint!

488
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,230
- ZY: I'll show the Chinese characters
- DH: “xiao wang zi”

489
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,300
- SD: It's flower, look that's ‘hua”
- LT: “xiao” prince

490
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,530
Right! “Hua” is flower

491
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,030
Where's the flower? What part?

492
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,040
- HC: Right at the end
- SD: This is flower. That’s flower

493
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,380
Um... so that's flower

494
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,100
Is the one write at the front 'sun'?

495
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,060
This- What is this?

496
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,250
One two move to see closer

497
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,760
Isn't it the character for 'sun', like the 'sun' in the name 'Jin Sun Mi'?

498
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,430
Actually, isn't this 'sun'?

499
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,100
- DH: Hyung, it'll be good to hear it read again
- LT: Please read it for us

500
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,660
What is the little prince's favourite flower?

501
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,440
This is the character for [‘s]. Blank’s something flower

502
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,660
It's something to do with favourite

503
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,130
- EH: Who’s “xiao wang zi” though?
- DH: If only I knew what 'xiao wang zi' was, I'd be able to get it!

504
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,130
What's left is the meaning of xiao wangzi

505
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,030
This means 'small', this is the character for 'king' and this is 'son'

506
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,940
Small

507
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,940
King

508
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,940
Son

509
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,200
Little Prince. It’s the Little Prince!

510
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,510
It's the little prince!

511
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,500
It’s Little Prince!

512
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,280
The Little Prince!!!

513
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,030
What flower does the Little Prince like?

514
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,330
- SD: The little prince! What is the flower?!
- EH: The flower! Is it a Rose?

515
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,420
No, no it’s not

516
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
Isn’t it that rose?

517
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,730
- EH: No, isn't it...
- LT: The flower that doesn't wither!

518
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,100
- EH: Is it the rose that doesn’t wither?
- HC: Edelweiss flower?!

519
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,030
- SD: What is it?
- EH: Teacher!

520
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,460
Wait a second, are you sure?

521
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,180
Answer!

522
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,600
Answer

523
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,730
Answer? He said answer!

524
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,860
Is it a rose that doesn’t wither?

525
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Rose that doesn’t wither ?

526
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,910
Will the suju team win like this?

527
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,080
Wrong

528
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,530
Maybe it's just 'rose'?

529
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,830
- EH: Could it just be rose by itself?
- Yeah since they're just asking what the flower is

530
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,160
You have only one more chance left

531
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,380
Only 1 chance left

532
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
What answer did you give just now?

533
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
A rose that doesn’t wither

534
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,800
Rose! Answer!

535
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,160
Wait wait this is our last chance

536
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,600
- SD: Let’s try with rose
- EH: Isn't there any other flowers that come tomind other than rose?

537
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,090
I have a feeling

538
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Answer! Rose!

539
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:43,940
Answer rose

540
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Rose?

541
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,160
We were right! I knew we were~

542
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,330
I answered it correctly so the present is mine. I’m coming

543
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,040
Because I got it right, the prize is mine!

544
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,740
Honestly, I pretty much got the whole answer

545
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,130
Well since I picked the question-

546
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,780
Me too me too    gift greed

547
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,200
- EH: I figured out The Little Prince!
- LT: That's not it

548
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,200
It's not that one, it's this one

549
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,250
It's not this ?

550
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,630
Hyung you don't even play golf

551
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,030
- YS: Ah it was that!
- ZY: We can't lose that...

552
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,930
This is what you call excitment~

553
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,130
- HC: It wasn't this?!
- LT: No, this one

554
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,760
1st round

555
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,760
Home fragrance set acquired by Suju

556
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,960
This is fun, let’s do the next question!

557
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,330
I said to look at the Chinese characters, right? See?

558
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,900
It’s unfair for me, you guys all know some Mandarin to some extent

559
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,370
Where did your spirit go

560
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,130
Why is he suddenly like this?

561
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,760
Is it okay if I only read the question 3 times?

562
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,430
I can't do it too many times for them

563
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,430
Be easy on me

564
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,680
Pretend not listen

565
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,680
Yesung's turn to pick a question

566
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,730
Next, Yesung will pick

567
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,600
- YS: Following the momentum
EH: Let’s do another Chinese question

568
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,920
Don't pick Chinese

569
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,630
- HC: How about a Spanish cultural art question?
- YS: I'll choose Hindi general knowledge (low difficulty)

570
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,960
Hindi common knowledge (low) ?

571
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,360
They don’t have Hindi general knowledge in low difficulty though

572
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,660
There isn’t?

573
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,230
The low difficulty general knowledge is in Arabic

574
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,100
It's Arabic

575
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,660
High difficulty general knowledge is Hindi

576
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,400
Then I'll choose Spanish cultural arts (low difficulty)

577
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
Spanish Culture & Arts (low)

578
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,860
Yes, that’s right!

579
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
Prize that comes with this question is ?

580
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,210
Bomber Jacket Set & Hat

581
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
Airport Jumper set and cap

582
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,330
Darling~

583
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,530
- CH: What is the school the wizard Harry Potter goes to?-
- DH: I got no idea

584
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,230
We can't know this by listening, please read it once more, slowly

585
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,990
Even if you listen, you can't understand..

586
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,660
It was definitely
low difficulty...

587
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,260
What is the school the wizard Harry Potter goes to?

588
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,630
My queen~

589
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,400
He's talking about Sistar

590
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,730
- EH: In the middle, “aerlakai” is “I like”
- LT: Sistar, Sistar

591
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,230
You didn't space it out normally, did you?

592
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,140
Suspicious

593
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,860
- CH: I spaced it out properly
- LT: Did you do it properly?

594
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,800
I did space it out normally

595
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,100
Please do it once more

596
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,010
Long step                                                                     Long step

597
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,780
Translation app is prohibited!

598
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,850
Using a translation app

599
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,780
That's cheating

600
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,310
Shindong Warning

601
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,800
What is the school the wizard Harry Potter goes to?

602
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,350
Fixed stare

603
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,330
I tried using it but it didn't work, it only came up with 'and'. There's an 'and' in the middle

604
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,460
Cheating fail

605
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,060
I think I heard the last word

606
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Last word

607
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,480
The wizard~ Harrypotter!

608
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,260
Are we allowed to say brand names though?

609
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,820
Why?

610
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,940
What is it          what is it

611
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Haribo, the jelly, isn't that what he said?

612
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,130
- SM: Jelly
- LT: is that right?

613
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,340
Is that really right ?

614
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,130
He said Haribo at the last end

615
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,730
I said he said Haribo at the end

616
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,860
Wait, say it again, clearly. We can’t tell even if we hear it, so say it slowly

617
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,330
Usually in Spanish, you say the end of sentences fast

618
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,030
Mexican people normally talk fast

619
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,550
Good teamwork

620
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,020
What do you see us as!

621
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,160
Senorita, Mamacita!

622
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
I’ll read it clearly

623
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,930
Please read it slowly until the end!

624
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,930
Focus till the last word

625
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:27,400
What is the school the wizard Ha.rry.Pot.ter goes to?

626
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,060
So it’s Harry Potter! It's Harry Potter!

627
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,070
It's Harry Potter!!!

628
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,930
Harry Potter!

629
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,780
Harry Potter is clearly said in the question!

630
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,730
But what about Harry Potter is it?

631
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,360
- LT: Harry Potter’s...
- SD: Who is his girlfriend?

632
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,930
Emma Watson?

633
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,060
Then it’d be Hermione

634
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,560
Answer!

635
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,630
He said ‘answer’!

636
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,620
You

637
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,620
shouted

638
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,620
answer

639
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,360
- EH: Hyung, what are you doing?
- LT: Did he say it?

640
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,160
No I just said the "answer is that"

641
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,730
Making excuse

642
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,860
He shouted it out. What is your answer?

643
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,560
Her… Hermione?

644
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,740
Her....mione

645
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,740
Main actress in Harry Potter

646
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,200
Is that the correct answer?

647
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,040
Correct?

648
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,170
Wrong

649
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,460
That’s incorrect

650
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,710
I was ahead of myself

651
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,660
What if the question’s about Harry Potter’s hometown?

652
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,930
New Zealand?

653
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,030
- CH: So Harry Potter was from New Zealand?
- SD: Is it the name of the magic school?

654
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,090
Then what is it

655
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,290
Only to our viewers
We'llshow you the answer first

656
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:31,870
What is the name of the school that Harry Potter goes to?

657
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,870
Answer: Hogwarts

658
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,060
Isn’t it the name of the uncle wizard in Harry Potter? Gandalf?

659
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,160
- DH: Oh! No, it’s not that!
- SD: Voldemort

660
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,700
- DH: Or…
- YS: I think it’s…

661
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,270
This won't be easy lol

662
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,860
A magical character?

663
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,530
The school’s name… Does the school have a name?

664
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,860
Hogwarts, Hogwarts!

665
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,000
- DH: Ans-
- EH: No, don’t do it!, don't you dare

666
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,550
Controlling his expression

667
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,930
- DH: Answer!
- EH: What are you doing?!

668
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,860
Your answer? Are you going to say your answer?

669
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,920
Bluffing

670
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,660
- DH: I think this is right?
- EH: Why? Where did you get that idea?

671
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,460
- DH: If I get this wrong, I won’t answer any more questions after this

672
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
He has confidence

673
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,960
- LT: Are you confident right now? Do you have confidence?
- DH: I really do. I have a feeling

674
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,270
Believe me I got the feeling

675
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,860
- DH: I haven’t seen Harry Potter but, what was it?
- EH: Hogwarts!

676
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,630
- DH: Hog... Mart?
- EH: Hog…

677
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,800
Hogmart!

678
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,410
Okay~ Let's go shopping to Hogmart!

679
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,530
I’m sorry, but can we have a member that’s good at Korean answer this?

680
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,930
- DH: Hog… Art?
- EH: Hogwarts!

681
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,500
Answer! Hogwarts!

682
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,900
Okay, once again, to check pronunciation

683
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,820
The last hope

684
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,860
Hogwarts!

685
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,700
Correct!

686
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,700
Oh! Really?!

687
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,660
Goosebumps

688
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,600
I don’t know! The school just came to my mind

689
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
It was about the school?!

690
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,900
It's a good thing you've been living as a celebrity surviving on good senses for 12 years

691
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,570
Wits level 9 0Hae

692
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,700
- LK: Congratulations.
- LT: Ah, Donghae!

693
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,500
Won’t we get everything right if we keep going like this? We didn’t even use hints!

694
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,540
2 consecutive wins

695
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,300
That’s good! Our flow is good!

696
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,140
Good let's contuinue like this!

697
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,900
It doesn’t look good for us

698
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,640
The foreigner team one the other hand is...

699
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,800
We should use Arabic

700
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,050
Gloomy

701
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,560
I think we could get anything correct right now, honestly

702
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I’ll go for… Thai

703
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,190
Sulking

704
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,100
In Thai, culture and arts (low difficulty)

705
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,060
Thai
Culture/Arts (low difficulty)

706
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,830
Make up set

707
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,730
Oh, a 3-set of makeup

708
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,060
I need that, I need that

709
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
I could use that well too

710
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,460
Please listen closely

711
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,600
Who is the author of Romeo-

712
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Wait a sec, wait a sec

713
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,500
We’ve traveled to Thailand for 13 years, but…

714
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,850
We won~

715
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,900
It’s because of the intonation

716
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,960
Who talks in Thai like this?

717
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,530
Isn’t this the kind of speech used for being annoying?

718
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
I’ll say it again

719
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,960
Hearing it one more time

720
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,400
Who is the author of Romeo and Juliet?

721
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,060
Oh, Romeo and Juliet?!

722
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,000
Romeo and Juliet!!!

723
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,000
We heard it

724
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,700
- TC: Isn’t it easy?
- EH: It’s so easy!

725
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,400
Tried rolling his tongue but...

726
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,160
- SD: Wait a sec
- EH: “Krai” is 'cried'

727
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,860
- EH: Romeo and Juliet cried…
- LT: Why did they cry?

728
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760
Why were they sad?

729
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,230
It’s out of the blue, but could the answer be 'Lee Donghae'?

730
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,350
Out of the blue the answer could be Lee Donghae?!

731
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,350
Me?

732
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,900
Maybe it's 'who's the person who’s read Romeo and Juliet for three years'?

733
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,560
Romeo and Juliet

734
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,060
I’m reading right now~

735
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,490
Been reading it for 3 years <3

736
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,160
- HC: Oh, that might be right
- SD: The staff's reactions makes it seem likke it's correct!

737
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,860
Donghae's favorite book

738
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,860
Romeo and Juliet

739
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,360
Answer! Lee Donghae!

740
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
Lee Donghae…

741
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,370
Will Suju get 3 consecutive wins like this?

742
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,370
Wrong~

743
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,560
Oh?

744
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,930
Hey, don’t get fooled by the producers’ expressions right now

745
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,900
- EH: You’ve read it a lot, tell us about it!
- DH: But, that’s…

746
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,380
Busy thinking

747
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,300
It's low difficulty, I don't think this question will have a hard answer

748
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,060
It’s Montague and Capulet’s families

749
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,960
You really have read it a lot

750
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,400
Wait! Shakespeare!

751
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,100
All of a sudden...?

752
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,830
Oh, indeed you are smart!

753
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,360
The only possible answer for this category is Shakespeare

754
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,900
Let’s go with Shakespeare for one go

755
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,170
Unable to know Tatchara's expression

756
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,400
Answer?

757
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,530
I think that’s too simple

758
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,500
Let’s try it, and then we’ll still have one chance left over

759
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,610
Correct

760
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,830
See, Shakespeare

761
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,200
That was good!

762
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,180
Mixed

763
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,180
feeling

764
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,030
They looked down on us too easily!

765
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:22,730
Who's is the author of Romeo and Juliet?

766
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:22,730
Thai Culture/Arts

767
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,730
Answer: Shakespeare

768
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,560
When you said the only possible answer was Shakespeare, it was really-!

769
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,160
We’ve really gotten the hang of the cultural arts category

770
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,260
It’s because we’re cultural arts people, that’s why

771
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,530
The producers looked down on us too much

772
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,410
The staff looked down on us too much!

773
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,500
These questionss aren’t hard

774
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,100
- DH: I want to try Hindi once!
- LT: Which category?

775
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,860
People! People!

776
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,060
Hindi!

777
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,480
Bravely chooses Hindi

778
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,480
I will win you all!!

779
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,560
People in Hindi

780
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,350
Hindi

781
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,350
People (medium)

782
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,350
Travelling carrier fullset

783
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,600
- LT: Wow! I need those!  really need those!
- YS: I need one too!

784
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,390
Excited

785
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,730
There’s three!

786
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
I want it too

787
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,900
Aren’t those Chanel?

788
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,260
- Lucky: Are you ready?
- LT: We’re ready, Teacher Lucky

789
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,330
Donghae's chosen: Hindi - People (medium difficulty)

790
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,860
Who is the oldest in Super Junior?

791
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,160
“In Super Junior…”

792
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,260
“Ssabsae?” What is ssabsae?

793
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,530
Ssabsae...

794
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,400
Service? “Service is… best at…”

795
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,230
Hey, it'll be about someone out of us 6

796
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,860
A disappointed person?

797
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,860
[T/N: 'Disappointed' in Korean sounds similar to 'ssabsae']

798
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Let’s go with an acted out hint

799
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,030
An acted out hint without any words
from the other foreign members

800
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,300
But we need this, producers. You can’t act it out poorly on purpose to make us unable to guess correctly

801
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,830
If that happens, then I’ll become a gangster too!

802
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,630
I’m originally an actor. A while ago, I was
in the series “Rustic Period”

803
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,400
Oh, really?!

804
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,360
I acted as the character Wateko Soryong. The guy who arrested after Kim Duhan. “Kim Duhan, I’ll catch you!”

805
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,350
Please refer to S Headquarter Rustic Period

806
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,130
Wow!

807
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,550
Oh~  Actor

808
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,900
Wow, for real?

809
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,900
But I can’t really act now, because that
was a long time ago

810
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
What are you saying? That means you’re not good at acting now?

811
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes, that’s right

812
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,690
I can't act

813
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,500
Okay, then please give us the hint now

814
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,460
If you can't, just do a motion

815
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,900
Ready, set, go!

816
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,800
Lucky's Hindi motion hint

817
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,700
What is it?

818
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,630
Super Junior, 6?

819
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,500
- LT: It’s one of us
- HC: Isn’t it Super Junior-T?

820
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
It’s one of us

821
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,100
- EH: How many are there?
- LT: Do you have a six on your clothes?

822
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,110
I beg you

823
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,160
Oh! Meat ‘yook’?

824
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,160
[T/N: The hanja character for meat is pronounced as ‘yook’; same as the Korean word for ‘six’].

825
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,500
Pork?

826
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,560
Pork topped rice?

827
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,790
Super Junior + 6 meat = Pork Shindong?

828
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,860
The person who can eat six meals in a day?

829
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,260
What? Me? Me?

830
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,460
Hyung! Hyung, it’s you!

831
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,000
But I don’t eat as much you’d think

832
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,360
Don't misunderstand

833
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,660
Let’s go with Shindong once

834
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,830
- SD: Me?
- LT: Yeah

835
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,630
Answer! Shindong!

836
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,540
Wrong

837
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,870
Yasss

838
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,160
Who sings in Super Junior?

839
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,130
But that’s not specific, we all sing.
It’s a question that has a more specific answer

840
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Perfect logic Dong-crates

841
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,300
The way I see it, it’s something like, the fat person or the person who made Super Junior; Lee Sooman Teacher

842
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,460
- EH: Or something like, Super Junior’s leader
- SD: That’s right

843
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,360
I guess “ssabssae” could mean leader or something

844
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,000
Or it could be something like, who is the oldest

845
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,660
- HC: Who in Super Junior is doing military service right now?
- SD: No, I think it’s someone out of us 6

846
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,630
Maintaining his poker face

847
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,430
[To LT] Ah, Hyung! It’s you, Hyung!

848
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,860
Attention seeker! Attention seeker!

849
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,170
If it's "attention seeker"

850
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,730
Leeteuk!

851
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,140
It's Leeteuk

852
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,100
This is your last chance though

853
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
Do it do it, it’s okay if we’re wrong!

854
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,900
- LT: Answer! Leeteuk!
- YS: Okay, let’s go with Leeteuk

855
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,110
Correct~

856
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,300
We got it right!

857
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,620
4 consecutive wins!!!

858
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,160
- SD: What does “sseobssae bara” mean though?
- EH: Attention seeker?

859
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,790
Sulking

860
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,900
You got it right anyway, what use is it to tell you now?

861
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,860
I should go to India

862
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,630
What is it?

863
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,030
The person who is oldest

864
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,660
Oh, I said that

865
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,460
Heechul said it too

866
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,460
I didn't know
my talent either

867
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,030
Oh, I really need a carrier though, I really need it. The wheel on mine broke…

868
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,700
Sulking

869
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,730
Everyone look here, we haven’t won anything yet

870
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,040
Super Junior have any of the prizes

871
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,660
Indeed, it’s Super Junior. Wow~

872
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,870
As expected it's Super Junior

873
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,230
- EH: Hyung, we’ve got the hang of this, so let’s go for a hard question
- LT: Go for one we haven’t done yet

874
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,640
Choose anything

875
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,640
Since we've got the hang of it a difficult question!!

876
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,460
Arabic! People! High diffiiculty!

877
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,610
People (high difficulty)

878
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,610
Arabic

879
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,830
What presents are at stake here?

880
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,110
Skin care product

881
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,700
Skin care

882
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,260
Samy, please say the question

883
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,750
Heechul's chosen: Arabic - People (High difficulty)

884
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,900
What is my name?

885
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,160
What, you punk?

886
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,100
Wait, I’m sorry~

887
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,630
I’m sorry, because it was so short!

888
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,530
Warning!

889
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,530
Okay, a warning. I’m sorry. One more time!
Because it was so short

890
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,430
What is my name?

891
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,270
What is my name?

892
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,700
What is my name?

893
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,460
'Who is me?' Who am I?

894
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,480
First let's laugh...

895
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,360
That’s right, that’s right!

896
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,810
In  disturbing mission

897
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,500
“Eh hu eh semme?” He said “eh hu eh semme?”

898
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Why are you laughing?

899
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,660
[T/N: Correcting pronunciation]

900
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
What is my name

901
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,960
Isme?

902
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,390
What is 'e hu eh'?

903
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,430
Isn’t that Egyptian?

904
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,900
What is “ehu”?

905
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,060
Normally, countries have similar names

906
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,930
If SJ can guess this right

907
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
The foreigner team will have 5 consecutive loses

908
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,030
Shall we look at the hint?

909
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,030
Mix the question with Korean and read it to us again

910
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,230
Reading the question again with Korean mixed in

911
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,430
Since the question is short, I think this will be helpful

912
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,430
We’ll have a short meeting

913
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,300
You can’t have a meeting!

914
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,400
Do as you please!

915
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,210
World's Most Serious Discussion

916
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,400
Do it this way.. otherwise they'll figure everything out

917
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,140
Okay, we're done with our discussion!

918
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,740
Here comes the question

919
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,230
What is (in Korean) my name (in Arabic)?

920
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,440
Mr. Zhang! This doesn't count as hint

921
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,480
- HC: Since we know the "what is" part you can't use this as a hint
- LT: That's right

922
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,100
- LK: But that's part of the question
- SM: I definitely mixed the question into the two languages

923
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,520
But we already guessed that out

924
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,040
As an MC, if I were to have my say...

925
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,730
They're definitely allowed to do so

926
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,420
I just have a tendency to strip off

927
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,460
Won't it be something just like "Who am I?"

928
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,340
- SD: "Who am I?"
- EH: So the answer will be Samy?

929
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,140
That's right

930
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,500
Yeah since I'm kinda getting an attention seeker vibe from him

931
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,460
"Who am I?"

932
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,260
- SD: "Who am I?" Can I try it?
- DH: It's Samy

933
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,280
The answer is...

934
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,280
- SD: 2nd try!
- EH: Hyung, go ahead!

935
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Samy!

936
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:16,180
Hey, earlier! Didn't I say it will be Samy earlier?

937
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,370
Shindong is Amazing

938
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,680
5th Winning Streak!!!

939
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,680
Already

940
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,850
Super Amazing Sense!

941
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,040
That's awesome

942
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,550
Another Prize Won <3

943
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,260
We're crazy

944
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,160
We should recommend them to use hints

945
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,470
- ZY: 'Use a hint~' Then they won't be able to use them for harder questions
- Panel: That's right

946
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,430
Thanks to Super Junior's unexpected skills

947
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,430
Having an Urgent Meeting

948
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,830
I heard everything

949
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,750
French, high-difficulty

950
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,340
Passion

951
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,340
Burning

952
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,820
The present is

953
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
High-Level

954
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
French

955
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,970
Faux Fur

956
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,900
Faux fur jacket and jeans

957
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,940
Faux Fur

3 Sets

958
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,970
1 plus 1 equals cutie, 2 plus 2 equals cutie

959
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,620
3 plus 3 equals cutie, 4 plus 4 equals cutie

960
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,870
Wait pause

961
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,870
Wait pause

962
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,190
Mumbling

963
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,300
You can't read it with such little confidence

964
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,950
Please pronounce it precisely

965
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,870
I'm doing exactly that

966
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,900
Your voice barely comes out

967
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,720
Okay, I'll read it louder

968
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,020
1 plus 1 equals cutie, 2 plus 2 equals cutie,

969
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:16,350
3 plus 3 equals-

970
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,650
I heard Twice!

971
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,050
Twice members plus other group plus other group...

972
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,880
Addition of Girl Groups' Members?

973
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,500
How much is the total?

974
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,000
Repeat it again

975
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,260
This is crazy! We're crazy!

976
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,590
I can sense it~

977
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,590
I can sense it~

978
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,750
He's flustered!

979
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,330
Confident in

980
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,330
Winning

981
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,450
It's hot here

982
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,700
Fabien's expression which can't be read...

983
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,620
Fabien is flustered!

984
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:48,600
- FB: 1 plus 1 equals cutie, 2… plus 2 equals… cutie
- LT: What's that!!

985
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,610
everywhere

986
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,610
Backlash

987
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,150
- EH: I can't hear anything
- HC: Louder

988
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,070
I'll read it one last time since I'm tired

989
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,280
Joking

990
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,280
Playful

991
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,420
You can't do that!

992
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,150
There's no such thing lol

993
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,150
Please speak louder, volume up!

994
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,290
Volume Up!!!

995
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,420
His voice is so quiet so

996
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,800
1 plus 1 equals cute, 2 plus 2 equals cute,

997
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,000
3 plus 3 equals cute, 4 plus 4 equals cute, 5 plus 5 EQUALS—

998
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,170
His face might burst at this rate

999
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,450
- SD: There's definitely Twice in it
- EH: There's four groups

1000
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,650
He said 'egal mignon' 3 times, so that means addition

1001
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,320
I feel like Red Velvet will be there

1002
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,220
I think "Wedeu Beuvle" means Red Velvet

1003
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,020
It's definitely girl group members addition

1004
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,220
Twice plus Red Velvet plus IOI plus...

1005
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,690
Falling into the trap of Girl Groups

1006
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,690
Foreigner Team trying to trick Suju~??

1007
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,690
Speaking loudly on purpose?

1008
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,000
- LK: We've got this one
- TC: Yeah it's difficult

1009
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,720
You can use your hint

1010
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,550
Use your hint!

1011
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,750
What about a motion hint? Then wont they have to dance?

1012
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,870
Should we go with that?

1013
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,220
Right! Lets go with that

1014
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,720
Let's see Fabien's dance skills

1015
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,850
Motion Hint!!

1016
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,620
We'll get it right if he dances

1017
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,470
Please play the song

1018
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,770
Fabien, please come here for a moment

1019
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,950
Hey! You guys are really too much!

1020
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,700
We can't do if if you're gonna be like this!

1021
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,200
If you wanna play this way I'll turn into a gangster! Since I cant hold back!

1022
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,800
We will settle this ourselves

1023
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,130
You shouldn't go, I can't see this happening you can't

1024
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,760
It's okay! It's okay!

1025
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,000
Fabien, just do it as you see fit

1026
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,130
- YS: Don't fight~
- HC: Ah this owl PD, this really won't do

1027
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,720
I'll give out the hint

1028
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,800
You have to dance well

1029
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,780
Fabien's Movement Hint

1030
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,520
You have to pause in between

1031
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,760
- DH: Fabien is cute when he's flustered
- LT: 1, 2, 3... 4, 5

1032
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,530
Five girl groups?

1033
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,600
That's it

1034
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,020
I gave everything out

1035
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,160
Is it really
a Girl group member
addition question?

1036
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:02,010
1+1= Cutie

1037
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:02,010
2+2= Cutie

1038
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:02,010
3+3= Cutie

1039
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,010
4+4= Cutie

1040
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,010
5+5= ?

1041
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,030
It's definitely 5 girl groups

1042
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,900
And the five of them are cute

1043
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,420
Girl group-Holic

1044
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:15,870
Gfriend plus Twice plus IOI plus Blackpink plus Red Velvet

1045
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,870
The answer is 35!

1046
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,370
Let's go with that first

1047
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,000
You're wrong

1048
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,990
Wrong-

1049
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
But we don't know where we got it wrong though

1050
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,000
Exactly, since this is high difficulty

1051
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,500
The answer is... 37!

1052
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,820
Is 37 the right answer?

1053
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,440
Wrong-

1054
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Wrong!

1055
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,630
- EH: Should we include 101?
- Sure, let's try that

1056
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,430
Produce 101, Twice 9, Red Velvet 5, makes it 115

1057
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,800
Plus Black Pink so 119

1058
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,700
And Gfriend?

1059
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Gfriend is 6 so 125?

1060
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,000
Let's try that one

1061
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,000
The answer is 125

1062
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,990
Wrong-

1063
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:55,360
We wonnnnnn

1064
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What is it then?

1065
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,550
Cutie Song! 1+1= Cutie!

1066
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,590
Cutie! Cutie!

1067
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,270
We are all cuties

1068
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,300
3+3= Cutie!

1069
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,190
Who said there was Twice?!

1070
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,410
Mental                                                                     Breakdown

1071
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,800
He definitely said Twice though...

1072
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Fabien really gave everything away in the hint

1073
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,500
Zhang Yuan, please do it in Chinese

1074
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,640
1+1 is cutie, 2+2 is cutie...

1075
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
We should have used that hint!

1076
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,630
If we heard it in Chinese, we'd get it right away!

1077
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,330
Should've listened to it in Chinese

1078
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,970
What a miss

1079
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's over now

1080
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,300
First prize for Foreign Team!

1081
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
So this is how they felt

1082
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,560
Let's refresh our minds again and do well

1083
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,360
Let's go with Chinese to get out of our slump

1084
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,840
it on

1085
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,840
Bring

1086
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,460
We'll go for, Chinese, common sense, mid difficulty

1087
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,480
Resting Leisure Chair

1088
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,150
Resting Leisure Chair

1089
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,770
Where will the Pyeongchang Olympics be held at?

1090
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,590
Eunhyuk held his hand up...!

1091
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,860
Just hearing
it once?

1092
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,790
Huh?

1093
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,490
He knows the answer?

1094
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,930
Huh?

1095
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,680
Where is the opening of Pyeongchang Olympics held at?

1096
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,900
No! What is this?!

1097
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,400
Chinese is too easy!

1098
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,050
Answer! Pyeongchang!

1099

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,510
Sit there

1105

- HC Sit in front there
- EH: Wait, I'll just have a seat

1106
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,300

1107
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500

1108
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,600

00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,000
A lifetime English lecture Coupon

1120
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,590
A golden opportunity to learn english!

1121
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
For real?

1122
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,300
I want it. You want it too

1123
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,890
Me too

1124
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I want it too!

1125
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,700
Please listen to the question

1126
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,420
Pororo is a penguin. Frog is a frog. Then what kind of animal is Dooly?

1127
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,000
- EH: That was too quick!

1128
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
- YS: Please repeat it

1129
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,200
slowly please

1130
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,200
Read it

1131
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,200
- EH: Slowly~

1132
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,420
I'll go slowly, word by word

1133
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,960
Pororo is a penguin. Frog is Keroro. Then what kind of animal is Dooly?

1134
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,500
Phone-call chance!

1135
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,830
I'd like to call NCT's Ten, is that okay?

1136
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,730
We have to use hints for this one

1137
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,730
Use the Chinese hint!

1138
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,000
Please stop mentioning Chinese

1139
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,900
Let's ask him to read it in Chinese

1140
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,500
Stop mentioning Chinese please!

1141
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,890
About to cry

1142
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,600
Let's go to China again in 2018

1143
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,650
Reading the question again in the language Suju wants

1144
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,500
I need to hold it in

1145
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,360
Deep Sigh

1146
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,320
This doesn't feel good

1147
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,620
Read it real fast, real fast

1148
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,960
Lucky! Why aren't you acting like your name!

1149
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,330
- Zhang Yuan: I'll do it fairly, don't worry

1150
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,660
- Lucky: Only a little faster

1151
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,830
His name is Lucky though

1152
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,830
There really isn't this word in Chinese though

1153
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,900
It's not in Chinese?

1154
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,660
- HC: Slowly~
- EH; There's practically everything in Chinese though?

1155
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,600
- LT: We'll understand the question in Chinese
- Zy: I'll read the question

1156
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Seems like it's an English phrase?

1157
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,820
Pororo is- (in Korean)

1158
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,870
Yas! We heard Pororo!

1159
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,330
We're screwed :(

1160
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,530
We're screwed!

1161
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,930
So there's no Chinese word for Pororo

1162
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,120
Obviously there isn't

1163
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:38,570
Pororo is a penguin. Keroro is a frog. Then what kind of animal is Dooly?

1164
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:44,080
Answer!

1165
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,080
The answer is Dinosaur, isn't it?

1166
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,910
HC: Pororo, Keroro, Dooly

1167
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,200
Pororo is a penguin, Keroro is a frog

1168
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,200
They're so senseless!

1169
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
It's something like

1170
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,430
Pororo is a penguin, Keroro is a frog

1171
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,430
So what is Dooly?

1172
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,030
It's a dinosaur

1173
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,350
If that's the case...

1174
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,300
Answer!

1175
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,500
- ZY: Answer?
-YS: What is it?

1176
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Dinosaur!

1177
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,960
Correct!

1178
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,700
See it was right!

1179
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,430
We're on point today~

1180
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,130
Bitter

1181
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,500
How many times have we watched this scene…

1182
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,900
- EH: You can do it too!
- LT: I can do it too!

1183
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,270
So far, they’ve correctly answered 7 out of 8 questions!

1184
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,000
Jealous

1185
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,700
Because we’re doing so well...

1186
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,800
We don't need to hear that

1187
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,430
What should we do next?

1188
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,730
We don't need to hear that

1189
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,160
Let's go for French Culture and Arts, high difficulty

1190
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,200
We lost at the French one earlier

1191
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,250
Suju failed only at the French question

1192
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,250
I’ll win again this time

1193
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,400
We'll reveal the prize

1194
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh that? Oh!

1195
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,400
Shindong, it's that!

1196
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,090
Lambskin goose coat & golf equipment

1197
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,300
French Culture & Arts, high difficulty

1198
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,230
French – Culture & Arts (High difficulty)

1199
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,800
It must be a name ofa song, it's the right time for that

1200
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,470
According to Dongcrates

1201
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,470
It's time for a question about music?

1202
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,700
If the father of music is Bach, then who’s its mother?

1203
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,270
French - Culture & Arts (high difficulty)

1204
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,800
Music? Kkisameya??

1205
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,930
[T/N: Singing 'Bésame mucho' by Andrea Bocelli (and singing it wrong)]

1206
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,080
So they know 'Bésame mucho'

1207
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Can we hear it again?

1208
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,110
Listening to the French question about Culture & Arts again

1209
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,900
Yes~ If the father of music is Bach, then who’s its mother?

1210
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Failure? Even if you fail, don't give up

1211
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,590
Failure?

1212
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,760
Thinking of endless things that are related with failure

1213
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,500
Failure is the mother of success?

1214
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,730
- SD: Culture and arts... We've already done movies and novels
- HC: What was the Thai one?

1215
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,930
Guessing master Shindong starts reasoning

1216
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,300
So it should be a music question

1217
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,900
There’s music in the question right?

1218
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,500
Shall we use the Chinese hint?

1219
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,380
Shall we use the Chinese hint now?

1220
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,960
Will I end up having to leave early today?

1221
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,160
We have to save that one

1222
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,550
Saving the Chinese hint for later

1223
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,000
How about the written hint?

1224
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,850
Show the written version

1225
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,000
Shall we take a look at it?

1226
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,750
That’s good

1227
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,400
Seeing it written is hard though

1228
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,760
We might be able to read it because it's the alphabet we know

1229
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,060
I will show you guys the written version

1230
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,200
- FB: How many seconds should I show it for?
- SJ: Just show us!

1231
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,470
Just show us please

1232
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,000
Our Fabien is so sly!

1233
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
1 2 3

1234
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,260
You won't get it anyway

1235
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,580
Cannot understand at all

1236
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,600
If the father of music is Bach, then who’s it's mother?

1237
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,600
There's a hint in the word you just covered

1238
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,600
You gave them a hint!

1239
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,490
Soz

1240
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,360
Did you see?

1241
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,960
If Bach is the father of music, who is music's mother?

1242
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,960
Question #9: French – Culture & Arts

1243
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,500
Isn't this word Bach? Bach? The father of music

1244
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,070
The covered word

1245
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,070
Bach, the Father of Music

1246
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,700
Father of music is Bach

1247
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,040
Confused between Back and Bach

1248
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,200
Then the mother of music is?

1249
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,210
Crazy reasoning

1250
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,400
Mother? Ahn Miyeon (Shindong’s mother name)

1251
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Yang Hee Eun!

1252
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,600
Kim Eana... Kim Eana!

1253
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,700
Beethoven!

1254
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,500
No... its not Beethoven

1255
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,990
Donghae, that’s not it~

1256
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,500
That's right~

1257
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,000
- SD: Father is Bach... mother... Handel?
- HC: Isn't Bach the mother?

1258
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,230
Handel and Gretel

1259
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,430
Carelessly spouting out the word Handel

1260
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,430
Clenching teeth

1261
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,270
What are these guys

1262
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,440
This situation again…

1263
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,000
Handel? Is it right? Who's the mother?

1264
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,500
Say something... Beethoven or whatever

1265
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,480
Donghae who was silently listening shouts out

1266
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,000
Answer!

1267
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
Answer?

1268
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,310
I got a feeling

1269
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
I can use at least one chance right?

1270
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,130
Handel

1271
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,730
Handel? Will it be correct?

1272
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,020
Correct!

1273
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Oh it's right

1274
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,360
Everything is going right today!

1275
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,430
Even the French we trusted in

1276
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,600
Congratulations

1277
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,800
So what I said randomly earlier was right?

1278
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,540
A                                                               harvest

Let's use a hint!

1378

Mix Korean in between the question and read it again

1380

1440
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,940
He's fascinating

1441
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,330
However, after that…

1442
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,330
French - Nature

1443
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,140
What kind of fish is cooked in chueotang?

1444
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,400
Fabien’s difficult question about France

1445
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,380
'Gelpos?'

1446
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,840
Requested for an acting hint because they weren’t able to understand

1447
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,620
Having another bite

1448
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,200
There's gotta be a meaning behind that

1449
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,410
But then, they still don’t know…

1450
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,860
Answer!

1451
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,600
Silk worm pupa!

1452
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,600
[T/N: Bundaegi (silk worm pupa) is a type of Korean snack.]

1453
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,370
Scorched rice!

1454
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,490
Answer! Jeju Island!

1455
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:08,260
Wrong!

1456
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,410
Wrong answer parade

1457
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,300
Incorrect

1458
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,450
I can’t guess it...

1459
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,450
Foreigner team keeping up their momentum

1460
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,720

Is Super Junior's Kyuhyun...

1463
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:15,920
Super Junior...

1464
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,570
A boy or a girl?

1465
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:18,760
Cute person?

1466
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,620
Cute member?

1467
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,490
Cutest member?

1468
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,260
Could it be me?

1469
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,860
Answer!

1470
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,390
Lee Soo Man

1471
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,350
Shindong!

1472
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,060
I'm the cute one

1473
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,020
Shin Dong?

1474
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,150
Donghae!

1475
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,430
Donghae!

1476
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,430
Then is it me

1477
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,100
Foreigner Team - 2 wins

1478
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,950
It's okay, it's okay

1479
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,510
Okay!

1480
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,590
It's alright

1481
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,860
Don't get discouraged

1482
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,610
Careful

1483
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,310
For me this time-

1484
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,460
Spanish

1485
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,250
Will Suju team be able to reverse the table!

1486
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,250
With this problem

1487
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,780
Math

1488
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,030
Medium difficulty

1489
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,020
Mathematics

1490
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,020
Spanish

1491
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:45,820
Tea maker

1492
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,490
Tea maker

1493
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,030
From the three pieces of chicken,

1494
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,400
Shindong eats two

1495
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,430
Oh it’s my name!

1496
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:54,300
Shindong?

1497
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,680
How many pieces are left?

1498
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,300
Shindong, fantastic, egg

1499
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,420
How many eggs can Shindong Hyung eat fantastically?

1500
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,760
How many eggs can he eat?

1501
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,470
What is that

1502
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:08,090
Will he be eating now, right here?

1503
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,410
Truly

1504
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,410
anticipating

1505
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,230
Is that so?

1506
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,030
Could it be, "How heavy are you?"

1507
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,280
You’ll never know?

1508
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,660
If it's related to math and Hyung,

1509
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,700
I feel that it could be related to Hyung's weight, or the amount of meals you eat in a day

1510
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,550
If it's a question about Shindong

1511
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,550
of meals he has in a day

1512
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,550
It’ll be like the number

1513
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,330
Is Shindong's weight 2 digits or 3 digits?

1514
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,380
The production team wouldn't know my weight now, though

1515
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,760
What would they know then?

1516
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,490
What is information that they’ll know for sure?

1517
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,890
If it's like that...

1518
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,170
Answer!

1519
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:27,860
Answer!

1520
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,840
34

1521
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,300
Is 34 the correct answer?

1522
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,530
Maybe Shindong's age?

1523
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,250
No

1524
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,200
Wrong~

1525
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,470
Aren't you born in 1985?

1526
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,140
Or maybe Shindong’s year of birth?

1527
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,770
Try 1985

1528
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,340
Answer!

1529
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:37,800
Answer!

1530
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,690
85

1531
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,290
Is 85 the right answer?

1532
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,810
Wrong~

1533
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,600
Hey, isn't it 4?

1534
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,600
Why 4?

1535
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,940
What is Shindong's position here?

1536
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,350
1, 2, 3, 4

1537
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,750
Which position am I, according to age?

1538
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,900
Yeah, you're fourth

1539
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,850
It could be like that

1540
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:51,910
Let's go

1541
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,770
Answer!

1542
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,220
4!

1543
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,780
4!

1544
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,750
I’ve said everything that I could think of

1545
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,320
Is 4 possibly the correct answer?

1546
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,380
Is that the correct answer?

1547
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:02,130
Wrong answer even in the last chance

1548
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,780
It's not

1549
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,110
What's the question?

1550
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,790
If there are three pieces of chicken,

1551
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,900
And Shindong eats two,

1552
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,460
How many pieces are left?

1553
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,720
Oh, it's difficult. Difficult

1554
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,160
The answer is...

1555
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,070
1 piece

1556
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:14,870
But that doesn't make sense,

1557
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,410
If there were 3 pieces, Shindong Hyung would finish all 3

1558
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,740
A logical objection

1559
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Ah, really?

1560
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,470
Right? He wouldn’t let others eat

1561
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,550
This is prejudice,

1562
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:26,430
It’s prejudice to say that I’d eat everything, I could leave one and then save it for dinner later~

1563
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,590
So he'd eventually eat it all

1564
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:29,760
For me

1565
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,360
French, nature

1566
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,020
Let’s get French right this time

1567
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,890
Let's escape from the 3 lose streak!

1568
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,400
Let's win Fabien!

1569
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,530
Pressured

1570
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:36,990
Win Fabien!

1571
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,950
The next question is,

1572
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,900
French, nature, high difficulty

1573
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,200
I'll win

1574
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:41,930
French

1575
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:41,930
Nature (high difficulty)

1576
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,700
Mixed Nuts Set

1577
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,300
Mixed Nuts Set

1578
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,340
Hey, I have to eat this nut set!

1579
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,410
It's food!!!

1580
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,940
We have to eat this!

1581
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,810
Members who are hungry because of long recording

1582
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,580
It is high in unsaturated fatty acid,

1583
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,970
It's good for dieting

1584
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,220
I'm protecting the nut set!

1585
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,610
I'm scared

1586
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,180
I have to it eat it all tomorrow!

1587
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,080
Excited~

1588
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,040
I'll start

1589
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,260
If a lion and a rabbit fight,

1590
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,730
Who would win out of the two?

1591
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,220
A good place to kiss?

1592
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,030
Let's use a hint!

1593
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,250
We'll go with,

1594
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,680
Motion hint from the guests

1595
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,870
Motion hint?

1596
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,130
Ah, what should I do...

1597
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,700
Fabien is too-

1598
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,930
This time I’ll give the right answer!

1599
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,780
You can start when you're ready

1600
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
What kind of  motion hint will Fabien show

1601
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,910
Working hard

1602
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,240
Oh, it's totally different

1603
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:24,930
Rabbit

1604
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,620
Tiger and rabbit!

1605
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,010
Ah~ It was hard

1606
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,020
Safari!

1607
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:30,690
What is this?

1608
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,860
Tiger?

1609
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,360
Lion?

1610
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,680
It's an animal that hunts, right?

1611
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,730
This is a tiger and this is rabbit

1612
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,500
Is it a tiger or lion?

1613
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:38,960
Huh?

1614
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,260
Pretends not to know

1615
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,940
He’s acting like he doesn’t know

1616
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,090
To tell them the answer...

1617
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,090
Asking the other team

1618
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,790
If a lion and a rabbit fight,

1619
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,030
Fabien who calmly reads the question again

1620
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,650
Who would win out of the two?

1621
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,800
Ate?

1622
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,240
It sounded like ‘ate’

1623
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,090
It's unclear whether it's tiger or lion

1624
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,940
Anxious

1625
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,100
By nature, they both hunt to eat

1626
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,400
Is the tiger stronger or the lion stronger?

1627
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,380
Lion is king

1628
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,500
But there's no such movie as "Tire King"

1629
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,500
[T/N: Heechul meant to say "Tiger King."]

1630
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,480
It’s tiger...

1631
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,570
Lion

1632
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,200
Lion!

1633
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,380
1, 2, 3!

1634
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,080
Lion!

1635
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,180
Is lion the correct answer?

1636
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,490
CrazyDol Heechul

1637
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,490
who's only picked right answers today

1638
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,130
Or maybe Fabien who has been strong will win?

1639
00:54:14,140 --> 00:55:14,100
[SKIP TO 55:10]

1640
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,860
1, 2, 3! Lion!

1641
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,200
Is Lion the correct answer?!

1642
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,260
CrazyDol Heechul who's only picked right answers today

1643
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,190
Or maybe Fabien who has been strong will win?

1644
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,260
Correct~

1645
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,030
Proud

1646
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What is this?

1647
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You have to empty it out

1648
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,600
Can't believe I lost to Tire King...

1649
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,800
How did they guess it right?

1650
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,770
Excited~

1651
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
There’s a lot inside

1652
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,270
We're hungry too...

1653
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,900
Please give us some

1654
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,500
We have to give 1 to the MC

1655
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,000
He’s on our side

1656
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,000
I’ll eat it well

1657
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,300
- SD : We have to share this kind of thing
- LT : Naturally

1658
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,550
SuJu team who share and eat the food together

1659
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,320
Looks delicious

1660
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Donghae

1661
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Let’s go with Arab, low difficulty

1662
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,500
Common sense, low difficulty?

1663
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,920
Okay

1664
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,000
You have chosen Arab, common sense, low difficulty

1665
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,090
Donghae’s choice which is Arab’s common sense

1666
00:55:54,500 --> 00:56:00,000
OH! HEY! I HAVE TO HAVE THIS!

1667
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,500
I really need to have this

1668
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,570
I need that too

1669
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,570
What kind of prize will it be

1670
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
You have to manage your hair

1671
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:03,370
Arabic

1674
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,970
Hairloss shampoo set

00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,540
Rising combat power

1676
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:20,500
Lucky, Fabien, Tachara, Christian, Samy, and Zhang Yuan. How many of us is there?

1677
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,000
- EH : This is common sense?
- ZY : Yes, it’s common sense

1678
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,920
What?

1679
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Is he talking about religion?

1680
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,900
He’s talking about their names. Lucky, Fabien, Tatchara, Christian

1681
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,000
The answer is Fabien

1682
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,430
The answer is Fabien?

1683
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,500
Look at this, please read it again

1684
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,200
- SD : He mentioned Fabien too
- LT: He did?

1685
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,100
Me?

1686
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,500
He mentioned all of them

1687
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:43,000
Lucky, Fabien, Tachara, Christian, Samy, and Zhang Yuan. How many of us is there?

1688
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,200
Could it be 'Who is the oldest here?’

1689
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,100
What are they doing here now?

1690
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,700
They’re doing a quiz

1691
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,500
The answer is?

1692
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,000
Answer!

1693
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Quiz!

1694
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,790
My hair loss shampoo is on the line...

1695
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,920
Got you

1696
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,690
You can't even play the Xylophone!

1697
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, it’s frustrating!

1698
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Hyung!

1699
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,900
So frustrating

1700
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Did something come to mind?

1701
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,930
We're sorry

1702
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,900
They were nervous

1703
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,900
Let’s use a hint

1704
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,400
Could it be ‘Where is this location at?’

1705
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
What should we use?

1706
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,700
Korean?

1707
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,000
No, the one at the bottom

1708
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,730
‘Acting without words with another foreigner’ hint

1709
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,200
I think I’ll be good if we all come out

1710
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,500
Hello, I’m Lucky

1711
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Hello

1712
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Hello

1713
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,920
Giving their greetings?

1714
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,920
One by one

1715
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Hello, how are you?

1716
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,500
I am Samy

1717
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,000
Hello

1718
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,500
Korean?

1719
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,500
- LT : Hello
- YS : Is it not ‘Korea’, the place where we are currently in?

1720
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,260
But I have to get the prize...

1721
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,000
Heechul, do you want to hear it again?

1722
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Owl chance

1723
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
[T/N: Owl is the PD’s nickname]

1724
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
No, no, no you can’t

1725
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,500
Hey there

1726
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,600
Hey there?! We barely know each other and you say ‘hey there’?!

1727
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,500
How can someone that's balding know how I feel about this?!

1728
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,800
Look closely

1729
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,500
Samy, Tatchara, Zhang Yuan

1730
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,200
How many languages are being used here?

1731
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,850
Heechu's thought

1732
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,850
the guests use altogether?

1733
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,850
How many languages

1734
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,000
So 6

1735
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,700
How many languages, how many countries do they come from?

1736
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,700
Oh, ‘how many countries do they come from’ is correct

1737
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The answer is 6!

1738
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Hence the answer is?

1739
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,960
Sammy’s unknown expression...

1740
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You’re going with 6? I don’t know anything

1741
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You have to say the answer really accurately

1742
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,970
Precisely?

1743
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,300
If I get it wrong here

1744
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,500
Our Owl PD will drop out from the show

1745
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,500
You cannot joke around with a guy's hair on the line

1746
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,700
Just say whatever

1747
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,600
- YS : 6!
- SD : Say it confidently, Hyung!

1748
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,100
Answer is

1749
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,000
6!

1750
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,250
The answer is 6

1751
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Is that the answer?

1752
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,160
Correct~

1753
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,630

00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,000
I choose Hindi, common sense, high difficulty

1757
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Alright, next

1758
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,230

- YS: Is that my size?

1763
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,240
A suit?

1764
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,000

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,900
Let’s go

1767
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,000
India

1768
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:14,800
Out of the letters A, B, C, D, E and F, which is not used when giving exam result grades?

1769
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,500
Heh?

1770
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,800
Was this common sense?

1771
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,130
Hindi common sense (high difficulty)

1772
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,200
Yes, it’s common sense

1773
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,800
Should we look at the writing?

1774
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,600
It is

1775
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,200
Let’s start from the writing

1776
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,600
Time to see it written in Hindi

1777
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,500
Writing? Will it be helpful?

1778
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Worried

1779
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Let’s look at the writing

1780
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,870
If you want I’ll show it

1781
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Let’s see

1782
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,300
There’s a lot of hints left since they did well at the beginning

1783
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,080
A sigh right after seeing it

1784
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,920
What could it possibly look like!!

1785
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Is that a quadratic formula?

1786
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Wait, after E…

1787
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,760
What is that?

1788
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,260
It seems like only these letters are what we know...

1789
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,300
It was hard for me too since I haven't written it in a long time, I got confused while writing

1790
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,000
Look at this, these 2 look the same

1791
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,700
Are these 2 the same word?

1792
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,300
Which one?

1793
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,500
- SD : This and this
- LK : No

1794
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,440
Suprised

1795
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,600
Those are 2 different words?

1796
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,400
You can see the white part for this word and you can’t see it here

1797
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
That’s the important point

1798
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,000
I'll tell you one thing about Hindi

1799
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,500
The line over the top means it's one word

1800
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,700
When writing a sentence in Hindi
you put a line above each word

1801
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,700
Hindi tip 1

1802
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,330
It's one

1803
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,160
That's one, that's one, and this is the full stop

1804
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
A vertical line at the end of the
sentence is the full stop       .

1805
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Hindi tip 2

1806
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,960
It won't be something about the alphabet right?

1807
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,150
Shindong who continues to try to figure out the unfamiliar language

1808
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:27,930
- LT: Maybe it's "Out of A, B, C, D, E and F-"
- SD: Answer!

1809
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,130
Answer?

1810
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,750
So suddenly?

1811
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,750
Nervous

1812
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,700
What is that Hyung...

1813
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,730
E!

1814
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,900
Answer?

1815
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,460
E!

1816
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,100
[T/N: Donghae said his name because E sounds like Lee]

1817
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,030
Donghae

1818
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,830
E!

1819
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,330
Will that be correct?

1820
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,850
The meaning behind his smile is?

1821
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,600
Shindong is correct

1822
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:46,100
How did he know that?!

1823
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,500
How did you know??

1824
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,560
Let's go to India!

1825
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,200
Will Shindong leave for India like this?

1826
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,820
Excited

1827
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,830
How did you know?

1828
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,660
Was it, "Out of A B C D E F, which has the most strokes?"

1829
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,600
Shindong who was counting the number of strokes from earlier

1830
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,930
What was it? Let's listen

1831
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,560
It was "Out of A B C D E F, what is not used to grade exam results?"

1832
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,630
Ah, what's not used for exam results!

1833
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,700
The question was that hard?!

1834
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,450
Whatever the question was, Shindong was correct

1835
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,360
Then I should be wearing that

1836
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,900
Peekaboo

1837
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,900
Come here Shindong Hyung

1838
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,060
Let's do a fitting first

1839
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,600
If it doesn't fit, donate it

1840
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,800
If it doesn't fit
give it to meee~

1841
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,300
Is this skin?

1842
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,350
Tight

1843
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,800
It's a very slim fit

1844
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,500
Interested

1845
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,660
- SD: Is that so? I'll look slim if I wear this?
- LT: Yes, it's a slim fit suit

1846
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,360
I feel like it's gonna rip!!!

1847
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,460
Customer! This suits you so well~

1848
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,760
This?

1849
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,950
A suit fit that leaves you breathless(?)

1850
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:38,360
Anyway~

1851
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,400
How did he get it right?!

1852
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,150
Shindong's guess that is fascinating

1853
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,800
The last bonus question!

1854
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,860
In Chinese now

1855
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,750
Last question is Chinese (High difficulty)

1856
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,600
Robot Vacuum cleaner

1857
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,150
Robot Vacuum cleaner

1858
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,400
Ah, okay!

1859
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,500
I work hard at cleaning!

1860
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
I kinda need that...

1861
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,350
I really need that too...

1862
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,030
We must get this!

1863
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,600
I'll definitely win
the last question!

1864
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,570
It was extraordinary from the opening!

1865
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:10,330
All of the Super Junior members were skilled in Chinese!

1866
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,800
Though he tried many things to win

1867
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:20,000
All he did was get teased...

1868
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,650
At the member's endless undeserved love

1869
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,350
All that came out was a sigh

1870
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,170
Will he end up helplessly pushed back right until the end!

1871
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,850
What will be the end to this long battle?

1872
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:31,550
Nervous

1873
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,660
What is the prize for this question?

1874
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,000
Huh? What did he say?

1875
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,450
Did you understand?

1876
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,530
'Seohaean'?

1877
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,830
He didn't say 'Seohaean'

1878
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,600
- EH: This is definitely difficult
- ZY: Please!

1879
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,850
nervous

1880
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,850
Feeling

1881
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,800
The chinese answer
bot that's analysing

1882
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,660
You can do it

1883
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,330
- EH: We can ask you to do it slowly, right?
- LT: Slowly, slowly~

1884
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,660
What is the prize for this question?

1885
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,460
He's saying 'this'

1886
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,800
'This'

1887
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,930
Why can they all speak Chinese?!

1888
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,160
This-

1889
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,830
It's not too different with Korean

1890
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:58,400
Suju team that works it out calmly until the end

1891
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,300
"What is blank blank this blank"?

1892
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,250
Answer bot watching Zhang Yuan carefully

1893
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,130
- LT: What is 'Seohaean'?
EH: This is-

1894
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,250
eye contact

1895
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,250
Avoids

1896
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,630
Ah! Answer!

1897
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,230
Answer?!

1898
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,700
Seriously?

1899
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,800
Ah... You can't

1900
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,360
Answer?!

1901
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:07,900
Seriously?

1902
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,860
Zhang Yuan!

1903
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,200
Zhang Yuan?!

1904
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,030
Anticipates

1905
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,360
Ah! Answer!

1906
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,030
Answer?!

1907
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:13,960
Seriously?

1908
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,570
Ah... You can't

1909
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,100
Answer?!

1910
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:16,630
Seriously?

1911
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,460
Zhang Yuan!

1912
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,230
Zhang Yuan?!

1913
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,460
Anticipates

1914
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,800
Zhang Yuan?!... is incorrect!

1915
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,900
Lucky...

1916
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,900
Phew~

1917
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,800
Hyung, Donghae just wasted a chance...

1918
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,270
He probably thought 'Jjang pien' was in relation to 'Zhang Yuan'

1919
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,300
Ah, what is ‘jiang ping’?

1920
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,460
Isn't it, "This is xtvN"?

1921
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,630
Like what we said earlier?

1922
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:34,860
- SD: In my opinion-
- LT: Answer! xtvN!

1923
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,850
Wrong~

1924
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,460
It's not

1925
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,160
- DH: It's not!
- SD: I dunno

1926
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,050
Only one go left

1927
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,600
- LT: Please say it once more
- EH: Wait let's go closer and listen

1928
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,150
We'll tell you the answer first as you may be frustrated

1929
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,760
Open your ears

1930
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,800
Let's listen

1931
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,900
What is the prize for this question?

1932
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,100
For the last Chinese question

1933
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,100
What is the prize of this quiz?

1934
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,260
What is ‘jiang ping’?

1935
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,260
T/N: [‘Jiang ping’ means prize]

1936
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,030
LT: Let's do this, since we don't know-

1937
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,010
What is Jjang pien!!

1938
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,010
wronged

1939
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,010
Feeling

1940
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,160
- DH: I understand everything else but-
- YS: Since we don't know anyway-

1941
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,260
Ah! I really wanted to get the last question right!

1942
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,500
I think for this last one, there's now only one thing we can shout out

1943
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,830
Sure, it's done, let's do this

1944
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
What answer will it be?

1945
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,300
The answer is...

1946
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,960
We are Super Junior!

1947
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,500
Answer~

1948
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,900
It's 50/50

1949
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,780
Let's leave it to fate!

1950
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,100
Wrong~

1951
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,660
That is incorrect

1952
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,360
What is it?

1953
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,200
My prize!!

1954
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,550
My prizeeeee

1955
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,600
The answer was a robot vacuum cleaner ha~

1956
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,200
It's prize!

1957
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,610
Shake away the sadness during all that time

1958
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,200
‘Jiang ping’ means prize

1959
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,100
It was 'prize'

1960
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,560
Finally obtained a prize!

1961
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,300
We should have been looking for something with a similar pronunciation to it

1962
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,330
Deeply moved

1963
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,630
You finally got one

1964
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,100
If you saw this, you'd think the forienger team won...

1965
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,600
Suju team takes the final victory with an overwhelming lead

1966
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,630
So, how was today?

1967
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,660
I was really worried before we started

1968
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,030
What if they didn't figure any out?

1969
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,200
- FB: But because they got it all so well, I got goosebumps- DH: Ah~ no~

1970
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,100
You flatter us~

1971
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,900
Above everything else, they have team play, it's so amazing

1972
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,800
Really amazing

1973
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,500
Namaste~

1974
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,570
This is the dignity of 13 years

1975
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,730
Ah, thank you

1976
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,100
Please come to India, let's go India!

1977
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,850
Leggo to India~

1978
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,500
- SD: I should, I have to go to India!- EH: We should

1979
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,160
But you're not going to go yourself though are you?

1980
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,690
Flustered

1981
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,600
He's gonna be in Korea himself, he's just sending me?

1982
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,100
Let's go
together later

1983
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,600
Only I need to go?

1984
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,760
Truthfully, all these prizes... we want to give them all to you guys

1985
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,300
Is that okay?

1986
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,700
Asking the staff if it's okay

1987
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:05,060
We spoke about this in the waiting rooms earlier

1988
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,530
That we'd give them all the prizes

1989
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,950
Teary

1990
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,500
Truthfully, while looking at these prizes

1991
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:11,360
We said "We really need this!" and "It's so good"

1992
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:18,430
But the members all nicely said earlier "Hyung, we'd like to give the prizes to the others that are working hard with us"

1993
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,500
Even my
Precious shampoo

1994
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,160
Thank you

1995
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,800
Suju is the best~

1996
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,730
Congratulations!

1997
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,400
With suju's warm hearts

1998
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,400
The prizes all go to the foriegn team

1999
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,700
You worked hard!

2000
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,950
Thank you so much~

2001
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,930
Changing up all the formats in the world

2002
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,830
This is Super TV!

2003
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,350
We are Super TV

2004
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,730
