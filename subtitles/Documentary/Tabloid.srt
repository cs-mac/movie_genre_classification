2
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:25,596
"Once upon a time,
there was a little princess,

3
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:30,200
"the most beautiful
little princess in all the land.

4
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:36,738
"Her hair was long and blonde,

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,250
"and her eyes were as brown
as the dark waters of the river

6
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,253
"which ran by her castle.

7
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,380
"But the little princess
was unhappy,

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,981
"for she was lonely.

9
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:50,325
"Someday she would find
her kind, handsome prince,

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,263
"and he would sweep her up
on a big white horse,

11
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,562
"and he would take her away
and marry her,

12
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:58,331
and they would live
happily ever after."

13
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:01,874
Hi, I'm Joyce McKinney,
and that's from my pending book,

14
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:03,499
<i>A Very Special Love Story.</i>

15
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:16,013
First of all, were you
surprised to be put in prison?

16
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:18,387
I really didn't feel
I'd done anything wrong.

17
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:22,428
I still don't feel
I did anything wrong.

18
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:25,430
I would never do anything
to hurt Kirk Anderson

19
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,863
or slander him.

20
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,026
In fact, in my book...

21
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:34,096
my book is handled
in a very tender, nice fashion.

22
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:35,765
It's not a porno story

23
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,071
like these crazy newspapers
have tried to make it.

24
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,873
It's a love story, you know?

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,971
And, I mean, I would
never do anything to hurt him

26
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,607
or to cause him any harm at all.

27
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,710
And the way
that they threw me in prison

28
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,619
and tried to act like
I was some sort of criminal

29
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:54,160
and present this image over
was really what got to me.

30
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,627
My life started out in
a small town in North Carolina.

31
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,728
I was one of these girls
who was gonna meet, you know,

32
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,467
an all-American guy
and get married

33
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,065
<i>and have a little
Leave It to Beaver house</i>

34
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,337
with a white picket fence

35
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,436
and just have
a great little life.

36
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:16,772
Started dating
very late in life.

37
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,874
Didn't start dating
till I was, like, 17.

38
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,977
Was in an accelerated program
for kids with high IQ’s.

39
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>How high was your IQ?</i>

40
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,657
168.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,757
I hadn't been
out in the world much

42
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:30,523
till I went to Utah.

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,531
You know,
I hadn't been around much.

44
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,527
<i>But there were a lot of men
attracted to you?</i>

45
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:37,898
Well, I guess so.
I don't know.

46
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,733
I'm not that vain
that I would say...

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,468
but I wasn't looking
for just any guy.

48
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,942
I wanted a special guy.

49
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:47,639
I wanted
a special guy.

50
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,112
And he had to have
certain qualities.

51
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,513
There are plenty
of guys out there,

52
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,084
but I wanted a special guy.

53
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,220
I met this professor,
and he said,

54
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,153
"Well, I've got these
perfect guys for you,

55
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,952
"and they're just your type,
Joyce.

56
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,549
"They don't smoke,
and they don't drink,

57
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,718
"and they're clean-cut,

58
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,227
"and you're just going
to love them.

59
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,992
And why don't you come over
to my house and meet them?"

60
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,668
They were Mormons.

61
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,169
They didn't tell me
what Mormonism was all about.

62
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:14,240
He didn't say,
"We're a group that believes

63
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,036
"that Jesus was a polygamist

64
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,702
and was married
to Mary Magdalene."

65
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,370
He didn't say,
"We believe that God lives

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,505
on a star named Kolob."

67
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,050
He didn't say,
"We believe that black people

68
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:29,747
were cursed with
the mark of Cain."

69
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,086
They made me think
they were a church.

70
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:35,684
They made me think
that they were family-oriented.

71
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,597
And so I was drawn to them,
as a young 19-year-old teenager,

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,292
like a moth to a flame.

73
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,836
I was just so happy
to go to this place

74
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,338
where I thought
that I would have my pick

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,874
of just all-American friends,

76
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,570
people, husband material,
I guess.

77
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,047
I had a Corvette, and I had
a big old English sheepdog

78
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,243
that loved to ride
in the Corvette.

79
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:04,312
And I had a good friend.
Her name was Marilyn Clark.

80
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,051
There wasn't anything
Marilyn didn't do:

81
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,128
Smoke, drink,
have sex with Hells Angels.

82
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,289
I mean, this was a wild child.
We were exact opposites.

83
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,230
She used to call me
"Holier-Than-Thou McKinney"

84
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,461
because I was so straight.

85
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,060
We would cruise
the pizza parlor,

86
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,605
and we decided to cruise down
by Frosty's ice cream parlor.

87
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,402
And I noticed
this really handsome guy

88
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:26,673
driving alongside me also
in a Corvette, white Corvette.

89
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,112
And he kind of looks around
at me like he's watching me.

90
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,649
And I thought,
"Whoa, he's cute."

91
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,651
And I kept on driving,

92
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,050
and Marilyn goes,

93
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,089
"Hey, McKinn,
he's following you."

94
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,748
And I go, "He is?"

95
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,225
So I let him chase me.
He was quite aggressive.

96
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:46,829
And he pulled in beside me
and cleared his throat.

97
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,730
Then he goes, "Like your car."

98
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,894
I go, "Thanks.
I like yours too."

99
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,972
He goes,
"I really like yours better."

100
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,335
I go, "Want to drive it?"

101
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:08,049
When I met my Kirk,

102
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,519
it was like in the movies...

103
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,226
When the girl comes down
the stairs, and their eyes meet.

104
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,297
When Juliet looks at Romeo,
and it's... pkew!

105
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,490
That's how it was.

106
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,235
He had the most beautiful
blue eyes

107
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,361
and the sexiest smile,

108
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,669
and he always had
the cleanest skin.

109
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:44,414
Kirk Anderson
was a very big, rather flabby,

110
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:50,622
300-pound, 6'3", not athletic
or attractive-looking man

111
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,561
in the accepted sense
of the word

112
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,657
who had a very shuffle-y
kind of walk,

113
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:57,202
the last person in the world
that you'd think would be

114
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:03,606
the object of this kind of
strange sexual passion.

115
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,645
He had known Joyce McKinney
in Salt Lake City,

116
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,737
and she had fallen in love
with him.

117
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:12,011
Fallen in love with him...
become obsessed by him,

118
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,313
because that's another thing
about Joyce is obsession.

119
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,514
I mean, she just obsesses
about things.

120
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:17,851
I don't know what
the details

121
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:21,324
of their relationship was
in Salt Lake City,

122
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:25,865
but they obviously had some kind
of romance or love affair,

123
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,934
because if one's to believe
Joyce at all,

124
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:32,766
he had promised her
a family and children.

125
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,499
He actually told me
he loved me

126
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:35,904
the first night I met him

127
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,773
and asked me to marry him
the second night,

128
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:41,244
and then the next thing I know,
we're naming our kids.

129
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:44,475
And we were gonna name 'em all
with Js and Ks:

130
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,518
J for "Joyce"
and Ks for "Kirk,"

131
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,712
Joshua, Jacob.

132
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,289
You know, we had the names
picked out.

133
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,880
Kyle, Kirk.

134
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,061
And I remember, he took me home
to meet his Mormon mother,

135
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:00,030
and she was this big,
oh, huge woman,

136
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,658
about 350 pounds
in a tent dress,

137
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:03,861
and she took one look at me

138
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,870
with my little
beauty queen figure,

139
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,701
and her eyes went up,
and her eyes went down,

140
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,866
and she goes, "She doesn't look
like a Mormon to me."

141
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,413
From the time
I was a little girl,

142
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,680
I was in pageants.

143
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:26,116
It gave me a chance
to develop myself

144
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,923
to be the best person
I could be

145
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:34,966
with my looks, with my talent,
with my personality.

146
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,697
The pageants gave me,
as a small-town girl,

147
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:42,968
the chance to perform.

148
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:52,079
<i>So Mom thought
you were too sexy for him?</i>

149
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:56,417
I guess she thought
I was too pretty or something.

150
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:59,287
Kirk and I were just ready
for the big wedding,

151
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,518
and everything was happy.

152
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,855
The only problem is,

153
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,986
I was wanting to get married
in the Christian church,

154
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,429
and he was getting pressure
from the other side,

155
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,865
and so one day,
he vanished into thin air.

156
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,027
I don't mean he left me.
I don't mean he abandoned me.

157
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,832
I don't mean he left me
for another woman.

158
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:15,271
I mean he evaporated
into thin air.

159
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,536
He wasn't the kind of person
to just run off like that.

160
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,202
His things were still
at my place,

161
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,906
and, you know,
it was just weird.

162
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,743
I did what any American girl
would do

163
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,546
if her fiancé vanished
into thin air:

164
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:27,551
I looked for him.

165
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,246
I went to L.A.,

166
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,846
and I worked three jobs
trying to save up enough money

167
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,186
to pay a private investigator

168
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,692
to find out
what happened to him.

169
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,354
The private investigator
found him in England.

170
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:38,521
The Mormons had him.

171
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:42,158
All young men in the Church,

172
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,031
from the time
that we're young boys,

173
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:47,664
we're indoctrinated
to prepare to go on mission.

174
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:51,471
<i>We sing songs like I Hope
They Call Me On A Mission.</i>

175
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:56,880
# I hope they call me
on a mission #

176
00:08:56,983 --> 00:09:01,352
You leave as a boy.
You come back as a man.

177
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,014
For Kirk, when he reaches
the age of 19,

178
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,717
he doesn't get whisked away
from Joyce.

179
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,088
He's just fulfilling

180
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:11,163
his religious spiritual
responsibilities.

181
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:19,804
Joyce knew where he'd gone
and set up this plan

182
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:23,137
with her strange,
unexplained friend Keith May

183
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:26,804
to come over to the U.K.

184
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,177
I had a really good friend
from Torrance, California.

185
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:30,442
He was an architect,

186
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,518
and his name
was Keith Joseph May.

187
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,917
Everybody called him "K.J."

188
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,784
K.J. Was like my big brother,
and he said to me,

189
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,154
"I don't want you going over
there to England by yourself."

190
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,124
Said, "You don't know what
they're gonna do to ya."

191
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,821
All I knew
is this powerful group

192
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,627
had done something
to the man I loved.

193
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,326
We got two bodyguards
to go with us.

194
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,369
One was a big guy that was...

195
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,962
what do you call...
a body-builder guy.

196
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,472
And the other was a pilot.

197
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,376
I was interested in something

198
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:03,108
a little bit more exciting
than what I was doing.

199
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,774
I saw an ad in the newspaper.

200
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:08,081
They wanted a pilot to fly
short trips in England,

201
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,655
and it sounded kind
of interesting to me.

202
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,248
So I called the phone number,
and a gentleman answered,

203
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,850
and an appointment was made
for the following week.

204
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,486
I was expecting to go
to an office

205
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,859
or something like that,

206
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,990
but it turned out to be
an apartment building.

207
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:28,236
I was taken in by a gentleman
by the name of Keith.

208
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,434
And after I was there
for a few minutes,

209
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:31,737
why, Joyce came out.

210
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,778
<i>Tell me about
that first meeting.</i>

211
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,872
Well, I was
favorably impressed.

212
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,417
She had a totally
see-through blouse on.

213
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,781
I can even remember the color.

214
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,913
It was a light brown,
totally see-through blouse.

215
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,081
<i>No bra?</i>

216
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,318
- No bra,
see-through blouse.

217
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:56,090
She was very, very easy
to talk to.

218
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,898
At one point, she came over
and sat down next to me.

219
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,236
I was trying to perceive
what type of relationship

220
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,334
existed between Keith and her
at that point.

221
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,242
Perhaps maybe down the line,

222
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,781
I might want to ask this girl
out for dinner or something.

223
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,484
Joyce had a trunk
that she brought out,

224
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:17,488
and in it were folders,
pictures, tablets,

225
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,923
letters from a private
investigator in England.

226
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:25,225
She then unraveled a story to me
that was just unreal.

227
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:32,862
Joyce had hired bodyguards,
she told me, from Gold's Gym.

228
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,030
She was gonna put 'em up

229
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,473
while they were there
in England,

230
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:42,310
and they were going to liberate
her fiancé from this cult group.

231
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:43,848
In the back of my mind,

232
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,214
I was trying to figure out how
she could have all this money

233
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,809
to take all these people
to England.

234
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:53,288
She told me she was a model.

235
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:56,123
I didn't realize models
made that kind of money.

236
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:02,095
We actually hired some guys
to go with us from Los Angeles

237
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,135
in case we were attacked
or anything.

238
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,670
I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

239
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,865
I didn't know what
I was gonna be walking into.

240
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:11,637
I didn't know if they would
release him willingly or what.

241
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,712
I didn't know if they would
do something to hurt me.

242
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,007
I didn't know.

243
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,674
Joyce called me
and wanted to know

244
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,982
if I would fly her someplace in
an airplane locally for dinner.

245
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,521
That sounded pretty good.

246
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,091
I thought it might possibly be
an overnight trip or something,

247
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,183
and I was more than up for that.

248
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:31,457
But when Joyce showed up,
much to my surprise,

249
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,464
Keith was with her.

250
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:36,694
I felt this was a time
that I could try to make

251
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,998
a determination
on how real she was

252
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,868
and her financial ability.

253
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:45,171
So I did rent the most expensive
airplane that was possible,

254
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,714
single-engine,
a Beechcraft A36 Bonanza.

255
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:53,543
When you rent an airplane
like that,

256
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,245
you have to give 'em
a credit card,

257
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,720
and they lock in the approximate
amount it was gonna be.

258
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,223
Joyce didn't have a credit card.

259
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:00,986
But she did bring out
an envelope

260
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,789
filled with
hundred-dollar bills.

261
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,396
That brought me
a little bit closer to realizing

262
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:14,337
maybe she has the money to do
what she wants to do.

263
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,930
So we flew down to San Diego.

264
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,600
We had dinner,
and we flew back.

265
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,870
<i>Didn't stay the night.</i>

266
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,411
No.
No.

267
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,141
Keith was with her, and so...

268
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,149
that was three people there.

269
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,378
That's not for me.

270
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,659
<i>I take it that you
were attracted to Joyce.</i>

271
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,693
Yes.

272
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,855
She was in her late 20s,
had an outstanding figure,

273
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:42,901
had a Southern accent,
long blonde hair.

274
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:47,473
Any heterosexual male
would be attracted to Joyce.

275
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,939
Prior to our departure from
the United States to England,

276
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,980
they wanted me
to meet the bodyguard.

277
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,175
His name was Gil.

278
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,581
Gil would come to their place.

279
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:00,947
I would come to their place,

280
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,920
then we would go down
to the beach.

281
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:07,151
Then they told me the beach they
we’re going to was a nude beach.

282
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,592
Well, I've never been
to a nude beach,

283
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,755
so that really slowed me down
a little bit.

284
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,696
Joyce spread out a blanket

285
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,792
and proceeded to take off
all her clothes.

286
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,269
Totally.

287
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:23,699
Very quickly,
three to four guys showed up

288
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,834
around the blanket
and started taking pictures.

289
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,845
I don't know
where they came from.

290
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,972
Joyce protested,
tried to stop them.

291
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,515
She claimed
that she was a model,

292
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,676
and she didn't want photographs
taken of her.

293
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,378
After about 15 minutes,

294
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,150
Joyce put on her clothes,
and we left the beach.

295
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:42,353
And so we met at Los Angeles
International Airport.

296
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,952
Keith May was there,
Joyce McKinney,

297
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,759
Gil Parker, and myself.

298
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,602
First off, Gil Parker
had a problem

299
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,073
when he went through customs.

300
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,041
They asked him
what his occupation was,

301
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,703
and he told 'em
he was a bodyguard.

302
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,110
And they said, "For who?"

303
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:04,342
And they said,
"For Joyce and Keith."

304
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,680
Well, that put up a red flag,
evidently, in customs,

305
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:07,946
and they pulled him out.

306
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,079
Well, that scared Gil
right there.

307
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,683
Then, on the second day, we were
in a motel room together,

308
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:17,661
and Joyce had a lot of baggage.

309
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,129
I'd never seen anybody travel
with so many bags.

310
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,201
And they took out
wireless microphone

311
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,495
and listening devices.

312
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:24,900
Surprised me.

313
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,767
I wasn't sure what they
we’re going to use it for.

314
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,237
It was something you
could probably

315
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:29,706
just have carried
through customs,

316
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,642
but they had it inside
of a portable radio.

317
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,441
Well, when Gil seen this,
that about did it for him.

318
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,038
That was when
he called me outside

319
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,912
and said he wanted to go back
the next day.

320
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,817
The private investigator
had told Joyce

321
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,357
two or three different places
where Kirk was at,

322
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,984
and Keith was gonna go
into some of these places

323
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,586
where this cult group
was supposed to be,

324
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:52,925
ask questions,

325
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,126
and it would be transmitted out
to Joyce in the car...

326
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,532
wirelessly.

327
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,009
Keith May and I, we wanted to
go out a little bit on our own,

328
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:10,913
but Joyce was keeping us
so busy, we couldn't,

329
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:11,984
so one day, she...

330
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,176
<i>Keeping you so busy?</i>

331
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,583
Yeah, driving places,

332
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,178
checking out places,
walking places.

333
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,952
She had this wig,
this wig she called "Matilda."

334
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,651
And she'd wear this strange wig

335
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,457
when we'd go out driving
sometime and sunglasses.

336
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,622
And any time we'd go down near
one of these churches

337
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,359
where they were trying
to find out

338
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,697
if Kirk was gonna be
at that church

339
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,464
or if that was one
he frequented,

340
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,698
she'd have that wig on.

341
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:38,607
We were across,
in front of a building.

342
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:42,306
Outcome two young men
dressed in suits,

343
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,406
a tie, and a white shirt.

344
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,678
And she told me,
"There is Kirk."

345
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,447
Well, I was totally surprised.

346
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,613
This was nobody
being held captive.

347
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,816
And that's when Joyce
kind of leveled with me.

348
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:56,258
She showed me a bottle
of chloroform,

349
00:16:56,362 --> 00:17:00,765
and I'd already seen
this phony gun they had.

350
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,232
I was going to be no part
of any of this,

351
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,963
and I told her that.

352
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:13,538
So she arrives
with Keith May, lurks around,

353
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,639
waits around outside
the temple of whatever it was,

354
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,877
Latter-Day Saints
of something or other,

355
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,818
waited for this huge,
shuffling figure to come out

356
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,322
with his short Mormon haircut

357
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:29,861
and pointed a gun at him
and said, "Get into the car."

358
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,486
In the final analysis,

359
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,691
the one way they were able
to make contact with Kirk...

360
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,165
Keith called him and told him

361
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,498
he wanted to convert
to the Mormon religion,

362
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,936
and they thought they had
a new convert.

363
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,769
Now, I'm not sure
this is the exact scenario,

364
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,775
but at that point,
Keith used the gun

365
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,071
to get him out to the car.

366
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,715
<i>So you drive up
in your rental car with K. J.</i>

367
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,047
I waited, and K.J. Went in,

368
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,519
because they're not supposed to
be in the room alone with girls.

369
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,682
So K.J. Went in and said,
"Joyce is in the car."

370
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,089
And Kirk turned around,

371
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,058
and he threw the keys
to his companion and said,

372
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,959
"I've got to go out
in the car and get something.

373
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,760
I'll be right back."

374
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,062
<i>So he goes out with K.J.?</i>

375
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,069
Yeah, and didn't come back,

376
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:14,662
and his poor old dumb companion
is sitting there

377
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:17,299
staring like
he's catching flies,

378
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,537
looking out the window,
waiting for him to come back.

379
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,779
He got in the car, and he goes,

380
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,317
"How long have you been
in England?"

381
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,681
Like a robot.

382
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,448
He was almost speaking
in a monotone voice,

383
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,388
and he'd go, "They said
you didn't love me anymore."

384
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,959
It was like he had
a personality alteration,

385
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,791
Kirk Number 1
and Kirk Number 2.

386
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:42,356
Kirk Number 1 was the man
I fell in love with.

387
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,902
Kirk Number 2 was Cult Kirk.

388
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:53,106
According to all the reports
at the time,

389
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:58,775
he was driven 250 miles
to a cottage in Devon.

390
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,684
She had a suitcase full
of all the equipment required,

391
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:03,948
including, I gather,

392
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:08,152
some Los Angeles
Police Department

393
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,162
Smith & Wesson handcuffs.

394
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:17,031
And he was taken in
and chained to...

395
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,434
Joyce claims it was ropes,
not chains,

396
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,971
but chains sounds better.

397
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:24,099
Anyway, he was allegedly
chained to a bed,

398
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,734
first by his ankle

399
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,938
so that he could actually
reach the toilet.

400
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,709
The chain was long enough
for him to get to the toilet.

401
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,647
Subsequently, with the help
of Keith May,

402
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,911
was spread-eagled...

403
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,008
spread-eagled...

404
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,748
which is this wonderful
bondage word...

405
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,189
was spread-eagled to the bed,

406
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:45,195
and Keith May discreetly left
the room at this point, I think,

407
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,197
closed the door behind him,

408
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,767
and Joyce had sex with him.

409
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,031
And she said to him

410
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,164
she was going to go on
having sex with him

411
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:59,244
until she found
she had missed a period

412
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:02,712
and would then hopefully
be pregnant by him.

413
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,215
<i>She wanted to be inseminated?</i>

414
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:07,615
Yes, I think that's
the polite word for it.

415
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,188
Kirk and I went to
this cottage down in England.

416
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,091
Well, I think they called it
the Devon area down there.

417
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:19,221
Real Franco Zeffirelli.

418
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,765
<i>You know, like Brother Sun,
Sister Moon type shots.</i>

419
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,392
If you saw that film,
that's what it looked like.

420
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,404
Clare!

421
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,974
You shouldn't have come,
but I knew you would.

422
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:31,167
I knew.

423
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:32,471
I have to tell you,

424
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:34,671
and I don't care
if the whole world knows it.

425
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,477
From now on, I'm not asking
to be loved.

426
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,211
I want to love!

427
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,762
Okay, if you can get
that vision

428
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,457
set in your head,
Mr. Filmmaker.

429
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,295
<i>How'd you find this place?</i>

430
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:58,029
Well, I was looking
for someplace peaceful

431
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:59,627
where he could normalize,

432
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:06,007
someplace where he could
come back to Kirk Number 1.

433
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:11,014
I had a big fireplace,
patchwork quilt, silk sheets...

434
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,516
blue to match his eyes,
with his initials on it...

435
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,749
cinnamon oil back rub,
'cause he loved my back rubs,

436
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:20,848
and all his favorite foods
in the fridge.

437
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,391
<i>What were his favorite foods
in the fridge?</i>

438
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:30,195
- Oh, I had chocolate cake
and Southern-fried chicken.

439
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:31,462
He loved my chicken.

440
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,832
Mashed potatoes.

441
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,002
I made everything
that he wanted.

442
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,601
I was like his little,
you know, wifey almost.

443
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,309
We were slow-dancing.

444
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,975
He got turned on
as we were dancing.

445
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,246
I'll be blunt.
He had an erection, okay?

446
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:51,346
And we sat down on the bed,
and he said,

447
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:52,754
"Can you give me a back rub?"

448
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,156
And I got the cinnamon oil,
which I had warmed,

449
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,352
and I was giving him a back rub.

450
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,293
And he had these
ugly garments on, and I said,

451
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,989
"How am I supposed
to give you a back rub

452
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,067
with this Mormon thing on?"

453
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,532
And I ripped
the ugly things off,

454
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:04,933
because they smelled, you know,

455
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,561
and they had those
occultic symbols,

456
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:09,436
and I didn't want
anything ugly there

457
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,872
in our beautiful moment.

458
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,501
You know, it was like
a honeymoon cottage.

459
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:16,240
And we burned 'em.
We actually burned 'em.

460
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,407
<i>You ripped off
his magic underwear</i>

461
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:19,711
<i>and burned it?</i>

462
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,046
And I threw 'em
in the fireplace

463
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,620
where they belonged!

464
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,121
Where they should put 'em all,
as far as I'm concerned.

465
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,385
There's folk stories galore,

466
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:32,692
legends of the temple garment
protecting people from harm.

467
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,528
The hooks, the psychic hooks
of the temple

468
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:41,663
are so... pried in so deep
that even people

469
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:45,972
who don't go to church anymore
still wear them,

470
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,636
because in the back
of their mind, like...

471
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:50,374
"What if I don't wear them,
and then Satan's got me?"

472
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:54,741
Kirk was impotent.

473
00:22:54,853 --> 00:23:00,314
He was sexually impotent
because of this brainwashing.

474
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,488
He's not supposed
to have sexual feelings.

475
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:05,586
He's not supposed
to have emotional feelings.

476
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:09,794
He's not supposed
to fall in love.

477
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,870
And we were in love.

478
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,633
He loved me, and I loved him.

479
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,868
I knew there was only one way
to get Kirk out of Mormonism,

480
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,672
and that was to make love
with him,

481
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:21,973
because for a Mormon missionary

482
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,844
to have a love affair
is totally taboo.

483
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,974
They can't be in a room
alone with a girl

484
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:29,350
without their companion
with them to even shake hands.

485
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,821
So if it took giving up
my virginity

486
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:34,392
in a romantic moonlit cottage,
so be it.

487
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,428
I just wanted him
out of that cult.

488
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,827
We started to make love,
and all of a sudden,

489
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,923
he jumps up on the bed
like this, and he goes,

490
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:43,729
"By the law of the holy prophet
Joseph Smith,

491
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,770
"I cannot not touch my bodies
or the bodies of others

492
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,236
"in an unnatural,
experimental way!

493
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,533
By the law
of the holy prophet..."

494
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,971
Hold a Book of Mormon
firmly in hand.

495
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,009
Sing a Mormon song.
Sing a Mormon song.

496
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,807
Because he's turned on,
and he's not supposed to be.

497
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:56,278
And I go, "Ha."

498
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,645
I'd come across
an ocean to find him,

499
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,651
and the Mormons
are in our bedroom?

500
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:05,247
That moment, when his garments
are coming off,

501
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:07,416
that could have been
a moment that triggered him,

502
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:08,458
like, "Oh, my gosh."

503
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,289
"Oh, my heck,"
as they say in Utah.

504
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,364
"I'm doing something wrong."

505
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:15,893
I went back in the kitchen,

506
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,662
and I got myself
a real cold glass of water.

507
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,032
<i>Does he still have
the erection</i>

508
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:20,196
<i>while he's chanting?</i>

509
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, I came back...
to be continued...

510
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,597
I came back in there,
and I'm thinking,

511
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,869
"Am I doing something wrong?"

512
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:28,310
He started to cry.
He had ejaculated, I guess.

513
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:31,382
He said, "Please don't tell 'em
about the filthy place,

514
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:32,950
what happened
at the filthy place."

515
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,916
And I said,
"Honey, what's wrong?"

516
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,181
He goes, "They'll know."

517
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,849
I mean, every guy on the planet
masturbates and has wet dreams.

518
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,222
And I ask him, I said, "Honey,
don't you have those dreams

519
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,988
guys have
or whatever they're called?"

520
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:47,588
He goes, "Yeah, but I didn't
tell 'em in the interview."

521
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,757
I go, "What interview?

522
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,459
They talk to you
about this stuff?"

523
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,366
He goes, "Yeah, once a week.

524
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:54,063
"They take us in rooms
by ourselves,

525
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,267
and they say, 'M1, M2, M3?
M1, M2, M3?"'

526
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,400
I go, "What's that?"

527
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,102
"Masturbation once,
masturbation twice,

528
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,201
"masturbation three times.

529
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,280
"So many times, you're out.

530
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,348
"You're Xed.
You're home.

531
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:04,506
"You're off your mission.

532
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:05,981
You can't get married
in the temple."

533
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,848
I go, "Kirk, these people
are controlling your sex drive.

534
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,445
"They're controlling your mind.
They're controlling your food.

535
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:13,787
You can't have coffee,
tea, or Pepsi-Cola."

536
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,552
There was
a Christian marriage manual,

537
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:21,759
which I bought, which
explained sex to young virgins.

538
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,529
There was a section in there
on sexual impotence.

539
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:25,830
Im-po-tence.

540
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,065
L- M-P-O-T-E-N-C-E.

541
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:32,735
And it said sometimes if a guy
was very repressed sexually,

542
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,676
which poor Kirk was,
Lord knows,

543
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,374
that you could
tie the person up,

544
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:40,474
and they could say,
"Ah, I'll let go."

545
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,747
You know, "I can finally let go
and make love."

546
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,517
And so I went, and I read
that section really quick,

547
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:46,921
speed-read it.

548
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,458
And I come back and I said,

549
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,551
"Honey, we're going to try
some of these exercises."

550
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,720
And so we did.

551
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,967
We made love, actually,
for three days.

552
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,596
We sort of, like,
didn't get out of bed.

553
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,231
It was the honeymoon,
was what it was for me.

554
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:07,977
I wanted us
to have a good sex life.

555
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,513
I wanted to be a good wife
to Kirk,

556
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:12,448
and I wanted to give him
lots of babies in my tummy.

557
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,576
I didn't look at sex
as a bad thing with him.

558
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:17,211
I looked at it as
a melting of two souls,

559
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,086
because when he kissed me,

560
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,956
it was like we melted
into one person.

561
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:29,762
It was like I didn't know
where I stopped and he began.

562
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,301
We were lying there,
holding hands,

563
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:34,372
and his little missionary
glasses were kind of askew.

564
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:36,703
And he goes, "Guess
we're married in God's eyes."

565
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,275
I go, "Yup, we are."

566
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:40,208
He says, "Guess we better
make it official."

567
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,712
He said, "Let's go into London,
and let's get married."

568
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,777
We took the rental car,
and we went into town,

569
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:51,185
to London,
and we saw Trafalgar Square.

570
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,155
They had, like, pigeons.
We fed the pigeons.

571
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:54,520
And so I said, "Oh, Kirk.

572
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,423
"We've got this cool cafe
we want to take you to.

573
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,962
It's called the Hard Rock Cafe."

574
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:00,964
And there were cops
running around everywhere.

575
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,761
What do they call 'em,
bobbies or whatever?

576
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,130
British cops.

577
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:07,069
If Kirk felt kidnapped
at any time, he could have said,

578
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:10,107
"Hey, this little pint-sized
girl here has me kidnapped.

579
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,732
Can you please help me,
'occifer'?"

580
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,811
But he didn't.

581
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:15,903
Kirk says, "Well, I'm gonna go
over across the street

582
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:17,174
and get a newspaper."

583
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:22,276
So he went over, by himself,
got a newspaper,

584
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,911
came back to the table,

585
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:26,456
slammed that newspaper down
on the table.

586
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:28,219
He's white as a ghost.

587
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:30,989
And we said, "What's wrong?"

588
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,325
It was so shocking.

589
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,961
It sounded like Scotland Yard
was after us or something.

590
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,563
And I'm sitting there
with my "kidnap victim"

591
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,733
eating a burger
with a hundred people

592
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:46,242
in a crowded tourist restaurant.

593
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:47,778
Kirk says,
"Well, maybe if I call 'em

594
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,006
and let them know
I'm alive and okay."

595
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:51,878
He says, "Oh, they're
gonna ask me about sex.

596
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,179
"Oh, they're gonna ask me
about sex.

597
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,949
What am I gonna say?
They're gonna ask me about sex."

598
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,523
I says,
"Can't you just tell them?"

599
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,525
"Oh, no, I can't!
Can't tell 'em we had sex!

600
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:05,460
Oh, they'll excommunicate me.
Oh, my mother will be so mad."

601
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:08,226
We called his mother.
We called my dad.

602
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,426
We called from the phone booth
at Trafalgar Square.

603
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,436
Kirk said to my dad,
"Mr. McKinney,

604
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,372
I love your daughter,
and I'm gonna marry her."

605
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,377
And my dad said,
"Welcome to the family, son."

606
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:22,907
When we called his mother,

607
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,846
I could hear her screeching
across the Atlantic.

608
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,679
"Oh, you've ruined
your eternal progression!

609
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,013
"Don't you know
what you've done?

610
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,485
"How could you get involved
with that girl?

611
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:30,953
You've not had sex with her,
have you?"

612
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,155
The mission president was,
"Yadda, yadda, yadda.

613
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,851
Oh, you've been kidnapped,"
and da, da, da.

614
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,656
And Kirk could hardly
get a word in edgewise.

615
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:39,993
He'd say, "But I'm really okay,
President Eyre."

616
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:41,997
"When the news media...

617
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:44,967
Kirk hung up, and he goes,

618
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,470
"You know, they've got
Scotland Yard and the FBI.

619
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:49,563
"How about if I just go back in,
and you guys stay here,

620
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,938
"so they can't do nothing like
arrest you guys or anything,

621
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,569
and I go back in
and show 'em I'm okay."

622
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,410
And I'll never forget that day.
It was a real Kodak moment.

623
00:28:58,517 --> 00:28:59,882
Victoria Station in those days

624
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:01,475
had a beautiful
old-fashioned train

625
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:02,917
that pulled out
with one of those...

626
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,988
And the last thing I remember
of Kirk Number 1 is,

627
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,188
he got on the train,

628
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:15,164
and he mouthed the words,
"I love you."

629
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,667
And I go,
"I love you too, baby."

630
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:23,105
If Kirk went away
with Joyce willingly...

631
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,405
and had sex with her...

632
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:32,507
the guilt that would come over
him so strongly after the fact

633
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,881
could be overwhelming.

634
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,512
K.J. And I turned
and walked away,

635
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:39,817
and he goes, "Don't worry.

636
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,790
"He'll be okay.
He loves you.

637
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,793
You got the man you love.
What you worried about?"

638
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:46,363
I says, "I don't know, K.J.
Some nagging feeling.

639
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,796
I'm worried."

640
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,596
So we went back to the cottage,
and we packed everything up.

641
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,261
I remember
I had my wedding dress,

642
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:57,535
a pretty white dress
I was gonna use for our wedding.

643
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,007
Put flowers in my hair.

644
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:04,310
Also, our wedding bands
with our names engraved inside.

645
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,077
It said, "Joyce and Kirk.

646
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:11,349
He lift thee, and thee lift me,
and we will ascend together."

647
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,491
Even after we grew old
and died,

648
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:19,052
we would rise into the heavens
together as man and wife.

649
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,706
This bizarre story
began here last Wednesday.

650
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,904
Kirk Anderson,
a young Mormon missionary

651
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,846
was talking outside to a man
with a Canadian accent.

652
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,507
He then disappeared.

653
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,108
But early today,
he phoned police

654
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,379
and told them he was kidnapped.

655
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:44,182
A blanket had been placed
over his head.

656
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,779
He'd been driven to a house

657
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:48,951
where he'd been blindfolded
and his legs shackled.

658
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,355
When I got back
to my apartment in Long Beach,

659
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:55,865
the landlady called me in

660
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:58,458
and said the Long Beach Homicide
Department had been there,

661
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,471
and they wanted me to come down
to the police station.

662
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,007
And that really freaked me out.

663
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,872
Why the Homicide Department,
I don't know.

664
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,203
I told them everything.

665
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,543
Then we went down,
had a cup of coffee.

666
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,913
Then they asked me to come back
and tell 'em again,

667
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,349
the same story.

668
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,579
They had tape recorded
the first time I said it,

669
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:17,916
and they wanted to make sure

670
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,752
that when I told it
a second time,

671
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,349
it was exactly the same story,
which it was.

672
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,223
I told 'em the truth.

673
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,661
They got kind of a big kick
out of it,

674
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,756
considering
they hadn't found him yet,

675
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:29,925
about the whole story.

676
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,366
<i>The Manacled Mormon.</i>

677
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,437
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what it boiled down to.

678
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,801
I was a Mormon missionary
in Exeter, okay?

679
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,001
This is in Devon.

680
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,308
And I was at
a church member's house,

681
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:44,746
and they were a younger couple.

682
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:48,615
And they sort of sat down
and told us the whole story

683
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
of Joyce McKinney
and the Manacled Mormon.

684
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:54,818
It reminds me
of those cultures

685
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:57,793
<i>that have stories
of the vagina dentata,</i>

686
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:01,127
the women
with the toothed vagina.

687
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:04,794
They become cautionary tales
about sexual impropriety,

688
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:09,636
the dangerous powers of women,

689
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:13,973
women that can seduce
a young missionary

690
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,206
who are on God's errand.

691
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:18,341
Young men, once they receive

692
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,179
what's called
the Melchizedek priesthood,

693
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:22,515
they are endowed with power
from on high.

694
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:25,317
They go through... we go through...
I went through

695
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:29,325
an elaborate "endowment"
through the Mormon Temples

696
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:32,555
where we received
sacred underwear

697
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:36,361
and sacred knowledge
of keys to heaven.

698
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:38,595
You reenact
the Garden of Eden scenario,

699
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,035
and there's an actor
that performs Lucifer.

700
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:44,131
And he says in a menacing tone,

701
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,437
"Those of you
who don't live up

702
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:48,444
"to the covenants that you make

703
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:51,174
"on the altar of the temple
this day

704
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:53,751
will be in my power."

705
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:59,713
And one of the covenants that
you make is the law of chastity,

706
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:01,758
that you will only have
sexual relationships

707
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,298
with he or she to whom you are
legally and lawfully wedded.

708
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,806
<i>"Manacled Mormon Sex Slave"
wrecks that, doesn't it?</i>

709
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,172
Completely wrecks that.

710
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:25,614
If Kirk Anderson was
a willing Manacled Mormon,

711
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:31,155
he will have violated
his temple covenants,

712
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:34,919
violated the law of chastity.

713
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,859
What he risks is excommunication
from the church,

714
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,692
and greater than that,

715
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,998
unless he repents,
he won't be able to, ultimately,

716
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:50,063
become a god
and have his own planet.

717
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:52,976
That is Mormon theology.

718
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:54,773
That's what
they're working towards.

719
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:03,549
I got this weird phone call.
I had an answering service.

720
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:05,316
It said,
"It's been really crazy here,

721
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,823
"but I finally got 'em
off my back.

722
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,587
"I still love you.

723
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:11,059
"Call me.
Urgent.

724
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:14,063
Epsom 25724.
Urgent."

725
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:20,397
So I called the number,
and some Mormon answered.

726
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:22,405
"Who is this?
What do ya want?"

727
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,407
Very suspicious voice.

728
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,841
And I said,
"I want to talk to Kirk...

729
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,435
I mean Elder Anderson."

730
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:32,949
So I said, "This is
Sister... Helmsley calling

731
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,748
regarding the baptism
for my daughter Millie."

732
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:41,690
Millie was my sheepdog,
and I knew Kirk would know that.

733
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,556
And I said, "Honey,
where do you want to meet?"

734
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:44,958
He says, "About 2:00."

735
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:47,088
I said, "Don't say where it is
over the phone."

736
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:48,222
He goes, "Okay."

737
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,857
I was worried about
an extension phone.

738
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,368
It went further than that.
It was a phone tap.

739
00:34:56,775 --> 00:35:00,211
On my way to meet him,
I remember me and K.J.

740
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:01,778
Were going along the motorway,

741
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,247
and I'm singing, "I'm getting
married in the morning!"

742
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,147
And I'm so happy.
I'm so...

743
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,413
I was just like a young bride
on her honeymoon.

744
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:11,489
I was just so full
of so much love for him.

745
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,092
These cop cars
ran us off the road.

746
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:17,320
They just literally edged us
off the road.

747
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,057
And then when they threw us up
against the police car and said,

748
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,326
"You're under arrest
for false imprisonment

749
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,026
and carrying away
Kirk Anderson,"

750
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,261
I couldn't believe it.

751
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,564
It was just, like, shock.

752
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,245
The law was required
to take seriously an act

753
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,784
involving a woman with a gun,
pointing it at a priest.

754
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,683
Forcing him... although
this was a sort of fantasy...

755
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,551
forcing him into a car

756
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:48,217
and spread-eagling him to a bed
and having sex with him.

757
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:51,318
I mean, there are
so many crimes, possible crimes,

758
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,090
involved in all of that,

759
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,689
and yet someone...
everyone suspected

760
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,791
there wasn't really
a crime here at all.

761
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:00,803
Scenario number one
is Kirk's story:

762
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:04,739
Fake gun, chloroform, kidnapped,
tied up, forced to have sex.

763
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,505
The second version
is Joyce's story.

764
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:09,876
They were gonna be married.
They were gonna have children.

765
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:12,313
He needed to escape
from the Mormon Church.

766
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,476
She goes to rescue him.

767
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:16,315
They rush away

768
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,946
and have this magical,
wonderful night...

769
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:20,149
weekend together.

770
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,520
And then they get him.

771
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:23,651
They brainwash him,
and all of a sudden,

772
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,695
he's claiming rape.

773
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:30,063
The third scenario
is something in between.

774
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:34,434
There was a consensual aspect
to his getaway with her.

775
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,531
But then somewhere
along the line,

776
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,611
he had second thoughts.

777
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:44,671
And he wanted it to stop,
and it didn't.

778
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:46,306
<i>Do you think a woman
can rape a man?</i>

779
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,044
No, I think
that's like putting

780
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,710
a marshmallow
in a parking meter.

781
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:51,948
I don't... a guy either wants
to have sex, or he doesn't.

782
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,489
He has an erection,
or he doesn't.

783
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:59,552
She spent about three months
in Holloway Prison,

784
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:03,430
the famous women's prison
in London.

785
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:06,299
There was
a little sliding door

786
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,237
that they would slide open with
just a little slit of light.

787
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,934
And they would slide it open
maybe once a day and say,

788
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:13,476
"Are you ready to sign
a confession?"

789
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:15,546
I kept screaming,
"Please get Kirk!

790
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:16,978
Please get Kirk!"

791
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,811
I beat my fists bloody
on this cold, steel prison door

792
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:24,150
screaming,
"Please, somebody get Kirk!"

793
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:29,522
There was a picture of her
in all the papers

794
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:32,357
looking out of the back
of a police van.

795
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,029
She had scrawled
on a piece of paper,

796
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:43,403
which she was holding up
to press,

797
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:47,171
"Kirk was cooperative
all along."

798
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:52,815
When I went
to the prison library,

799
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,249
I got a Bible,
and in the back of the Bible,

800
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,913
there was two white pages
of blank paper,

801
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:01,185
almost like God put it there.

802
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:04,352
I wrote two letters on those
two blank pages out of my Bible:

803
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:07,397
One to my parents,
and one to the press.

804
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,692
I put them up inside...

805
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,960
I hate to sound gross,

806
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:13,799
but I put one in my vagina
and one in my rectum.

807
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,873
I got out in the prison van,
in the Black Mama,

808
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,202
and I pushed 'em out.

809
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,833
I grunted them out, and I popped
them out the window.

810
00:38:19,944 --> 00:38:21,878
And this man saw them, and I go,

811
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,174
"Pick it up.

812
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:25,010
Pick it up."

813
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:26,606
And he goes like...
"Pick it up.

814
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,481
Mail it.
Mail it."

815
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,076
You know, I was trying
to motion to him,

816
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,315
'cause I knew he couldn't
hear me inside the prison van,

817
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,015
to mail it at the post office.

818
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,615
And he goes...

819
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,854
"Please, please,
please mail it."

820
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:41,693
And so he mailed it,

821
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:44,097
and of course, the next time
I go back for my bail hearing,

822
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:45,533
the whole planet was there.

823
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:07,788
I asked my lawyer.

824
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,792
I said, "Look, if you
can't talk, would you let me?

825
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,156
"'Cause I can sure talk.

826
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:12,786
Let me tell people
what happened."

827
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:14,694
So I got up there,
and I had 'em laughing.

828
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,164
I had 'em crying.

829
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:19,566
I had 'em throwing spitballs
at the Mormons, you know?

830
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,139
Thank God for all those years
of drama school.

831
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,071
Thank you!

832
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:27,633
Everyone was just mesmerized
by her performance.

833
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:30,908
I mean, there was no sense
of fear or shame or anything.

834
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:34,075
She just took on the court
with great confidence,

835
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,119
and she said,
"I loved him so much,

836
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,053
"I would have skied down
Mount Everest nude

837
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:42,217
with a carnation up my nose
for the love of that man."

838
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,867
There was standing room only.

839
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,166
There were little old ladies
with their shopping carts

840
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:57,969
ogling for places to stand!

841
00:39:58,076 --> 00:39:59,100
The banners outside...

842
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,871
"Free Joyce! Free Joyce!"

843
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:05,277
These judges with their white
wigs sitting there, you know,

844
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:07,943
unable to comprehend
any of this.

845
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:09,986
And there was nothing
in the statute books

846
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,350
which would deal with it.

847
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,890
They're so prim and proper,
you know.

848
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,186
They wear these little
powdered wigs,

849
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:17,955
which look like
dumb little hats,

850
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,657
and they sit up and down
and wiggle on their heads.

851
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,290
One of the questions
they ask him was,

852
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,493
"Did you ask for a back rub?"

853
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:25,694
And he said, "Yes."

854
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,202
And they said,
"Was it cinnamon oil

855
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,431
that she rubbed on your back?"

856
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:29,733
And he goes, "Yes,"

857
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,809
like he had remembered,
"Well, that was nice."

858
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,104
They ask him, "Were you willing
or unwilling?"

859
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:36,942
And he did that like really fast
and looked at the head Mormon

860
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:38,072
right on the front row.

861
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,547
He jerked his head
really fast like,

862
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,015
"What am I supposed to say?"

863
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,780
And the head Mormon went like,

864
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,946
"You say what we told you
to say," like that.

865
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,614
And he goes, "I was unwilling!

866
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,282
I was unwilling."

867
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:50,292
"Were you unwilling
all seven times?"

868
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:52,123
"Well, I wasn't as unwilling

869
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,028
the third time
as I was the first."

870
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,363
I wanted him to be strong
and say, "Yes, I love her,

871
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,026
"and I'm gonna tell
the truth right now,

872
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:00,399
and let's get rid of this."

873
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,837
But he was so scared.

874
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,603
You know, you can tell a lie
long enough till you believe it.

875
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:12,273
For 55 minutes, Ms. McKinney
poured out her statement

876
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,681
to an occasionally
confused magistrate.

877
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:17,016
At one point, he stopped her
and said, "I'm lost."

878
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,749
And Ms. McKinney, speaking
in a North Carolina drawl,

879
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:21,518
put the whole case in this way:

880
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:24,618
Referring to the young Mormon,
Kirk Anderson, she said,

881
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,459
"He put me in prison
to save himself

882
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,090
from excommunication
and family disgrace."

883
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,999
This was a phony kidnap
according to Ms. McKinney.

884
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:36,232
Referring to the episode down
in the Devon cottage, she said,

885
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,332
"We had three days of fun,
food, and sex."

886
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:46,639
By this time,
the British Isles was on fire

887
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,480
with the Joyce McKinney story.

888
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,315
That was all
that was being talked about

889
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:53,015
in the pubs and taverns
and restaurants.

890
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,025
"Where were you when you read
the Joyce McKinney story?"

891
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,424
You know.

892
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,725
I mean, it had kinky sex.
It had religion.

893
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:03,733
It had a beauty queen,
kidnap at gunpoint,

894
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,360
chains, being spread-eagled.

895
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,732
It had Mormon missionaries.

896
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,773
And there was something
in that story for everyone.

897
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:11,967
It was a perfect tabloid story.

898
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,373
I mean,
I could never understand

899
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,707
the public's fascination
with my love life.

900
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:16,939
I'm not a movie star.

901
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,073
I'm just a person,
a human being,

902
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:22,209
that was caught in
an extraordinary circumstance.

903
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:28,915
<i>The Daily Express
and the Mirror were locked</i>

904
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:33,759
in almost deadly combat
over the Joyce McKinney story.

905
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:36,698
And then it all
kind of went away

906
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:40,202
until she was released on bail.

907
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,965
And then there was a kind
of burst of stuff again.

908
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:51,873
I was let out on bail
to await the upcoming trial

909
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:54,178
to clear my name.

910
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:56,617
Somebody sent a limousine
to pick me up at the prison,

911
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,086
and here I exit the prison,

912
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:00,157
and I mean,
I've got lice powder in my hair.

913
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,919
I'm supposed to be
this ex-beauty queen,

914
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:04,426
and all the cameras are there,
and, you know, I look like...

915
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:07,053
That was my first taste
of the press.

916
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,961
And when I got back
to the bed-and-breakfast,

917
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:12,263
I started to very quietly
get out of the limousine.

918
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,895
I'm thinking, "I wonder
who sent this car, you know,

919
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:16,530
at the prison to pick me up?"

920
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,768
And I was going to go in
and hug my mom and dad and say,

921
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,070
"I'm home!"

922
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:23,112
All of a sudden,
the sky lit up with flashbulbs.

923
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,114
Suddenly night became day.

924
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:28,674
I was suddenly a celebrity.

925
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:29,912
I didn't ask to be a celebrity.

926
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,989
I didn't want to be a celebrity.

927
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:33,351
But it was like a wave.

928
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:35,618
It was like a "phenomen-imum."

929
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:39,988
<i>So what have these last
few months been like for you?</i>

930
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:43,794
Well, I've been very busy.

931
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,926
It's been amazing,
the way the public

932
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:47,595
has responded to my case.

933
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:52,369
I got close to 1,000 letters
from the British public.

934
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,535
The rest of the time
that I'm not answering letters

935
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:55,771
or something of this nature,

936
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,938
I'm working on my book.

937
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:58,913
<i>What kind of a book is that?</i>

938
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,574
Well, this is my life story,

939
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:03,882
and it's the story
of how I met Kirk,

940
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:06,479
<i>and the name of it is
A Very Special Love Story.</i>

941
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:15,989
I had said something like
I loved Kirk so much,

942
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,965
I'd have skied naked
down Mount Everest

943
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:19,400
with a carnation in my nose.

944
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:21,198
When I went into
the bed-and-breakfast,

945
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:25,036
there were pink carnations
all over the room!

946
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,940
There were pink carnations
in the closet, in the sink,

947
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:29,672
on the floor, on the bed.

948
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,476
Sacks of mail
from all over the world.

949
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,313
People wanted me to autograph
their baby's bellies,

950
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:37,649
their elbows,
their cigarette packs!

951
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:39,154
I got marriage proposals.

952
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:42,384
I got maps with directions
to guys' houses saying,

953
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,552
"Please come and kidnap
and rape me anytime, honey!"

954
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:46,892
It kind of got a life
of its own.

955
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,643
I remember, I was at a party.

956
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:07,217
<i>It was an after-party
for Saturday Night Fever,</i>

957
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:09,183
and Johnny Travolta was there.

958
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,516
And the Bee Gees came over
and asked me to dance,

959
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:12,919
and, you know...

960
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,424
Keith Moon... he was the drummer
for The Who... spied me,

961
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:16,754
and he told
one of the reporters,

962
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:17,885
"I want to meet the girl."

963
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,189
He was with his girlfriend.

964
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:21,025
I mean, there was nothing
between me and Keith,

965
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,326
but he came over,
and he says,

966
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,264
"Joycie girl, I'm gonna give you
a big old smooch."

967
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:25,357
And he just kissed me!

968
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:27,061
And that was
just getting started.

969
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:31,130
Peter McKay, my editor,
said to me,

970
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:34,700
"Why don't you hire
a Rolls-Royce

971
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:39,408
<i>"and take Joyce to the premiere
of The Stud</i>

972
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:42,714
and upstage
the show business element?"

973
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,788
<i>Was there a chance that you
could actually do this?</i>

974
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:46,857
<i>Could you upstage Joan Collins
with Joyce McKinney?</i>

975
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:48,015
Well, we did.

976
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,888
She stepped out
of this Rolls-Royce,

977
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:51,552
and all the press went mad.

978
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:54,654
I mean, it was as if...
I don't know...

979
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,233
Marilyn Monroe got out
or the queen.

980
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,733
I mean,
certainly more excitement

981
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,066
than when Joan Collins
got out of her limousine.

982
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:10,580
She returned home at midnight
like Cinderella.

983
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:14,640
Presumably, Keith May
had been packing their bags,

984
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:17,243
because they disappeared
a day later.

985
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,685
<i>The police had opposed bail,</i>

986
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:20,723
<i>believing that the couple
would leave the country</i>

987
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:22,383
<i>if it were granted.</i>

988
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:24,757
<i>Since their disappearance
was discovered on Thursday,</i>

989
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:27,797
<i>the police have kept a watch
on all air and seaports,</i>

990
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:31,527
<i>but they were last seen by
neighbors on Wednesday evening.</i>

991
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:37,804
I never fled.
Don't use the word "fled."

992
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:39,808
I resent the word "fled."
I left.

993
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,402
- They went to the airport
as deaf-mutes, I gather.

994
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:46,741
Quite clever, really.

995
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:55,783
I went, and I got the birth
certificates of two dead people.

996
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:57,258
I didn't figure they'd mind.

997
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:58,760
And I got me a travel visa.

998
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:01,093
I put on a granny wig,
and I made me a fat suit.

999
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,859
<i>You know what a fat suit is,
like in Norbit.</i>

1000
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:06,869
I said,
"Keith, we're going home."

1001
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:08,836
So I dye his hair coal black,

1002
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:11,464
and I made him
a little handlebar moustache

1003
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:13,805
and darkened his skin,
like Pedro Gonzalez.

1004
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:17,039
And I found out there was
a troop of deaf actors

1005
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:19,309
going to the States via Canada.

1006
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,576
Well, let me tell ya,

1007
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,914
I put some little signs on us,
and it said,

1008
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,217
"I am deaf, but I can lip-read.

1009
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:29,588
Please enunciate your words
slowly and speak clearly."

1010
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:30,853
I remember the stewardess said,

1011
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:32,189
"Get these dummies
on the plane!"

1012
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:33,991
The other one said,
"Shh, They'll hear you!"

1013
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:36,032
And she goes, "No, they won't!
They're stone deaf!"

1014
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:43,872
We got to Canada,
and it's at night,

1015
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:45,134
and they stop us in immigration.

1016
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:47,574
I had 13 suitcases
full of news clips.

1017
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,071
In those suitcases are
hundreds of pictures of me,

1018
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:55,846
magazine covers
and all this stuff.

1019
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:57,921
They're gonna look at me
and say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

1020
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:01,457
They go, "13 suitcases?
You immigrating?"

1021
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,050
And I go...

1022
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:08,029
And she goes, "Oh, you're deaf!
Okay!

1023
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:11,124
We cannot get our interpreter
at night!"

1024
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:12,725
And she's talking louder
and louder.

1025
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:16,101
She gives me a pencil,
"I tired.

1026
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:17,572
May I go now, please?"

1027
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:20,166
Lady goes, "Eh, go on."

1028
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:25,544
Ten days later,
I was in my office

1029
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:27,014
<i>in the Daily Express building.</i>

1030
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:31,110
The telephone rang
one evening about 6:00.

1031
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,450
And I picked it up,
and it was Joyce.

1032
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,290
<i>She said that she wanted to sell
her story to the Daily Express</i>

1033
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:43,196
for £40,000.

1034
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,565
We arranged there and then
for me to fly out to Atlanta

1035
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,266
and wait in the Atlanta airport
Hilton hotel.

1036
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,433
I went to the door,

1037
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:55,376
and there outside
were these two Indians...

1038
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:57,071
like Indians from Calcutta.

1039
00:48:57,181 --> 00:49:02,744
They should have been arrested
for bad acting

1040
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:06,619
far more than abducting
Mormon priests.

1041
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,824
She was having, really,
the time of her life.

1042
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:15,365
There was no sense of anxiety.
She was just enjoying it.

1043
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,900
And giving us all
this nonsense,

1044
00:49:18,002 --> 00:49:21,403
which was a totally sanitized
version of the truth.

1045
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,200
And we were falling for it,
of course,

1046
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:26,208
getting it all onto these little
tape recorders, and thinking,

1047
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,177
<i>"God, hasn't the Express
got a great story here!"</i>

1048
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:33,581
Joyce brought in this suitcase,

1049
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:36,414
took about three of us
to get it in the room.

1050
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,681
I daresay she just put
her finger on the button.

1051
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:39,949
The thing exploded.

1052
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:43,925
And these disguises
and wigs and...

1053
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,825
not bondage gear,
I hasten to add.

1054
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:47,897
At least, I didn't see any.

1055
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,590
I expected the FBI

1056
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,760
to come crashing in through
the windows at any minute,

1057
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,531
'cause as far as I knew, I mean,

1058
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:58,074
we were aiding
and abetting fugitives.

1059
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:01,941
It wasn't clear, really,

1060
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:08,076
what Keith May's motive was
except that he adored Joyce.

1061
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:12,121
And Joyce kind of did,
from time to time,

1062
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:13,382
treat him as if he was

1063
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,187
in some kind
of mistress-slave fantasy.

1064
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:20,058
Like, "Down, slave,"
she would say to him.

1065
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:23,429
"Down, slave!
Down, slave!"

1066
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:26,025
But she would say it
humorously, joking.

1067
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:28,536
But it did occur to us
at the time

1068
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:31,233
that this is all the language
of the world of bondage.

1069
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:34,607
I speak as if I'm an expert,
but I mean...

1070
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,179
<i>I assume that you are.</i>

1071
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:41,982
But it's all this kind of
master-mistress power thing,

1072
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:45,715
domination thing that seems
to run through this whole story.

1073
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:47,017
It seems to be a theme.

1074
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:50,582
Keith had probably
an obsession for Joyce

1075
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:53,254
just like Joyce had
an obsession for Kirk.

1076
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:55,355
The fact that he was just able
to be around her

1077
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:56,865
and helping her
where he could

1078
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:59,595
satisfied his emotions.

1079
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:12,841
There are tabloids in England
that are filth.

1080
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,919
<i>At the top of the list
would be the Daily Mirror.</i>

1081
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:19,750
<i>The Daily Mirror had...
meantime...</i>

1082
00:51:19,857 --> 00:51:21,347
had their reporters
in Los Angeles

1083
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:26,020
digging up all this stuff
about her activities as a...

1084
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,122
I don't know...
not a call girl, but as a...

1085
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,393
well, I suppose she was.

1086
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:34,301
I mean, she was being paid
for sexual services.

1087
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:39,206
But this was all long before
her escapades in the U.K.

1088
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:42,642
This was earlier
Joyce McKinney history.

1089
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:43,940
They had a tip.

1090
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,015
I think it was from
a police officer in London

1091
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:48,983
to one of our London reporters
that was covering the story,

1092
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:52,112
who said that it might be worth
looking up an address

1093
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:54,622
that we know
she had in Los Angeles

1094
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:58,855
and a boyfriend called
Steve Moskowitz.

1095
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:05,034
Joyce had been in touch with him
from England saying,

1096
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:06,602
"Destroy any pictures.

1097
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:10,195
If any journalists turn up,
do not talk to anybody."

1098
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:12,434
Steve was very uncooperative
when I first met him.

1099
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:14,977
Once he told me that he was
still madly in love with her,

1100
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,979
I said, "Look, Steve,
if you want to be at her side

1101
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,480
"for the trial
at the Old Bailey,

1102
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,983
"we will pay
a first-class air ticket for you

1103
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:24,713
and put you up in a hotel in
London so you can be with her."

1104
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:25,914
The next morning,

1105
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:28,389
I'm in the hotel
at Santa Monica.

1106
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,892
8:00, Monday morning,
the phone goes.

1107
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:32,154
Steve.

1108
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:34,059
"I'm downstairs."

1109
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:37,224
He produced six strips
of black-and-white contacts.

1110
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:39,734
There was nothing really
that bad on them.

1111
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:41,737
She was sitting on a horse.

1112
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,864
They were glamour pictures,
as such.

1113
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,536
I said, "Well, look, Steve,

1114
00:52:47,644 --> 00:52:49,635
"this doesn't take us
very much further,

1115
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:51,839
"but I will hang on to them.

1116
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,712
We need more."

1117
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:56,012
I said, "By the way,
the editor in London

1118
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:57,586
wants me to take a picture
of you."

1119
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:00,780
He said, "Can you make it look
as if I've not posed for it?"

1120
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,950
I said, "What do you mean?"

1121
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,290
He said, "Well,
I've got Joyce's car here,

1122
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:06,521
"and I've got Millie.

1123
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,757
"I often take the dog out,
put him in the car,

1124
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,834
take the dog away for a walk."

1125
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,107
He didn't want Joyce to know
he was cooperating.

1126
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:22,372
<i>So he's betraying her.
He knows he's betraying her.</i>

1127
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:26,575
I don't think he realized
how much he was giving us.

1128
00:53:26,683 --> 00:53:29,243
It was only when he said to me,

1129
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:30,547
"She placed these ads

1130
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,144
<i>in the Hollywood Free Press,
in Freep. "</i>

1131
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:34,747
He took us to one
of their offices,

1132
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,826
which had back numbers
of some of the ads

1133
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:39,555
that she'd posted in there,
and it read:

1134
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:43,531
"Gorgeous former Miss USA
contestant desires work.

1135
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:47,229
<i>"Beauty, brains and talent.

1136
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:49,669
"38-24-36.

1137
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:52,264
"Slim, sweet, Southern blonde.

1138
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,435
"How would you like her
to leisurely bathe you,

1139
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:56,740
<i>"lovingly blow dry/style

1140
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:59,213
"and then give you
a delicious nude massage

1141
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,910

1142
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:04,010
"Your fantasy is her specialty.

00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:06,453

1144
00:54:06,557 --> 00:54:08,047

"Dirty panties or pictures.

00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,188
Mail your fantasy
or specialty to Joey."

1149
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:18,199
I love this bit.

1150
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:19,667
"P.S., Joey says,

1151
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:23,536
'I love shy boys, dirty old men,
and sugar daddies."'

1152
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,608
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

1153
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:28,303
I could not believe
that that was Joyce

1154
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:29,674
advertising those services.

1155
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,906
But that was only the beginning,

1156
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:32,174
because once we had
all of that,

1157
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,579
we then had to start thinking,

1158
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:35,515
"Who's got pictures
of all this?"

1159
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:38,019
It was only when he named
that photographer.

1160
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:42,325
He said, "I've never
photographed Joyce McKinney.

1161
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:43,916
I have no idea who she is."

1162
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:47,554
And I said, "Well,
according to a friend of mine

1163
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:49,063
"and a friend of hers,

1164
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,863
she always came on modeling
assignments with her dog."

1165
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,666
"Ah."

1166
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:57,296
He dug out some magazines.

1167
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:58,897
Soon as I saw it,
I said, "That's her."

1168
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,115
I took that away, and I thought,
"Job well done."

1169
00:55:06,216 --> 00:55:08,810
We were getting somewhere.

1170
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,183
We went back
to Steve's apartment,

1171
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,019
and he brought up a phone bill.

1172
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:18,060
Every itemized phone call Joyce
had made from the apartment

1173
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:20,254
in the last three, four months.

1174
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:22,662
Right.

1175
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,996
Away we went
with the phone bill.

1176
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:26,933
Frank Power and I
spent three hours

1177
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,902
hitting every one
of those numbers on there.

1178
00:55:29,006 --> 00:55:31,736
Nobody had heard
of Joyce McKinney.

1179
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,537
No idea who she was.

1180
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:37,239
The dog was the link.
Always the dog.

1181
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,374
It was only when Steve told me

1182
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:43,043
that she took
the dog with her

1183
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:47,214
that the photographer
could put a face to an alias.

1184
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,887
You learn, when you're famous,
who your friends are.

1185
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:54,623
When the payrollees come out,
the checkbook journalists.

1186
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,961
People that are real jealous
or maybe didn't like you

1187
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,864
or need money, it's, "Yeah?

1188
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:01,267
What do ya wanna know about her?
How much you pay me?"

1189
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,362
I had a false friend,
and his name was Steve,

1190
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:05,464
and he was a creep.

1191
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:08,009
He had the key
to the outside of my apartment

1192
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:11,046
so he could go in
and walk my dog.

1193
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:12,638
He broke in a steamer trunk.

1194
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:16,981
I had huge pictures of me in
there from a modeling portfolio.

1195
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:19,749
<i>He sold those to The Sun
and the Daily Mirror.</i>

1196
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:21,380
Both were in contests

1197
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:24,722
to see who could do the worst
Joyce McKinney story.

1198
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,090
<i>When those Daily Mirror
reporters</i>

1199
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:27,356
showed up on his doorstep,

1200
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:30,729
they turned him
and bragged about it.

1201
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:35,862
They sent him and
his prostitute crony to Mexico

1202
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:38,532
so that they
wouldn't be prosecuted

1203
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:41,133
for breaking and entering
my apartment.

1204
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:42,734
We were worried about Steve,

1205
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:45,110
that somebody
was gonna get to him.

1206
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:50,084
So we kept Steve out of the way
of all our opposition in Mexico

1207
00:56:50,187 --> 00:56:53,486
for about ten days until we
finished with the story.

1208
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,649
He didn't realize that it was
to keep him out of the way.

1209
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:57,226
I mean, he could've made
a lot of money

1210
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:58,589
by telling his side
of the story.

1211
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,425
All he got from us
was a promise

1212
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:05,627
to be at the Old Bailey
when Joyce goes to trial.

1213
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:09,502
We were coming up with more
material than you could believe,

1214
00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:11,471
unpublishable material,

1215
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:14,066
bondage pictures,
her wrestling with Thai girls,

1216
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:16,577
mud wrestling, nudes.

1217
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,673
The service that were offered
were oral sex, massage, bondage.

1218
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:23,412
Laura would have
the full intercourse

1219
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,047
if they paid enough money.

1220
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:30,126
Joyce would do the bondage
and anything else they needed,

1221
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:32,320
including oral sex,
but that was it.

1222
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:35,295
I said to him,
"Well, what happens

1223
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:36,626
if this ever got
out of control?"

1224
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:38,860
And he said,
"Oh, we had that fixed."

1225
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:40,493
I won't try to get his accent.

1226
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,196
He said,
"I bugged the dog's collar."

1227
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:44,205
I said, "You did what?"

1228
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,537
He said, "I put a bug
in the collar of the dog."

1229
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:49,203
I said, "What, the dog went with
her on these sexual encounters?"

1230
00:57:49,312 --> 00:57:50,279
"Oh, yeah, always."

1231
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,642
He said, "And if it got
out of hand,

1232
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:53,739
"I'd be sitting outside
with a couple of other guys,

1233
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,147
and we would go in."

1234
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:57,447
<i>So is he sitting in
a coffee shop with headphones?</i>

1235
00:57:57,554 --> 00:57:58,543
He was sitting in the car.

1236
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:05,086
Steve was very much in love
with Joyce.

1237
00:58:05,195 --> 00:58:08,528
We asked him if he'd ever
had sex with her, and he said,

1238
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:11,760
"Shoot, man, nobody's ever
had sex with Joyce."

1239
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:14,132
That was the quote from him.

1240
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:15,329
<i>Nobody?</i>

1241
00:58:15,438 --> 00:58:17,531
"Nobody."
That was the quote.

1242
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:21,304
When Mike Malloy,
who was the editor

1243
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:22,503
<i>of the Mirror at that time,</i>

1244
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:24,705
asked me how
we were getting on, I said,

1245
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:25,873
"It's interesting, Mike.

1246
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,506
You'll be pleased to see
what we've got."

1247
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:29,278
"Do you have a picture of her
in a swimsuit?"

1248
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:31,581
I said, "Oh, yes.
We've got that."

1249
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:39,889
I mean, worms crawl
out of the woodwork

1250
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:42,464
when you become famous,
worms, cockroaches!

1251
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:50,703
Mike called me to say,

1252
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:52,798
"I better let you know
that tomorrow we're gonna run,

1253
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:56,037
for a week,
with 'The Real McKinney' story."

1254
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,171
And that was the front page,
"The Real McKinney."

1255
00:59:03,253 --> 00:59:06,745
Their front page was
going to be Joyce, naked,

1256
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,154
but lying on her stomach.

1257
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:12,718
And ours was going to be
these pictures of her as a nun.

1258
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:14,888
One paper projecting her

1259
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:18,434
as an innocent,
sweet-natured woman,

1260
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:21,265
a God-fearing, religious woman,

1261
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:24,306
who was a victim
of cruel circumstances.

1262
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:26,773
<i>And the other, the Daily Mirror,
projected her</i>

1263
00:59:26,877 --> 00:59:32,816
as a kind of manipulating,
sex-crazed, part-time hooker.

1264
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:36,215
Somewhere in between, maybe,
is the truth.

1265
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,050
<i>- The Express came, and they
actually let me tape-record</i>

1266
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:42,920
what I said, and they
printed it word-for-word.

1267
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:47,258
<i>And that same week, the Mirror
came out with the story.</i>

1268
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:49,662
They had painted a totally
different picture of me.

1269
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:53,600
If I was well-educated,
they made me stupid.

1270
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:57,867
If I was a virgin in real life,
they made me a slut.

1271
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:02,274
We did the fantasy
that Joyce wanted promoted

1272
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,007
to the millions
of English readers.

1273
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:06,673
<i>Yeah, you became her tool,
her slave.</i>

1274
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,717
Oh, totally.
I became her slave, yes.

1275
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:10,615
We were all her slaves.

1276
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:16,315
<i>The Daily Express
did buy the story,</i>

1277
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:18,121
and it was only Joyce's story,

1278
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:20,492
what she wanted to say
about the kidnapping,

1279
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:22,565
what she did or did not do
with Kirk.

1280
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,294
She wasn't gonna tell a story
about her hooker assignments.

1281
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:26,630
She can't say it never happened

1282
01:00:26,736 --> 01:00:30,399
because there it is
in black-and-white.

1283
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:34,102
It was Joyce.

1284
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,507
<i>Well, her claim is, of course,</i>

1285
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:37,045
<i>that those pictures
were doctored.</i>

1286
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:38,307
You don't doctor negatives.

1287
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:41,441
We had the negative,
print, and the magazine.

1288
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:43,644
Get out of that, Joyce.

1289
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:46,483
<i>The Sun put my head
on another person's naked body.</i>

1290
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:48,523
And she was flat-chested
as a board.

1291
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:51,526
I mean, the girl was flat
in her front.

1292
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:53,926
As you see, I'm not flat
in my front.

1293
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,294
<i>So it was clear that
this woman's breasts...</i>

1294
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:57,525
Were not me.

1295
01:00:57,634 --> 01:01:00,797
Those are fried eggs!

1296
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:02,838
<i>The Sun admitted
it was a fake picture.</i>

1297
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,430
They came out and said,
"This is a composite picture."

1298
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,009
<i>But the Daily Mirror didn't.</i>

1299
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:11,012
<i>The Daily Mirror tried to make
it look like I was a whore.</i>

1300
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,604
On the only occasion
when I did meet her

1301
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:14,946
a bit later, she said,
in her accent, you know,

1302
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,780
"I don't pose nude."

1303
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:18,945
Of course, sitting
on the editor's desk

1304
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:21,717
was over 1,000 pictures
and magazines

1305
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:25,124
and negatives of her
that we already had.

1306
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:26,525
She never knew that, of course.

1307
01:01:26,629 --> 01:01:28,756
I never took a picture,
which is really unusual for me.

1308
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,162
The only thing
I ever wanted to do

1309
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:31,858
was photograph Joyce
with no clothes on.

1310
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:33,128
And I ended up picking up

1311
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:35,363
hundreds of other people
who did it.

1312
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:37,838
Bit strange.

1313
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:39,306
<i>Do you still have
the photographs?</i>

1314
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:40,842
Unfortunately,
only the pictures

1315
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,844
<i>that were published
in the Mirror at the time.</i>

1316
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:46,712
The file, which was
between 800 and 1,000 pictures,

1317
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:47,942
were all locked up in a safe.

1318
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:49,018
But unfortunately,

1319
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,518
the Mirror Group
changed ownership,

1320
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,110
and along with
a lot of other things,

1321
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:54,349
all that dossier went missing.

1322
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,257
We were in the hotel room,
and Joyce was constantly calling

1323
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:01,694
her friend
in North London saying,

1324
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:02,924
"Have you seen the papers yet?

1325
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:04,125
Have you seen the papers yet?"

1326
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:05,496
She'd gotten the newspapers,

1327
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:08,127
the early editions
of the newspapers,

1328
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:10,468
and had them laid out
in front of her

1329
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:12,006
and was on the telephone saying,

1330
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:14,303
<i>"And the Mirror says this,
and the Mirror says that.</i>

1331
01:02:14,411 --> 01:02:18,905
"And there's a photograph
of you here with no clothes on.

1332
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:20,744
"And there's another photograph

1333
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,684
of you here standing on a man
in a bedroom."

1334
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:27,018
And this is when Joyce
freaked out.

1335
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:35,292
She was so appalled
and enraged and distressed

1336
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:36,956
about all the stuff

1337
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:39,501
<i>that the Mirror had been
printing about her,</i>

1338
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:41,832
'cause she had no idea
this was gonna happen at all.

1339
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:45,567
She just went crazy,
went absolutely crazy.

1340
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:49,702
Brian realized that he had
to stop this conversation

1341
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:52,646
and that she mustn't learn
any more,

1342
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:54,546
'cause we didn't know
what she was going to do.

1343
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:57,142
So he didn't even bother
to disconnect the telephone

1344
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:58,618
in a civilized way.

1345
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:01,519
He just grabbed the wires
and pulled them out of the wall.

1346
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:06,720
He didn't unplug them;
He just pull...

1347
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,923
and bits of plaster came out,
I remember, with it.

1348
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:12,126
<i>This is a very unusual kind
of behavior, no?</i>

1349
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,930
<i>Wouldn't you just
hang the phone up?</i>

1350
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:17,029
Well, Joyce McKinney
had it in both hands

1351
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,937
screwed into her ear.

1352
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,476
I mean, she was really scary,
really scary.

1353
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:23,546
She appeared to kind of fly
across the room,

1354
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:27,844
as far as I remember it,
and clung on to the curtains,

1355
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:30,852
which partly came away
on the rail.

1356
01:03:30,954 --> 01:03:32,512
She was completely hysterical.

1357
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:33,953
Then she went for the balcony.

1358
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:36,787
I dived after her and sort of
grabbed her by the ankles.

1359
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:39,088
I didn't know whether
she was going to jump off,

1360
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,857
'cause if she had done, I think
there were probably tourists

1361
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,660
on deck chairs underneath.

1362
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,030
She would've probably
taken them out too.

1363
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:49,731
So it would have been very
embarrassing, to say the least.

1364
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,704
I looked down, and I could see
all the reporters

1365
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:53,969
milling around outside
trying to get their shot,

1366
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,635
trying to get their shot.

1367
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:57,474
You know, even as far up
as I was,

1368
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,047
they were trying
to get their shot.

1369
01:03:59,149 --> 01:04:02,710
And I thought, "All I have to do
is just climb up on this rail

1370
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,344
"and just splatter,
and I will be dead.

1371
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:06,854
"I'll be in heaven.

1372
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:12,826
There will be no more tabloid
reporters ever to ruin my life."

1373
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:14,726
She went a bit up the wall.

1374
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:16,765
She tried to climb up
and jump off the balcony.

1375
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:18,766
"I want to meet my Maker!"

1376
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:24,663
K.J. Came running in
the motel room, and he's just,

1377
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:27,038
"Don't let 'em win!

1378
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:29,338
"If you die,
the truth dies with you,

1379
01:04:29,445 --> 01:04:31,913
"and nobody will ever know
what really happened.

1380
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:34,449
Nobody will know
how much you loved him."

1381
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:36,416
She was screaming.
She was hysterical.

1382
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:39,249
She was completely
out of control.

1383
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:40,879
We got her to a hospital.

1384
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,221
We were thinking in terms of
a pill of some kind,

1385
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:46,659
but this nurse appeared
with a large syringe

1386
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:50,494
and just stuck it in her.

1387
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,692
And we wheeled her out

1388
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:53,962
in this wheelchair
that was provided,

1389
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,004
unconscious,

1390
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,663
and got her back to the hotel.

1391
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:00,538
Her father, this gentle man,
came in with his wife

1392
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:03,840
and tried to put his arms
around Joyce.

1393
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:07,212
And she just sunk her teeth
into his forearm.

1394
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:10,480
And there was an awful kind
of tussle.

1395
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,748
And he managed
to get himself free,

1396
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:15,119
and there was blood
trickling down his arm.

1397
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,159
He'd been attacked by a vampire.

1398
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,833
Joyce then fled the whole lot
of us in her nightie.

1399
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:28,301
And we kind of followed her
and chased her down.

1400
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:30,998
And there was this freeway
that went past the back

1401
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:34,133
of the hotel with huge trucks

1402
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:37,509
and cars whizzing past
in both directions.

1403
01:05:37,614 --> 01:05:40,845
I remember seeing her
run across this freeway,

1404
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:46,684
miraculously being missed
by all these vehicles

1405
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,121
and kind of disappearing
somewhere into the distance.

1406
01:05:58,434 --> 01:05:59,662
I know.
Exactly.

1407
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:01,828
Because would you believe
McKinney is back?

1408
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:03,030
Joyce McKinney,

1409
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:05,198
the "sex in chains" girl,
arrested.

1410
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:07,708
She kept us all entertained
in 1977.

1411
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,244
She used to phone me up
every day, two or three times,

1412
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:12,780
for months, saying,
"Lawks, have mercy!

1413
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:16,010
<i>I'll kill myself... what
the Daily Mirror said about me."</i>

1414
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:17,313
And seven years later,

1415
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,945
she'll still pursuing
this unfortunate Mormon.

1416
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:21,148
Can you believe it?

1417
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:23,384
Oh, dear.

1418
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,085
<i>You saw him in 1984?</i>

1419
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,252
Yeah.

1420
01:06:26,362 --> 01:06:27,488
Yeah, I was at the airport,

1421
01:06:27,597 --> 01:06:32,534
and his... overweight
Mormon wife saw me.

1422
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:35,263
And I guess she was disturbed
I was using the public airport.

1423
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:36,804
She went and called the police
and said,

1424
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,237
"Oh, McKinney's here.
Go get her."

1425
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:40,070
<i>What was his job
at the airport?</i>

1426
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,668
- I hate to say this,
but he was a doo-doo dipper.

1427
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,475
<i>A doo-doo dipper?</i>

1428
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:46,775
Yeah.

1429
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:48,248
<i>What is a doo-doo dipper?</i>

1430
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:50,410
- That's someone
who takes the doo-doo

1431
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,351
off the back of the plane.

1432
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:54,446
They married him off
to this big, overweight woman,

1433
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,684
and they told her to start
having kids as quick as possible

1434
01:06:56,793 --> 01:06:59,887
so that he would get over me.

1435
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:02,931
That fact that I could have
given him children, I guess,

1436
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,397
was bypassed.

1437
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,991
I was kind of glad
she was not too good-looking.

1438
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:08,934
I mean, If she had been
really great-looking,

1439
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:10,903
I would have probably felt
really awful, you know?

1440
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,304
Cried my eyes out,

1441
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:14,740
but it wasn't any competition,
if you know what I mean.

1442
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,368
The only thing she had
that I didn't have

1443
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:18,606
was 100 extra pounds,
and she was a Mormon.

1444
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:24,585
She was found lurking
outside his office.

1445
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:28,054
I think she was arrested
for stalking him or something.

1446
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,529
<i>Do you still love him?</i>

1447
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,291
I'll die loving him.

1448
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,594
I never got married
because of him.

1449
01:07:50,913 --> 01:07:54,246
I'm the incurable romantic,
you know?

1450
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,183
The idea of marrying somebody
that I didn't love

1451
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:59,516
and having to sleep with him
and have his kids

1452
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:04,116
and live a humdrum, blasé life
with half a love...

1453
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:08,061
I would rather have
a short few weeks

1454
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:13,602
with someone who was
the star in the crown

1455
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:17,662
than to spend my life
with someone and be miserable.

1456
01:08:17,774 --> 01:08:20,265
Love is not a changing thing.

1457
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:23,243
It doesn't... it's a steadfast
and eternal thing.

1458
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:24,836
It's like an eternal flame.

1459
01:08:24,947 --> 01:08:28,144
It doesn't just stop because
of circumstances or situations.

1460
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:29,650
It goes on, even past death.

1461
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:32,585
It's a very bleak future
you paint for yourself.

1462
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:33,780
What is gonna happen to you?

1463
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:36,222
Well, first of all,
I want to write my book

1464
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:38,816
and make sure
that the truth comes out,

1465
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:41,123
because, regardless
of what you've heard,

1466
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:44,131
I haven't sold my life story
to anyone, to any newspapers.

1467
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,895
<i>The only newspaper I have talked
to has been the Express,</i>

1468
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:49,198
who did the article about
my adventures in America,

1469
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:50,363
and that's it.

1470
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:51,940
And I want my story to be told.

1471
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,872
Are you really prepared
to condemn yourself,

1472
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:57,673
'cause that's what it is,
to a very solitary life?

1473
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,042
Yes.

1474
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:08,384
Today's date
is September 25, 1986.

1475
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:09,924
September 25, 1986.

1476
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:13,928
It is the interior
of the McKinneys' house,

1477
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,691
the office.

1478
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:19,234
This is the office
where the McKinney daughter

1479
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:20,768
is currently working on a book.

1480
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,861
Could you work
at this computer

1481
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:26,499
with the Benfield coon dogs
barking outside your window?

1482
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:33,146
My father is trying
to take a nap.

1483
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,218
Outside, both Benfield hounds
are barking.

1484
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:47,387
This shot is done
through the screen.

1485
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:57,638
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1486
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:03,440
shows absolutely nothing around.

1487
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:07,915
This shot shows absolutely
nothing in the picture.

1488
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:16,147
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1489
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:19,490
shows absolutely nothing
in the picture.

1490
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:25,200
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1491
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,394
shows absolutely
no other animals

1492
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:28,629
or anything in the picture

1493
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:33,038
to agitate the barking
Benfield hound.

1494
01:10:33,142 --> 01:10:35,076
This is the same dog, of course,

1495
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,975
that's been barking
in the other pictures.

1496
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,858
I finally got
what's called agoraphobia.

1497
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:02,165
It's when you can't
go out of the house.

1498
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:04,432
We had a big old farmhouse

1499
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,838
with a river on one side
and woods on the other.

1500
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:15,078
And we thought that was, like,
a natural barrier to paparazzi.

1501
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,118
But they would just
put on fisherman boots

1502
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:18,811
and just wade
right through that river.

1503
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:24,954
I remember one time a woman
came on our property,

1504
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,756
ignored
the "no trespassing" signs,

1505
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,625
and she was just gawking
in the window,

1506
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:29,720
like, trying to get up

1507
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:32,562
to see what Joyce McKinney
looked like.

1508
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,260
It went on like that for years.

1509
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:41,074
I could barely get out
to go feed the horses.

1510
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:51,085
So finally, I got me
this big old guard dog.

1511
01:11:51,187 --> 01:11:53,621
His name was Tough Guy.

1512
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,520
He was a huge dog.
He weighed about 150 pounds.

1513
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,853
Solid muscle.

1514
01:11:56,959 --> 01:12:00,326
Pit bull mastiff bulldog.
Jaws like a alligator.

1515
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,329
And I just put him right
out in the front yard like,

1516
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,865
"Come on, boys.
Come on."

1517
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:11,295
One day, he got bee-stung.

1518
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:13,602
These two women
that worked at the pharmacy

1519
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,234
who didn't like me
decided that it'd just be a hoot

1520
01:12:16,345 --> 01:12:18,506
to add a zero onto
that Prednisone prescription

1521
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:19,808
for Joyce McKinney's guard dog.

1522
01:12:19,915 --> 01:12:21,075
Wouldn't that be funny?

1523
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:22,741
Probably drive him nutty,
wouldn't it?

1524
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:25,719
Well, it drove him
more than nutty.

1525
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:29,518
The capillaries
in his brain exploded.

1526
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:32,924
But not before he attacked me.

1527
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:34,690
He didn't know who I was.

1528
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:37,231
He amputated...
I can't raise this arm up.

1529
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,029
But he amputated my left arm.

1530
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:41,763
He tore off three fingers
on this hand.

1531
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:44,396
He ripped my intestines out
of my stomach wall.

1532
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:47,032
He shredded my knee

1533
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,976
from my right kneecap
to my ankle.

1534
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,411
I was bleeding to death.

1535
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:53,982
I was dying.

1536
01:12:57,386 --> 01:12:58,751
A few months before this,

1537
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:01,220
I had found a little dog
by the side of the road

1538
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,483
going through garbage cans.

1539
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:03,922
I named him Booger.

1540
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:05,721
And Booger
was a little pit bull.

1541
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:08,458
I hit the brakes,
and I backed up,

1542
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:11,328
and I got out, and I said,
"Could you use a friend?

1543
01:13:11,434 --> 01:13:13,402
"I could use a friend too.

1544
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:16,232
Okay, I'm a softie.
Get in the car."

1545
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:17,362
So he went...

1546
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:22,668
He had a little five-beat
musical bark, Booger did.

1547
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,439
Booger, Booger, Booger.

1548
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:25,673
I had taken him home with me,

1549
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:28,215
not realizing that he was
gonna be famous someday

1550
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:31,445
or that he would save my life
or change the lives... my life

1551
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:34,216
and the lives of so many people.

1552
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:36,951
The night that this big mastiff
attacked me, the guard dog,

1553
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:38,651
I got next door
to where Booger was.

1554
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:40,251
I said, "Help me, Booger,"
and Booger shot out,

1555
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:42,091
and he jumped on that other dog
and pulled it off of me.

1556
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:45,090
It was a fight to the death,
and I thought,

1557
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:46,998
"Poor little Booger,

1558
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:49,537
he's gonna give himself
in a Christlike love for me."

1559
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,369
When I came home
from the hospital,

1560
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:54,807
he sat on the bed beside me,
and we healed together,

1561
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:56,571
and we formed a bond,
a friendship.

1562
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:02,507
Booger was a very special dog.

1563
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:05,781
Not only was he
a licensed service dog,

1564
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:07,879
but one day he just got up
and unlocked the door,

1565
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,686
and then he started
dialing 911 with his paw.

1566
01:14:10,793 --> 01:14:12,260
He had a big button phone.

1567
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:13,487
And I'd say, "Booger, help!

1568
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:15,621
Dial 911."
He'd go, whomp!

1569
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:16,857
"Booger, I need a towel.

1570
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:18,490
Go get me a towel
out of the dryer, buddy."

1571
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:20,330
He'd go in there into the dryer
and get me a towel.

1572
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:22,370
"Hey, Booger, get me a pop
out of the refrigerator."

1573
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:25,565
And he'd go get me one,
and he'd so gently carry it

1574
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:27,699
so he wouldn't burst it
with his teeth

1575
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,607
and drop it in my lap.

1576
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,910
He got me through
that tough time.

1577
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:42,081
For ten years, he was my helper.

1578
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:45,126
My beloved old friend Booger
passed away in my arms

1579
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:47,821
of cancer in April of 2006.

1580
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,057
I tried everything
in the world to save him.

1581
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:52,532
I took him to every
veterinary hospital I could.

1582
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:54,000
I said, "You can't die, buddy.

1583
01:14:54,103 --> 01:14:55,866
"You're all I have.
We're a package deal.

1584
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:57,962
You can't die."

1585
01:14:58,073 --> 01:15:00,667
That was the last command
I gave him, "You can't die."

1586
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:04,872
And he looked at me as if he
didn't want to disappoint me.

1587
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,971
And those eyes,
with age-old wisdom,

1588
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:12,349
those dark brown eyes
looked at me like, "Don't worry.

1589
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:16,550
I'll see you again.
This is not the end for us."

1590
01:15:17,226 --> 01:15:18,318
I just wanted to go to heaven,

1591
01:15:18,427 --> 01:15:20,156
and I thought God
would just have Booger there

1592
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:21,388
on a cloud for me or something.

1593
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:23,795
And I'd had such a sad life,
you know,

1594
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,628
with all the tabloid mess.

1595
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,669
And I thought,
"I just want the hurt to stop.

1596
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:30,466
And I can't do without him."

1597
01:15:30,573 --> 01:15:32,438
Then I heard about cloning.

1598
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,668
You know, I thought, "Well,
I'll just give it a stab."

1599
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:37,612
I contacted Dr. Byeong Chun Lee

1600
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:40,580
and asked him
if it was possible.

1601
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:42,583
I wrote him a letter in Korean,
translated it,

1602
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:44,550
and then tracked down
his phone number.

1603
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,144
And he goes,
"I can clone your dog."

1604
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:48,621
I said, "Are you sure?

1605
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:52,319
I mean, is it possible
I could have my old boy back?"

1606
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:54,362
He goes, "I can."

1607
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:01,329
<i>Do you ever feel like God?</i>

1608
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:27,885
What their plan was

1609
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:31,398
is to take a little piece
of tissue from Booger's tummy,

1610
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,127
put it in liquid nitrogen

1611
01:16:33,235 --> 01:16:35,601
for its safe trip back
to Seoul, Korea.

1612
01:16:37,072 --> 01:16:40,439
They flew back with the help
of Homeland Security.

1613
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:44,069
Homeland Security
guarding these little cells.

1614
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:45,168
<i>Guarding Booger.</i>

1615
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:46,646
Well, to me,
it was Spirit Booger.

1616
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:47,716
That's what we called it.

1617
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:50,046
It was like an orb of light

1618
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,518
moved along the fuselage
of the plane.

1619
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:54,646
And people were saying,
"What is that?"

1620
01:16:54,757 --> 01:16:58,386
But I knew.
I knew it was old Spirit Booger.

1621
01:16:58,494 --> 01:17:01,588
I closed my eyes, and I said
a silent prayer, and I said,

1622
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:04,689
"Oh, Heavenly Father,
please take good care of him."

1623
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,394
And it was like he spoke
to my heart, and said,

1624
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:09,528
"Don't worry.

1625
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:11,970
"He's with me, and he's fine.

1626
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:16,033
"And you, you are going
to be fine too,

1627
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:17,840
"because I've got Booger 1,

1628
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:20,279
"but I'm sending you back
Booger 2

1629
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:22,873
and a little something extra."

1630
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:00,278
- I get this
long-distance phone call.

1631
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,254
It's Dr. Hong.

1632
01:18:02,358 --> 01:18:05,623
"Miss Brenann, what is best news
I can bring to you?"

1633
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:08,219
And I said, "We're pregnant?

1634
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:09,922
We're pregnant!"

1635
01:18:10,032 --> 01:18:11,056
He said, "We are."

1636
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:16,468
On August the 5th,
I flew to Seoul, Korea.

1637
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:35,022
Well, I found out what
the little something extra was

1638
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:37,922
that Heavenly Father
had promised me.

1639
01:18:38,027 --> 01:18:39,551
<i>There were five.
Five?</i>

1640
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:42,994
Five cloned puppies,
all exactly like Booger,

1641
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:46,431
five mini Boogers lying there
like little black jelly rolls

1642
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,867
with half the world press
crowding around.

1643
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:51,531
They just looked like
little tiny mini Boogers.

1644
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,301
It was the strangest feeling.

1645
01:18:57,179 --> 01:18:58,703
The weirdest thing is,

1646
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,009
I was sitting in a hotel
in Seoul, Korea,

1647
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,277
and one of them got up
and opened the door,

1648
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:04,511
and he was four months old.

1649
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,555
And I just went...

1650
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:08,782
I thought, "How'd he know that?

1651
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:10,153
I didn't train them to do that."

1652
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:12,159
You know, they have
those little refrigerators

1653
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:15,526
with little wooden doors,
like a cabinet, in hotels.

1654
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,826
And he just reached right up,
got that silver knob,

1655
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,195
and jerked it open
with his teeth

1656
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,427
just like old Booger used to do.

1657
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,003
And then, when one of them
got the leash

1658
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:23,162
and went over to the door

1659
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:24,933
and dropped it like,
"Walk me, now,"

1660
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,736
like Booger did,
it blew me away.

1661
01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:30,277
I said, "These are his clones."

1662
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,609
It was $25,000,
if I can remember.

1663
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,774
<i>Well, the original price was,
I believe, $150,000.</i>

1664
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:37,317
Was it?
God.

1665
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:38,716
She must like her dogs.

1666
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:41,847
I don't know.
Some girl.

1667
01:19:41,957 --> 01:19:43,390
It was in all the papers.

1668
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:47,986
<i>"Dog cloning girl turns out
to be the Joyce McKinney,"</i>

1669
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:50,861
because she pretended
it wasn't her to start with.

1670
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:52,934
She called herself
Brenann McKinney.

1671
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:54,866
Something like Brenann,
was it?

1672
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,699
Berman McKinney,
or something like that.

1673
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:58,796
I forget what name she used.

1674
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:01,137
I knew right away it was Joyce.

1675
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:02,403
<i>Why?</i>

1676
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,036
Well, I think there was
a photograph.

1677
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:06,739
And she hadn't changed
that much.

1678
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:10,012
I thought if I used
my middle name

1679
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:12,246
that I would just be left alone
by the press,

1680
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,254
because I don't see
any connection at all

1681
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:15,721
between cloned puppies

1682
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:17,985
and a 32-year-old
sex-in-chains story.

1683
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:20,527
I'm sorry, but I don't see
the connection.

1684
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:23,097
But you should have seen
the way Associated Press...

1685
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:24,927
those people slandered me
so bad.

1686
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,126
In fact, if there's an attorney
listening to this

1687
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:28,897
that wants a good libel suit,
I've got one.

1688
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,029
"I'll sue anybody," she said,

1689
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,903
"who says I'm
that Joyce McKinney.

1690
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:34,168
I'm not that Joyce McKinney."

1691
01:20:34,276 --> 01:20:37,177
But she had to admit
that she was.

1692
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:50,149
I was afraid to have a love
affair of any kind after Kirk.

1693
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,419
I was afraid to kiss a guy.

1694
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:54,394
So I chose just
to be celibate and...

1695
01:20:54,496 --> 01:20:56,191
as Bridget Bardot once said,

1696
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:57,492
"I gave my youth to men,

1697
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:00,227
and my old age I give to dogs
that I trust."

1698
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:02,200
Dogs and children love me.

1699
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:03,771
They love Joyce McKinney,

1700
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:07,308
because they sense in me
an innocence, you know?

1701
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:10,401
They sense in me a gentleness.

1702
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:12,571
And they don't read
tabloid papers.

1703
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:13,978
They love me for me.

1704
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:15,606
She's not an evil person.

1705
01:21:15,717 --> 01:21:20,051
I mean, she's just a bit crazy,
eccentric, self-obsessed,

1706
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:22,919
and self-involved
and manipulative

1707
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:25,687
and barking mad, probably,
basically, but...

1708
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:27,227
<i>"Barking mad."</i>

1709
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:28,523
Yeah.

1710
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,621
<i>I wish we had that expression
over here.</i>

1711
01:21:30,732 --> 01:21:32,063
You can have it.

1712
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:36,037
You can tell yourself
a million times,

1713
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:37,628
"God knows the truth."

1714
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:40,708
And it would be nice
if all you had to deal with

1715
01:21:40,809 --> 01:21:43,471
every day was God.

1716
01:21:43,579 --> 01:21:45,809
But you don't.
You have to deal with people.

1717
01:21:52,754 --> 01:21:55,416
I didn't plan on any of
the tabloids destroying my life

1718
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:57,651
or the Mormons or the press
or the wire services.

1719
01:21:57,759 --> 01:21:59,386
That was not in my plans.

1720
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:03,923
I really didn't have
much choice

1721
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:08,128
other than to make
some kind of move in my life.

1722
01:22:08,237 --> 01:22:10,501
I had promised God
I was gonna write the book.

1723
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:12,836
Finally.
No matter how much it hurt me.

1724
01:22:16,278 --> 01:22:18,576
But someone broke into
my pickup truck.

1725
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,174
I had an entire cab
full of materials.

1726
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:25,480
I had court cases,
court records.

1727
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:26,986
I had all
the interview witnesses.

1728
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:29,023
I had all the exhibits.

1729
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:32,958
I had the original
modeling portfolio

1730
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:37,259
which matched the head
that was put on the naked body.

1731
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:40,494
My whole life is
in those three suitcases.

1732
01:22:40,602 --> 01:22:43,002
And this was an old pickup.

1733
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:45,903
They pried the wing open
with an orange screwdriver,

1734
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,875
and they took coat hangers,

1735
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:51,241
pulled the door open,

1736
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,678
took absolutely everything

1737
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:56,012
documenting the story
I've just told you,

1738
01:22:56,118 --> 01:22:57,517
took everything,

1739
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:59,849
with the exception of one little
yellow laundry basket

1740
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:03,220
which had somehow
wedged under the seat.

1741
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:06,856
At least I had something to show

1742
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:10,762
that this nightmare ordeal
happened to what was once

1743
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:13,926
a normal, all-American kid.

1744
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:23,642
"After her miraculous escape
to America,

1745
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:26,508
"Joyce retreats into seclusion
to write a book

1746
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:27,980
"about her love story.

1747
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:29,778
"She vows never to marry,

1748
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:31,910
"knowing fully
that she could never love

1749
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,817
"another man other than Kirk,

1750
01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:38,120
"for she will grow old alone.

1751
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:41,423
"The love that once spanned
an entire continent

1752
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,725
and ocean still exists."

1753
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:52,638
"Time changes, but the scene
is still the same.

1754
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:56,108
"Joyce is now
a lonely old woman.

1755
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:59,442
"Like Narcissus,
she is pining to death,

1756
01:23:59,548 --> 01:24:01,413
dying of a broken heart."

1757
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,657
That's the conclusion
of my book,

1758
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:21,759
but the love has never ended.
