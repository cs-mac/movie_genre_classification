Ma?

00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,449
Ms, Min,

9
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:41,885
What is this?

10
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:46,189
It has nothing to do with you,

11
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:48,658
Yes,

12
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,494
it does,

13
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,499

Baek Sang Ho?

17
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,400
Baek Sang Ho speaking,

18
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:34,905
I told you that I'd call you,

19
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,080
You should go,

20
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,336
Hi, You should've called first,

21
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:07,337
Did you eat?

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,006
Yes, I ate,

23
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,277
Is something wrong?

24
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,146
You look terrible,

25
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,582
It's nothing, I'm fine,

26
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,085
Mom,

27
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,623
About Kim Mi Jung whom we mentioned earlier,

28
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,726
I found her medical report earlier,

29
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,796
But some things were strange,

30
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,899
I searched the ID number on her chart,

31
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,234
and it was someone else,

32
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,902
Her name and address are all different too,

33
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,871
Really?

34
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,674
Was there anything odd,,,

35
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,109
when she was in the hospital?

36
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,111
Like what you see in the news,,,

37
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,312
about people who fake,,,

38
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,947
someone's identity and send them,,,

39
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:53,283
to a mental institution to take their money,

40
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,053
If Kim Mi Jung was also in such a situation,

41
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,956
the Kim Mi Jung that you know,,,

42
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,492
may not really be Kim Mi Jung,

43
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,827
Right?

44
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,066
Don't you have something to say to me?

45
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,145
The Hyungjae factory,

46
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,749
The sexual torture of female factory workers,

47
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:26,983
You've heard of it, right?

48
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,486
In 1986,

49
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,155
when Cho Gap Soo was a detective,

50
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,125
The sexual assault of female workers,,,

51
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,960
who had gone on strike,

52
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,834
I was the prosecutor on the case,

53
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,838
I dragged Cho Gap Soo to trial,,,

54
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:51,207
based on the victims' testimonies,

55
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,076
but we lost,,,

56
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,644
for insufficient evidence,

57
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:57,280
So?

58
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,483
What does that have to do with my mom?

59
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,654
The one victim from the incident,,,

60
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,724
who could not be located,

61
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,794
Seo Jung Soon died,

62
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,996
and the day after he was found not guilty,,,

63
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:15,999
I want to file a report,

64
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,535
Yes, go ahead,

65
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,537
It's regarding Cho Gap Soo,

66
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,340
I have a tape,,,

67
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,509
where Cho Gap Soo admits,,,

68
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,845
what he did 10 years ago,

69
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,046
Back then,

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,416
I was sure that informant was Kwak Young Shil,

71
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,852
But I couldn't meet her,

72
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,287
Instead,

73
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,723
I saw someone else,

74
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:43,059
Look who it is,

75
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,464
It's the just prosecutor,

76
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,966
Min Ji Sook,

77
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,435
Kwak Young Shil, who had the evidence,

78
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,337
and Cho Gap Soo,

79
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,339
who wanted to hide it, were at the same hospital,

80
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,575
Then Kwak Young Shil disappeared,

81
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,044
Do you think that was a coincidence?

82
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,747
Do you think Cho Gap Soo had nothing to do with it?

83
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,685
Are you saying that man abducted my mom?

84
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,154
It's a reasonable deduction,

85
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,724
So I investigated it as an abduction for a while,

86
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,926
but there weren't enough leads,

87
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,897
No way, My mom wouldn't,,,

88
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,400
Sexual torture?

89
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:26,836
No way,

90
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:28,638
That can't be,

91
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,175
My mom is a cheerful person,

92
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,877
I never once saw her,,,

93
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:36,679
cry, cringe, or even sigh,

94
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,615
And she's a crybaby,

95
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,584
She'd freak out about a tiny cut,

96
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,819
How could she,,,

97
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,456
Sexual torture?

98
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:54,097
If she really experienced something like that,

99
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,735
she couldn't have survived a single day,

There must've been an error,

104
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,670
You remember,

105
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,206
The hospital computer was so old,,,

106
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,007
that it would break all the time,

107
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,177
The nurses struggled, always having to input,,,

108
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,679
the patients' information over and over,

109
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:47,283
It must've been inputted incorrectly back then,

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,962
I wouldn't be mistaken about that,

You were nagging before,

That was because I was upset,

129

Don't beat around the bush, I take after you,

Sure, a doctor, That would be nice,

Mr, Oh, when you stood in front of Heo,,,

173
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,696
and told him he'd get 10 years for the bribe,,,

174
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,999
along with getting disfranchised,

175
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,237
I felt so good,

176
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:00,643
You're flattering me,

177
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,647
I only told him we should do it by the law,

178
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,682
He should be flattering you,

179
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,785
It's thanks to you he got to unify everyone,

180
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,387
He'll be elected for sure,

181
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,522
Am I right, Mayor Cho?

182
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,426
I'll be serving you for the rest of my life,

183
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:20,162
Will I get to see such beauties all my life?

184
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,531
Of course!

185
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,037
You're just my style,

186

(Witch's Court)

188
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,213
- What? - Hey, Ahn Tae Kyoo,

189
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,448
Bottoms up,

190
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:57,219
Honey!

191
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,025
What a man! You're crazy,

192
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:05,094
You have something on you,

193
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,898
Is it a cut?

194
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,667
I'm sorry,

195
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,837
It's not like you got hit, Where did you get that?

196
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,806
I did get hit,

197
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,176
Really?

198
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,945
That's amazing,

199
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,916
Do someone like you get beat up too?

200
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,628
Are you that amazed?

201
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,700
It must be good to be so easily amused,

202
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,873
Come on, we're having fun, Don't mess it up,

203
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,374
Come on,

204
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,678
I'm just playing,

205
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,286
Are you done being amazed now?

206
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,655
Then smile a little,

207
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,657
Smile,

208
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,659
Go,

209
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,929
You smiled,

210
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,098
Happy?

211
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,399
Yes,

212
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,874
I enjoyed it so much,

213
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,576
- Yes, - It's nothing,

214
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,179
- I enjoyed it a lot, - I'm glad,

215
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,647
All right,

216
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,584
- Please invite me again, - I will,

217
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:37,353
Take care,

218
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:48,864
What's going on?

219
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,166
It's nothing,

220
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,605
Ma'am, please come down!

221
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,907
- Come down, - We'll help you!

222
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,076
What are you doing? Come down!

223
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,978
Be careful, it's dangerous!

224
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:05,514
She should come down,

225
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,082
I said, come down!

226
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,184
Please come down!

227

Cho Gap Soo! Bring Cho Gap Soo!

I,,,

229
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:18,027
I won't go down until he comes here!

230
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,462
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

231
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,931
Isn't that Prosecutor Ma Yi Deum?

232
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,633
What does she have to do with Cho Gap Soo?

233
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,969
Let's report it to the news desk first,

234
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,605
Call Cho Gap Soo right now!

235
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,507
Bring him here!

236
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:33,409
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

237
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,512
Cho Gap Soo!

238
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,747
Get down!

239
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,949
Please come down!

240
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:43,152
You have to get down!

241
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:44,987
Mr, Yeo,

242
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,424
Okay, I'll come right now,

243
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,465
What? Ma Yi Deum?

244
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:57,666
Yes,

245
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,035
I don't know what it's about,

246
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,805
but he's adamant about seeing you,

247
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,239
She'll jump if you don't show up,

248
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,709
She's been making a scene for two hours,

249
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,713
What does that have anything to do with me?

250
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,449
Are you telling me to pull her back in?

251
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:14,917
Sir,,,

252
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:19,455
You visited her at the hospital,

253
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:22,191
and she's even in your campaign video,

254
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,992
If something bad happens,

255
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,962
they'll draw you in,

256
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,597
I'm worried,

257
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,935
Before I go,

258
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,170
I should at least know what it's about,

259
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,506
I can't go there to have feces,,,

260
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,707
thrown at me,

261
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:39,708
I still think,,,

262
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,944
you should go,

263
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,923
Ms, Ma,

264
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,094
What is it?

265
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,296
Why are you putting yourself in danger?

266
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,931
You might get hurt,

267
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:06,235
Please come down so we can talk,

268
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,337
Okay,

269
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,010
Cho Gap Soo!

270
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,346
What did you do to my mom?

271
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:20,215
What did you do to Kwak Young Shil?

272
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,153
Ms, Ma,

273
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,088
Why are you,,,

274
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,323
asking me about your mother?

275
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,958
Then who should I ask?

276
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,960
In 1986,

277
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,796
you raped her during interrogation,

278
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,197
and in 1996,

279
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,967
you abducted her before she could report you,

280
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,602
The criminal is right in front of me,

281
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,612
Now that I know you're safe,

282
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,915
I'll be going,

283
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:06,895
What is this?

284
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,167
On the day my mom disappeared,

285
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,670
you were also at the same place,,,

286
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,904
my mom was,,,

287
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:18,674
last seen before she disappeared,

288
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:20,476
Is it a coincidence?

289
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,454
What are you trying to say,

290
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,356
Ms, Ma?

291
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,358
Isn't it spelled out for you?

292
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,694
That day,

293
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,763
my mom went to report to Ms, Min Ji Sook,

294
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,499
and you saw her,

295
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,767
You figured leaving her alone,,,

296
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,403
would ruin everything you did to get acquittal,

297
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,938
Of course you can't just watch,

298
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,074
That's why you kidnapped her,,,

299
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,742
and got rid of the evidence,

300
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,945
Shamelessly, you became a commissioner general,

301
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,947
and then a politician,

302
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,683
Now, you're eyeing to become a mayor!

303
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:04,786
Do you have evidence?

304
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,488
I'll find it soon,

305
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:24,873
Do you know why,,,

306
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:27,676
your mother disappeared?

307
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:31,113
Because she tried,,,

308
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,348
to reveal things,

309
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:35,984
If you don't want to turn out like her,

310
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:39,955
it'd be best to remain quiet,

311
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,423
Great,

312
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:44,126
This is the way you should act,

313
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,663
This makes me a reason to live,

314
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,567
I'll find the evidence soon,,,

315
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,602
and get a warrant to arrest you,

316
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,538
You can look forward to it, Cho Gap Soo,

317
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:11,653
What an exclusive,

318
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,721
Can she find the evidence?

319
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:15,357
Ms, Ma's mother's name is Kwak Young Shil?

320
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:16,491
Is that her mother?

321
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,628
We'll interview those around Cho Gap Soo first,

322
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,764
Where is Ms, Ma?

323
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,066
It's over,

324
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,401
She's safe, so don't worry,

325
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,575
I think the disappearance of Ms, Ma's mother,,,

326
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,777
has something to do with Cho Gap Soo,

327
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:36,778
(Cho Gap Soo Returns to Work After 12 Days,,,)

328
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,261
Anyway, I feel sorry about what happened,,,

329
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:55,163
to her mother,

330
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,397
Can you take me home?

331
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,928
You said you have something to say to me,,,

332
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,663
at the hospital, right?

333
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,439
I'll tell you later,

334
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,689
I'll give you exactly one hour,

335
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,158
No matter what you do, stop them!

336
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:34,062
If they mention kidnapping on the internet,

337
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,264
you will never set foot,,,

338
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,167
in Yeouido again,

339
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:40,836
Understand?

340
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:42,938
Yes,

341
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:48,477
Mr, Baek, where are you?

342
00:28:58,286 --> 00:28:59,654
I told you,,,

343
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,357
not to let Tae Kyoo come in here,

344
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,092
I'm sorry, sir,

345
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,761
Who did he come with?

346
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:07,763
Did he come alone?

347
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,306
Play it,

348
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,307
Okay,

349
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:37,926
(Min Ho)

350
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,063
The number you're calling is not available,

351
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:44,866
You'll be connected to voicemail after,,,

352
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,238
Hand me all CCTV footages,

353
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,908
Check if he was caught on any other cameras,

354
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:53,909
Yes, sir,

355
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,682
- Hey, - This is bad,

356
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,927
Where did you go?

357
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:13,595
I'm sorry,

358
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:15,797
Did popping champagne for a few days,,,

359
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,866
make you go soft?

360
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,136
I heard, What should I do about that prosecutor?

361
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,006
I suggest having Mr, Oh pressure,,,

362
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:29,277
If we're gentlemanly, she won't get it,

363
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,382
If she wants to throw turd in my face,

364
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:36,484
I will,,,

365
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,287
throw turd in hers,

366
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:41,423
I'll look into it,

367
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:15,624
(Ms, Min)

368
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,926
Hello, Ms, Min,

369
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:19,694
So?

370
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,164
Do you feel better after causing a ruckus?

371
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,902
I heard from the reporters about last night,

372
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,905
It was a personal matter,

373
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,407
You don't need to make excuses,

374
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,076
I understand how you felt and why you did it,

375
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:38,346
I'm sure you couldn't stop thinking about your mom,,,

376
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,447
after talking with me,

377
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,584
It was obvious Cho Gap Soo would play dumb,

378
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,487
I'm sure you wanted to throw the reporters bait,

379
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,123
and find out where your mom was,

380
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,927
But sorry,

381
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,138
Some got the hidden camera videos of you,,,

382
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:04,506
from Kim Sang Gyoon's case,

383
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:07,175
They didn't upload the entire video,

384
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,177
but just a few screen shots,

385
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,179
to make you trending online,

386
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,348
It's obvious who's behind it,

387
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:16,851
I feel terrible,,,

388
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,487
about your mother too,

389
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:21,856
But Ms, Ma,

390
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,759
Cho Gap Soo won't be caught that easily,

391
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,227
You need to be rational,

392
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,596
You can take a few days off if you need,

393
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,365
No,

394
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,567
I'll go work,

395
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,748
That makes no sense,

396
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:48,984
How could you print that?

397
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,386
This is a violation of human rights,,,

398
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,454
and defamation,

399
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,422
- Take it down now, - Sir, Sir?

400
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,524
Even the president is concerned,,,

401
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,326
with digital sexual crimes,

402
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,796
How could you write an article like this?

403
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,567
Yes, Please delete it,

404
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:06,768
Thank you,

405
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,472
Thank you for your help,

406
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,008
Not at all,

407
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:15,577
This is all for the CAGU family,

408
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:18,446
Mr, Koo,

409
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:21,116
Yes?

410
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:27,856
What is all of this?

411
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:32,027
I was thankful and felt bad for last time,

412
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:35,430
You must miss home cooking since you live alone,

413
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:37,899
I showed off my skills a little,

414
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,935
- You made all of this? - Yes,

415
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,505
It isn't much, Please eat,

416
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:48,276
But I don't know if I deserve this,

417
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:49,844
Well,,,

418
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,814
Okay, Thank you, Ms, Son,

419
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:54,616
Thank you,

420
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,284
What should I eat first?

421
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,487
Are we having a feast or something?

422
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,824
Look how pretty the food looks,

423
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:04,726
It looks like banquet food,

424
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,596
I packed a lunch,

425
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,032
You haven't eaten yet?

426
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,867
I wish you could join us, but I made two servings,,,

427
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,202
Can we join you?

428
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:16,604
- We'd love to, - Here,

429
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:18,406
It's two servings,

430
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,742
I haven't had home cooking in ages,

431
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:24,045
I get home too late to even cook for myself,

432
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:27,182
- Thank you, Ms, Son, - Sure,

433
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:30,485
- Mr, Koo, Please eat, - Sure,

434
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,887
Ms, Seo, Eat up,

435
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,722
Eat up,

436
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,425
- You too, Ms, Son, - It's so yum,

437
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,828
- This is incredible, - Try this,

438
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,629
Kong Soo Ah is missing,

439
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,201
What happened?

440
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:49,037
This is her call record for yesterday and today,

441
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,506
The highlighted number is Eel's burner phone,

442
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,577
It looks like she went out after getting his call,

443
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,746
She couldn't have,,,

444
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,552
(Call, or your granny will be in danger,)

445
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:08,323
So she disappeared after the trafficking,

446
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,058
Yes, We couldn't find,,,

447
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,427
any communication thereafter,

448
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:13,795
Anywhere she could've gone?

449
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,997
Her grandmother and friends,,,

450
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,266
have no idea where she is either,

451
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,969
So there's no way of locating her?

452
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,571
That's why I called you,

453
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,243
There's someone she called at the end,

454
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:29,477
(Domestic call)

455
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:44,025
(Ma Yi Deum)

456
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,818
Yi Deum, please help me,

457
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:12,687
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel, K,,,

458
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,525
Bring me Cho Gap Soo!

459
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,160
Cho Gap Soo!

460
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,930
I won't go down until he comes here!

461
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,466
Ms, Ma,

462
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:31,072
Yi Deum, please help me,

463
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,074
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel, K,,,

464
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:35,843
Hyungjae Hotel?

465
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:47,755
There is no room with K in the name,

466
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:50,525
Did you check that right? Check again,

467
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,860
Are you sure it's our hotel?

468
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,596
There must be a mistake,

469
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:58,433
We tracked her cell phone, and it was Hyungjae Hotel,

470
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,435
I'm sorry I can't be of assistance,

471
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,737
Then may we check the security videos?

472
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,974
We need to check from 7pm to this morning,

473
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:07,275
I'm sorry,

474
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:11,512
It violates our clients' privacy,

475
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,881
We're looking for someone, Please,

476
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:17,485
There's nothing else I can assist you with,

477
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:19,487
- My apologies, - Look,

478
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,257
Something may have happened to a kid,

479
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:23,358
I'm sorry, but,,,

480
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,261
we have our situation as well,

481
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:28,630
Are you kidding me? What situation?

482
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,032
A person's life is at stake, but you won't help?

483
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:32,367
Bring a warrant,

484
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:35,036
Then we'll cooperate,

485
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:37,005
We will, so wait,

486
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,706
If anything is missing or destroyed,

487
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:39,974
you'll be accountable,

488
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,076
I'll add on your refusal to cooperate,,,

489
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,611
and hold you legally accountable,

490
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,912
Got that?

491
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:46,648
Let's go,

492
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:50,785
Do you know how important the situation is?

493
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,363
What?

494
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,466
He always gets out of any trap we set,

495
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,105
- I have a question, - Yes?

496
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:12,607
Last night,,,

497
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:18,012
What's that?

498
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:26,054
That's him, right? Eel!

499
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,422
Get over here!

500
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,530
Eel,

501
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,435
Who are you?

502
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,337
Darn it,

503
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:43,971
Stop chasing me,

504
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,448
You're dead!

505
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,552
I'm a prosecutor, Sorry,

506
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,454
Excuse me,

507
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,258
Manual? I can't do it,

508
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,160
Okay,

509
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,497
Wait, Hold on, Prosecutor, Sorry,

510
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,068
Let's take a break!

511
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,973
Stop, Mr, Eel!

512
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:21,976
Mr, Eel, I need to talk to you, Hold on,

513
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,245
You must be tired,

514
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:30,818
Mr, Koo!

515
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,555
Sorry, Go, Go already,

516
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,858
Leave,,, Leave me, Go!

517
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:40,495
You can do it! Go!

518
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:42,597
Bicycle,

519
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,637
Stop coming! Darn it,

520
00:39:57,345 --> 00:39:58,513
Hold on,

521
00:39:58,513 --> 00:39:59,514
Where's Soo Ah?

522
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:00,882
Who are you?

523
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:02,116
Where's Kong Soo Ah?

524
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,552
- Hold on, - Seriously,

525
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,262
Did you get him?

526
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,297
Yes,

527
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:20,134
The phone has been turned off,

528
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,335
Please leave,,,,

529
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,307
(Heo Yoon Kyung)

530
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,846
Did Min Ho come to work?

531
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:33,915
As you can see,

532
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:36,417
Okay,

533
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,786
He said he was going to the kingdom yesterday,

534
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:40,588
You should check there,

535
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,026
Please watch what you say,

536
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,431
Did you forget,,,

537
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,266
that the 100,000 dollars,,,

538
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:54,635
incorporated confidentiality?

539
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,005
Of course, I know that,

540
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:00,241
I just wondered,,,

541
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:02,376
if I could help like last time,

542
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,451
(Min Ho)

543
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,802
No,

544
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:29,637
No,

545
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,707
No,

546
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:34,475
No,

547
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:39,747
No,

548
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,284
(Uninstall)

549
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,285
No,

550
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:46,053
No,

551
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,157
No,

552
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,262
Hey, hey, Wake up,

553
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,035
Hey,

554
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:02,737
Tae Kyoo,

555
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:08,242
Hey, If you were drunk, you should've gone home,

556
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,477
Why did you drive?

557
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:10,945
Will we,,,

558
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,281
be okay?

559
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,050
It was too dark last night,,,

560
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,218
It was dark,

561
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:19,220
So where did you drive my car in the dark?

562
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:21,055
You dragged me here with you too,

563
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,490
If there's a single scratch,

564
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,658
you're dead,

565
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:25,760
Hey,

566
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:27,361
Don't you,,,

567
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:28,896
remember?

568
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:34,702
- Last night, we,,, - "We"?

569
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,471
You and I aren't on par to be lumped together,

570
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,408
Don't you agree?

571
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,244
Just because I partied with you,

572
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:45,947
you think you're on my level,

573
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:48,816
Yes, but,,,

574
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,287
Last night, what you and I did,,,

575
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:54,555
What about last night?

576
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:57,992
Other than you,,,

577
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,661
drinking expensive drinks thanks to me, what?

578
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:02,897
What else?

579
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,165
Hey,

580
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:07,301
- Ahn Tae Kyoo, - Seriously,

581
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:09,537
Chicks or dudes,

582
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:12,607
Those without money are all the same,

583
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,176
If you're good to them,

584
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,011
they think they're special and get annoying,

585
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:18,746
What?

586
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,992
Hey, Get out,

587
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:36,130
What are you doing? Get out, you rat,

588
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:03,457
Hi, Sang Ho,

589
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:05,760
It's me,

590
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:11,265
She took off with my precious money,

591
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:12,566
That witch,

592
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,535
You had a sick minor,,,

593
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:17,672
do that just to make a few bucks?

594
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:18,706
"Just"?

595
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,342
"Just"?

596
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,445
It was one large,

597
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,615
And to be honest, Soo Ah was the one,,,

598
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:29,884
who got excited when I mentioned money,

599
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:33,721
- What? - That wench,,,

600
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:35,056
was blinded by greed,,,

601
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,557
and took off with the money,

602
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,759
Hold on, Isn't this,,,

603
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,295
embezzlement or something?

604
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,097
Look,

605
00:44:43,864 --> 00:44:45,866
How could so much money,,,

606
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:49,036
exchange hands for a sex trafficking done via chat?

607
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,073
How could you trust him enough to send her there?

608
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:56,177
I sent her after making sure he checked out,

609
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:57,511
She's my ace,

610
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,513
I wouldn't have sent her just anywhere,

611
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:02,383
I see, You checked him out,

612
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,287
That means you have the client's information,

613
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:08,355
Come on,

614
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,257
What information do you have?

615
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,627
If I tell you,

616
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,363
what will you do for me?

617
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,201
You seem to be confused,

618
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:21,469
I mean,

619
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,137
I should gain something,,,

620
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,840
to give you information or something,

621
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,241
Look,

622
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:29,610
All of this is being recorded,

623
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,680
Everything you say, Your attitude,

624
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,516
They may be held against you later,

625
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,284
Are you threatening me?

626
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,957
You don't know how to make deals,

627
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,726
You should be begging me right now,

628
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:47,661
Aren't you going to find Soo Ah?

629
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,396
Wait,

630
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:50,931
Look, sir,

631
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,536
I'll drop the charge for,,,

632
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:58,906
sex trafficking of a minor,

633
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,646
This is being recorded, right? Clearly?

634
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:06,781
Clearly,

635
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,617
Finding Soo Ah is more important,

636
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:12,153
We need to save a life,

637
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:14,355
Gosh, Soo Ah, Okay,

638
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:17,324
We have to save Soo Ah,

639
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:19,493
Here,

640
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:25,132
This psycho sent me his ID,

641
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:28,936
And he said Hyungjae Hotel was his,

642
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,739
Doesn't it seem like there's something huge?

643
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:35,743
Okay, That was clear, Now get me out,

644
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:37,111
Clearly,

645
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:40,014
Your cell phone will be taken as evidence,

646
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:42,716
And if anything happened to Soo Ah,

647
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,186
I'll tack on aiding and abetting to your charges,

648
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:47,054
Shut your trap and wait,

649
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:51,826
Wait, Hold on, It was all recorded,,,

650
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:53,260
Hey!

651
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:57,531
This is why no one trusts people in law!

652
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:59,366
Don't delete this recording!

653
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:00,935
I'll check it all!

654
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:02,703
I'll check all of it!

655
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:04,972
Did you check Baek Min Ho's identity?

656
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,341
Yes, No sign of forgery,

657
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,909
and I confirmed his identity,

658
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,345
I texted you his current address,

659
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:12,346
Okay,

660
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,700
Baek Min Ho,

661
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,577
Baek Min Ho,

662
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,245
You're inside, right? We're prosecutors,

663
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,281
Baek Min Ho?

664
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,655
Baek Min Ho,

665
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:35,029
Baek Min Ho,

666
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:37,364
You're inside, right? We're prosecutors,

667
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:39,466
Baek Min Ho?

668
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:44,738
Hey,

669
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:46,473
Hey,

670
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:48,676
What are you doing?

671
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,744
You are trespassing,

672
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,048
A high school girl went missing last night,

673
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:56,183
Your cooperation will be appreciated,

674
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,719
Missing?

675
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,722
You know her, right?

676
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,862
I don't know,

677
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,864
You saw her last night,

678
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,266
But you don't know her?

679
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:15,636
I don't think so,

680
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,075
(My big bro)

681
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:25,145
You chatted with her around 8pm last night,,,

682
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:26,380
and checked her photo,

683
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,716
Then you promised to meet an hour later,

684
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,552
I said I don't know,

685
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:33,954
What about this?

686
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:38,993
You even sent your ID via chat,

687
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,161
How could you not know?

688
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:43,630
You met Kong Soo Ah, didn't you?

689
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,205
Why don't you take that?

690
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:08,589
Did you find her?

691
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:11,925
Not yet,

692
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:14,661
Min Ho,

693
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,364
Do you remember anything other than,,,

694
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,366
that it was in the woods?

695
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,302
Hey, Prosecutors,,,

696
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,205
are here right now,

697
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:29,243
You must find her first,

698
00:50:29,877 --> 00:50:30,944
No matter what,

699
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,782
What?

700
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:26,700
(Danger: Fall Risk)

701
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:48,815
Where were you between 8pm and 2am last night,

702
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:50,517
and what were you doing?

703
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,088
I was at my law office,

704
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,925
You were working until that late?

705
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,994
Yes, I focus better when it's quiet,

706
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:08,202
You can go and check what time I left,

707
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:09,703
Which law firm?

708
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,739
Hyungjae in Gangnam,

709
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:20,948
Happy now?

710
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:23,016
Goodbye,

711
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:25,786
I said to leave,

712
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,569
Yes, I focus better when it's quiet,

713
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,205
Hyungjae in Gangnam,

714
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:46,607
Cho Gap Soo!

715
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:48,575
Bring me Cho Gap Soo!

716
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:50,277
Bring Cho Gap Soo!

717
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:52,746
Hyungjae's office was quite?

718
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:55,882
Although I created that ruckus last night?

719
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:05,659
- Yes? - We found Kong Soo Ah,

720
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:31,111
This was found next to her body,

721
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:36,550
(Baek Min Ho)

722
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,661
Gap Soo,

723
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:50,964
Please,,,

724
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,334
save Min Ho,

725
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:45,685
(Witch's Court)
