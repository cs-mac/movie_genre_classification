00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:01,149
<font color=#0080FF>Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.</font>

3
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,569
<font color=#0080FF>This is my cab.</font>

4
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,988
<font color=#0080FF>I was here first!</font>

5
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,741
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, God.</font>

6
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,253
<font color=#0080FF>Let's go across. Come on.</font>

7
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,591
<font color=#0080FF>We'll get one down the road. Hurry.</font>

8
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,684
<font color=#0080FF>For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?</font>

9
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,687
<font color=#0080FF>I'm trying to get a... Taxi!</font>

10
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,940
<font color=#0080FF>We're going the wrong way!</font>

11
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,946
<font color=#0080FF>Put that away. We look like tourists.</font>

12
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:40,949
<font color=#0080FF>Let's cut over to Seventh.</font>

13
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:44,245
<font color=#0080FF>- Seventh is <i>that</i> way.
- I know where we are!</font>

14
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,065
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, give me a dollar.</font>

15
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,111
<font color=#0080FF>How about it? One dollar.</font>

16
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,282
<font color=#0080FF>Are you deaf? You don't speak English?</font>

17
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:15,451
<font color=#0080FF>Come on! Up here.</font>

18
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,624
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, lady...</font>

19
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,252
<font color=#0080FF>...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.</font>

20
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,155
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, all right!</font>

21
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,491
<font color=#0080FF>American Express card.</font>

22
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,952
<font color=#0080FF>"Don't leave home without it."</font>

23
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,456
<font color=#0080FF>Get out of here.</font>

24
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,670
<font color=#0080FF>I don't like it up here.</font>

25
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,673
<font color=#0080FF>Are you scared of heights?</font>

26
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,512
<font color=#0080FF>I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs...</font>

27
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,017
<font color=#0080FF>Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.</font>

28
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,230
<font color=#0080FF>That ain't what I heard at all.</font>

29
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,943
<font color=#0080FF>I heard that the Bat got him.</font>

30
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:18,029
<font color=#0080FF>The Bat? Give me a break, will you?</font>

31
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:22,034
<font color=#0080FF>Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.</font>

32
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:25,705
<font color=#0080FF>No shit. It was all over the pavement.</font>

33
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:32,339
<font color=#0080FF>- I'm getting out of here.
- Shut up. Listen to me.</font>

34
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,884
<font color=#0080FF>There ain't no Bat.</font>

35
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:39,515
<font color=#0080FF>You shouldn't have turned the gun on that kid.</font>

36
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:44,563
<font color=#0080FF>You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! <i>Shut up!</i></font>

37
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,120
<font color=#0080FF>Don't kill me!</font>

38
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,538
<font color=#0080FF>Don't kill me!</font>

39
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,042
<font color=#0080FF>Don't kill me! Don't kill me!</font>

40
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:37,129
<font color=#0080FF>I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.</font>

41
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,048
<font color=#0080FF>Tell all your friends about me.</font>

42
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,383
<font color=#0080FF>What are you?</font>

43
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,053
<font color=#0080FF>I'm Batman.</font>

44
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:05,748
<font color=#0080FF>Across this nation...</font>

45
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:09,920
<font color=#0080FF>...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.</font>

46
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:14,259
<font color=#0080FF>Our streets are overrun,
our public officials are helpless.</font>

47
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:18,430
<font color=#0080FF>As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...</font>

48
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,684
<font color=#0080FF>...Boss Carl Grissom.</font>

49
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:24,355
<font color=#0080FF>Now, our new District Attorney, Harvey Dent...</font>

50
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:27,359
<font color=#0080FF>...will carry out that promise.</font>

51
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,954
<font color=#0080FF>Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.</font>

52
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,208
<font color=#0080FF>People of Gotham City...</font>

53
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,212
<font color=#0080FF>...I'm a man of few words.</font>

54
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,885
<font color=#0080FF>But those words will count,
and so will my actions.</font>

55
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,640
<font color=#0080FF>Commissioner Gordon informs me
that he has targeted those businesses...</font>

56
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:56,228
<font color=#0080FF><i>... suspected of fronting for</i>
<i>the syndicate in this city.</i></font>

57
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,691
<font color=#0080FF><i>Before this week is out...</i></font>

58
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:03,070
<font color=#0080FF><i>... we are going to knock down their doors...</i></font>

59
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:07,743
<font color=#0080FF><i>... and shed the light of the law</i>
<i>on that nest of vipers.</i></font>

60
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:14,835
<font color=#0080FF><i>Together, we can make this</i>
<i>city safe for decent people.</i></font>

61
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,342
<font color=#0080FF>Decent people shouldn't live here.</font>

62
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,221
<font color=#0080FF>They'd be happier someplace else.</font>

63
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,058
<font color=#0080FF>Pretty tough talk about Carl.</font>

64
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,393
<font color=#0080FF>Forget about it.</font>

65
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:33,692
<font color=#0080FF>If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.</font>

66
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,072
<font color=#0080FF>If Grissom knew about us...</font>

67
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,908
<font color=#0080FF>...he might hand you something.</font>

68
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,371
<font color=#0080FF>Don't flatter yourself, angel.</font>

69
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:48,378
<font color=#0080FF>He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.</font>

70
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:51,924
<font color=#0080FF>And besides...</font>

71
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,929
<font color=#0080FF>...he doesn't know.</font>

72
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:02,061
<font color=#0080FF>You don't worry about anything, do you, Jack?</font>

73
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,078
<font color=#0080FF>You look fine.</font>

74
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,958
<font color=#0080FF>I didn't ask.</font>

75
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,970
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah. Hanging on.</font>

76
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,984
<font color=#0080FF>Let me guess.</font>

77
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:44,740
<font color=#0080FF>Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.</font>

78
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,744
<font color=#0080FF>That's it. What are they seeing up there?</font>

79
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,997
<font color=#0080FF>They're drinking Drano.</font>

80
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,415
<font color=#0080FF>It's weird.</font>

81
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,167
<font color=#0080FF>Thanks for the tip.</font>

82
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,504
<font color=#0080FF>Christ. Knox.</font>

83
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:59,842
<font color=#0080FF>Lieutenant, I hear we had another Bat attack.</font>

84
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:04,932
<font color=#0080FF>That's eight sightings in a month.
I hear the Commissioner's opened a file.</font>

85
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:08,853
<font color=#0080FF>Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.</font>

86
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,858
<font color=#0080FF>I'm telling you, a giant bat!</font>

87
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,869
<font color=#0080FF>Don't write about this.
It will ruin your already useless reputation.</font>

88
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,456
<font color=#0080FF>Lieutenant, every punk in this town is scared.</font>

89
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,460
<font color=#0080FF>They say he can't be killed.</font>

90
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,713
<font color=#0080FF>They say he drinks blood.</font>

91
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,134
<font color=#0080FF>I say you're full of shit, Knox.</font>

92
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,391
<font color=#0080FF>You can quote me on that.</font>

93
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:42,312
<font color=#0080FF>Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City?</font>

94
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:44,732
<font color=#0080FF>Is he on the police payroll?</font>

95
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:47,735
<font color=#0080FF>What's he pulling down, after taxes?</font>

96
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:19,276
<font color=#0080FF>Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.</font>

97
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:24,157
<font color=#0080FF>- Why don't you broadcast it?
- Shut up and listen.</font>

98
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:29,330
<font color=#0080FF>Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.</font>

99
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,960
<font color=#0080FF>That's my territory.
If there's a problem, <i>I</i> deal with it.</font>

100
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,631
<font color=#0080FF>Your problems are our problems.</font>

101
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:41,511
<font color=#0080FF>I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.</font>

102
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,016
<font color=#0080FF>You ought to think about the future.</font>

103
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,854
<font color=#0080FF>You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.</font>

104
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:53,652
<font color=#0080FF>You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.</font>

105
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,119
<font color=#0080FF>Better be sure.</font>

106
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:07,878
<font color=#0080FF>See?</font>

107
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,675
<font color=#0080FF>You can make a good decision when you try.</font>

108
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:22,230
<font color=#0080FF>Where've you been spending your nights?</font>

109
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:31,241
<font color=#0080FF>I don't care if this festival is in debt,
I want a parade.</font>

110
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,744
<font color=#0080FF>I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.</font>

111
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:37,666
<font color=#0080FF>We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.</font>

112
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,918
<font color=#0080FF>We may celebrate in bankruptcy court.</font>

113
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:43,339
<font color=#0080FF>It's $250,000 in debt and we
haven't seen one balloon.</font>

114
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,177
<font color=#0080FF>You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.</font>

115
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,098
<font color=#0080FF>A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.</font>

116
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,436
<font color=#0080FF>They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.</font>

117
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,939
<font color=#0080FF>I promised that, remember?</font>

118
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,195
<font color=#0080FF>Welcome, Count Dracula.</font>

119
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,033
<font color=#0080FF>Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?</font>

120
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,369
<font color=#0080FF>- They buried your story on Batman.
- They bury garbage.</font>

121
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,373
<font color=#0080FF>This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.</font>

122
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,710
<font color=#0080FF>I got something for you.</font>

123
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:19,344
<font color=#0080FF>Very funny. You should have
put more gore under the fangs.</font>

124
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:21,721
<font color=#0080FF>What a dick.</font>

125
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,060
<font color=#0080FF>Hello, legs.</font>

126
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,315
<font color=#0080FF>I'm reading your stuff.</font>

127
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,234
<font color=#0080FF>Well, I'm reading yours.</font>

128
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:34,655
<font color=#0080FF>Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.</font>

129
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,824
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.</font>

130
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:41,245
<font color=#0080FF>If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.</font>

131
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,166
<font color=#0080FF>Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.</font>

132
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,421
<font color=#0080FF>You could get hurt doing this stuff.</font>

133
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:50,591
<font color=#0080FF>What brings you here?</font>

134
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,761
<font color=#0080FF>I'm here to see the wildlife in Gotham City.</font>

135
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,515
<font color=#0080FF>Wildlife? Like what?</font>

136
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,852
<font color=#0080FF>Like... bats.</font>

137
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,358
<font color=#0080FF>- Who sent you?
- Nobody, really.</font>

138
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,778
<font color=#0080FF>I just loved your story, and...</font>

139
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,699
<font color=#0080FF>...I like bats.</font>

140
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,789
<font color=#0080FF>My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.</font>

141
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,752
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, you're a visionary,
and also the only one who believes me.</font>

142
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,672
<font color=#0080FF>I need something tangible.</font>

143
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:25,010
<font color=#0080FF>Gordon's got a file.
I can't even get him on the phone.</font>

144
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:27,804
<font color=#0080FF>He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit, right?</font>

145
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:31,225
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.
No.</font>

146
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,899
<font color=#0080FF>Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?</font>

147
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,235
<font color=#0080FF>- No.
- Buy me lunch?</font>

148
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,989
<font color=#0080FF>- Maybe.
- I eat light.</font>

149
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,458
<font color=#0080FF>Say this...</font>

150
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,586
<font color=#0080FF>...son of a bitch...</font>

151
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,257
<font color=#0080FF>...makes a connection with
us <i>and</i> with Axis Chemicals.</font>

152
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,843
<font color=#0080FF>What kind of damage are we looking at?</font>

153
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,348
<font color=#0080FF>If he ties us with Axis Chemicals,
we're dead and buried.</font>

154
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,893
<font color=#0080FF>We should move immediately.</font>

155
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:08,022
<font color=#0080FF>I say we break into the place...</font>

156
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,024
<font color=#0080FF>...trash the office...</font>

157
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:14,738
<font color=#0080FF>...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.</font>

158
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,537
<font color=#0080FF>Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...</font>

159
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:24,084
<font color=#0080FF>...I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.</font>

160
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:27,213
<font color=#0080FF>Me?</font>

161
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:38,059
<font color=#0080FF>Would you mind waiting in the next room?</font>

162
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,912
<font color=#0080FF>That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.</font>

163
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,100
<font color=#0080FF>Can somebody else do this?</font>

164
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:13,646
<font color=#0080FF>The fumes in that place...</font>

165
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,279
<font color=#0080FF>It's an important job. I need...</font>

166
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,615
<font color=#0080FF>...someone I can trust.</font>

167
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,454
<font color=#0080FF>You... are my number one guy.</font>

168
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:30,292
<font color=#0080FF>Now...</font>

169
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,296
<font color=#0080FF>...don't forget...</font>

170
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,468
<font color=#0080FF>...your lucky deck.</font>

171
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,442
<font color=#0080FF>My friend...</font>

172
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:53,946
<font color=#0080FF>...your luck is about to change.</font>

173
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,370
<font color=#0080FF><i>Police Department.</i></font>

174
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:02,040
<font color=#0080FF>Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.</font>

175
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:45,970
<font color=#0080FF>Can I help you, sir?</font>

176
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,660
<font color=#0080FF>- Good evening.
- A little crowded.</font>

177
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:18,053
<font color=#0080FF>Could you tell me who is Bruce Wayne?</font>

178
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,597
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not sure.</font>

179
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,725
<font color=#0080FF>Thanks anyway.</font>

180
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:59,646
<font color=#0080FF>Eight. I can make that eight.</font>

181
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:01,982
<font color=#0080FF>I can make that eight.</font>

182
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,153
<font color=#0080FF>Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.</font>

183
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:08,658
<font color=#0080FF>Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?</font>

184
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:12,913
<font color=#0080FF>There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.</font>

185
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,499
<font color=#0080FF>Be straight with me, Commissioner.</font>

186
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,335
<font color=#0080FF>How're you making out?</font>

187
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:19,672
<font color=#0080FF>Mr. Dent, I love that tie.</font>

188
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,427
<font color=#0080FF>We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?</font>

189
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:26,179
<font color=#0080FF>We have enough problems in this city...</font>

190
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,933
<font color=#0080FF>...without worrying about ghosts.</font>

191
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,687
<font color=#0080FF>Pardon me, but that's not a denial.</font>

192
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,608
<font color=#0080FF>Excuse me, I'll be back.</font>

193
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,694
<font color=#0080FF>Won't anybody go on record?</font>

194
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,781
<font color=#0080FF>- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.</font>

195
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,702
<font color=#0080FF>What's up?</font>

196
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,956
<font color=#0080FF>Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.</font>

197
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,052
<font color=#0080FF>Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?</font>

198
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:59,638
<font color=#0080FF>- Eckhardt.
- Oh, my God!</font>

199
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,307
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, let's go.</font>

200
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:07,648
<font color=#0080FF>Mr. Gordon?</font>

201
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,866
<font color=#0080FF>Mr. Gordon?</font>

202
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:27,340
<font color=#0080FF>Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.</font>

203
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:29,718
<font color=#0080FF>Look at this stuff.</font>

204
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:32,054
<font color=#0080FF>Who is this guy?</font>

205
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:37,061
<font color=#0080FF>He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.</font>

206
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:41,024
<font color=#0080FF>He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.</font>

207
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,069
<font color=#0080FF>Don't leave out his very large bankroll.</font>

208
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,240
<font color=#0080FF>The more they've got, the less they're worth.</font>

209
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:50,911
<font color=#0080FF>This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.</font>

210
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:55,875
<font color=#0080FF>Check this out. He must have been
the King of the Wicker People.</font>

211
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,213
<font color=#0080FF>Where'd this come from?</font>

212
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,216
<font color=#0080FF>I have no idea.</font>

213
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,220
<font color=#0080FF>It's Japanese.</font>

214
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,930
<font color=#0080FF>How do you know?</font>

215
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,600
<font color=#0080FF>I bought it in Japan.</font>

216
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,272
<font color=#0080FF>- Who are you?
- Sorry. Bruce Wayne.</font>

217
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,358
<font color=#0080FF>Alexander Knox.</font>

218
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,113
<font color=#0080FF>I read your work. I like it a lot.</font>

219
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,324
<font color=#0080FF>Thanks. Can I have a grant?</font>

220
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,619
<font color=#0080FF>Vicki Vale.</font>

221
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:26,247
<font color=#0080FF>Bruce Wayne.</font>

222
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,833
<font color=#0080FF>Are you sure?</font>

223
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,796
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't I?</font>

224
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:35,593
<font color=#0080FF>You've got a wonderful eye.</font>

225
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,803
<font color=#0080FF>Some people think she has two.</font>

226
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,933
<font color=#0080FF>This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.</font>

227
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,813
<font color=#0080FF>We need more champagne.
Is that all right?</font>

228
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:47,816
<font color=#0080FF>Sure. Go ahead.</font>

229
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:51,571
<font color=#0080FF>How many cases? Six? Six?</font>

230
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,239
<font color=#0080FF>Six is good.</font>

231
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,081
<font color=#0080FF>Will you be in Gotham for a while?</font>

232
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:03,836
<font color=#0080FF>I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's "giant bat" stories.</font>

233
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:06,590
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, right. The bat... Batman.</font>

234
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,846
<font color=#0080FF>A bit light after the war in Corto Maltese, no?</font>

235
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,433
<font color=#0080FF>What do you do for a living?</font>

236
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,355
<font color=#0080FF>Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave.</font>

237
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,110
<font color=#0080FF>Very unexpectedly, sir.</font>

238
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:25,405
<font color=#0080FF>Will you two excuse me?</font>

239
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:28,283
<font color=#0080FF>I think perhaps this way, sir.</font>

240
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:33,707
<font color=#0080FF>They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.</font>

241
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:37,796
<font color=#0080FF>And give Knox a grant.</font>

242
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,429
<font color=#0080FF>Nice talking with you, Wayne.</font>

243
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,056
<font color=#0080FF>The rich...</font>

244
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:49,561
<font color=#0080FF>Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.</font>

245
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,479
<font color=#0080FF>Look at this mirror.</font>

246
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,566
<font color=#0080FF>Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.</font>

247
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:35,117
<font color=#0080FF>- What's up?
- Anonymous tip.</font>

248
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,704
<font color=#0080FF>Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.</font>

249
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:41,042
<font color=#0080FF>If we could get him, we'd have Grissom.</font>

- Oh, my God!</font>

252
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,135
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, let's go.</font>

253
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:06,241
<font color=#0080FF>Get a good look.</font>

254
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:09,911
<font color=#0080FF>Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?</font>

255
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:13,165
<font color=#0080FF>Let's move out.</font>

256
00:24:46,374 --> 00:24:48,710
<font color=#0080FF>We've been ratted out, boys.</font>

257
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,045
<font color=#0080FF>Watch it.</font>

258
00:24:56,386 --> 00:24:57,555
<font color=#0080FF>Freeze!</font>

259
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,914
<font color=#0080FF>You take the right. Move it.</font>

260
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:20,709
<font color=#0080FF>What the hell's going on?</font>

261
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:25,173
<font color=#0080FF>- What are you trying to do?
- I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.</font>

262
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:30,679
<font color=#0080FF><i>This is Commissioner Gordon.</i>
<i>I want him taken alive.</i></font>

263
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,686
<font color=#0080FF><i>I repeat. Any man who opens fire</i>
<i>on Jack Napier will answer to me.</i></font>

264
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:24,998
<font color=#0080FF>Let me down!</font>

265
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,501
<font color=#0080FF>Let me down!</font>

266
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,089
<font color=#0080FF>Let me down!</font>

267
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,051
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God!</font>

268
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,599
<font color=#0080FF>Get up on the catwalk, on that side.</font>

269
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:48,311
<font color=#0080FF>You take that side. Be very careful.</font>

270
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,540
<font color=#0080FF>Jesus!</font>

271
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,754
<font color=#0080FF>Let him go... or I'll do Gordon.</font>

272
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:23,230
<font color=#0080FF>Nice outfit.</font>

273
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:38,124
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, Jack, let's go!</font>

274
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,301
<font color=#0080FF>Come on!</font>

275
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,138
<font color=#0080FF>Eckhardt!</font>

276
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:53,352
<font color=#0080FF>Think about the future.</font>

277
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:39,117
<font color=#0080FF>Goddamn it, we had him!</font>

278
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,954
<font color=#0080FF>Hold it right there!</font>

279
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,558
<font color=#0080FF>- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.</font>

280
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:03,231
<font color=#0080FF>Until we find out, keep a lid on it.</font>

281
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:30,432
<font color=#0080FF>If there's no Bat,
then who dropped Napier into the acid?</font>

282
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:33,937
<font color=#0080FF>Suicide? I want to get this on tape.</font>

283
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:38,651
<font color=#0080FF>He hung up. What have you got?</font>

284
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:40,611
<font color=#0080FF>Here's the inner city.</font>

285
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:42,697
<font color=#0080FF>Here's the sightings so far.</font>

286
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:46,619
<font color=#0080FF>Maybe Batman has some sort of flight pattern.</font>

287
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:51,124
<font color=#0080FF>This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.</font>

288
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,962
<font color=#0080FF>No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.</font>

289
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,297
<font color=#0080FF>Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!</font>

290
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:59,301
<font color=#0080FF>The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.</font>

291
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,805
<font color=#0080FF>Thanks for being so concerned.</font>

292
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,325
<font color=#0080FF>How's the soup?</font>

293
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,329
<font color=#0080FF>Excuse me?</font>

294
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,042
<font color=#0080FF>The soup. How is it?</font>

295
00:31:26,002 --> 00:31:27,837
<font color=#0080FF>It's great.</font>

296
00:31:33,052 --> 00:31:34,762
<font color=#0080FF>Could you pass the salt?</font>

297
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,291
<font color=#0080FF>Did you have trouble finding the house?</font>

298
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,087
<font color=#0080FF>- It was no problem.
- Good.</font>

299
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,846
<font color=#0080FF>Do you like eating in here?</font>

300
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,777
<font color=#0080FF>I don't think I've been in this room before.</font>

301
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,199
<font color=#0080FF>You want to leave?</font>

302
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:24,700
<font color=#0080FF>Yes.</font>

303
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,047
<font color=#0080FF>There was young Master Bruce...</font>

304
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:38,301
<font color=#0080FF>...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...</font>

305
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:43,140
<font color=#0080FF>...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.</font>

306
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:48,230
<font color=#0080FF>That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.</font>

307
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:52,402
<font color=#0080FF>I think I've embarrassed him for long enough.</font>

308
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,905
<font color=#0080FF>I'm off to bed.</font>

309
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,827
<font color=#0080FF>Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.</font>

310
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:12,176
<font color=#0080FF>He's really wonderful. He loves you a lot.</font>

311
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:16,265
<font color=#0080FF>Alfred's great.
I couldn't find my socks without him.</font>

312
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:19,853
<font color=#0080FF>He reminds me of my grandfather.</font>

313
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,732
<font color=#0080FF>Were you close to him?</font>

314
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:25,944
<font color=#0080FF>I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.</font>

315
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:30,700
<font color=#0080FF>They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...</font>

316
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,870
<font color=#0080FF>...it was fun.</font>

317
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:35,205
<font color=#0080FF>That sounds nice.</font>

318
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,628
<font color=#0080FF>What about your family?</font>

319
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:44,301
<font color=#0080FF>Actually, Alfred is my family.</font>

320
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:52,311
<font color=#0080FF>This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.</font>

321
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:57,567
<font color=#0080FF>Some of it is very much me.</font>

322
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,571
<font color=#0080FF>Some isn't.</font>

323
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:04,993
<font color=#0080FF>That dining room is definitely not you.</font>

324
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:06,955
<font color=#0080FF>The dining room isn't.</font>

325
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,069
<font color=#0080FF>Let's see how we did.</font>

326
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,306
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God!</font>

327
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:55,807
<font color=#0080FF>Mirror.</font>

328
00:34:58,102 --> 00:34:59,145
<font color=#0080FF>Mirror!</font>

329
00:35:08,615 --> 00:35:12,787
<font color=#0080FF>You understand that the nerves
were completely severed.</font>

330
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:20,964
<font color=#0080FF>You see what I have to work with here.</font>

331
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,787
<font color=#0080FF>There are an awful lot of stairs in this place.</font>

332
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:47,873
<font color=#0080FF>My feet are killing me.</font>

333
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,554
<font color=#0080FF>I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.</font>

334
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:01,556
<font color=#0080FF>One drink and I'm flying.</font>

335
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:04,727
<font color=#0080FF>Why are you afraid of flying?</font>

336
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:37,184
<font color=#0080FF>That you, sugar bumps?</font>

337
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,439
<font color=#0080FF>Who are you?</font>

338
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:42,859
<font color=#0080FF>It's me.</font>

339
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,028
<font color=#0080FF>"Sugar bumps."</font>

340
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:52,787
<font color=#0080FF>You're alive! I heard you'd been...</font>

341
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:54,123
<font color=#0080FF>Fried?</font>

342
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,459
<font color=#0080FF>Is that what you heard?</font>

343
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:59,046
<font color=#0080FF>You set me up over a woman.</font>

344
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:01,799
<font color=#0080FF>A woman!</font>

345
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,552
<font color=#0080FF>You must be insane.</font>

346
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,405
<font color=#0080FF>Don't bother.</font>

347
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:24,160
<font color=#0080FF>Your life won't be worth spit!</font>

348
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,915
<font color=#0080FF>I've been dead once already.</font>

349
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,168
<font color=#0080FF>It's very liberating...</font>

350
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,589
<font color=#0080FF>...if you think of it as... therapy.</font>

351
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:37,427
<font color=#0080FF>Jack, listen.</font>

352
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,100
<font color=#0080FF>Maybe we can cut a deal.</font>

353
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:44,520
<font color=#0080FF>Jack?</font>

354
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,774
<font color=#0080FF>Jack is dead, my friend.</font>

355
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:50,276
<font color=#0080FF>You can call me...</font>

356
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,696
<font color=#0080FF>...Joker.</font>

357
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,699
<font color=#0080FF>As you can see...</font>

358
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:56,618
<font color=#0080FF>...I'm a lot happier.</font>

359
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,485
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, what a day.</font>

360
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:20,556
<font color=#0080FF>Gotham City.</font>

361
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,773
<font color=#0080FF>It always brings a smile to my face.</font>

362
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,782
<font color=#0080FF>"Winged Freak...</font>

363
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:37,453
<font color=#0080FF>"...Terrorizes..."</font>

364
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,377
<font color=#0080FF>Wait'll they get a load of me.</font>

365
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:03,235
<font color=#0080FF>I've got an idea. How about lunch at
my place? I'll show you some photos.</font>

366
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:04,988
<font color=#0080FF>Sure. Okay.</font>

367
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:08,576
<font color=#0080FF>Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.</font>

368
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:11,747
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, we'll do it later in the day.</font>

369
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:16,419
<font color=#0080FF>I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.</font>

370
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,173
<font color=#0080FF>What's wrong?</font>

371
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:21,258
<font color=#0080FF>Nothing.</font>

372
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:24,846
<font color=#0080FF>I have to leave town for a few days.</font>

373
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,600
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, we'll do it when you get back.</font>

374
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:30,437
<font color=#0080FF>I have to go. I'm late.</font>

375
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:50,128
<font color=#0080FF>- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.</font>

376
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:54,217
<font color=#0080FF>I'll talk to you guys when you get back.</font>

377
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,387
<font color=#0080FF>Back, Miss Vale?
We'll be here for quite a while.</font>

378
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:14,492
<font color=#0080FF>You'll never believe what happened to me today.</font>

379
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:33,224
<font color=#0080FF><i>So, gentlemen, that's how it is.</i>
<i>Until Grissom... resurfaces...</i></font>

380
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:35,476
<font color=#0080FF><i>... I'm the acting president.</i></font>

381
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,064
<font color=#0080FF><i>And I say, starting with</i>
<i>this anniversary festival...</i></font>

382
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,526
<font color=#0080FF><i>... we run this city into the ground.</i></font>

383
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,820
<font color=#0080FF>Why don't we hear this from Grissom?</font>

384
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:45,072
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah.</font>

385
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:48,160
<font color=#0080FF>And what's with that stupid grin?</font>

386
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:51,831
<font color=#0080FF>Life's been good to me.</font>

387
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:57,588
<font color=#0080FF>What if we say "no"?</font>

388
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:04,930
<font color=#0080FF>Nobody wants a war.</font>

389
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:10,103
<font color=#0080FF>If we can't do business,
we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.</font>

390
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:11,522
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah?</font>

391
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,788
<font color=#0080FF>I got a live one here.</font>

392
00:42:30,963 --> 00:42:35,135
<font color=#0080FF>There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight.</font>

<font color=#0080FF>You're crazy.</font>

395
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:04,839
<font color=#0080FF>Haven't you ever heard of the
healing power of laughter?</font>

396
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:15,144
<font color=#0080FF>- Now get out of here!
- Let's go! Move it!</font>

397
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:17,439
<font color=#0080FF>You think it over.</font>

398
00:43:36,128 --> 00:43:40,175
<font color=#0080FF>Go to the <i>Globe</i>, follow that reporter Knox.
Take your camera.</font>

400
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,016
<font color=#0080FF>And, Bob...</font>

00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:17,347

few days to think it over.</font>

409
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:28,861
<font color=#0080FF>No?</font>

410
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:36,246
<font color=#0080FF>Grease them now?</font>

411
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,543
<font color=#0080FF>Okay.</font>

412
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:45,549
<font color=#0080FF>You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.</font>

413
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:49,262
<font color=#0080FF>I'm glad you're dead.</font>

414
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:58,524
<font color=#0080FF>I'm glad you're dead.</font>

415
00:45:01,444 --> 00:45:04,197
<font color=#0080FF>I'm glad you're dead.</font>

416
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,708
<font color=#0080FF>I need that.</font>

417
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:15,378
<font color=#0080FF>I'm losing confidence in you.</font>

418
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,214
<font color=#0080FF>I thought we were a team.</font>

419
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,967
<font color=#0080FF>Is this a personal issue for you?</font>

420
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,387
<font color=#0080FF>I just want you to do your job.</font>

421
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,930
<font color=#0080FF>I am doing my job.</font>

422
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,808
<font color=#0080FF>And I'm protecting my partner.</font>

423
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:29,730
<font color=#0080FF>There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?</font>

424
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,565
<font color=#0080FF>Who cares?</font>

425
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:36,488
<font color=#0080FF>Forget Bruce Wayne. I'm onto Batman.</font>

426
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,841
<font color=#0080FF>They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.</font>

427
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:42,188
<font color=#0080FF>What is this affidavit you filed?</font>

428
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,273
<font color=#0080FF>Grissom gave you his business?</font>

429
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,444
<font color=#0080FF>Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...</font>

430
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:50,949
<font color=#0080FF>...to take over all his
businesses until he returns.</font>

431
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:55,621
<font color=#0080FF>That's a big favor.
You two must have been very close.</font>

432
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,250
<font color=#0080FF>Did you do time together as children?</font>

433
00:48:41,345 --> 00:48:45,017
<font color=#0080FF>Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.</font>

434
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:53,694
<font color=#0080FF>I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?</font>

435
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:55,655
<font color=#0080FF>Of course you can.</font>

436
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,993
<font color=#0080FF>We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is legitimate.</font>

437
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,536
<font color=#0080FF>It is legitimate.</font>

438
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:03,791
<font color=#0080FF>I saw it. I was there.</font>

439
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,960
<font color=#0080FF>I saw it all.</font>

440
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,797
<font color=#0080FF>He reached up with his dead hand...</font>

441
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,550
<font color=#0080FF>...and signed it in his own blood.</font>

442
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:14,888
<font color=#0080FF>And he did it... with this pen.</font>

443
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:18,810
<font color=#0080FF>Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.</font>

444
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:21,939
<font color=#0080FF>Time to pay the check.</font>

445
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:29,573
<font color=#0080FF>The pen...</font>

446
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:32,326
<font color=#0080FF>...is truly mightier than the sword.</font>

447
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:49,932
<font color=#0080FF>Get down!</font>

<font color=#0080FF>Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.</font>

461

00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:22,315
<font color=#0080FF><i>Love that Joker.</i></font>

526
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,985
<font color=#0080FF>- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.</font>

527
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:30,909
<font color=#0080FF><i>He doesn't look happy.</i>
<i>He's been using brand X.</i></font>

528
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,832
<font color=#0080FF><i>But with new Joker Brand...</i></font>

529
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,293
<font color=#0080FF><i>... I get a grin again...</i></font>

530
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,129
<font color=#0080FF><i>... and again.</i></font>

531
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,466
<font color=#0080FF><i>That luscious tan...</i></font>

532
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:45,636
<font color=#0080FF><i>... those ruby lips...</i></font>

533
00:56:45,844 --> 00:56:50,475
<font color=#0080FF><i>... and hair color so natural,</i>
<i>only your undertaker knows for sure.</i></font>

534
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:53,479
<font color=#0080FF><i>You're saying:</i></font>

535
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:56,984
<font color=#0080FF><i>"Where can I get these fine, new items?"</i></font>

536
00:56:57,192 --> 00:57:01,656
<font color=#0080FF><i>That's the gag. Chances are,</i>
<i>you've bought them already!</i></font>

537
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:04,368
<font color=#0080FF><i>Love that Joker.</i></font>

538
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,036
<font color=#0080FF><i>Remember...</i></font>

539
00:57:06,328 --> 00:57:09,332
<font color=#0080FF><i>... put on a happy face.</i></font>

540
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:15,883
<font color=#0080FF>The information you requested.</font>

541
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:27,521
<font color=#0080FF>"Jack Napier, assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.</font>

542
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:30,358
<font color=#0080FF>"Results of psychological profile...</font>

543
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:34,655
<font color=#0080FF>"...violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.</font>

544
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:38,744
<font color=#0080FF>"Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."</font>

545
00:57:40,997 --> 00:57:42,332
<font color=#0080FF>Chemistry.</font>

546
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,383
<font color=#0080FF>Let's go shopping.</font>

547
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:04,860
<font color=#0080FF>...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.</font>

548
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,114
<font color=#0080FF>And what is the pattern?</font>

549
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:12,453
<font color=#0080FF>Foods, alcohol, or beauty and hygiene products?</font>

550
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:16,458
<font color=#0080FF>Cologne, mouthwash, underarm deodorant?</font>

551
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:19,628
<font color=#0080FF>Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.</font>

552
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,968
<font color=#0080FF>The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.</font>

553
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:29,474
<font color=#0080FF>We are having a festival, if I have to
use a gun to get people there myself.</font>

554
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:33,646
<font color=#0080FF>Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!</font>

555
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:36,900
<font color=#0080FF>Find out what this madman is poisoning us with.</font>

556
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,569
<font color=#0080FF>Do you read me?</font>

557
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:43,324
<font color=#0080FF>We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.</font>

558
00:58:47,496 --> 00:58:49,666
<font color=#0080FF><i>Hi, it's Vicki.</i></font>

559
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,503
<font color=#0080FF><i>I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.</i></font>

560
00:58:52,753 --> 00:58:54,839
<font color=#0080FF><i>I'll see you when you get there.</i></font>

561
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:03,349
<font color=#0080FF>A message from Miss Vale.</font>

562
00:59:03,683 --> 00:59:06,353
<font color=#0080FF>She'll be late meeting you at the museum.</font>

563
00:59:06,937 --> 00:59:09,608
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.</font>

564
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:11,986
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not meeting her today.</font>

565
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:25,711
<font color=#0080FF>Jack, where are you going?</font>

566
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,800
<font color=#0080FF>Daddy's going to make some art, darling.</font>

567
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:07,513
<font color=#0080FF>Mr. Wayne's table?</font>

568
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:10,350
<font color=#0080FF>He hasn't arrived yet.</font>

569
01:00:10,725 --> 01:00:12,395
<font color=#0080FF>We have a table waiting.</font>

570
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,430
<font color=#0080FF>Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.</font>

571
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:44,843
<font color=#0080FF>Gentlemen!</font>

572
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:48,181
<font color=#0080FF>Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.</font>

573
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:10,959
<font color=#0080FF>Give him a shave.</font>

574
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,463
<font color=#0080FF>Terence, brush.</font>

575
01:03:08,365 --> 01:03:10,033
<font color=#0080FF>The one-dollar bill.</font>

576
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:15,289
<font color=#0080FF>Hold it!</font>

577
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,211
<font color=#0080FF>I kind of like this one. Leave it.</font>

578
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,564
<font color=#0080FF>You can take that off now.</font>

579
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:42,240
<font color=#0080FF>You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.</font>

580
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:46,078
<font color=#0080FF>But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.</font>

581
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,084
<font color=#0080FF>Your portfolio?</font>

582
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,589
<font color=#0080FF>I'm meeting someone who wants to see my work.</font>

583
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,261
<font color=#0080FF>Crap.</font>

584
01:03:59,678 --> 01:04:01,514
<font color=#0080FF>Crap. Crap.</font>

585
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:04,435
<font color=#0080FF>Crap. Crap.</font>

586
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:09,774
<font color=#0080FF>Now that's good work.</font>

587
01:04:13,195 --> 01:04:14,864
<font color=#0080FF>The skulls, the bodies.</font>

588
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:19,703
<font color=#0080FF>You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.</font>

589
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:24,501
<font color=#0080FF>Let me tell you what I'm thinking about.</font>

590
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:26,712
<font color=#0080FF>I was in the bath one day...</font>

591
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:30,633
<font color=#0080FF>...when I realized why I
was destined for greatness.</font>

592
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,347
<font color=#0080FF>You know how concerned people
are about appearances.</font>

593
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,309
<font color=#0080FF>This is attractive, that is not.</font>

594
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:41,856
<font color=#0080FF>That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.</font>

595
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:45,152
<font color=#0080FF>I make art... until someone dies.</font>

596
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:46,653
<font color=#0080FF>See?</font>

597
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:52,495
<font color=#0080FF>I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.</font>

598
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:56,291
<font color=#0080FF>What do you want?</font>

599
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:00,045
<font color=#0080FF>My face on the one-dollar bill.</font>

600
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,716
<font color=#0080FF>You're joking.</font>

601
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:06,679
<font color=#0080FF>Do I look like I'm joking?</font>

602
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:08,515
<font color=#0080FF>No.</font>

603
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,058
<font color=#0080FF>Listen.</font>

604
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:15,064
<font color=#0080FF>We mustn't compare ourselves to
regular people. We're artists.</font>

605
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:18,735
<font color=#0080FF>For instance, let me challenge you
with a piece I did.</font>

606
01:05:19,027 --> 01:05:21,197
<font color=#0080FF>Bob. Alicia.</font>

607
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,535
<font color=#0080FF>You will photograph and record my work.</font>

608
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:29,082
<font color=#0080FF>You will join me in the
avant-garde of the new aesthetic.</font>

609
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:33,879
<font color=#0080FF>Jack, you said I could watch
you improve the paintings.</font>

610
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,717
<font color=#0080FF>I'm in trouble now.</font>

611
01:05:37,426 --> 01:05:39,428
<font color=#0080FF>Why is she wearing a mask?</font>

612
01:05:40,388 --> 01:05:42,181
<font color=#0080FF>She's just a sketch, really.</font>

613
01:05:42,265 --> 01:05:45,936
<font color=#0080FF>Alicia, sit down. Show the lady
why you wear this mask.</font>

614
01:05:46,228 --> 01:05:50,108
<font color=#0080FF>Alicia's been made over in
line with my new philosophy.</font>

615
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,943
<font color=#0080FF>So now, like me...</font>

616
01:05:52,277 --> 01:05:54,572
<font color=#0080FF>...she is a living work of art.</font>

617
01:05:58,952 --> 01:06:01,456
<font color=#0080FF>I'm no Picasso, but... do you like it?</font>

618
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:04,208
<font color=#0080FF>It's great.</font>

619
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:08,047
<font color=#0080FF>So... what can I do for you?</font>

620
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,468
<font color=#0080FF>A little song, a little dance.</font>

621
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,804
<font color=#0080FF>Batman's head on a lance.</font>

622
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:16,140
<font color=#0080FF>What do you know about...?</font>

623
01:06:16,892 --> 01:06:19,102
<font color=#0080FF>I don't know anything about Batman.</font>

624
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:21,564
<font color=#0080FF>Really?</font>

625
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:24,485
<font color=#0080FF>Well, how about a little "you and me"?</font>

626
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,406
<font color=#0080FF>You're insane.</font>

627
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:30,867
<font color=#0080FF>I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.</font>

628
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:33,662
<font color=#0080FF>Let's make up. Have a little...</font>

629
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,748
<font color=#0080FF>...whiff of my posy.</font>

630
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:43,007
<font color=#0080FF>Help me!</font>

631
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:45,344
<font color=#0080FF>I'm melting!</font>

632
01:06:46,095 --> 01:06:48,848
<font color=#0080FF>I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!</font>

633
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:13,963
<font color=#0080FF>Hold on.</font>

634
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:26,145
<font color=#0080FF>Where does he get those wonderful toys?</font>

635
01:07:29,065 --> 01:07:30,900
<font color=#0080FF>- Get in the car.
- Which one?</font>

636
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,634
<font color=#0080FF>Let's go.</font>

637
01:09:12,737 --> 01:09:13,738
<font color=#0080FF>Shields.</font>

638
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:40,730
<font color=#0080FF>How much do you weigh?</font>

639
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:42,607
<font color=#0080FF>About 10<i>8</i>, I think.</font>

640
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:52,953
<font color=#0080FF>Hold on.</font>

641
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,636
<font color=#0080FF>Grab that thing on my belt.</font>

642
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:07,304
<font color=#0080FF>Don't let go.</font>

643
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:23,157
<font color=#0080FF>No blood.</font>

644
01:10:23,324 --> 01:10:24,827
<font color=#0080FF>Who is this guy?</font>

645
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:26,412
<font color=#0080FF>Check his wallet.</font>

646
01:10:27,746 --> 01:10:30,333
<font color=#0080FF>- Wait.
- What is that?</font>

647
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:34,171
<font color=#0080FF>Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.</font>

648
01:10:34,505 --> 01:10:35,965
<font color=#0080FF>Take off the mask.</font>

649
01:10:42,098 --> 01:10:43,182
<font color=#0080FF>Shoot her!</font>

650
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:47,387
<font color=#0080FF>Shields open.</font>

651
01:12:12,418 --> 01:12:14,213
<font color=#0080FF>You weigh more than 10<i>8</i>.</font>

652
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:16,465
<font color=#0080FF>- Really?
- Let's go.</font>

653
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,056
<font color=#0080FF>Stop.</font>

654
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:52,469
<font color=#0080FF>Where are we going?</font>

655
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:13,487
<font color=#0080FF>Be careful.</font>

656
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:23,583
<font color=#0080FF>Bats.</font>

657
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,879
<font color=#0080FF>They're great survivors.</font>

658
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:55,122
<font color=#0080FF>- What is all this?
- The police have got it wrong.</font>

659
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,876
<font color=#0080FF>They're looking for one product.</font>

660
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:01,297
<font color=#0080FF>The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.</font>

661
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:06,136
<font color=#0080FF>Then whole shipments would be poisoned.</font>

662
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:08,055
<font color=#0080FF>And we'd all be dead.</font>

663
01:15:09,057 --> 01:15:10,558
<font color=#0080FF>No.</font>

664
01:15:10,808 --> 01:15:15,481
<font color=#0080FF>The poison only works if the components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.</font>

665
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:20,237
<font color=#0080FF>But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.</font>

666
01:15:20,904 --> 01:15:23,074
<font color=#0080FF>How did you figure this out?</font>

667
01:15:29,082 --> 01:15:30,792
<font color=#0080FF>Take that to the press.</font>

668
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,921
<font color=#0080FF>I might have trouble with that.</font>

669
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:38,134
<font color=#0080FF>A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.</font>

670
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:41,138
<font color=#0080FF>He's psychotic.</font>

671
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:44,976
<font color=#0080FF>Some people say the same thing about you.</font>

672
01:15:46,144 --> 01:15:47,312
<font color=#0080FF>What people?</font>

673
01:15:48,313 --> 01:15:50,483
<font color=#0080FF>Well, let's face it.</font>

674
01:15:51,943 --> 01:15:55,114
<font color=#0080FF>You're not exactly normal... are you?</font>

675
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:57,909
<font color=#0080FF>It's not exactly a normal world.</font>

676
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,953
<font color=#0080FF>Why did you bring me here?</font>

677
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:03,624
<font color=#0080FF>You could have sent that
stuff to the press yourself.</font>

678
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:05,544
<font color=#0080FF>You're right.</font>

679
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,632
<font color=#0080FF>There is something else you have that I want.</font>

680
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:10,967
<font color=#0080FF>What?</font>

681
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:34,997
<font color=#0080FF>He took the film.</font>

682
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:44,008
<font color=#0080FF>Where have you been? Are you okay?
Should I come over?</font>

683
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:46,345
<font color=#0080FF>No, Allie.</font>

684
01:16:47,012 --> 01:16:50,517
<font color=#0080FF>If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?</font>

685
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,729
<font color=#0080FF>Just barely. Is it hot?</font>

686
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:57,066
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah, it's real hot.</font>

687
01:16:59,236 --> 01:17:00,237
<font color=#0080FF>Copy!</font>

688
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:14,755
<font color=#0080FF><i>Avoid the following combinations:</i></font>

689
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:18,343
<font color=#0080FF><i>Deodorants with baby powder,</i>
<i>hairspray, and lipstick.</i></font>

690
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:23,182
<font color=#0080FF><i>Safe products are flying in</i>
<i>as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.</i></font>

691
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:26,603
<font color=#0080FF><i>And all of Gotham is wondering</i>
<i>what to make of Batman.</i></font>

692
01:17:26,854 --> 01:17:28,522
<font color=#0080FF><i>Friend or foe?</i></font>

693
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,443
<font color=#0080FF>I have given a name to my pain...</font>

694
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:35,614
<font color=#0080FF>...and it is Batman.</font>

695
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,958
<font color=#0080FF>You must possess strength to inflict pain, Bob.</font>

696
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:46,879
<font color=#0080FF>We've got a flying mouse to kill...</font>

697
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,799
<font color=#0080FF>...and I want to clean my claws.</font>

698
01:17:54,722 --> 01:17:57,392
<font color=#0080FF><i>Sir, Miss Vale called again.</i></font>

699
01:17:57,809 --> 01:18:00,854
<font color=#0080FF><i>Dare I suggest that your</i>
<i>present course of action...</i></font>

700
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:03,524
<font color=#0080FF><i>... might simply strengthen her resolve?</i></font>

701
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:05,986
<font color=#0080FF>She is quite tenacious.</font>

702
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,071
<font color=#0080FF>You're right.</font>

703
01:18:08,197 --> 01:18:12,702
<font color=#0080FF>And quite special.
Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.</font>

704
01:18:23,341 --> 01:18:24,675
<font color=#0080FF>Coming.</font>

705
01:18:38,735 --> 01:18:39,986
<font color=#0080FF>May I come in?</font>

706
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,668
<font color=#0080FF>This is a nice apartment.</font>

707
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:55,256
<font color=#0080FF>Lots of space.</font>

708
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,557
<font color=#0080FF>Listen, I came over to...</font>

709
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:05,727
<font color=#0080FF>...clear...
- I don't know who you think you are!</font>

710
01:19:05,936 --> 01:19:07,604
<font color=#0080FF>- You hurt me.
- I know.</font>

711
01:19:07,896 --> 01:19:12,569
<font color=#0080FF>I called you and called you. And you lied!
You lied about leaving town.</font>

712
01:19:12,735 --> 01:19:15,072
<font color=#0080FF>- Let me tell you why.
- Let me tell you!</font>

713
01:19:15,281 --> 01:19:18,785
<font color=#0080FF>I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.</font>

714
01:19:19,077 --> 01:19:20,745
<font color=#0080FF>I even slept with you.</font>

715
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:24,584
<font color=#0080FF>Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.</font>

716
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:29,632
<font color=#0080FF>You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot,
but right now, shut up.</font>

717
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:32,927
<font color=#0080FF>I have something to tell you.</font>

718
01:19:41,062 --> 01:19:45,401
<font color=#0080FF>You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?</font>

719
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:48,739
<font color=#0080FF>Sometimes...</font>

720
01:19:49,574 --> 01:19:53,579
<font color=#0080FF>...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.</font>

721
01:19:54,163 --> 01:19:55,998
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God, you're married.</font>

722
01:19:56,498 --> 01:19:58,335
<font color=#0080FF>No, I'm not married.</font>

723
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,678
<font color=#0080FF>You see...</font>

724
01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:10,350
<font color=#0080FF>...my life is really...</font>

725
01:20:13,687 --> 01:20:14,855
<font color=#0080FF>...complex.</font>

726
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:22,698
<font color=#0080FF>All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...</font>

727
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,119
<font color=#0080FF>...goes downstairs...</font>

728
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,205
<font color=#0080FF>...and eats breakfast...</font>

729
01:20:28,538 --> 01:20:32,043
<font color=#0080FF>...and kisses somebody good-bye,
and goes to...</font>

730
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:35,047
<font color=#0080FF>...a job, and, you know...</font>

731
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,216
<font color=#0080FF>No.</font>

732
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,390
<font color=#0080FF>Look.</font>

733
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,397
<font color=#0080FF>What I'm trying to tell you is...</font>

734
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,318
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, it's okay.</font>

735
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:54,071
<font color=#0080FF>You can tell me.</font>

736
01:20:59,327 --> 01:21:01,496
<font color=#0080FF>What I'm trying to tell you is...</font>

737
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,086
<font color=#0080FF>I'll be right back.</font>

738
01:21:17,016 --> 01:21:18,184
<font color=#0080FF>Miss me?</font>

739
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:27,195
<font color=#0080FF>Nice place you got here. Lots of space.</font>

740
01:21:28,614 --> 01:21:31,117
<font color=#0080FF>Vicki, we've really got to talk.</font>

741
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:36,957
<font color=#0080FF>We were having dinner.</font>

742
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:41,212
<font color=#0080FF>I was a man doing well with a beautiful woman.</font>

743
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:44,300
<font color=#0080FF>And without so much as an apology...</font>

744
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:48,347
<font color=#0080FF>...you ran off with that sideshow phony.</font>

745
01:21:53,561 --> 01:21:54,730
<font color=#0080FF>You know...</font>

746
01:21:56,982 --> 01:21:59,903
<font color=#0080FF>...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.</font>

747
01:22:00,153 --> 01:22:01,571
<font color=#0080FF>Alicia...</font>

748
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,825
<font color=#0080FF>...threw herself out a window.</font>

749
01:22:05,076 --> 01:22:06,245
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God.</font>

750
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:10,250
<font color=#0080FF>But...</font>

751
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,921
<font color=#0080FF>...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.</font>

752
01:22:25,309 --> 01:22:26,937
<font color=#0080FF>Well, Miss Vale...</font>

753
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:30,316
<font color=#0080FF>...another rooster in the hen-house?</font>

754
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:36,156
<font color=#0080FF>Take thy beak from out my heart.</font>

755
01:22:42,498 --> 01:22:45,626
<font color=#0080FF>Bruce... Wayne, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>?</font>

756
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,423
<font color=#0080FF>Most of the time.</font>

757
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:57,182
<font color=#0080FF>I know who you are.</font>

758
01:23:00,353 --> 01:23:02,982
<font color=#0080FF>Let me tell you about this guy I know.</font>

759
01:23:03,858 --> 01:23:07,195
<font color=#0080FF>Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.</font>

760
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,531
<font color=#0080FF>I like him already.</font>

761
01:23:12,869 --> 01:23:15,164
<font color=#0080FF>You know what the problem was?</font>

762
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:18,501
<font color=#0080FF>He got sloppy. You know, crazy.</font>

763
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:23,174
<font color=#0080FF>He started to lose it.
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.</font>

764
01:23:23,382 --> 01:23:25,886
<font color=#0080FF>Couldn't keep it straight up here.</font>

765
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,514
<font color=#0080FF>He was the kind of guy who...</font>

766
01:23:30,725 --> 01:23:34,063
<font color=#0080FF>...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.</font>

767
01:23:38,735 --> 01:23:40,946
<font color=#0080FF>You know what happened to this guy?</font>

768
01:23:45,744 --> 01:23:47,704
<font color=#0080FF>He made mistakes.</font>

769
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:52,919
<font color=#0080FF>Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?</font>

770
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:54,964
<font color=#0080FF>Come on! Let's get nuts!</font>

771
01:23:56,423 --> 01:23:57,926
<font color=#0080FF>Tell me something.</font>

772
01:23:59,678 --> 01:24:03,015
<font color=#0080FF>Have you ever danced with the
devil in the pale moonlight?</font>

773
01:24:03,265 --> 01:24:04,183
<font color=#0080FF>What?</font>

774
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,270
<font color=#0080FF>I always ask that of all my prey.</font>

775
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:09,857
<font color=#0080FF>I just like the sound of it.</font>

776
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:18,451
<font color=#0080FF>Never rub another man's rhubarb.</font>

777
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:29,298
<font color=#0080FF>Why is it, every time I come for you...</font>

778
01:24:30,383 --> 01:24:32,635
<font color=#0080FF>...somebody always gets in the way?</font>

779
01:24:32,969 --> 01:24:35,139
<font color=#0080FF>I'll need a moment alone.</font>

780
01:24:37,976 --> 01:24:40,645
<font color=#0080FF>I'm only laughing on the outside.</font>

781
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:44,650
<font color=#0080FF>My smile is just skin deep.</font>

782
01:24:45,818 --> 01:24:47,612
<font color=#0080FF>If you could see inside...</font>

783
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:49,823
<font color=#0080FF>...I'm really crying.</font>

784
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:52,994
<font color=#0080FF>You might join me for a weep.</font>

785
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,970
<font color=#0080FF>You really wouldn't believe it.</font>

786
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:45,142
<font color=#0080FF>While you were entertaining, I've been
