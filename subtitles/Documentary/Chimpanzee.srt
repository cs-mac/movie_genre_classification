1
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:35,394
Once, not long ago,
in deepest Africa,

2
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,230
a great rain forest,

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,368
a wild, magical land,
barely touched by humankind.

4
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:00,921
It's a special day in the dark
heart of this forest.

5
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,648
There's a new life,

6
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,853
a precious baby boy named Oscar.

7
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,821
What's so special
about this little guy?

8
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:39,323
Well, something truly amazing
will transform his life.

9
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,194
And that's what our
story is all about.

10
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:55,198
CHIMPANZEE

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,815
Beneath this rain forest canopy

12
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,952
is a world that you or I
may never set eyes on.

13
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,624
It's a world with few people,

14
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:16,600
but still, it's full of drama,
sadness, and joy.

15
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,585
About three months have passed

16
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:54,189
since little Oscar brought
light into his mother's life.

17
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,593
Isha couldn't be happier
with her new baby boy.

18
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:05,735
Oscar's world revolves around Mom,

19
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:08,507
but there are 35 other chimpanzees
in his group

20
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,775
that make a kind of extended family,

21
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,443
and they're never far away.

22
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,552
Perhaps one day Oscar will become

23
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,490
an old-timer like Grandpa,

24
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,085
who will turn 50 this year.

25
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,028
But there are other kids, too.

26
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,693
They'll become Oscar's playmates.

27
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,429
It's a rich society,

28
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,733
but in the heart of the jungle.

29
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:53,314
Now, Oscar won't be
in his prime until he's over 20,

30
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,259
but one day, he'll look like this big guy.

31
00:04:56,328 --> 00:05:00,628
This is Freddy,
and he's large and in charge.

32
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,928
His white beard shows his years

33
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,992
of wisdom and experience.

34
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,637
Right now, Freddy is untouchable.

35
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,472
And like most alpha males,

36
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,910
he couldn't care less
about the young upstarts

37
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,881
who would just love
to take over his job someday.

38
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,958
Yeah, yeah. Seen it all before.

39
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,762
You need brains
to make a living in this forest.

40
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,829
The jungle toolbox can help,

41
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,740
but only if you're bright
enough to use it.

42
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,143
Sometimes it just takes
a little home-schooling

43
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,846
available from your friends and family.

44
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,487
See? Like this.

45
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,488
Right there.

46
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,627
Even Rufus catches on, eventually.

47
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,893
There you go. Bugs on a stick.

48
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,602
It's finally time for Oscar
to leave his mother's side.

49
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:34,522
For Isha 's little boy,
this is independence day,

50
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,687
and independence
comes one step at a time.

51
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,020
Well, that's enough
independence for one day.

52
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,503
Oscar's forest home is a prime
piece of chimpanzee real estate

53
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,632
that appears rich and lush,
but it's a hard place to make a living.

54
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:27,338
The jungle itself is a living,
breathing thing

55
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,437
that doesn't want to be eaten.

56
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,631
Finding food here is a full-time job

57
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,435
that involves the whole family,

58
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,100
including Oscar.

59
00:07:58,677 --> 00:07:59,939
Now that he's grown up a little,

60
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,445
he can start to explore on his own.

61
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,684
But he's not above
catching a lift when he can.

62
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:10,187
Really, why walk
when you can hitch a ride?

63
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,322
Keep it moving, Mom.

64
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,423
Freddy leads the search for breakfast.

65
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,191
It helps to have someone who
knows where they're going,

66
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:23,727
especially when the restaurant
is never in the same place.

67
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:39,475
Today the diner isn't even
in the same neighborhood.

68
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,542
To find the fruit they'll need,

69
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,088
they will have to travel much further

70
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,180
and take a risk.

71
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,756
Freddy knows the only fruit
available now

72
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,529
is on the far side of their kingdom,

73
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,036
out of their safe zone.

74
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,473
This border has been
a battleground for generations.

75
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,383
Everyone is on maximum alert

76
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,952
and treads as quietly as possible.

77
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:31,290
Freddy is leading them close
to their greatest enemies.

78
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,068
This ridge marks the start of territory

79
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,734
owned by a group
of rival chimpanzees.

80
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:51,979
The forbidden fruit is finally in reach.

81
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,273
Shh, Oscar. Shh.

82
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,934
Freddy sees his team
are outnumbered two to one.

83
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,579
The enemy has a formidable leader,

84
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,849
Scar.

85
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,309
He and his team have had Freddy

86
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:57,548
in their sights for years.

87
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,759
Oscar clings to Isha.
They dare not make a move.

88
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,828
The rivals have caught their scent.

89
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,609
Oscar and the others
are in real danger.

90
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:44,392
Scar's drum is a threat.
For Isha, it's run or die.

91
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,109
Freddy leads the escape.

92
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,059
By running off Freddy's group,

93
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,561
their enemies have claimed
a small victory.

94
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,994
But that's just the beginning.

95
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:17,968
Scar and his troops are intent
on winning the war,

96
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,027
not just a single battle.

97
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,305
The prize,

98
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:29,642
a grove of nut trees
in the center of Freddy's land.

99
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:35,012
The grove is an oasis of food
in this difficult forest

100
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,611
and one that Scar's army
has to conquer

101
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,522
if they're going to survive and thrive.

102
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:59,036
Isha knows that Scar
is the greatest threat to little Oscar,

103
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,840
and the run-in
was too close for comfort.

104
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,745
She'll do everything possible
to keep her son safe.

105
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,325
Oscar will rely on his mother's
milk for a good while yet,

106
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,399
and to keep that milk flowing

107
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,634
Isha relies on the rich nuts
in Freddy's kingdom.

108
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,109
The magnificent nut groves,
so sought-after by Scar,

109
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,553
thrive here because of the rich soil,

110
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,749
and another magic ingredient,

111
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,787
life-giving water.

112
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:06,901
Beneath the waterfall,
in the heart of Freddy's territory,

113
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,598
the nuts are coming into season

114
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,164
and it's time for a feast.

115
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:26,383
They're delicious, nutritious,
and you can't eat just one.

116
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:32,094
It seems impossible to have too many.

117
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:36,097
But how do you carry them
without a bag?

118
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,965
You've got to be creative.

119
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:43,040
Hmm. Put them over in this hand.

120
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,473
Anybody watching this?

121
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,613
The ripest nuts can be sniffed out.

122
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,241
But these are also
the hardest to break into.

123
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:01,156
They require the right tool
for the right job.

124
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,208
It looks easier than it is,

125
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,734
and the technique takes these
guys many years to master.

126
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,176
Yeah, here we go. Yum, yum.

127
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:42,755
Sometimes the best tool
for getting nuts isn't a tool at all.

128
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,859
Yup, it's good old Mom.

129
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,097
It's a pretty sweet deal.

130
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,703
But Mom will only help out
for a couple of years.

131
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,975
Then they'll have to take
a shot at it themselves.

132
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,044
Really, how hard can it be?

133
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,719
Oscar is in nut preschool.

134
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,192
There's something wrong
with this hammer.

135
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,355
It won't hit the nut!

136
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,863
Yup, definitely the hammer.

137
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:25,032
Of course. A bigger one!

138
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,054
This is defective!

139
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,157
They just don't make logs
like they used to.

140
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,470
All right. It has to be the nut.

141
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,421
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
They're using rocks?

142
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,822
No one said anything about rocks.

143
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,252
Oh, I get it.
They must be harder than wood.

144
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,538
Mr. Nut, meet Mr. Rock.

145
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,809
Come to Papa.

146
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,946
Yes! Okay, that's one.

147
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,021
Now Oscar's out of nuts.

148
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:55,930
He'll have to leave
his hammer to stock up.

149
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,861
Rookie mistake.

150
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,171
I had an eye on that kid all day.

151
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,399
What an idiot.

152
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,281
After all those nuts,

153
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,985
nobody's swinging through the trees.

154
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,620
Yes, it's time to rest and digest.

155
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:28,324
Even our boy Oscar's knocked out.

156
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:37,338
It can take hours
to sleep off a big meal,

157
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:40,104
but the jungle never rests.

158
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,864
In the heat of day,

159
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:07,837
the parents just want a few
minutes of peace and quiet,

160
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,203
but the kids have other ideas.

161
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:13,072
Especially Oscar.

162
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,807
Come on up, guys!

163
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,752
A million trees in this forest

164
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,855
and you have to play over me.

165
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:45,669
I'm sleeping. I am still sleeping!

166
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,706
Poor Isha. Just look at her.

167
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,841
She really does have
her hands full with Oscar,

168
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,078
but her patience
never seems to run out.

169
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,820
Oscar's one lucky young chimp.

170
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,506
Scar and his thugs
are a growing threat.

171
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,977
Food is still scarce in their territory.

172
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,314
If nothing changes,

173
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:05,822
they'll be forced to make
a move on the nut groves.

174
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,589
If they succeed,

175
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,889
Freddy and his group will be exiled

176
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:13,555
from their homeland forever.

177
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:21,329
The aging Scar is under
constant pressure from within.

178
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:24,800
The males in his team are so powerful

179
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,708
that any one of them could
challenge him as leader,

180
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,370
and he knows it.

181
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:36,253
Grooming helps hold
this volatile team together

182
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,289
and reminds everyone who's boss.

183
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,054
Without it, there would be anarchy.

184
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,840
This hierarchy may hold
in the short term,

185
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:04,176
but how long can Scar
count on his men?

186
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,048
Far to the west,

187
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,822
a special fruit has come into
season beneath the waterfall.

188
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:20,427
Sacoglottis.

189
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,931
Trying saying that three times fast.

190
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,666
Freddy knows the fruit is a real bonus,

191
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,232
so it's best to make the most of it.

192
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:39,145
Isha collects a private stash
for herself and Oscar.

193
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:54,196
Remember to wash your food
before eating it.

194
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,740
Once washed,
the fruit is chewed to a pulp

195
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,404
so all the goodness can be sucked out.

196
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:12,946
You can do it without teeth.
No wonder Grandpa likes them!

197
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,347
That's a good look.

198
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,252
Not a lot of family photos
with Grandpa.

199
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:20,615
Very appetizing.

200
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,051
When the fruit is sucked dry,

201
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,756
rinse and repeat.

202
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,624
Wow, that is some good Sacoglottis!

203
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:50,416
Finally, this is something Oscar can
eat without his mother's help.

204
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,185
But it's anyone's guess where
the next meal is coming from.

205
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,603
With the fruit running low,

206
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,071
Freddy's family resorts
to another source of food.

207
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,507
Like us, they eat fruits,
vegetables, and meat.

208
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:18,906
But their choice in meat is something
that just might surprise you.

209
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,571
Monkeys.

210
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,541
The males take up the hunt.

211
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,669
They split up.

212
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,639
Fanning out through the forest,

213
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,741
they take up their places.

214
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,578
Freddy is at center stage.

215
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:04,956
Oscar and Isha watch
from the sidelines.

216
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:14,002
These colobus monkeys
are being hunted.

217
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:17,673
Smaller and lighter
than the chimpanzees,

218
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:19,766
they can run on thinner branches,

219
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:22,835
and this makes the hunt
much more challenging.

220
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:31,882
Freddy holds back.

221
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,514
This operation requires planning,

222
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,650
and everyone has a role to play.

223
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,393
One by one,
they silently take their positions.

224
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:55,067
The monkeys still haven't seen them.

225
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,745
Now, the blockers move up.

226
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,263
They're supposed to be seen,

227
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,230
and take a position in clear view.

228
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,962
Another blocker.

229
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,064
Another escape route closed.

230
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,679
Freddy climbs carefully.

231
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:31,977
He must not be seen.

232
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,712
As ambusher,

233
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,884
Freddy will stay hidden
until he makes the grab.

234
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,330
Perfect.

235
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:00,705
Now, for the driver.

236
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,179
He'll push the monkeys
towards the ambusher.

237
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,261
Ready,

238
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,097
steady,

239
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:29,629
go!

240
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,342
They've got one!

241
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:49,557
Freddy takes the best for himself.

242
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,562
After the initial scramble,

243
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:58,066
the group settles in for the feast.

244
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:05,165
For Oscar, it's time to try to
win a seat at the adult table.

245
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,003
Shares get dished out first to those

246
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:11,070
that helped in the hunt
or as payback for favors.

247
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:13,173
But no matter how hard you try,

248
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,912
there's always someone
who feels shortchanged.

249
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,719
The females couldn't care less.

250
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:27,423
When it comes
to guarding meat from the guys,

251
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,466
girl power usually wins.

252
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,000
Back up, big boy.

253
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:46,950
It's always good to add
a little fiber to your diet,

254
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,247
so don't forget the side salad.

255
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,232
As usual, Oscar was last in line,

256
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:07,429
so he missed the main course.

257
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,332
He'll have to settle
for his mother's milk.

258
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,706
He may not be the most popular
little boy with everyone,

259
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:17,042
but his mother's love
is something he can count on.

260
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:30,119
With dusk approaching, leopards will
soon prowl the forest floor.

261
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:32,287
If Isha and Oscar want to sleep safely,

262
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,387
the only way is up.

263
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:57,945
Young, flexible branches
can be woven into a platform.

264
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,793
And leaves from the same tree
will do for bedding.

265
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:28,985
Now, that's comfort.

266
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:42,024
Like most kids, Oscar hates bedtime.

267
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:06,849
Finally, Isha 's little rascal hits the sack.

268
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,900
Even if the kids let you sleep,

269
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:30,435
there's a good chance
the neighbors will keep you awake.

270
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,849
Ah, please...

271
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,524
Are you kidding me?

272
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,959
You know, frogs are edible.

273
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,406
Here we go.

274
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,818
Isha and Oscar go downstairs
the exciting way.

275
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,309
Early morning, just after breakfast,

276
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:11,780
is the best time of day to strengthen
friendships with a little grooming.

277
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:24,388
The bonds between Freddy's team
are more important than ever.

278
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,831
The group is far smaller
than Scar's rival army

279
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,924
and teamwork is their best chance

280
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:34,562
of protecting the nut groves
for the next generation.

281
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,745
Oscar's future is in all their hands.

282
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:56,214
Far to the east,
just inside Freddy's territory,

283
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:58,293
a fig tree comes into fruit,

284
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,852
and is an instant hit with everyone.

285
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:04,625
Figs are a lifeline in the forest,

286
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,669
often fruiting when
there is nothing else to eat.

287
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,926
Scar's gang is mounting a raid.

288
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:42,498
They've wiped out the fruit
in their own territory

289
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:45,541
and have crossed the border
to satisfy their hunger.

290
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,171
All other animals scatter.

291
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:02,116
Even these figs
won't keep them fed for long.

292
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:04,387
This is just a stepping stone.

293
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:06,823
When the moment is right,

294
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:09,431
they will try to take over the real prize,

295
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:11,023
the nut groves.

296
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,399
Scar's raid on the eastern border

297
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,501
goes unnoticed by Freddy's group.

298
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:25,975
A new kind of nut is ripening
in the nut groves.

299
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,074
These are far tougher
than the last ones.

300
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:30,949
It's time to bring in
the heavy equipment,

301
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,315
power tools!

302
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,972
Success with these nuts
is all about the quality of your hammer.

303
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:57,143
You can steal someone else's
while they're off collecting nuts.

304
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:03,209
And Freddy is an expert at this.

305
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:06,380
But, man, is he tough on his tools.

306
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:09,721
These things are
a community resource,

307
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:12,990
so can you please
try not to break them?

308
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,474
Safety first!

309
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:30,172
So please keep hands and feet
clear of rocks at all times.

310
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:43,286
Chimps have gathered here
to crack nuts for over 4, 000 years.

311
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:48,622
Nut-cracking is
part of the group's cultural heritage

312
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:50,859
and is passed through the generations,

313
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,425
especially from mother to child.

314
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,602
Learning, for Oscar,
will be a slow process.

315
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:02,305
It will be years before he could
even lift a rock like this.

316
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,343
Day after day,
it takes a committed mom to teach him

317
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,851
how to make a living in the jungle.

318
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:46,520
It will be many years
before Isha 's son can fend for himself.

319
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,217
A gathering storm
excites Scar's forces.

320
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,891
For Freddy's gang,
the rain is less welcome.

321
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,026
Chimps just hate getting wet.

322
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:21,915
Oscar gets all the warmth
he can from Isha.

323
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,580
Scar and his gang.

324
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,891
The storm is cover for a raid.

325
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:37,049
This time, they've got them cornered.

326
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:52,001
Isha and Oscar are in trouble.

327
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:14,527
Scar's army was overwhelming.

328
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,763
Oscar's group is in disarray
and badly shaken.

329
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:40,349
In all the chaos,
Oscar lost contact with his mom.

330
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,852
Isha is nowhere to be seen.

331
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:16,622
Isha has been injured and separated
from the group by Scar's gang.

332
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,685
She will struggle to get back safely.

333
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,968
This is no forest
to be alone in after dark.

334
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,785
Several of Isha 's friends
have been lost to leopards,

335
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:48,483
often when they have strayed
from the safety of the group.

336
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,110
Isha will never return to her family

337
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,356
or her son.

338
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:10,169
Oscar doesn't know
about his mother's death

339
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:12,773
and he searches for her everywhere.

340
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:23,580
With every hour that slips by,
he becomes more desperate.

341
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,833
Oscar's growing body
needs constant food.

342
00:45:43,506 --> 00:45:47,135
He tries to remember
what his mom did to make their living.

343
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:49,602
But nothing comes easily without her.

344
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:14,799
Hours turn into days.

345
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:18,063
Oscar must spend less time searching

346
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:20,769
and more time focusing on his survival.

347
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,543
Hunger drives Oscar to a bees' nest.

348
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:37,584
Honey is good food, but he's always
relied on his mom to collect it.

349
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:49,196
The honey's too deep for small arms to
reach, and the bees are not happy.

350
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:58,668
Oscar's loss will be Freddy's gain.

351
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,728
The boss takes the biggest
piece of honeycomb,

352
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:24,732
but there's enough left
for everyone else,

353
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:29,203
except the little boy who found it.

354
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:41,441
The forest seems an
increasingly hostile place

355
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:43,747
for a young, hungry chimpanzee.

356
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:51,251
The razor-sharp jaws
of these army ants

357
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:54,626
can strip a frog or a lizard
to the bone in minutes.

358
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:59,896
Is it really a good idea to eat
something that can eat you back?

359
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,814
Oscar is the first to get bitten.

360
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:16,283
Without a mother, he'll need to learn
fast from the older chimps.

361
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,919
All right, step one,

362
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:23,481
make a miniature fishing rod
from a nearby branch.

363
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:29,422
Step two, cast it in and wait for a bite.

364
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:33,830
And finally, step three, ants on a stick!

365
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:35,726
Eat and enjoy!

366
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:45,180
Boy! That is spicy.

367
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:55,788
It's ingenious!

368
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:56,950
They will bite your lips,

369
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,551
but at least the rest of you is safe.

370
00:50:10,072 --> 00:50:12,063
Oscar keeps his distance.

371
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:16,111
Maybe it's safer
just to pick up tips for another time.

372
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,496
Oscar is losing weight quickly,

373
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:41,001
and with no one to groom him,

374
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,560
it's becoming harder to keep ticks

375
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:44,765
and other bugs from his skin.

376
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:53,238
It's time to accept the simple truth.

377
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:55,916
Isha isn't coming back.

378
00:50:57,086 --> 00:50:59,316
Oscar has to find a new mother.

379
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:05,817
But sadly for him, most of the
females have kids of their own

380
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:08,125
and are unable to help.

381
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,132
Again and again, Oscar is rejected.

382
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:37,156
Even finding a friend seems hard.

383
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:05,676
It's hopeless.

384
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:11,153
Scar and his men may have
taken more than one life that day.

385
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:49,490
The enemy has returned.

386
00:52:49,565 --> 00:52:52,159
They have eaten all the food
in their own territory

387
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:55,203
and are now stealing from Freddy's
land to sustain their number.

388
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,444
For Scar, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

389
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:15,148
There is a growing impatience
among Scar's army.

390
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:18,290
They want to take the nut groves,

391
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:23,124
and more than one of them
would like to be leader.

392
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,712
Oscar has tried everything,

393
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,655
but he is still alone.

394
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:59,633
There's only one chimp
he hasn't approached.

395
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:01,296
Freddy.

396
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:19,154
By following the leader,

397
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:21,486
Oscar will at least find the best food

398
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:23,855
and work out what's safe to eat.

399
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,093
Right now, survival is all that matters.

400
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:38,799
Freddy is not known for his tolerance,

401
00:54:39,808 --> 00:54:42,003
but Oscar isn't a challenger.

402
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:45,544
This will be
a new experience for them both.

403
00:54:56,458 --> 00:55:00,155
A gentle acceptance is more than
Oscar could have hoped for.

404
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:08,502
Being at Freddy's side

405
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,131
should allow him to pick up some
tips on food preparation.

406
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,214
Maybe the big guy's table manners

407
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:26,584
don't set the best example,

408
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:28,885
but who's going to tell him off

409
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:32,092
or pick a fight
with the friend sitting next to him?

410
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:28,180
As the days pass, Freddy and Oscar's

411
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,582
relationship begins to change.

412
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,151
Until something
extraordinary happens.

413
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:38,152
Freddy allows Oscar
to ride on his back

414
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:40,457
as usually only a mother would.

415
00:56:52,674 --> 00:56:55,609
It's a sign of something truly incredible.

416
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:00,010
Freddy will adopt Oscar.

417
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:21,063
Just being led to these nuts
would not help Oscar,

418
00:57:21,837 --> 00:57:23,498
but now Freddy steps up

419
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:26,837
and gives his new friend first pick
of every one he cracks,

420
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,070
just as his mother once did.

421
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:31,476
The bond between them is growing.

422
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,204
It's Oscar's best meal
since Isha vanished.

423
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,112
The group is waiting for their leader,

424
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:13,313
but Freddy has a new project.

425
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:21,392
The learning that stopped short
when Oscar was orphaned

426
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:23,124
is starting again.

427
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:27,929
He's with a wise and skilled
chimpanzee who has much to offer.

428
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:56,053
Forest school is back in session.

429
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:06,867
Everywhere Freddy goes,
Oscar follows.

430
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:15,248
And everything Freddy does,
Oscar copies.

431
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:27,955
Our little boy is
on the fast track to forest knowledge.

432
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:46,139
Freddy's world may be richer,
thanks to his new friend,

433
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:50,480
but his commitment to Oscar has left
him no time to patrol his borders.

434
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:55,082
The change has been noticed.

435
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:10,462
Scar and his gang have now
crossed over the ridge.

436
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:14,737
They would not usually get this deep
into Freddy's land without opposition

437
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,472
and they intend to take full advantage.

438
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:28,045
The troops need to refuel
before they push on.

439
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:32,016
The grand fig tree is being pillaged.

440
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:36,727
This is the food
that Freddy's group were relying on,

441
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:42,001
but Scar has no interest
in the needs of his enemies.

442
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:48,140
Encouraged by the lack
of resistance at the border,

443
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,407
the intruders are now
deep inside Freddy's land.

444
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:56,814
But there is growing dissent
in the ranks.

445
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:01,213
The physical power of
this army is beyond question,

446
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:03,917
but the unity of a team can be fragile.

447
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:07,022
Scar needs to watch his back.

448
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,281
Freddy has become
completely devoted to Oscar.

449
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:32,777
The highest-ranking male
grooming the lowest.

450
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,356
It's an astonishing turn of events.

451
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:07,516
A few weeks ago, Oscar had nothing,

452
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:11,118
and now he is well fed
and completely adored,

453
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,696
and his savior is the last one
anyone could have expected.

454
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,835
The rivals are fed and rested.

455
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:09,949
Scar and his mob
are within reach of the nut groves.

456
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:16,082
The time for a full invasion has arrived.

457
01:03:57,465 --> 01:03:59,456
Freddy grooms his allies.

458
01:04:01,136 --> 01:04:02,899
He knows there is trouble approaching

459
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:06,566
and for the first time
in weeks, he appears nervous.

460
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:17,541
Friendships need investment,
and his attention has been elsewhere.

461
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:24,549
Oscar feels Freddy's focus
drift away from him.

462
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:31,689
Freddy must reassure his team
that he is still the boss

463
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:34,929
and has the strength
to unite them and lead them.

464
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:44,539
Oscar is confused.

465
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:48,379
He's lost one parent and
seems to be losing another.

466
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,677
The rivals are close.

467
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:33,188
Oscar and the group
sense that something is wrong.

468
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,006
Something catches Freddy's eye.

469
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,318
Scar attacks.

470
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,655
The final push has begun.

471
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:21,802
Freddy's team can't escape.

472
01:06:27,816 --> 01:06:29,306
They have to fight.

473
01:06:29,384 --> 01:06:31,614
But some of Scar's mob hold back.

474
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:39,016
Freddy leads the attack.

475
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:52,172
Freddy and Scar go head-to-head.

476
01:07:03,885 --> 01:07:06,012
There can be only one victor.

477
01:07:29,611 --> 01:07:32,546
Freddy's drum announces victory.

478
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:41,344
Scar will not be returning
anytime soon.

479
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,720
Teamwork has beaten brute force.

480
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,467
The group is now thriving,

481
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:39,172
unchallenged in their
ownership of the precious nut groves.

482
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:44,748
Cracking school continues,

483
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:47,219
but some students
never seem to catch on.

484
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:55,362
Grandpa has lived
to see Scar dealt a blow

485
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,728
from which he may never recover.

486
01:09:00,568 --> 01:09:03,537
And Oscar is causing
as much trouble as ever,

487
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:07,068
but now he's fully
accepted by the group,

488
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,770
and seems to be
everyone's new friend.

489
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:18,980
Maybe quiet times are returning at last.

490
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,724
Oscar and Freddy
have been transformed

491
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:27,226
by the turmoil of the last few months.

492
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:31,824
For Oscar, the loss of his
mother could have meant the end.

493
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,130
Instead, it's a new beginning

494
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:37,365
with the most unlikely foster parent
in the forest.

495
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:40,472
And Freddy?

496
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:42,499
He's discovered a softer side

497
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:45,068
that must have been there all along.

498
01:10:02,597 --> 01:10:04,622
Secure in Freddy's arms,

499
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:07,998
the future finally looks bright for Oscar.

500
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:59,374
When this big male decided
to carry this little orphan

501
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:01,472
and take care of him and give him food,

502
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:03,949
it literally took our breath away.

503
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:06,843
For sure, there's no doubt

504
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:08,946
he saved the life of the little one.

505
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,684
And that was really
very touching to see.

506
01:12:13,461 --> 01:12:15,827
And when you see a
mother carrying its baby,

507
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:17,159
it's charming.

508
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:20,291
But when you see this huge,
King Kong-like figure

509
01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:23,701
carrying this tiny, little,
male orphan around,

510
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:24,863
it was lovely.

511
01:12:26,307 --> 01:12:28,502
Every single day
was an act of beauty

512
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:30,510
between the two of them.

513
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:32,910
And that's something
you can never forget.

514
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:37,375
Sometimes I imagine

515
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:38,942
the rest of the world waking up,

516
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,148
getting on busses,
or they may be getting on subways.

517
01:12:42,223 --> 01:12:45,818
Our commute to work
is walking for an hour

518
01:12:45,893 --> 01:12:48,054
through the jungle
to find chimpanzees.

519
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:51,121
Some of this stuff is just impenetrable

520
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,327
and really difficult to move through.

521
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:00,133
It really is a joy
to walk through this forest.

522
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:05,910
You see, it's not always that easy.

523
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,880
So, we're just walking...

524
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:17,017
They bite you
in the most remarkable places.

525
01:13:18,426 --> 01:13:20,758
These sweat bees are driving me nuts.

526
01:13:20,828 --> 01:13:23,319
Still, at least they're not honeybees.

527
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:27,095
Ahh! Ow! Ow! Ahh!

528
01:13:30,805 --> 01:13:32,534
It's gotten intolerable.

529
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:33,596
I'm leaving.

530
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,432
Oh, my God. Ed!

531
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:38,271
If it bites you, you won't survive.

532
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,446
It's not a picnic, you know.

533
01:13:47,622 --> 01:13:48,646
Yes!

534
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,725
There must be easier ways
to make a living,

535
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,522
but they're not as much fun.

536
01:17:50,829 --> 01:18:01,562
THE END
