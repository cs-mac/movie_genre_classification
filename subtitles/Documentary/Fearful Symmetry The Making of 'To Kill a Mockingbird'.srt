There's this old chifforobe
in the yard,

and bust up this chifforobe,

and I go in the house
to get him the nickel...

and before I know it, he's on me.

around the neck...

and I turned around...

1088
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,398
and she sorta jumped on me.

1089
01:28:17,537 --> 01:28:20,563
She hugged me
around the waist.

1090
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,974
She reached up and kissed me
on the face.

1091
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:29,846
She said she'd never kissed
a grown man before...

1092
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:33,545
and she might as well kiss me.

She says for me
to kiss her back,

1094
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:41,784

"Miss Mayella, let me outta here,"

1095
01:28:41,862 --> 01:28:43,796

from the window.

To begin with,

1125
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,428
this case should never
have come to trial.

1126
01:32:09,502 --> 01:32:12,596
The State has not produced
one iota...

1127
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,663
of medical evidence...

1128
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:18,472
that the crime Tom Robinson
is charged with...

1129
01:32:18,545 --> 01:32:21,981
ever took place.

1130
01:32:22,048 --> 01:32:24,380
It has relied, instead,

1131
01:32:24,451 --> 01:32:27,716
upon the testimony
of two witnesses...

1132
01:32:27,787 --> 01:32:31,154
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question...

1133
01:32:31,224 --> 01:32:33,784
on cross-examination,

1134
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:38,320
but has been flatly contradicted
by the defendant.

1135
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:43,469
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that...

1136
01:32:43,536 --> 01:32:48,405
Mayella Ewell
was beaten savagely...

1137
01:32:48,475 --> 01:32:53,139
by someone who led,
almost exclusively, with his left.

1138
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:59,976
Tom Robinson now sits before you
having taken the oath...

1139
01:33:00,053 --> 01:33:03,750
with the only good hand
he possesses,

1140

1141
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:21,903
I have nothing but pity
in my heart...

1142
01:33:21,975 --> 01:33:25,911
for the chief witness
for the State.

1143
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:33,542
She is the victim
of cruel poverty and ignorance.

1144
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,626
But my pity...

1145
01:33:40,693 --> 01:33:43,856
does not extend so far...

1146
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:48,264
as to her putting
a man's life at stake,

1147
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:53,795
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

1148
01:33:53,873 --> 01:33:57,070
Now I say "guilt," gentlemen,

1149
01:33:57,143 --> 01:34:02,775
because it was guilt
that motivated her.

1150

She's committed no crime.

1151
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:10,922
She has merely broken
a rigid and time-honored...

1152
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:14,687
code of our society--

1153
01:34:14,761 --> 01:34:19,095
a code so severe that whoever breaks it
is hounded from our midst...

1154
01:34:19,165 --> 01:34:21,360
as unfit to live with.

1155

of her offense?

Tom Robinson, a human being.

1159
01:34:38,685 --> 01:34:43,520
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

1160
01:34:45,058 --> 01:34:48,892
Tom Robinson was to her
a daily reminder...

1161
01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:51,760
of what she did.

1162
01:34:51,831 --> 01:34:55,164
Now, what did she do?

1163
01:34:55,235 --> 01:34:57,362
She tempted a Negro.

1164
01:34:57,437 --> 01:35:01,806
She was white,
and she tempted a Negro.

1165
01:35:01,874 --> 01:35:06,675
She did something that,
in our society, is unspeakable.

1166
01:35:06,746 --> 01:35:09,214
She kissed a black man.

1167
01:35:09,282 --> 01:35:13,548
Not an old uncle,

1168
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,748
but a strong, young Negro man.

1169
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:23,592
No code mattered to her
before she broke it,

on her afterwards.

that their testimony
would not be doubted.

would go along with them...

01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:03,427
the evil assumption--

1178
01:36:03,503 --> 01:36:06,301
that all Negroes lie,

1179
01:36:06,372 --> 01:36:09,569
all Negroes are basically
immoral beings,

1180

all Negro men are not
to be trusted around our women.

1181
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:22,552
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber,

1182
01:36:22,622 --> 01:36:27,389
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie,

1183
01:36:29,862 --> 01:36:33,923
which I do not need
to point out to you.

1184

And so,

a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro,

1186

who has had the unmitigated
temerity...

to feel sorry
for a white woman,

1188

has had to put his word
against two white people's.

I'll, uh-- Well, I'll run down
to the office--

02:03:30,395 --> 02:03:32,989
Mr. Finch...

1399
02:03:33,065 --> 02:03:35,659
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell?

1400
02:03:35,734 --> 02:03:38,999
Is that what you think?

1401
02:03:39,071 --> 02:03:42,336
Your boy never stabbed him.

1402
02:03:59,191 --> 02:04:02,786
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1403
02:04:02,861 --> 02:04:06,297
He killed himself.

1404
02:04:09,701 --> 02:04:12,636
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

1405
02:04:12,704 --> 02:04:16,640
Now the man
responsible for it is dead.

1406
02:04:16,708 --> 02:04:19,802
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

1407
02:04:19,878 --> 02:04:22,312
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

1408
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:24,974
to do his utmost to prevent a crime
from being committed,

1409
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:27,143
which is exactly what he did.

1410
02:04:27,219 --> 02:04:32,816
But maybe you'll tell me it's my duty to
tell the town all about it, not to hush it up.

1411
02:04:32,891 --> 02:04:35,325
You know what'll happen then.

1412
02:04:35,393 --> 02:04:37,657
All the ladies in Maycomb,
includin' my wife,

1413

will be knockin' on his door
bringin' angel food cakes.

1414
02:04:42,234 --> 02:04:45,499
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man,

1415
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:48,403
who done you and this town
a big service,

1416
02:04:48,473 --> 02:04:52,603
and draggin' him with his shy ways
into the limelight--

1417
02:04:52,677 --> 02:04:55,942
To me, that's a sin.

1418
02:04:56,014 --> 02:04:58,107
It's a sin.

1419
02:04:58,183 --> 02:05:02,119
And I'm not about
to have it on my head.

1420
02:05:02,187 --> 02:05:05,122
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

1421
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:08,785
but I'm still Sheriff
of Maycomb County,

1422
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:12,956
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1423
02:05:13,031 --> 02:05:14,965
Good night, sir.

[ Car Door Shuts, Engine Starts ]

1425
02:05:54,172 --> 02:05:56,766
Mr. Tate was right.

1426
02:06:00,845 --> 02:06:03,439
What do you mean?

1427
02:06:03,515 --> 02:06:07,281
Well...
it would be...

1428
02:06:07,352 --> 02:06:11,618
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

1429
02:06:39,718 --> 02:06:41,811
Thank you, Arthur.

1430
02:06:49,661 --> 02:06:52,596
Thank you for my children.

[ Adult Scout ]
Neighbors bring food with death...

1432
02:07:10,181 --> 02:07:12,274
and flowers with sickness...

1433
02:07:12,350 --> 02:07:15,945
and little things in between.

1434
02:07:16,021 --> 02:07:18,785
Boo was our neighbor.

1435
02:07:18,857 --> 02:07:21,621
He gave us two soap dolls,

1436
02:07:21,693 --> 02:07:24,457
a broken watch and chain,

and our lives.

One time Atticus said...

1440
02:07:37,208 --> 02:07:42,646
you never really knew a man until you stood
in his shoes and walked around in them.

1441
02:07:47,218 --> 02:07:51,416
Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

1442
02:07:57,996 --> 02:08:01,762
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended,

1443
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:04,267
and another summer
had taken its place.

1444
02:08:04,336 --> 02:08:06,270
And a fall.

1445
02:08:06,338 --> 02:08:09,774
And Boo Radley had come out.

1446
02:08:13,011 --> 02:08:16,447
I was to think
of these days many times,

1447
02:08:16,514 --> 02:08:18,607
of Jem and Dill...

1448

And Atticus.

1450
02:08:33,698 --> 02:08:37,794
He would be
in Jem's room all night,

1451
02:08:37,869 --> 02:08:42,806
and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning.
