1
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,444
First big one of the season.

2
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,579
Yep.
It's heading right for base.

3
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,184
It's gonna mess up Kim's dig.

4
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,822
She's not gonna like that.

5
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,224
Yeah, well, I don't
like it much either.

6
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,226
There's a surprise.

7
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,064
Lighten up, Vince,
a bit of dust never hurt anyone.

8
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,704
It's not the dust
I'm worried about.

9
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,576
- Harrington, you seeing this?
- Yeah, it's a beast.

10
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,746
Cycle down the backup grids
in case we lose anything.

11
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,946
We'll be back
when we pick up Kim.

12
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,286
<i>~ Blue skies are

13
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,889
<i>~ Walk round the corner with me</i>

14
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,059
<i>~ Just round the
corner you'll see</i>

15
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,263

there's nothing warmer</i>

17
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,737
<i>~ Won't you feel happy to be</i>

18
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,473
<i>~ Sharing the sunshine with me</i>

19
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:32,111
<i>~ Under those blue skies?</i>

20
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,748
<i>~ Troubles may come
But troubles will go</i>

21
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,552
<i>~ Don't you ever worry any more</i>

22
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,122
<i>~ Look at those skies
They're not telling lies</i>

23

were put there for</i>

27
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,612
Campbell to Aldrich.

28
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,253
Campbell to Aldrich.

29
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,627
Campbell to Aldrich.
Come in, Kim.

30
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,634
It's 1530, Kim.

31
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,575
- Come on, Kim, time to wrap it up.
- Fuck off.

32
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,048
Actually, I'd be happy to, Kim.

33
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,351
Unfortunately, Brunel wants you
back at the briefing.

34
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:22,554
Well, he'll have to wait,
won't he?

35
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,361
Ten things about Mars you won't
miss when you're back on Earth.

36
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,830
Only ten?

37
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,433
Storms... Your driving.

38
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,435
Kim.

39
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,885
Kim.

40
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,880
Kim.

41
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:48,847
A six-month commute home
in a floating coffin. With Kim.

42
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,084
Is that ten?
I've lost count already.

43
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,685
It's not a coffin, Vince.

44
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,789
But that's an interesting
choice of word.

45
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,694
OK. A nice big spaceship.
What do you want me to say?

46
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,666
We get out and walk at the end.

47
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:11,236
On green grass.
Under blue skies.

48
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,672
Yeah.

49
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,978
Green grass. Blue skies.

50
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:25,084
<i>~ Blue skies around the corner</i>

51
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,221

53
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,263
Running late, Kim.

54
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,298
Don't worry,
I'll take the heat.

55
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,734
Did you get
all the samples you wanted?

56
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,104
Does it matter?
We're still going back empty handed.

57
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,940
Come on, Kim. That's not fair.
We've achieved a lot here.

58
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,810
Yeah? Like what?

59
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,781
As far as I'm concerned, we're just
sharpening pencils for the next crew.

60
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,750
Whoever remembers the
second man on the moon anyway?

61
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,252
It was Buzz Aldrin.

62
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,288
- First man to piss on the moon.
- What?

63
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,957
He pissed himself on the moon.
You didn't know that?

64
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,494
Well, that's something for
us all to aspire to, isn't it?

65
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:13,007
I just don't want to go home with nothing.
Six months isn't enough time.

66
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:17,065
- You could always stay.
- Vincent, why don't you just go fu...

67
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,136
Let's go.

68
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,368
Rover One, where the hell are you?
We've got circuits failing all over.

69
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,370
Sorry. Got held up.
On our way.

70
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,206
Alright, but we need
you back here.

71
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,776
We've lost our link to the Aurora and
Harrington can't handle it alone.

72
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,979
Where's Vincent?
I wanna talk to my daughter.

73
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,381
On his way, I hope.

74
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:07,286
Six months cruising and now this.
Bit of a mess.

75
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,822
Be alright. We're on the home stretch.
One more day.

76
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,565
Hey. When you wake up,

77
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,002
I'd love to know how long it'll
be before skylink's restored.

78
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,303
Sorry.

79
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,741
Nearly there.

80
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:32,211
Ah, yeah. This should be it.
Here we go.

81
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,780
We've lost your signal,
do you copy?

82
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,283
Sorry, guys. We had a
power outage due to the storm.

83
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,853
We can see it from Sat Four.
You had us worried there for a minute.

84
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,057
Alright, time check: final approach
burn in 19 hours, 56 minutes.

85
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:49,262
Copy that. Safe orbit. Be great to
see you guys again. Brunel out.

86
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,864
For fuck's sake.

87
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,034
Alright. Manual check everything.
All systems.

88
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,947
What are you so happy about?

89
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,216
Vince, tell me you're close by.

90
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,019
We're on our own until you get
these systems back online.

91
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,489
Roger that. Almost there.
Keep losing charge on this thing.

92
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,593
- Don't want to push it too hard.
- Roger that, Vince.

93
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,194
I need a word.

94
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,632
Alright. OK.

95
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,942
- I need to go back out again.
- Forget it. We've got a briefing.

96
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:39,946
We need everyone on base.
What's going on?

97
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,181
Gamma sensor at Site Nine
is not responding.

98
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,850
Storm damage, possibly.
I don't know.

99
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,086
You didn't check it
before you came back?

100
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,790
What do you want me to say?
I'm a fucking idiot? I'm sorry.

101
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:56,095
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
The sun's about to go down.

102
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,465
I signed off on that site.
I'll be quick.

103
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,102
It's going to look bad if the relief
crew has to come out and fix it.

104
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,204
A lot of things
need fixing here.

105
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,705
You'll have Vincent in no time.

106
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,316
Take Harrington. And make
sure you're back before dark.

107
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,452
- Is that clear?
- Thank you.

108
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,722
I want everybody cleaned up
before we do our final briefing.

109
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,922
You know I don't fuck around.

110
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,726
Harrington, let's go.
Rover number two, now.

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,502
Sir, you want us to go outside?

112
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,270
Make sure you're back
before dark.

113
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,787
- Are you alright?
- Huh?

114
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,954
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,762
Just...

116
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,026
Never get sick of that sound.

117
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,501
- Where are you guys going?
- Soak up some more radiation.

118
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,770
Try making babies
after this mission, huh?

119
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,906
- Too funny.
- Well, I'm laughing.

120
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,441
What the hell are you doing?

121
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,644
Harry, if that cooling system's down,
I'm gonna need your help.

122
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:55,479
Sorry, man. You're gonna have to
speak to Brunel. It's not my call.

123
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,123
We bust our arses
to get back here

124
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,166
and those pricks get to
fucking go out again.

125
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,033
19 hours. It's just 19 hours.

126
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,401
So what do you know about
cooling systems?

127
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,741
So what's the score?

128
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,777
Marko Petrovic one, Kim nil.

129
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,613
- What?
- Never mind.

130
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,248
We're fixing a broken sensor.

131
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,018
Didn't you hear?

132
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,757
Right. So are we gonna be long?

133
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,594
Well, it takes as
long as it takes.

134
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,563
Oh, come on, man.
Brunel's not gonna like this.

135
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:49,101
You want to speed things up, Harry,
go prep the sample boxes, OK?

136
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,870
Date, grid reference,
and new prefix. MA1.

137
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,241
MA1?

138
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,911
Microscopic anomaly.

139
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,987
- Hold on. Does Brunel know?
- Just trust me on this one, OK?

140
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,100
Are you cosy in there?

141
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,103
Like a bug in a rug.

142
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,410
- You talk to Ella?
- No, I missed the window.

143
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,116
Shit, man. I'm sorry about that.

144
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:42,154
I got... you know, delayed.

145
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,390
- Kim.
- Yeah.

146
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,393
Never mind. I'll get another
chance back on Aurora.

147
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,361
Hey, I come bearing gifts.
You want some?

148
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,175
- Jesus Christ.
- What's up?

149
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,278
Half the CO2 scrubbers
are down on the Aurora.

150
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,247
Check out this
approach trajectory.

151
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,717
These guys are gonna get
pulled over for drunk driving.

152
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,921
Can't we at least get on board before
you start worrying about the Aurora?

153
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,123
Aren't you excited to go home?

154
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,692
Home isn't the issue.

155
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,961
It's the six months
it takes to get there

156
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:26,030
strapped to the back of a nuclear
warhead I'm worried about.

157
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,469
- What?
- Are you alright?

158
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,942
Come on, Irwin. Can we please
not do analysis thing right now?

159
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,410
I got a lotta work to do.

160
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,280
You know how it is. You're not
happy if things aren't working.

161
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,382
I'm not happy if
you're not happy.

162
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,753
I'm happy. I'm ecstatic. See?

163
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,624
- OK. Alright.
- See? Happy, happy, happy.

164
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,225
Alright. We're happy.

165
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,995
Get the popcorn out.

166
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,802
Who's your money on?

167
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,439
You kidding me?
Kim. Every time.

168
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,009
She's got a point, though.
How come Marko gets a free pass?

169
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,862
So, what do you reckon?

170
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:37,269
We all go back home, find God,

171
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,272
write a poem about it
like the moon walkers did?

172
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,876
It did change them.
They all said so.

173
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,644
People don't really change.

174
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,714
Put 'em under enough pressure,
you find out who they are.

175
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,683
God, that is deep. Are you
gonna put that in a poem?

176
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,696
That was uncomfortable.

177
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,669
What's she doing?

178
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,876
Kim, that's Marko's workstation.

179
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,847
I just wanna know
what's so urgent.

180
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:25,217
You can't go through
his private log. Vincent, tell her!

181
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:28,520
Oh, yeah.
Like she's gonna listen to me.

182
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,255
This is bullshit.

183
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,859
She's right. Just cos he broke the rules,
it doesn't make it fair game.

184
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,096
There's no way Marko gives a
shit about a broken sensor. OK?

185
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,931
I just want to know why his research
is more important than mine.

186
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,903
What?

187
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,874
That's not what it looks like.

188
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,378
Those cavities in the rock...
those could be microbial borings.

189
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,446
PAH's can be
formed non-organically.

190
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,116
- Is it still under the scope?
- I'll check.

191
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,551
Alright, anyone wanna tell me
what's going on?

192
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,887
Nothing's going on.

193
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,723
He found a piece of
abiotic mineral. Bullshit.

194
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,301
Got it.

195
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,374
Holy shit.

196
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,313
- That looks like...
- Cell division...

197
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,150
Bacterial cell division.

198
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,724
I want that site locked down.
No one goes near it.

199
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,393
We'll upload the scans and data
to mission control.

200
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,629
See if they confirm
Lane's conclusions.

201
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,531
We need to speak to Marko first.
It's his find.

202
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:49,401
He's the one who's been playing silly games.
Why didn't he talk to us?

203
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,537
Because that would be
sharing the credit.

204
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,172
That's not fair.

205
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:57,076
I think we're missing the point.
This is what we came here for, isn't it?

206
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,945
- Shouldn't we check it out?
- He knows what he's doing.

207
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,581
So we'll entrust the
greatest find in human history

208
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,382
to a man who just lied to you?
Is that it?

209
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,562
Rover Two, this is base.
You at Site Nine yet?

210
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,932
Yeah, we... we got here a couple
of minutes ago. What's up, sir?

211
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,168
I'm declaring the site off limits.
Put Marko on now.

212
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,005
Yep. Stand by, base.

213
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:31,110
Marko, I've got Brunel on comms.
Are you copying any of this?

214
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,579
That's negative.

215
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,415
Can you speak in English
please, mate?

216
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:42,416
Tell them the signal is breaking up.
Tell them you can't see me now. Tell...

217
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,165
I've got Brunel
holding on the other line.

218
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,501
Don't argue with me now. Just come
out and bring the camera with you.

219
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,505
You have to see this, Harry.
It's beautiful.

220
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,743
Harry! Harry! Help!

221
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,078
Marko!

222
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,715
Come on!

223
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,024
Oh, my God.

224
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,400
Mayday!
This is Harrington to base.

225
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:33,237
I need help here.
Repeat, Mayday! Please help.

226
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,101
- What happened?
- He's gone.

227
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:07,272
Have you been down there to him?
Why aren't you down there, Harrington?

228
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,243
- I tried.
- Well, you didn't try hard enough.

229
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,245
- I'm gonna go down there!
- No, Dalby.

230
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,356
- He could still be alive!
- You'll gonna rip your suit or break your neck.

231
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:20,529
- I haven't pronounced it yet.
- I'm pronouncing it, Dalby. He's dead.

232
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,321
I'm not gonna risk another life.
So stand down.

233
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,557
People are pulled from frozen
water all the time and revived.

234
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,461
- You don't know he's dead.
- Dalby, stand down.

235
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,062
Stand down.

236
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,777
He said he'd
found something, sir.

237
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,594
Nobody goes down there
until we've got the right gear.

238
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,633
We've gotta run this
by mission control.

239
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,034
How long will it take?

240
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,103
Altogether 30, 40 minutes.

241
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,207
Sir...

242
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,979
I really wanna stay here.
We can't just leave him like this.

243
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,948
No. I need to do it.
You've done enough.

244
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,788
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

245
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,094
You're not gonna go in that pit.
Is that clear?

246
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:40,264
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

247
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,635
Alright.

248
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,971
OK.

249
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,475
This is Brunel.

250
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,043
Contact mission control.
We've had an accident.

251
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,665
- Did you see him?
- No.

252
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,602
Look, skipper, if there's
any chance he's alive,

253
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:23,073
No. There's no way he survived that
fall without compromising his suit.

254
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,412
We'll pull him out as soon as we
hear back from mission control.

255
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,556
So when are we planning on
announcing the discovery?

256
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,724
You really are something else
aren't you, Kim?

257
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:42,694
Hasn't it sunken in yet?

258
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,897
This discovery
changes everything.

259
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,901
- Takes precedence over everything, right?
- What about human decency?

260
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:50,743
So I'm the bad guy now for
staying focused on the mission?

261
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,703
I didn't get him killed.

262
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,276
I'm sorry, what the fuck are
you trying to say there, Kim?

263
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,512
You broke with protocol.
Figure it out.

264
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,415
- You are fucking...!
- Hey, hey, hey...

265
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,283
You are unbelievable!

266
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,986
- What's the matter with you?
- Fucking laugh at me.

267
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:11,690
- OK, enough. Away.
- OK.

268
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,726
Nothing wrong with me.
I'm not the one breaking the rules.

269
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,529
- That's not helpful, Kim.
- Just drop it.

270
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,529
Cheers, Kim.

271
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,235
He's falling apart.
Like everything else around here.

272
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,736
Alright. That's enough.

273
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,638
Am I the only one
who's noticed this?

274
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,980
Base from mission control,
responding your priority code 13.

275
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:39,217
What can we say, guys?
We're all in deep shock.

276
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,987
Marko's family has been
informed of the situation,

277
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:45,490
but we haven't gone public yet
until you confirm his status.

278
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,793
The board are working
on an official statement,

279
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,562
but they'll be looking for you
to put a few words together

280
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,264
if it comes down to that.

281
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:56,601
Brunel, we copy your safety concerns,
but it's a go for retrieving Petrovic.

282
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,236
Use all caution.

283
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,807
Rough way to end the mission, guys,
but we're behind you 100 percent.

284
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:06,043
More soon. 1636, message ends.

285
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,814
You heard him.

286
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:12,716
We'll retrieve the body,
then announce Marko's discovery. Let's go.

287
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,256
Go ahead.

288
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,432
Sir, can I...?

289
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,868
Can I have a quiet word, please?

290
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,868
Yeah.

291
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,275
Skipper, I know it's not my place,
but you can't let Kim behave like that.

292
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,876
Nor anyone else, OK?

293
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,516
Look, I know it's bad,
but we all knew the risks.

294
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:48,286
Honestly, it's a miracle an accident
hasn't happened up here sooner.

295
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,088
I'm still the one
who let them go out.

296
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,226
No, I'm sorry, with all due respect
to Marko, he brought this on himself.

297
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:58,795
Any screw-up by anyone on this team,
that's my responsibility.

298
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,470
It's not fair to take Harrington
back out.

299
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,639
He stays here with Kim.

300
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,844
- Alright.
- OK.

301
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,934
Sir, you're breaking up.
Repeat your message.

302
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,636
Rover One all loaded up.
Heading back to you.

303
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,943
How are you holding up
out there? Dalby?

304
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,383
Sorry. For a second, I...

305
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,884
What is it, Dalby?

306
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,590
Dalby?

307
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,394
Somebody's coming in...

308
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,995
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

309
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,897
Dalby?

310
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,166
Dalby?

311
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,593
Dalby. Come in, Dalby.
Where the hell is she?

312
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:45,130
We've had static at Site Nine all day.
Maybe the comms are down again.

313
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:48,165
Still doesn't
explain her last response.

314
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,346
Lane, Irwin, check Rover Two.

315
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,595
Jeez, it's still venting steam.

316
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,899
Must be a lot of water
down there.

317
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,668
If she went down there
after I told her not to...

318
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:30,407
Dalby. Come in, Dalby.
Please respond.

319
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,578
Please respond.

320
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,914
There's nothing in Rover Two.

321
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:40,852
She wouldn't disobey an order.
Maybe she fell in.

322
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:45,457
Can't see the bottom.
How deep do you think it is?

323
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,724
I don't like this one bit.

324
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,429
Alright, Vince. Strap up.
Let's see what's down there.

325
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,265
Yes, sir.

326
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,412
Gets a little tight
down there, doesn't it?

327
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,512
OK.

328
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,883
Here we go.

329
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,567
Alright.

330
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,003
Jesus.

331
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,510
- You alright down there?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

332
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,183
It's nice... walk in the park.

333
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,524
Jesus Christ.

334
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,593
OK.

335
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,863
Mark me off!

336
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,744
Holy shit.

337
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,211
What? What do you see?

338
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,418
I don't know. It's...

339
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,956
In the rock formations, there's...
something growing on them.

340
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,524
Like...

341
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,895
I don't know what it is but...

342
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:35,834
- It's definitely alive.
- We should bring him up.

343
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:39,003
I'm gonna try and get a little lower.
See if I can find Marko.

344
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,739
- Take me down.
- You got it.

345
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,917
Fuck!

346
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,593
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

347
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,927
Vincent.

348
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,199
Bring him up. Bring him up.
Bring him up!

349
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,239
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

350
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,746
Vince, are you alright?
Just breathe.

351
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,114
We gotcha.
Come on. That's it.

352
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,119
- Alright.
- Vincent...

353
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,987
I can't... I can't...
I can't...

354
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,589
You're alright.

355
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,893
Vincent, what did you see?
Vincent?

356
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,827
Vincent!

357
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,267
I'm OK. I'm OK.

358
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,904
What the
hell happened down there?

359
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,873
Nothing. I'm good.

360
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,882
I saw the bottom.
They're not there.

361
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:34,284
Skipper, it's Irwin.

362
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,323
There's footprints here.
There's two pairs.

363
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:43,227
What?
Where are they headed?

364
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,129
They're crossing
the rift valley.

365
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,668
They look like
they're headed towards base.

366
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,603
If she pulled him out of there,

367
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,139
why didn't they
just take the rover?

368
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,941
It just doesn't make sense.

369
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,148
Call Kim. Tell her to prepare for one,
maybe two casualties.

370
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,121
He'll be in a bad way
if he's been exposed.

371
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:14,759
Possible brain damage from
oxygen deprivation, hypoxia...

372
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,261
That's if we're lucky.

373
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:21,199
- Look, what I said earlier...
- Shut up, Kim. Shut up.

374
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,201
Let's just forget it, yeah?

375
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,807
They're about 50 metres out.

376
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,810
Must be Marko and Dalby.
But what the hell?

377
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,113
They walked all the way back?

378
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:38,216
As long as they're OK,
that's all that counts, right?

379
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,818
Base to Dalby,
can you come in, please?

380
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:44,521
They're coming around to the airlock.
I'm gonna go let them in.

381
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,057
Wait. We haven't
established comms here.

382
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,579
Marko! Oh, fuck.

383
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,980
You're OK, you're OK.

384
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,152
Oh, fuck!

385
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,566
Marko, what the fuck
are you doing? Marko!

386
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,526
Go!

387
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,647
Base, this is Brunel.
Come in, please.

388
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,651
Come in, please. Base.

389
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,481
Mayday! Mayday!

390
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,984
Harrington?

391
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:56,554
Harrington, please respond.
Lane, Irwin, check the other side.

392
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,090
- Call me if you see anything.
- OK.

393
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:01,891
Harrington.
Come in, Harrington.

394
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,629
- Stay out here.
- I'm coming with you.

395
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,631
Just, stay on comms.
I'll call you if I need you.

396
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,566
I know I was a
little shaky back there.

397
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:12,201
That's an order.
Don't argue with me.

398
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,590
Explain to me
what the hell's going on here.

399
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,195
Fuck.

400
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,065
We need to quarantine them here.

401
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:18,000
Get in a suit. I'll buy you time. Go, go, go.
I'm right behind you.

402
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,780
Listen to me.
Marko, you're sick.

403
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,716
I want to help you. Can you understand me?
I want to help you.

404
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,290
Vincent, Lane, I'm in the airlock.
I'm coming out.

405
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,825
- What happened in there?
- They're killing us!

406
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,397
Kim?
What happened in there?

407
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,482
Are you alright?
What happened?

408
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:08,019
- Just breathe.
- Marko and Dalby are dead.

409
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,888
They couldn't have survived.
But they're still moving.

410
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:14,592
She's not making sense. If they're moving,
they've got brain function...

411
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,694
...that means
they're not dead, Kim.

412
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,763
I'm not a fucking idiot!
I know.

413
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,997
The airlock.

414
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,235
It's Brunel.

415
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:28,739
Lock the door!
Lock the door! Fuck!

416
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,342
Seal it up.
Don't let them get out!

417
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,844
- He's bleeding.
- Need to seal it.

418
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,448
He's got a tear!
He's bleeding.

419
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:41,651
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
You're OK.

420
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,792
Yeah, I've got it.

421
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,126
- What's Kim doing? She's...
- Kim!

422
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:52,862
What the hell are you doing?

423
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,234
Kim! No, that's the door lock!

424
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,237
Kim, stop!
No, they're still in there!

425
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,739
Get off me. Get off me!

426
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,308
It's OK. You disabled it.
They can't get out.

427
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:07,376
You don't know what they did!
Look for yourself!

428
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,022
Vincent?

429
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,663
What happened to them?
What the hell happened to them?

430
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,865
It's low pressure.
They've got the bends.

431
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,268
When are you guys gonna get it?
It's not them any more! They're gone now!

432
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:34,031
Fuck!

433
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,508
That door is reinforced steel.
They can't get through.

434
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,344
They have power tools.
They have high explosives.

435
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,513
The decompression'll kill them.

436
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,515
- It won't.
- Brunel's in a bad way.

437
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,051
- We need to move him now.
- Fuck.

438
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,286
Let's get him to
the hydroponic dome.

439
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,590
Kim, get the airlock.
Let's go. Now!

440
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:55,426
- OK, we're gonna move you now.
- We've gotta go now!

441
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:58,095
- Come on, skipper, let's go.
- One, two, three.

442
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,364
Oh, shit!

443
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,232
Just a little bit.

444
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:08,539
Almost there. Come on.
Come on, you can do it.

445
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,375
- You're nearly there.
- You can do it.

446
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,755
- Have you got him?
- Yeah.

447
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,424
Gently, gently.

448
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,626
- Irwin, get out the way. Out the way.
- OK, OK.

449
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:31,260
- Sit him up.
- I'm trying.

450
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,364
- Careful.
- Alright.

451
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,809
OK. One, two, three...
Mind his neck.

452
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,345
- It's OK.
- Gently, gently.

453
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,647
There you go.

454
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,288
Captain, stay awake
and focus, OK?

455
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,492
I'm OK... It's just nothing...
Nothing feels right inside.

456
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,594
- I'll give you a shot.
- Doesn't feel right.

457
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:07,296
- Gonna give you some morphine.
- Here we go.

458
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,839
Alright.
We've got to get this open.

459
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,281
- Jeez.
- Oh, God.

460
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,488
Vincent, I'm not a medic.
I can't do this.

461
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:33,724
Lane, if anyone can do this, you can.
Just tell me what you need.

462
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,293
Come on.

463
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:41,298
Hey, I know that look.
You don't have to...

464
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,734
Oh, God.

465
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,035
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

466
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,772
There should be more blood.

467
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:57,146
Six months. What a mess.
I thought we were home free.

468
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,562
What's Kate gonna tell
the kids?

469
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:10,860
I can't... I can't remember
what they look like.

470
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,199
You tell them
I was thinking about them.

471
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,768
I will. Of course.
Of course I will.

472
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,879
We've seen things
that no one has seen before.

473
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,882
They can't take that
away from us, right?

474
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,449
No.

475
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,889
God, I'm thirsty. Thirsty.

476
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,924
- I've got it.
- Thirsty.

477
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,565
Stay here, skipper. Come on.
Just breathe.

478
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:51,133
Nice and easy.
You're gonna be OK.

479
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,842
OK.

480
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,479
OK, stay there. It's OK.
It's me. It's Irwin. It's OK.

481
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,282
OK, careful. Careful.

482
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,756
Get some more. Kim, get some more.
OK. Hey, I'm with you.

483
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,892
You have to...
You have to...

484
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,895
You gotta help me.
You gotta help.

485
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:20,130
No! Stop!

486
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,733
- Skipper, no! Let go!
- Jesus!

487
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,568
Skipper! Stop! No!

488
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,611
Look at me! Look at me!

489
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:38,816
You're OK, you're OK. Come on.
Goddamn it! Stop, please!

490
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,985
Please. Just look at me.

491
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,888
It's OK. Just breathe. Just breathe.
Come on, come on, come on.

492
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:48,726
Look at me. Look at me, come on.
Please. Come on.

493
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:50,961
Just breathe. You're OK.

494
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,796
Skipper.

495
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,443
You'll never see home.

496
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,560
What the fuck was that?

497
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:33,435
He didn't mean that.
He couldn't. He couldn't.

498
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,150
Kim.

499
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:50,254
- Kim, he's gone.
- Don't touch me.

500
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,855
What the hell are you doing?

501
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,893
You think he's dead, right?

502
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:59,630
Vincent... Kim, he's gone.

503
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,198
Kim.

504
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,001
Get your hands off him.
Get away from him!

505
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,270
- He has gone.
- Think about it, Irwin.

506
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:10,874
Marko and Dalby are out there exposed to
the atmosphere and they're still moving.

507
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,577
It can't be how it looks.
There must be some explanation for this.

508
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,201
I've had enough of this place.
I just want to go home.

509
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,672
I'm done.

510
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,408
I'm done, Vincent.

511
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,753
He said he couldn't remember
his children.

512
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,122
I just want to
see my little girl.

513
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,823
I wanna see Ella.

514
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,959
- They've blown the dome.
- We need to contact the Aurora.

515
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,127
Comms are down.

516
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,563
Till we fix them, we're trapped.

517
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:41,532
What about the O2 feed pipe?

518
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:44,434
It's the only thing
connecting the two domes.

519
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,971
We can get back to the main base
without them even seeing us.

520
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,940
If I can get through and fix
the skylink,

521
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,975
I can reach the Aurora
and ask for help.

522
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,379
If they've blown the dome,
it won't be pressurised.

523
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,581
There's a seal at both ends.

524
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:00,117
If I close it behind here
and equalize the pressure,

525
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,586
it should hold
when I open the other side.

526
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:06,156
- And if it doesn't, we're all dead.
- And what do you suggest?

527
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,891
What about Harrington?

528
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:10,893
When they blew the dome,
he wasn't wearing a suit.

529
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,171
- Are you sure they can't get in?
- How the fuck should I know?

530
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,273
The failsafe is designed
to keep the door closed.

531
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,291
We need to deal with this now.

532
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:46,662
If Harrington has gone, Vincent's the
only one that can fix the skylink.

533
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,365
He's the only one.

534
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,472
I'm heading back.

535
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:59,209
- I'm going with you.
- No. There's no point.

536
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,511
What if Marko and Dalby
return to the base?

537
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,614
We'll keep them busy.

538
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,334
Just... close this behind me

539
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,870
and leach off the air at the
other end so it doesn't blow.

540
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,090
Lane, you copy me?

541
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,093
I got you.
Are you gonna be OK?

542
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:54,097
Yeah. You keep Marko and Dalby
on your side and I'll be fine.

543
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,666
I wasn't talking
about them. I know.

544
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,151
OK.

545
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,474
- Jesus, is that...?
- It's the same as Marko's sample.

546
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,344
It's infected his bloodstream.

547
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,509
Lane... Lane!

548
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,650
No, stop. No...

549
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,118
It's OK.

550
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,288
- You're having another attack.
- I can't...

551
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,057
Can you hear me?

552
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,558
Vincent.

553
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,628
What happened on the Aurora,
what happened on the way over here,

554
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:06,795
it's in the past, alright?

555
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:12,035
- I can't... I can't do it.
- You can do this, OK?

556
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:15,238
I have seen you build a comm system
out of a fucking shaving kit,

557
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,440
so don't tell me
you can't handle this.

558
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:26,249
They're supposed to test us for this shit.
Weed out people like me.

559
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,152
You think the rest of us aren't
on the verge of coming unstuck?

560
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,421
Was Marko acting rationally...

561
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,056
...in the last few days?
Was anyone?

562
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,662
You were.

563
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:42,666
If you think I'm handling this better,
then I'm worried about you.

564
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:47,069
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm barely holding it together.

565
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,238
Vincent.

566
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:56,912
No matter how tight it gets
in there, I will be with you.

567
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,116
I know. Thanks.

568
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,647
Lane, you still there?

569
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,749
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you at the base?

570
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,983
Yeah.

571
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:12,722
Something awful happened here.
There's blood everywhere.

572
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,525
We'll try and keep
Marko and Dalby busy.

573
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,361
We're looking for something
to immobilise them with.

574
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,731
OK. I'm gonna try
and get some power up.

575
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,434
Might take a while.
I'll keep you posted.

576
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,991
- It can't be that simple.
- What can't?

577
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,659
Well, it's a bacteria, isn't it?

578
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,995
We've got a whole range
of antibiotics here.

579
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:56,233
We've got tetracycline, cephalosporin,
erythromycin, penicillin.

580
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,501
And if they do work,
how do we deliver them?

581
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,637
They won't stand there
while we inject them.

582
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,440
Decontamination
spray in the airlock.

583
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,642
We atomize it
in a contained space.

584
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:08,210
We need to find a way
to test it.

585
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:29,224
Come on. Come on, baby.

586
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,645
OK, we've got something.

587
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:52,714
Blood sample 12 is
reacting to the cephalosporin.

588
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,125
Are we gonna do this or not?

589
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,369
Better hold him steady. Irwin?

590
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,073
Get over here.
For fuck's sake, Irwin.

591
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,912
Hold his head.

592
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,085
No pulse. Here goes.

593
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,205
- Captain...
- It's just a reflex.

594
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:53,341
- Maybe he's trying to fight it.
- Brunel's gone. He's not here any more.

595
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,967
Fixed and dilated.

596
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,971
Let's test his blood again.

597
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,376
No multiplication.
Almost zero motility.

598
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:28,711
You sure this
is gonna work as a vapor?

599
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:32,213
It works intravenously,
so it has to.

600
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:40,088
Tantalus base to Aurora.
Do you copy, Aurora?

601
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,228
Tantalus base to Aurora. Mayday, Mayday.
Do you copy, Aurora?

602
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,730
This is Aurora,
we copy your Mayday.

603
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:50,233
Christ, you don't know how good
you guys sound.

604
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:53,068
We've got an emergency
down here. We need...

605
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,073
What the...?

606
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,242
No, no, no...

607
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,748
Oh, shit.

608
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,321
They've just given up.
Kim, they're leaving!

609
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:14,055
They're heading to base.
I can't see them.

610
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,629
We've got to get
them in here, now!

611
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,890
Oh, please. Kim, Kim.

612
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,637
Get a syringe.

613
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,639
Fuck. Where's Marko?

614
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,840
Irwin, get a syringe.

615
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,880
- Just wait.
- What?

616
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:15,817
The bacteria's developing a resistance.
The effect's only temporary.

617
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,432
No, no!

618
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:31,092
Down! Down! Stay down!

619
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,534
Oh, for fuck's sake.

620
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:53,548
Harrington's behind me!

621
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,320
I couldn't seal the tunnel.
Open the panel!

622
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,121
He's in the tunnel.
Harrington's after him.

623
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,559
He hasn't sealed the other end.
Get your helmets on.

624
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:11,666
Open the panel!

625
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,772
- OK?
- Go, go.

626
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,772
Open the fucking panel!

627
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:54,042
Move, move!

628
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,645
Get out of here. We'll follow.

629
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,894
Why won't it open?

630
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,597
The failsafe is set
to lock in case of a breach.

631
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:17,432
I have to reboot
it to get it open.

632
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,505
Irwin. Where's Kim?

633
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:58,539
She didn't make it.

634
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:17,925
Rover One!
Go! Now! Go! Go!

635
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,896
Go!

636
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,942
Don't try and pull it out.
Your suit's breached. Come on.

637
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,677
Hurry up!

638
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:38,579
We need to get to the landing site,
wait for the Aurora crew. Irwin, drive.

639
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,551
- Shit.
- Drive. Just drive.

640
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,684
We need the med unit at base.

641
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,786
Dream on.

642
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:18,888
We don't have the kit here
to close that up.

643
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:22,425
And you think they'll just
sit there and let you do that?

644
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:24,760
What is it, ten hours
till the lander gets here?

645
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:27,230
How long have we
got in this thing?

646
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:30,099
Irwin, I need
power and O2 levels.

647
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,868
OK. I'm on it.

648
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,402
We'll be fine.

649
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:37,238
We'll hole up somewhere
and we'll wait it out.

650
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,810
What's the point in that?

651
01:04:40,811 --> 01:04:47,014
Stop the infection before it takes hold.
Give your body a chance to fight it.

652
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,893
Vincent.

653
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,696
I know.

654
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,466
It's OK.

655
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,003
You're gonna be OK.

656
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:18,646
There's not enough power
to get to the landing site.

657
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,054
Barely half of what we need.

658
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,855
We'd have to finish on foot.

659
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,265
No. We have to go back.

660
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,868
- What?
- We can't go on foot.

661
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:41,704
Lane's hurt. We go back,
we get her patched up.

662
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,106
We can hold 'em off.

663
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,775
- There are other options.
- Like what?

664
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:55,583
Look, Irwin, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

665
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,957
You think you should leave me
behind because I might be infected?

666
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:04,727
That's what you're
thinking, isn't it? Isn't it?

667
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,562
Lane, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help here.

668
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:11,909
But you might be infected, too.
Brunel touched you.

669
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,093
Let's see your neck.

670
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,938
Go on, let's see it.

671
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,841
- Site Nine.
- What?

672
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,877
We've forgotten about Site Nine.
Rover Two, it's still there.

673
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:23,546
It's nearly fully charged.

674
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:27,482
There's enough power to make it
to the landing site.

675
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:33,956
Looks like they're
following our tracks.

676
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,190
Let's get going.

677
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,028
Shit!

678
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,267
Shut down the airlock
and auxiliary cabin power.

679
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,571
Alright.

680
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:10,057
Battery's in the red.
This better work.

681
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,139
I'm gonna go check it out.

682
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,217
I suppose there's no point
in saying be careful.

683
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,221
No. I was planning on taking
a lot of unnecessary risks.

684
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,390
Just don't go
anywhere without me.

685
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,260
No, I'll go.

686
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,035
I have some
serious making up to do.

687
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,438
Let me do this. Please.

688
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,233
Irwin, do you copy?

689
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,435
I'm here. Vincent, I can hear.

690
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,337
Keep your eyes open.

691
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,973
If you see anything move,
haul ass back.

692
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,808
OK.

693
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,988
Irwin, can you hear me?

694
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,660
You OK?

695
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:28,062
Come on, Irwin.
Can you power it up or not?

696
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,902
Talk to me, Irwin.
What's going on?

697
01:09:32,903 --> 01:09:36,871
- Are we on a private channel?
- Why?

698
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,473
- How's Lane?
- What do you mean?

699
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:45,079
She's infected, Vincent.
You need to get out of there.

700
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,349
It's not gonna happen.
Forget it.

701
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,852
Vincent, you're my friend.

702
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,354
But you're not thinking clearly
about this.

703
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,957
Do you think this is about me
trying to save my own skin?

704
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,626
I'm trying to save both of us.
It's too late for her.

705
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,428
I'll give you three seconds
to get back here.

706
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,529
- Just leave her!
- One.

707
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,132
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- Two.

708
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:05,634
- For fuck's sake!
- Three. Shit.

709
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:09,570
Irwin's lost it.
I'm going out there.

710
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,991
Irwin!
I know you can hear me!

711
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:32,560
Don't do anything stupid.
Irwin!

712
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,564
No! Irwin! Wait!

713
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,400
Irwin, please, man.

714
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,570
Oh, fuck!

715
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,042
Vincent, they're coming.

716
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,984
Shit.

717
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,457
We gotta get outta here. Now!

718
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,640
80 degrees east. Into the storm.
It'll hide our tracks.

719
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,075
We've gotta lose
'em before the lander.

720
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:22,276
Battery power is dropping.

721
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:46,502
So they enter our
orbit in eight hours.

722
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:50,739
That is if they come down immediately
without waiting to hear from us.

723
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,910
- So what are our options?
- I don't know. Wait for dawn.

724
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:57,579
The sun should charge the
battery in about an hour,

725
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,015
give us enough juice
to make it to the landing site.

726
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:02,383
And what if they track us down
before then?

727
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:08,457
Then we'll just have to run
them over and over and over

728
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:11,860
- until they stop getting up.
- And waste the last of our power.

729
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:16,363
- That is such a shit plan, Vince.
- I know.

730
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,266
You got anything better?

731
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,076
Do you think they still feel?

732
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,180
No.

733
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,916
Not like us.

734
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,325
Oh, God. I'm so thirsty.
Do we have any water left?

735
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,926
Yeah. Let me check.

736
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,951
We get to the lander, they'll have
a direct line to mission control.

737
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:11,353
They can help.

738
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:14,189
And I always took
you for a pessimist.

739
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:18,092
Yeah, well, I like
to keep 'em guessing.

740
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,735
I keep thinking about Brunel.

741
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,606
I could see him fighting it.

742
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,611
I keep wondering if
he's still in there.

743
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:44,418
Trapped inside his own body,
with no control.

744
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,421
Sounds like hell to me.

745
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,561
Do you think any part of us
survives after death?

746
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:57,598
I don't know. That's a
little bit above my pay grade.

747
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,896
Lane?

748
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,071
This is Aurora broadcasting
on all emergency channels.

749
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:12,441
If there is anyone out there,
we're sending an emergency team to help.

750
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:15,244
Please respond. Please respond.

751
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:18,479
This is Campbell
to Aurora lander.

752
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,089
Campbell to Aurora lander.
Come in, Aurora lander.

753
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:30,090
Come on.

754
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,931
Lane?

755
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,568
Lane?

756
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,706
Shit.

757
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,722
Come on, come on.

758
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,880
Lane. Lane, can you hear me?

759
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,688
Stay back. Stay back.

760
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:41,196
No. I'm not gonna do that.
You know I can't do that.

761
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:46,166
Oh, please. I can't stop it.
I can't stop...

762
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,904
Lane, listen to me.

763
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:56,211
We'll find a way.
OK? I promise you.

764
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,981
We'll find a way.
Just stop, please.

765
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:01,582
Please, Lane, just stop.

766
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:05,385
No. Come on, come on.

767
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,727
Lane! Stop!

768
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,729
Wait!

769
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,932
Stop! Stop!

770
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:20,035
Please! Just stop.

771
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:23,171
You'll get out and walk
in the end.

772
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:26,174
On green grass.
Under blue skies. Won't you?

773
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:29,277
We will. We will.

774
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:33,382
I really wanted to, Vincent.
I really... I really did want to.

775
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:36,918
Lane, listen to me. Just wait.

776
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:40,389
- I'm so sorry.
- Just stop. Please!

777
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,391
I'm sorry.

778
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:43,991
No!

779
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:49,329
Lane.

780
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,139
Shit! No!

781
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:00,874
No! Lane, no.

782
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,079
No!

783
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:12,152
No, please. Please. Lane.

784
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,563
No.

785
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,038
No!

786
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,146
No!

787
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,815
Lane! Don't!

788
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,929
Lane! Look at me! Look at me!

789
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,830
Stop! No!

790
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,202
- Stop!
- Kill me. Please!

791
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:02,769
Kill me.

792
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,108
Kill me.

793
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:45,178
Responding to your Mayday.

794
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,518
Approaching touchdown.
Please make contact.

795
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:52,754
Altitude descending.

796
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:57,726
This is Aurora.
Approaching touchdown.

797
01:19:57,727 --> 01:20:00,362
We have no response
from Campbell.

798
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:07,401
- Prepare for breach conditions.
- Shit.

799
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,540
This is Aurora lander.

800
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,743
- Roger. System check.
- 29 percent fuel capacity.

801
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:17,979
All crew to prepare for exit.
Pressure checks complete.

802
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,382
Immediate ground reconnaissance.

803
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:22,217
Cabin pressure cross check.

804
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:24,252
Aurora lander, please respond.

805
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,254
OK, prepare rear hatch
for exit.

806
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:29,457
Aurora lander, please respond.
Do not open your bay doors.

807
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,627
- Hatch lowering.
- Repeat, do not open your bay doors.

808
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:36,898
We have ground contact.
Channel Nine clear for contact.

809
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:39,568
- Irwin, no!
- Emergency code seven.

810
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,570
Stay outta there! No!

811
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:44,239
We have two
unidentified figures.

812
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,907
I'm going out to meet them.

813
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,509
Something isn't right.

814
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,845
They're not responding
to our transmissions.

815
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,847
We have two
unidentified figures.

816
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,448
Go to seven, go to seven.

817
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,483
- Fuck, what the...
- Help me!

818
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:57,586
Stay back! Captain!

819
01:20:57,587 --> 01:21:01,188
- Jesus!
- Oh, God, no! Help!

820
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,028
Oh, fuck.

821
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,767
Marko.

822
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,851
My little girl.

823
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:21,555
I can't remember her name
any more... to say goodbye.

824
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:24,424
Ella.

825
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,727
Her name is Ella.

826
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:40,275
I wanna feel again, Vincent.
I can't feel my hands.

827
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:42,444
I can't let you do this, Irwin.

828
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:46,513
We can't let this get back to Earth.
It has to end here.

829
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:54,194
You're gonna be OK.

830
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:52,151
Aurora lander to
mission control.

831
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:57,557
This is chief systems officer
Vincent Campbell speaking.

832
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,764
I don't know how much
you guys know but...

833
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,370
The entire crew of Tantalus base
was infected by some sort of...

834
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,706
...virulent bacteria.

835
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:19,781
As far as I know, the Aurora
relief team was lost as well.

836
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:22,582
They're gone.

837
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:26,786
All of them.

838
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:35,630
Lander's in a stable orbit but I don't
have enough fuel to reach the Aurora.

839
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:40,635
I've got the... supplies on board
for the Tantalus's replacement crew.

840
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,904
There's a chance
they might last long enough

841
01:30:42,905 --> 01:30:47,640
for you to send someone
out here, but...

842
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,878
Here's the catch.

843
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,449
There's a...

844
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:01,654
...pretty good
chance I'm infected, too.

845
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:09,063
If that's the case, I've got just
enough fuel left to drop out of orbit

846
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:11,664
and burn up in the atmosphere.

847
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:16,235
At least it'll be quick.

848
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:23,242
You should get this
in about 15 minutes, so...

849
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,517
I guess I'll be waiting.

850
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:36,122
511 Zulu, Aurora lander out.

851
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:28,904
.
