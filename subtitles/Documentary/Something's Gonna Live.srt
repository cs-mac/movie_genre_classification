00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:07,782
<i>We now return to Aaron Sorkin's
new show, The Kitchen.</i>

2
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,317
<i>- Where's the milk? No milk?
- We're out. No.</i>

3
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:10,752
<i>Walk with me.
I want you to get some milk.</i>

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,320
<i>- Where? Now?
- At the store. Right now.</i>

5
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>- Any store? Bloomie's?
- Any store. Is that a joke?</i>

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>- What do you think?
- I think we need milk.</i>

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,291
<i>I think you're right.</i>

8
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:17,459
<i>You know, I never
get tired of hearing that.</i>

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,655
<i>- Should I go get the milk?
- Go get the milk.</i>

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,931
Looks like the power's out again.

11
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,767
What, are we in Iraq?
This happens entirely too often.

12
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,069
Can we tell stories till it comes back on?

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,873
Yeah, Dad. Remember the last time you
told us the story of Star Wars?

14
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:33,408
Maybe you could tell us another one.

15
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,542
Well, all right.

16
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:37,312
This is the story of Black Snake Moan.

17
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:41,082
Once upon a time, Christina Ricci was
all tied up for some reason...

18
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,884
I'm already bored and confused.

19
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:47,287
Yeah, Dad. Isn't there another story like
Star Wars you could tell us?

20
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:51,122
There just might be, Chris.
There just might be.

21
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,897
<i>His boy Elroy</i>

22
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,853
Echo 3 to Echo 7.
Han, old buddy, you read me?

23
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:34,789
Luke, I thought we talked about
this. I changed my code name.

24
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,660
Right. Sorry.
Echo 3 to Carlos Spicy Wiener.

25
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,161
Carlos Spicy Wiener here. Go ahead.

26
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:42,497
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

27
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,666
I'm gonna go check it out. Won't take long.

28
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,468
Okay, but be careful.
There's some snow monsters out there.

29
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,732
Relax, Han, I'll be careful...

30
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,100
Cookie!

31
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,429
Hey, you guys, I hate to do this
to you, but I gotta get out of here.

32
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,098
Hey, what's that
on your jacket? Is that the Purina logo?

33
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,866
- No, it's just a patch.
- I like it.

34
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,301
- Thank you.
- I lied. It's lame.

35
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,429
I won't miss you.

36
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,873
Han, wait.
I thought you said you were gonna stay.

37
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,176
Sorry, I can't.
But I'll give you my email address.

38
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:31,913
It's HanSolo64 @CompuServe. com.

39
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,048
- Comp...
- Yes, CompuServe.

40
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,650
But you can't leave now.

41
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,085
You're a natural leader and we...

42
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,419
Hey. Did you guys order some ice?

43
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,757
'Cause I got a bag of ice here.

44
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,089
Thought you might need some ice.

45
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,396
Yes, there is a lot
of ice around here. We get it.

46
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:50,898
We're having a conversation here.

47
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,768
Hey. I thought
you guys might need some ice.

48
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,100
What? Why would I need ice?
We're surrounded by...

49
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,908
What a day brightener.

50
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,577
Han, we need you.

51
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:06,014
- Really? "We" or "I"?
- What do you mean?

52
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,683
You don't want me to leave
because of the way you feel about me.

53
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,852
I bet you're afraid I'm gonna
leave without giving you a goodbye kiss.

54
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,888
I'd rather kiss George Takei.

55
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,323
Hello.

56
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,996
Man, it's cold in here.

57
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:26,467
Beep-boop-beep. I like all these
electrical wires just nailed to the ice.

58
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,663
That's probably pretty safe, right?

59
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,505
Captain Solo, have you seen Master Luke?

60
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:31,873
'Cause no one knows where he is.

61
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,941
What? Well, that doesn't sound good.

62
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,611
All right, I'm gonna go out
and look for him. I'll take my Don Don.

63
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:40,148
Well, I can't go outside. It's cold out there.

64
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,850
You can't go out there
in this weather. Your Don Don will freeze.

65
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,285
Then I'll see you in hell!

66
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:45,753
Wait, Han. You'll need this.

67
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:48,456
- What?
- Bag of ice.

68
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:51,858
You knucklehead.
Get out of here, but know I love you.

69
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:05,099
Damn these stubby arms!

70
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,417
Well, this is no better.

71
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,125
Me was going to ask you to snow
monster ball, but now forget it!

72
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:05,392
Luke. Luke, pull your pants down.

73
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:07,201
Ben?

74
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,936
You look awful cold.

75
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:12,607
Why don't I get you
a nice hot bowl of Zima soup?

76
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,774
Ben.

77
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,876
Luke.

78
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:20,448
You will go to the Dagobah system and
learn the ways of the Force from Yoda.

79
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,246
Ben.

80
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:28,756
- Luke!
- Ben!

81
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:29,924
Hang on, kid.

82
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:33,427
Yoda. Dagobah system.

83
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:38,058
Zima soup. Yoda. Dagobah.

84
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,435
Last time I was in a dago bar
I was drinking a beer in Little Italy.

85
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:42,770
Go on, get out of here!

86
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:47,105
Well, I can't stand
this cold anymore. I'm gonna die.

87
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,777
Well, it's probably for the best.

88
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:54,214
There are way too many
elderly comedians out here in the snow.

89
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:03,551
This may smell bad, kid,
but it'll keep you warm.

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,621
I thought they smelled bad

91
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,237
on the outside.

92
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:35,156
Captain Solo, do you copy?
This is Overweight Pilot Number 1.

93
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,592
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

94
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:38,893
Who are you looking for?

95
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,428
Captain Solo, there you are!

96
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,591
I'm sorry, I didn't copy that.
Who are you looking for?

97
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,334
Carlos Spicy Wiener, do you copy?

98
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,427
Carlos Spicy Wiener here, go ahead.

99
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,277
They found us, kid.
We're going back to base.

100
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,145
Just as soon as I grab some powder
with these skiing young people.

101
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,489
<i>Get your skis shined up
Grab a stick of Juicy Fruit</i>

102
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,125
<i>The taste is gonna move ya</i>

103
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:14,186
<i>Take a sniff
Pull it out</i>

104
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,833
<i>The taste is gonna move ya
when you pop it in your mouth</i>

105
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,669
<i>Juicy Fruit is gonna move ya</i>

106
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,772
<i>It chews so soft, it gets right to ya</i>

107
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,906
<i>Juicy Fruit</i>

108
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:29,968
<i>The taste, the taste, the taste
is gonna move ya</i>

109
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,047
How you doing, kid?

110
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,716
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off Jennifer Garner.

111
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:37,018
Thanks to you.

112
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,754
Well, your managed-to-keep-me-around-
a- little-longerness,

113
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:42,290
it looks like you managed
to keep me around a little longer.

114
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,792
I assure you, I had nothing to do with it.

115
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah, right.

116
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,130
I think you just can't stand
to let a fat guy like me out of your sight.

117
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:54,830
Why, you stuck up, half-witted,
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

118
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,162
You can't use that word!
Only we can use that word!

119
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,199
The boss is coming. Look busy.

120
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,801
- Lot of Empire stuff to do.
- Empire stuff.

121
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:28,769
- Getting Empire stuff done.
- Busy with Empire stuff.

122
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,771
- Yes, this is good Empire stuff.
- This Empire stuff looks good.

123
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,933
Yes, I think we're done
with this Empire stuff.

124
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,608
Hey, dudes, what you looking at?

125
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,736
We think we found something.

126
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,215
That's it. The Rebels are there.

127
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:44,018
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

128
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,521
It could be a phony!
A big, fat phony!

129
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,123
What'd them Rebels do anyways?

130
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,492
- You know your friend Alan?
- Yeah, I like Alan.

131
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:55,529
- They took his dog.
- They took Zeus? No!

132
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,965
- Central Command to Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey here.

133
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,768
- Jeffrey, them Rebels took Zeus.
- That's Alan's dog.

134
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,270
- I know.
- No!

135
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,772
I know.

136
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:07,741
Set your course for the Hoth system.

137
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,614
Hey, take care of yourself, Chewie.

138
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:16,150
What's this handshake business?

139
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:19,653
Come here. Come on.
Come on, bring it in. Come on.

140
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:21,322
I'm not really a hug person.

141
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:24,091
Knock it off. Come here. Come on, bring it.

142
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,494
Yeah, yeah. Hug it out, bitch.

143
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:28,529
Hug it out, yeah.
Spray that hug all over me.

144
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,797
What's wrong with you?

145
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:32,767
What? I just wanna share
my throbbing emotions

146
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:34,201
and shoot hot hug all over you.

147
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,836
I don't get why that's a problem.

148
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,372
Hey, Luke. Take care of yourself, okay?

149
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:39,507
You, too.

150
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,709
Hey, what'd you end up doing
with that dog we kidnapped?

151
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,411
I killed it and ate it!

152
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,712
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

153
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,647
- Rebels! Rebels!
- Rebels!

154
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,115
- Empire sucks!
- Rebels!

155
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,585
- Rebels! Yeah!
- Yeah, Rebels! Yeah.

156
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,367
Lord Vader,
we've entered the Hoth system,

157
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,403
but the Rebels have put up
an energy shield blocking our entry.

158
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:10,771
What are we gonna do now, buddy?

159
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,240
Admiral Ozzel came out
of light speed too quickly.

160
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,977
Yeah. I had that problem
with a chick the other night.

161
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:21,039
Okay, gross. I'm gonna
turn around and take care of this other guy.

162
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,545
Lord Vader, we're out of light speed and...

163
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,222
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

164
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,724
Didn't know I could choke you
through the TV, did you?

165
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:34,295
Well, I can.
Captain Piett, you're in charge now.

166
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,531
Don't fail me, Admiral Piett.

167
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,733
A promotion? Really?

168
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,169
Can I get business cards
that say "Admiral"?

169
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,939
That's not in the budget. You know,
we're trying to catch Rebels here.

170
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,308
I don't even have business cards.
None of us do.

171
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,909
- Do you have business cards?
- Yeah.

172
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,212
You have business cards?
You're a stormtrooper.

173
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,881
There's like a million of you.
What do you need business cards for?

174
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,249
Well, they're for my cookie business.

175
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,518
I don't want... My God.

176
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,648
That chocolate chip cookie
looks like the Death Star.

177
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:06,360
May I have everyone's attention please?

178
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,429
We're evacuating into outer space,

179
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,232
with literally
Infinite directions in which to flee.

180
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,667
However, we have decided
that our transports

181
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,604
will travel directly toward
the fleet of Star Destroyers.

182
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,839
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,242
Is there someone from the military
we can talk to? A man, perhaps?

184
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,619
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.

185
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,888
Good. Our first catch of the day.

186
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,956
Like you know how to fish.

187
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:38,721
Prepare to fire giant boob-nipple gun.

188
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,447
Feeling okay, sir?

189
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,750
Just like new. How about you, Dack?

190
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,719
I feel like I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

191
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,489
Really? 'Cause that would be awesome.

192
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,720
Hey, everyone, Dack says he's got this one.

193
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:15,325
You know it, bitches!

194
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,999
Hey, Imperial fleet,
get ready to suck some Dack!

195
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,749
- I think we're doomed.
- Nah.

196
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,708
Unless they've got any big, giant
robot camels, I think we're okay.

197
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:45,182
Jim, robot camels.

198
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:53,062
Check it out, that one's wearing Crocs.

199
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,743
Echo Station 5-7, we are on our way.

200
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:04,404
Great. We'll see you in...

201
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:08,749
Echo Station 5-8, we are on our way.

202
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,342
Hurry!

203
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,935
Yes, Lord Vader,
their shield will be down in moments.

204
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,236
You may start your landing.

205
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,505
Excellent. We'll prepare for our descent.

206
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,574
Hey. Hey, Consuela, no cleaning.

207
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,944
No cleaning while I'm doing
the hologram... Shut that off!

208
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:42,116
Mr. Darth, you no have
no more Windex on Star Destroyer.

209
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,551
Well, that's not my problem.
Why don't you go out and buy some?

210
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,954
No. No, you buy.

211
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,490
What if I give you the money,
then you can go out and buy it?

212
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,219
No.

213
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,644
Crap! I'm hit!

214
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,491
OnStar. What is the nature
of your emergency?

215
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:00,828
Yeah, I just got laser torpedoed
by an Imperial walker

216
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,563
and I need roadside assistance.

217
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,799
Of course, sir.
Am I speaking with Admiral Ackbar?

218
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,103
Yeah. Yes. Yes, I'm Admiral Ackbar.

219
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:10,730
It's a trap.

220
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,145
I love you guys.
We had a great summer.

221
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,716
Han! What are you still doing here?

222
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:27,313
Well, I just realized that my spaceship
works better when I have the keys.

223
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,759
Imperial troops have entered the base.
Imperial troops have...

224
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:37,628
Sorry, I dropped the thing.
Imperial troops have entered the base.

225
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,385
Oh, my God, it's pregnant.

226
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,786
We're in a war. We're in a war.

227
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,540
I want the princess captured immediately.

228
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,410
Geez, Gordon, maybe today wasn't the day
to wear your mesh stormtrooper shirt.

229
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:27,080
Sorry, it's just...
I'm going out dancing after work tonight.

230
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:30,951
Oh, my God, I can't remember
the last time I went out dancing.

231
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,887
I think it was Memorial Day,
like, 2 years ago.

232
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,556
No, you know what? It was 4 years ago.

233
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,090
You know how long it was?

234
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:40,685
It was on Alderaan.
That's how long ago it was.

235
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:44,164
Are those guys getting away?
We should probably get those guys.

236
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,862
Those other guys will get them.
So, what else?

237
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:54,608
This bucket of bolts
is never gonna get us past that blockade.

238
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,710
This bucket's got a few surprises
left in her.

239
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:59,112
Plus, me and Chewie are on it.
Ain't that right, Chewie?

240
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:02,482
- Hell, yeah. You my nerf herder.
- You my nerf herder.

241
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,507
All right, Chewie, punch it.

242
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,861
Thank God that hot chick is gone.

243
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,353
Now I can let loose my Darth farts.

244
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,104
Artoo, get her ready for takeoff.

245
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,907
You may not remember,
but I told you last week

246
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,842
I got my niece's recital today.

247
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:40,387
- We gotta sit through this whole thing?
- It's not that much longer.

248
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,690
She's number 7 and there's,
like, 18 people.

249
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,192
Relax, man.

250
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,127
I mean, as long as
she knows you were here...

251
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:50,392
Look, this is happening,
so just come to peace with it.

252
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,873
Hey, this ain't the way
to the rendezvous point.

253
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,441
We're not meeting up with the others.

254
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,375
We're going to the Dagobah system.

255
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,615
Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me.

256
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,951
Hi, yeah, do you know how to
get to the Dagobah system?

257
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,787
Yeah, actually
we're headed there now. You can follow us.

258
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:17,557
Okay, great. Annoying question.
We have to get gas,

259
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,618
would you mind pulling off
and waiting for us while we do that?

260
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,490
Thank you so much.

261
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,414
Han, look!

262
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,746
Crap, there's 2 more of them
dead ahead.

263
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,744
It's all right,
I think I can outmaneuver them.

264
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,864
This Rebel lawbreaker thinks
he can outrun the Empire.

265
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:01,501
The pursuing officers
realize he's entered a residential area.

266
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:05,238
They give him a wide berth,
but they don't let him out of their sight.

267
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:09,843
Astonishingly, the driver makes a left,
right into an asteroid field.

268
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:13,580
What are you doing? You're not actually
going into an asteroid field.

269
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:16,345
Well, it's either that
or go into the strawberry fields.

270
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,052
Hey, you know what
I'm getting into? Is one-legged chicks.

271
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,521
Yeah, Paul,
what's your new wife's name? Peg?

272
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,956
That'll be enough of that, lad.

273
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,057
How about Eileen?

274
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:25,889
Ringo got it.

275
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:34,634
Sir, the odds of successfully
navigating an asteroid field are 2 to 1.

276
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:38,405
Never tell me the...
Actually, that's not bad.

277
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,567
Yeah. No, let's keep going.

278
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,690
Look at that one! Look at that one there!

279
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,535
We're gonna get pulverized out here!

280
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,837
Look, we got 4 or 5 of the
main characters on this ship.

281
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:12,498
I think we'll be fine.

282
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:34,627
There, that looks good.

283
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:38,498
Doesn't that pie look good?
Too bad we can't get at it.

284
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,434
It's in space, and we're in here.

285
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,869
Otherwise, I'd be eating it right now.

286
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,894
All right, let's park right there in that cave.

287
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,338
What are you doing? You can't park there.

288
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:52,212
- You're not handicapped.
- I have vertigo.

289
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:54,081
It's a real medical condition.

290
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,642
I'm just going on record
as saying I'm not comfortable with this.

291
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,962
I hope you know what you're doing.

292
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:12,199
I've just found
that Leia's constant questioning of me

293
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,402
has not been productive
to the atmosphere of the ship.

294
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:19,430
And I think that she just
needs to get some respect for herself.

295
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:28,482
Artoo, wake up, we're here.
Put your shoes on.

296
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,250
You better hurry up and land.

297
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:34,050
The last half hour,
I've been having all pee dreams.

298
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:40,126
All the scopes are dead!
I can't see a thing!

299
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,462
Sorry, that's me.
I was still using an electronic device.

300
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:48,457
Okay, that's much better.
Now I can see the swamp... The swamp!

301
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:59,746
Swamp crashes.
They can land you knee-deep in trouble.

302
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:03,817
But the "good hands" people at Allstate will
make sure you have a soft landing.

303
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,220
Professional service.
Non-threatening black spokesperson.

304
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,188
That's Allstate's stand.

305
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,928
Thank God for these airbags.
You okay back there?

306
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,195
I'm okay, but the midget
inside me's got a head concussion.

307
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,472
No, no, no!

308
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,841
Artoo?

309
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,945
Artoo!

310
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,196
Artoo, are you okay?

311
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:53,428
I think so. Boy, who knows
what else is in this swamp?

312
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,536
Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom!

313
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,504
- Not now!
- Okay.

314
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,543
Hey, who the hell are you?

315
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,349
What the hell is that creepy little thing?

316
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,284
Well, I'm not Yoda.

317
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:12,519
Okay, I'm Yoda.

318
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,154
You're Yoda?

319
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:16,923
You're the one
that Obi-Wan sent me here to find.

320
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,025
Will you teach me the ways of the Force?

321
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:22,195
No, I will not teach you
the ways of the Force.

322
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:24,598
Okay, I'll teach you the ways of the Force.

323
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,134
But if you want to become a Jedi,
first I gotta ask you something.

324
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,436
Did you see Van Wilder?

325
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:30,937
Yeah, I saw it on Comedy Central.

326
00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:35,609
No! No, no, no!
We got a lot of training to do.

327
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,978
I'm asking, did you see
the DVD frat house edition

328
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:41,080
with all the uncensored footage
and the interview with Ryan Reynolds?

329
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,015
No.

330
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,718
Well, that's all part of
mastering the Force, man.

331
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:47,721
It starts with
checking out sweet-ass DVD releases,

332
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:50,624
like Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau.

333
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,493
Yeah, he puts himself
in his own movies, but you don't mind

334
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:57,157
'cause he seems like the kind of guy
who'd help you move if you asked him.

335
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,641
I'm glad you're here.
Look, I pulled this all apart,

336
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,643
and it looks like
you're gonna need a new condenser.

337
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:10,977
Really? A new condenser?

338
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,379
Yeah, and I would also highly recommend

339
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,914
a complete flush
of your photon conversion system.

340
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:16,383
I swear I just did that.

341
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,518
Okay, well, how about this?
Do you want me to just go ahead

342
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,121
and do that
while I'm replacing the new condenser?

343
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,057
I think I'd like to call my husband.

344
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,258
Look, how about this?

345
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,852
You buy the condenser,
and I'll make out with you.

346
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,363
I'm gonna kiss you so hard,

347
00:26:30,364 --> 00:26:33,958
the picture's gonna change
into something else.

348
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:43,743
Look, this isn't Windex
but it's just as good. It's the store brand.

349
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:48,048
- No. No. It leave a film.
- I'm okay with the film. Just use it.

350
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,815
- No. No. I no can clean.
- Shit.

351
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,455
- Hello?
- Mr. Darth Vader...

352
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,825
Yes, sir. Quiet, quiet. It's the Emperor.

353
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,594
- It's the Emperor.
- Tell him I no can do Friday.

354
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,797
- Okay. Okay, okay. Sir... Yeah.
- My apartment need water.

355
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,098
- No, no. No.
- He need to get it fixed.

356
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,268
Hello? I can't hear you.

357
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,932
I'm going to the knee pad.
I'm gonna call you from the knee pad.

358
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,616
What is thy bidding, my master?

359
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:25,985
Hey, I'm downloading
all my music to my iPod

360
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:27,520
'cause I'm getting rid of my CDs.

361
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,856
Do you have any desire for
Natalie Merchant's Tigerlily?

362
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:30,990
No.

363
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,660
- Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill?
- No.

364
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,762
You sure? This thing was unstoppable.

365
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:38,365
This was the soundtrack to my '95.

366
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,601
- To my '95 and my '96, actually.
- No, thank you.

367
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:43,803
- Richard Marx, Hold On To The Night?
- Yes!

368
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,605
I mean... Yeah, no...

369
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,640
I mean, if you're giving stuff away,
yeah, sure.

370
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:48,742
All right, listen.

371
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:51,978
It turns out
Anakin Skywalker's son is still alive.

372
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,414
I'm gonna need you
to find him and turn him.

373
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:57,417
Really? Maybe I can make him go b!,
but all the way is gonna be tough.

374
00:27:57,418 --> 00:27:59,252
No, I mean, turn him to the dark side.

375
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:00,353
Well, yeah, I thought that's what you...

376
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:01,821
- Oh, of the Force.
- Yes.

377
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:04,090
I'll get him over to the dark side.

378
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:06,456
I'll just show him our recruiting video.

379
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,168
Thanks to the training
I received in the Empire,

380
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,365
I have all the skills I need
to make it in the real world.

381
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:23,435
The Empire GI Bill helped me
finish school. Hey, wait up!

382
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:27,313
And I met my wife in the service.
We had our honeymoon on Alderaan.

383
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,441
Good thing we took pictures?

384
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:33,675
The Empire, chasing Rebel scum,

385
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,789
killing Luke's aunt and uncle,

386
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,091
telling people to move along.

387
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:41,823
The Empire, our ships are big triangles.

388
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,935
That's good. Stretch it out, stretch it out

389
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,503
because we're gonna start the training.

390
00:28:50,504 --> 00:28:54,407
I'm ready, Master Yoda.
I'm ready to become a Jedi.

391
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:57,240
All right, kid, let's do it.

392
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:11,116
You know, I'm up for this, but...

393
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,785
it kind of feels like the dark side
has a better gym than us.

394
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,612
There's something out there.

395
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,292
- There's something out there.
- Where?

396
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:53,893
Out there, in the cave!

397
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,462
Crazy women, always hearing things.

398
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:59,329
- There's something out there.
- Let's go check it out.

399
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,837
What's all this slime on the floor?

400
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:07,772
Yeah. It feels like we're
in Rod Stewart's stomach.

401
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,801
Wait a minute.

402
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,311
Hang on a second.

403
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:18,274
What's going on here?

404
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:21,320
Something doesn't add up.

405
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:24,285
Just a minute.

406
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:26,650
Time out.

407
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,620
This ain't quite right.

408
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:33,089
Now I get it. We should go.

409
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:39,269
Hang on, sweetheart. We're taking off.

410
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:45,878
The cave is collapsing!

411
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:48,006
- This is no cave.
- What?

412
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,662
How come I never get
any lines in these things?

413
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:04,926
Shut up, Meg.

414
00:32:13,907 --> 00:32:16,743
All right. Let's take a break.
Your back's getting all sweaty.

415
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,711
Sorry. Does that.

416
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:20,780
All right. Now,
let's go over what we've learned.

417
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:23,850
- Naked chicks. Best?
- Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business.

418
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:26,085
- Good. Worst?
- Kathy Bates in About Schmidt.

419
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:29,889
Correct. I also would've accepted
the rotting old woman in The Shining,

420
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,892
but Kathy Bates is probably worse.
Best scene in Teen Wolf?

421
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:34,460
When Michael J. Fox is in the bathroom,

422
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,062
turning into a werewolf for the first time

423
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,297
and his dad's
knocking on the door and he is freaking out

424
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,967
and he opens the door
and his dad's a werewolf, too.

425
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:42,035
Gold star.

426
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:44,604
I would've also accepted the scene
at the end, at the basketball game,

427
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,806
where the guy
in the crowd has his dick out.

428
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:48,508
- What?
- Yeah, there's a guy at the end.

429
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,310
Go online. Look it up.
He's in the stands, way in the background,

430
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:54,245
and he's totally got his dick out.

431
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:57,684
What's in there? It feels cold.

432
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:00,987
That place is strong with the dark side.

433
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:04,390
But it's very confusing
and it stops the movie dead.

434
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:06,984
I'm going in there anyway.

435
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,986
You know, I guess we should take
advantage of this very rare opportunity.

436
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:41,360
<i>You and I will settle down</i>

437
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:46,666
<i>In a cottage built for 2</i>

438
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,367
<i>Dear little buttercup</i>

439
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:50,470
<i>Sweet little buttercup</i>

440
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:52,538
<i>My little buttercup</i>

441
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:57,533
<i>I love you</i>

442
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:06,219
- I hate these hats.
- Yes, sir.

443
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,921
Okay, nice bounty hunter turnout today.

444
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:13,326
Let's see, we got Robot Guy,
Old Timey Deep Sea Diver Looking Guy,

445
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:16,996
Lizard Guy, who I think
I saw get in a fight with Captain Kirk,

446
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:19,732
Boba Fett, of course,
thanks for coming, and...

447
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,000
What are you supposed to be?

448
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,869
Raggedy Andy.

449
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,305
Get the fuck out
of my bounty hunter meeting.

450
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:35,511
Okay, get ready to go to light speed.
1, 2, 3.

451
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:42,588
Crap.

452
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:43,723
No light speed?

453
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:45,555
No light speed.

454
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,931
I got an idea. Chewie, turn us around.

455
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:53,299
You're gonna attack them?

456
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,168
"You're gonna attack them?"

457
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:56,335
That's how you sound.

458
00:34:56,336 --> 00:34:58,104
"You're gonna attack them?"

459
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,902
Imagine listening to that all day.

460
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,546
They're moving into attack position.

461
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:07,747
Good. Put the shields up.

462
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:10,082
My God! You have cake?
Where'd you get cake?

463
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,813
It was Jim's birthday,
but I think it's all gone.

464
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:22,361
Track them.
They may come around for another attack.

465
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:25,031
Captain, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

466
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:28,267
They can't have disappeared.
No ship that small has a cloaking device.

467
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:31,938
Captain, Lord Vader demands an update
on the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon.

468
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:35,431
Tell him... Tell him we blew it up.

469
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:38,044
He's not on hold and he just heard you.

470
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:39,739
Yeah, I just heard you.

471
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,892
This is insane, Han!
They're gonna find us here.

472
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:55,728
Yeah, and even if they don't,
where are we gonna hide out after this?

473
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,296
Hey, what about Lando?

474
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:58,965
The Lando system?

475
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:01,367
Lando's not a system. He's a black guy.

476
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,836
In fact, I think he might be
the only black guy in the galaxy.

477
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:05,929
Let's hope, right?

478
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:10,009
All right, the fleet's breaking up.

479
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,777
Chewie, get ready
to release the landing claw

480
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,838
and we'll float away
with their garbage. Release!

481
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:22,979
Look at that. Space bums.

482
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,196
Let's be thankful
for what we have, everyone.

483
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:32,255
Be thankful for what we have.

484
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:36,095
My God, I hit a space bum!
Chewie, go, go, go!

485
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,345
All right, concentrate.

486
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,114
What do you see?

487
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:51,284
I see a woman draining your bank account

488
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:54,120
and running off with a real estate agent.

489
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,188
That is a bitch you see.

490
00:36:56,189 --> 00:37:00,819
And I see my friends.
They're in trouble! I gotta save them!

491
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:05,364
Wait, wait, wait. Luke, that's a stupid idea.
You're not done with all your Force stuff.

492
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:07,333
And besides, you can't fight Vader.

493
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,936
Only an experienced Jedi
could fight Vader.

494
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,337
Well, why don't you go?

495
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:15,202
Yeah, you're probably ready to fight Vader.

496
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:24,150
That boy was our last hope.

497
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,176
No, there is another.

498
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:30,451
I know. I have the Force, too, you know.

499
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:44,697
I don't have a landing permit.
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

500
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:46,505
What the hell's he firing at me for?

501
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,774
- I told you not to shoot.
- Well, you're not in charge. I am.

502
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:49,942
- Well, I'm steering.
- No, I'm steering.

503
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:51,110
- No, I am.
- I have a steering wheel.

504
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:52,511
- So do I. There's 2.
- Well, that's stupid.

505
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,879
- I know.
- I know, too. That's why I said it.

506
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,381
- We lost them.
- This is going in my report.

507
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:56,871
No, it's going in my report.

508
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:23,409
- Lando!
- Hey, Han, you crazy old bastard.

509
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,078
Hey, let me introduce everybody.
You remember Chewbacca.

510
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,083
And this is my special friend, Leia.
And that's Sarge over there.

511
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:33,686
You don't know my name, do you?
You never bothered to learn it.

512
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,087
What are you talking about?

513
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:37,890
We've been through
all kinds of space adventures together.

514
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,458
Of course I know you, slugger.

515
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:42,528
- Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you. I'm C-3PO.
- C-3PO, yeah.

516
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,431
I was just gonna introduce you, C-3PO.
Why didn't you let me, C-3PO?

517
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:47,433
Maybe we should go inside.

518
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:48,868
Yeah, let's get inside, C-3PO.

519
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,394
You ever been to Cloud City, C-3PO?

520
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,059
J. Crew outlet store.
My God! Awesome!

521
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,858
Space summer is right around the corner.

522
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,335
My God. What happened?

523
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:27,606
I got into a slap fight with a prep droid
over a pair of cargo shorts.

524
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:29,275
Are you guys all ready for dinner?

525
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:31,844
I don't know,
the time change is really hitting me.

526
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:34,180
I might just stay in the room
and watch bad TV.

527
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:37,249
Geez, it's only like 2 hours earlier
on Hoth. What's the big deal?

528
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,485
I'm having my period, okay?

529
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:43,387
Please come in.
I have nothing to say to Lando.

530
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,261
Okay, the door's gonna open
and you guys say, "Freeze,"

531
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,496
and point your guns at them.

532
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:52,364
Or, you know... Or should it just be me?

533
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,033
Yeah, you know what?
I think that'll be better.

534
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:57,002
Get out. Go, go, go. It's just me.

535
00:39:57,204 --> 00:39:59,296
I wasn't ready. Hi!

536
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:04,509
<i>Wonder Woman</i>

537
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:10,238
Look, the Giant Chicken's Boba Fett.

538
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,855
Very well, Solo, if you won't talk,

539
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:19,091
we have very effective means of torture.

540
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:21,260
Well, I don't want to be tortured.

541
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:23,863
All right, Luke's on Dagobah,
there's a Rebel base on Kashyyyk,

542
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:26,332
and I'm the one who clogged
the toilet on the 16th floor.

543
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,067
That was disgusting!

544
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:31,303
You know, because of that, I had to use
the little pig people's bathroom.

545
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,203
All right, start the torture.

546
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:40,312
<i>Where have all the cowboys gone?</i>

547
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,073
Guys! Shut it off. Shut it off!

548
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,168
This facility should be adequate

549
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,970
to freeze Skywalker
for his trip to the Emperor.

550
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:07,173
We'll test it on Captain Solo.

551
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,574
And as long as we're freezing things,

552
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:11,544
why don't you toss this ice cube tray
full of orange juice in there?

553
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,345
And be careful with the toothpicks.

554
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,780
Lando, Lando. Lando!

555
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,281
Be careful with the toothpicks.

556
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,226
Chewie, you have to take care
of the princess while I'm gone.

557
00:41:27,227 --> 00:41:28,594
Take care of her?

558
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:30,996
- You mean like...
- No. What?

559
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:32,598
No. Just make sure she stays safe.

560
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,260
Okay. That'll be fun for me.

561
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,072
I love you.

562
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:46,938
Fuck off.

563
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:47,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your lightsaber battle.

564
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,678
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

565
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,374
But you are not a Jedi yet.

566
00:42:55,382 --> 00:42:57,116
You're getting there.
You're getting there, though.

567
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:00,518
I can defeat you, Vader. You'll see.

568
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,759
Okay, so, no cutting off body parts.
Let's make that a rule.

569
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,094
No below the belt,
if you know what I'm saying.

570
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:11,297
And you know what?
How about no name calling?

571
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:15,256
You know, let's not have
one of those kinds of lightsaber battles.

572
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:29,314
Car. Car coming!

573
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,414
We're clear.

574
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,370
Nice work, fellas! And, David,
you sold the most magazine subscriptions,

575
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:54,773
so you get to invite 4 of
your friends to a pizza party.

576
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,434
Hurray!

577
00:43:58,078 --> 00:44:01,775
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

578
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:21,200
No. We've lost Han.
They're taking him to Jabba's palace.

579
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,369
Well, even though
we know exactly where he's going,

580
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,599
we should rescue him in 3 years.

581
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:54,299
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

582
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,793
I would give my right hand
for this day to just end.

583
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:05,377
No. Damn it.
They changed the security code.

584
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:08,904
Let me see
if I can do something about that.

585
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:12,985
Hey, baby.
You're gonna let us through, ain't you?

586
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:16,021
Yeah, that's right.
You know that feels good.

587
00:45:16,022 --> 00:45:20,549
God! Nobody's touched me
like that for so long.

588
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:25,097
- No! I think I hear my husband.
- Honey, I'm home.

589
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,966
What the hell is this?
Who's he?

590
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:31,170
Thank God you're home, honey.
He tried to rape me.

591
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,337
That's bullshit.

592
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:34,169
You get out of our home!

593
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:42,542
Oh, man. How am I
supposed to run with this?

594
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,466
Have we ever hit anybody with these guns?

595
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,264
I hit a bird once.

596
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,379
Come on, Luke, join the dark side.
It's really cool.

597
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,211
Well, who's in it?

598
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,619
Me, the Emperor, this guy Scott.
You'll meet him, he's awesome.

599
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,254
And James Caan.

600
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:24,423
I'll be your friend
if you let me kick your ass.

601
00:46:24,424 --> 00:46:28,121
I'll never join the dark side. Never!

602
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:39,370
Hey, a hand.

603
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:44,443
There is no escape.
Don't make me destroy you.

604
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,213
- Join me, Luke.
- I'll never join you.

605
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:51,483
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

606
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:53,352
He told me you killed him.

607
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:55,220
No, I... Hang on.

608
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:56,488
Spoiler alert.

609
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:00,058
Okay. No, I am your father.

610
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:02,294
Well, that's fine,
but I don't see how that affects...

611
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:04,296
What?

612
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:08,300
Join me and we can rule the galaxy
as father and son!

613
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:12,271
You know? I mean, it doesn't have to be
as father and son, it can just be as,

614
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:15,307
you know, as 2 really close guys
who just happen to be men, you know?

615
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,610
Just 2 good-looking guys
sharing a cramped office,

616
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:20,946
running the galaxy together, you know?

617
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:23,682
Just getting the job done, you know?
Maybe we...

618
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:25,951
Maybe we'd do it occasionally,
but it's not weird, you know,

619
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:29,621
'cause we're just 2 guys
with raging goals, you know?

620
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:31,156
I mean, it's not even about
the doing it part,

621
00:47:31,157 --> 00:47:33,887
but that's a part of it,
but it's not the whole thing.

622
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,786
Hey, did you see a hand come down here?

623
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:02,311
No.

624
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,430
Ben. Ben.

625
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,666
Leia. Leia.

626
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,007
Tom Selleck.

627
00:48:31,384 --> 00:48:32,873
Leia.

628
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:40,459
Luke. Turn the ship around.
I know where Luke is.

629
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,327
What, are you out of your mind?
What about those fighters?

630
00:48:42,328 --> 00:48:43,929
I said turn us around!

631
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,566
<i>Turn the ship around</i>

632
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:51,169
<i>Leia knows where Luke is</i>

633
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,007
<i>Turn it upside down</i>

634
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:59,638
<i>Take it back to Bespin</i>

635
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:01,079
Is that him?

636
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,881
I don't know.

637
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:07,148
Luke, if that's you,
wave your right hand!

638
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,920
No, your right hand.

639
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,184
It's me, you fuckers!

640
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,892
- Luke.
- Yeah.

641
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,294
- Luke?
- Yeah?

642
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:51,463
- Wait. Luke Skywalker?
- Yeah.

643
00:49:51,464 --> 00:49:54,366
My God! This is so stupid,
I was trying to call Luke Adams.

644
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,893
His number is right next to yours
in my helmet.

645
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:01,228
So, how's everything been going
since our fight?

646
00:50:01,774 --> 00:50:02,874
It's good.

647
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,377
And, you know,
the offer's still open for the whole

648
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,412
"2 dudes running the galaxy" plan.

649
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,214
Yeah, listen, I gotta go.

650
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,049
Sure, sure, you're busy. It's okay.

651
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,753
All right. Well, I'll talk to you
later, Luke Skywalker, right?

652
00:50:14,754 --> 00:50:16,687
- Yeah.
- Okay.

653
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,167
Prepare to lock the tractor beam
onto the Millennium Falcon.

654
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:31,693
All right, Chewie, punch it!

655
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,377
Oh, man. All right, someone's
getting choked over this.

656
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:40,946
Who was in charge of the tractor beam?

657
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:42,080
That was me.

658
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,582
Yeah? Well...

659
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,643
You have failed me for the last time.

660
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,156
- I can still breathe just fine.
- I know.

661
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:54,285
- You're choking my...
- Yup. 'Cause I'm upset with you.

662
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,785
For the tractor beam thing.

663
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,710
Don't worry, we'll find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter,

664
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:14,012
and we'll get Han back.

665
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:16,481
Why are you wearing Han's clothes?

666
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:18,083
Seriously, watch the actual movie.

667
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:21,781
Lando is wearing Han's clothes
in this scene. It's really weird.

668
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:26,091
Take care, you two.
May the Force be with you.

669
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:29,459
There he goes with that crap again.
Keep it in church, man.

670
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,131
All right. Is this thing good to go?

671
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,033
Yeah, but practice on a hot dog first.

672
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,899
Otherwise you might rip your dick off.

673
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,473
Someday, I'm gonna buy my moms
a place with a view like this.

674
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:18,577
Wait a minute. This is how it ends?

675
00:52:18,578 --> 00:52:21,179
There's so many questions
left unanswered.

676
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,948
Are you Luke Skywalker?

677
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:25,650
- Yeah.
- I've got something for you.

678
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:27,379
A letter.

679
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:31,456
"Dear Luke, if my calculations are correct,

680
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:35,093
"you should receive this letter at the exact
moment the DeLorean vanished.

681
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:39,598
"I have been living happily for the
past 6 months in the year 1885.

682
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,732
"The lightning bolt that... "

683
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:43,902
1885! The doc's alive!

684
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,201
I mean, he's in the Old West,
but he's alive!

685
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,600
Subtitles: Arigon

686
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,979
The end.

687
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:04,589
Well, let's see Robot Chicken top this one.

688
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,792
Actually, I think they did a pretty
good job of that already, Dad.

689
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:10,829
Well, I'll have to take your word for it.
I don't watch Comedy Central.

690
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,466
It's on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, Dad.
I'm pretty sure you know that.

691
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:16,801
I don't know that.
I haven't seen that show in a while

692
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,470
and I don't know that anyone else has.

693
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:21,606
I think plenty of people have.
Their fans are pretty loyal to them.

694
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,475
Yeah? All 42 of them?

695
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,944
I'm not gonna let you get
to me this time, Dad.

696
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:27,412
I'm not gonna let you get to me.

697
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,447
Well, maybe I got time
for another story then.

698
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:30,782
It's called Without A Paddle.

699
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:32,746
Fuck you, Dad!
