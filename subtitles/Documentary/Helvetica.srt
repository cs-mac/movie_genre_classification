1
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,210
Type is saying things to us all the time.

2
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,838
Typefaces express a mood,
an atmosphere,

3
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,784
they give words a certain coloring.

4
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,020
Everywhere you look, you see typefaces.

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,216
But there's probably one you see more
than any other one, and that's Helvetica.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,729
You know, there it is, and it just seems to
come from nowhere.

7
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,857
lt seems like air, it seems like gravity.

8
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,297
lt's hard to evaluate it,

9
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,700
it's like being asked what you think about
off-white paint,

10
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,931
it's just, there.

11
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,238
lt's hard to get your head around
something that big.

12
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,707
Most people who use Helvetica use it
because it's ubiquitous.

13
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,716
lt's like going to McDonalds instead of
thinking about food.

14
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,411
Because it's there, it's on every street
corner.

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,148
So let's eat crap, because it's on the
corner.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,417
For me, Helvetica's just this beautiful,
timeless thing.

17
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,960
And certain things shouldn't be messed
with, you know?

18
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,801
Graphic design is the communication
framework,

19
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,636
through which these messages, about
what the world is now

20
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
and what we should aspire to,

21
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,945
it's the way they reach us.

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,416
The designer has an enormous
responsibility,

23
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,545
those are the people putting their wires
into our heads.

24
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,585
Now should l talk? Should l not talk?

25
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,718
You want me to say something?

26
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,089
Say something, say nothing?

27
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,431
The life of a designer is a life of fight:

28
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,990
fight against the ugliness.

29
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,801
Just like a doctor fights against disease.

30
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,500
For us, the visual disease is what we have
around,

31
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,545
and what we try to do is to cure it
somehow, with design.

32
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:17,550
A good typographer always has sensitivity
about the distance between the letters.

33
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,458
We think typography is black and white.

34
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,654
Typography is really white, it's not even
black.

35
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,621
lt is the space between the blacks that
really makes it.

36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,234
ln a sense it's like music,

37
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,704
it's not the notes, it's the space you put
between the notes that makes the music.

38
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,068
For instance, we designed the corporate
identity for American Airlines.

39
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,113
This was done in 1966,

40
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,241
and the novelty at the time was the fact of
making one word instead of two

41
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,582
American Airlines by making
AmericanAirlines all one word,

42
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,617
half red and half blue, just separated
by the color.

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,824
What could me more American than red
and blue? You know, so it's perfect.

44
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,062
lt's the only airline in the last forty years
that has

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,930
not changed their identity.

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,461
All the airlines coming and going and
changing... American Airlines is still the
same. There's no need to change,

47
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,442
and how can they improve it?

48
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,879
They got the best already: American
Airlines in Helvetica.

49
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,085
We always had a tendency to use
very few typefaces.

50
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,119
lt's not that we don't believe in type.

51
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,853
We believe there are not that many
good typefaces.

52
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,761
lf l want to be really generous
there's a dozen,

53
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,956
basically l use no more than three.

54
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,731
There are people that think that type
should be expressive.

55
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,033
They have a different point of view
than mine.

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,172
l don't think type should be
expressive at all.

57
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,338
l can write the word 'dog' with any typeface

58
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,507
and it doesn't have to look like a dog.

59
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,643
But there are people that think when they
write 'dog' it should bark!

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,421
What Helvetica is: it's a typeface that was
generated

61
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,486
by a desire of having better legibility.

62
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,903
lt is a modern type. lt is a very clear type.

63
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,296
lt's good for everything, pretty much.

64
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,534
You can say l love you in Helvetica.

65
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,842
And you can say it with Helvetica Extra
Light if you want to be really fancy.

66
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,873
Or you can say it in Extra Bold if it's really
intensive and passionate,

67
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,917
and it might work.

68
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,055
You can also say l hate you.

69
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:37,188
l can write . . . l certainly can write a few
letters in Helvetica saying that . . .

70
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,835
to Washington D.C. in particular,
if l can put it that way.

71
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,701
When Helvetica came about, we were all
ready for it.

72
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,268
lt just had all the right connotations we
were looking for,

73
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,008
for anything that had to spell out
loud and clear: modern.

74
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,752
The 1950s is an interesting period in the
development of graphic design.

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,195
ln that postwar period,

76
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,699
after the horror and the cataclysm of the
Second World War,

77
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,466
there's a real feeling of idealism among
some designers, many perhaps,

78
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,733
across the world, certainly in Europe,

79
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:26,245
that design is part of that need to rebuild,
to reconstruct,

80
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:31,045
to make things more open,

81
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,177
make them run more smoothly, be more
democratic.

82
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,383
There was this real sense of social
responsibility among designers.

83
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:44,931
And this is the period when the early
experiments of the high Modernist period

84
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,891
start to be broken down, rationalized,
codified,

85
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,202
you get the emergence of this so-called
international typographic style

86
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,071
or Swiss style.

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,843
And it's Swiss designers in the 1950s who
are really driving that along.

88
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,006
This is where Helvetica comes in.

89
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,382
Helvetica emerges in that period, in 1 957,

90
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,854
where there's felt to be a need for rational
typefaces

91
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,893
which can be applied to all kinds of
contemporary information,

92
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,728
whether it's sign systems or corporate
identity

93
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,035
and present those visual expressions of
the modern world to the public

94
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,801
in an intelligible, legible way.

95
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,601
So, it's underpinned, is what l'm saying

96
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,336
by this great feeling shared by many
designers of idealism.

97
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,156
l'm a Modernist, you know.

98
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,892
l was trained in that period,

99
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,763
l lived in that period. l love Modernism.

100
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,202
l go next week to London to see the
exhibition of Modernism.

101
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,740
l want it, you know.

102
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,133
And well, that's my life.

103
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:44,410
l'm surrounded with furniture from that
period. l can't change myself any more.

104
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,317
But if l see today designers, they use all
typefaces-one day one typeface,

105
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:54,189
the other day the other typeface, all in
favor of a certain atmosphere,

106
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,429
l'm not . . . l don't like that.

107
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,502
l'm always interested in clarity.

108
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,439
lt should be clear,

109
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,341
it should be readable, it should be
straightforward.

110
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,912
So l started using, gradually, grids for my
design,

111
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,415
for my catalogues for museums.

112
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,815
l invented a grid, and within the grid

113
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,149
l played my game.

114
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,514
But always along the lines of the grid,

115
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,955
so that there is a certain order in it.

116
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,759
That's why l use grids,

117
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,429
that's why they call me ''Gridnik.''

118
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,865
For me, it's a tool of creating order,

119
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,702
and creating order is typography.

120
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,802
l started late with the computer.

121
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,902
l think it was in 1993 that l bought my first
computer

122
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,150
and l learned myself and l can handle it
now quite well

123
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,516
but not like the young people.

124
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,147
l am slow with it and l can do it.

125
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,415
But l'm very much interested and

126
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,461
l would have liked to have in the sixties the
computer

127
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,928
because we can speed up our work, we
can do it so much better,

128
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,035
and especially all the layers you can bring
into your work.

129
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,842
We had the greatest problem in the sixties
to bring two or three layers into the work.

130
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,836
You need to do it by photograph, you did all
kinds of crazy techniques

131
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,472
and working on a poster took us days.

132
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:31,015
And now within half an hour you have your
ideas and you can make variations

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,689
and make a good choice.

134
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,352
You can't do better design with a computer,

135
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,899
but you can speed up your work
enormously.

136
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,730
Shall l begin?

137
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,064
l made these post stamps on the Stijl
movement.

138
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,874
ln the beginning, if you see the sketches,

139
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:55,109
l tried to use typefaces from van Doesburg,
one of the artists of the Stijl movement.

140
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,384
Then l decided for the final designs

141
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,616
not to use these typefaces because the
illustration is already from that period,

142
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:07,454
and l used the most neutral typeface-
Helvetica.

143
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:13,729
Helvetica was a real step from the
nineteenth-century typefaces.

144
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,324
lt was a little more machined,

145
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,739
it was doing away with these manual
details in it,

146
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:30,074
and we were impressed by that, because it
was more neutral.

147
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,274
And neutralism was a word that we loved.

148
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,615
lt should be neutral;

149
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,154
it shouldn't have a meaning in itself. lt
should . . .

150
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,390
the meaning is in the content of the text,
not in the typeface.

151
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,260
That's why we loved Helvetica very much.

152
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,748
l have to say that for a lot of my life

153
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,151
l rather dreaded the moment of having to
explain to someone...

154
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,522
you know, you find yourself sitting next to
some nice person on a plane

155
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,582
or a train and they ask you sooner or later
what you do

156
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,198
and if you say type designer, they
generally look completely blank.

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,968
Occasionally, someone will actually know
the term

158
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,061
but then will say, ''l thought they were all
dead.''

159
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,135
Since l did some work for Microsoft in the
mid-nineties on screen fonts,

160
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,473
particularly Verdana and Georgia,

161
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,373
l've had quite comical encounters with
people who will say,

162
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,914
''Oh, you work with fonts.

163
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,554
We just got this memo round the office
saying we've all got to start using
something called Verdana.

164
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,553
Have you ever heard of it?''

165
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:24,153
Funny conversations that never would
have happened to me

166
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,754
thirty, forty years ago.

167
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:32,401
My dad was a typographer, and although
he didn't push me to follow in his footsteps

168
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:39,867
when l left school, high school in the UK, l
had a year to fill before going to university

169
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,282
and l got sent as a trainee, an unpaid
trainee, intern,

170
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,217
to a type foundry in the Netherlands,

171
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,922
where l spent a year learning what turned
out to be a completely obsolete trade

172
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,057
of making type by hand.

173
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:57,085
lt was a matter of cutting letters in steel,
engraving them at actual size.

174
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:03,265
You know, l doubt if l ever got up quite to
one letter a day at that time.

175
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,773
So, you know, l could say that really l've
made type by practically all the means

176
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,539
it's ever been made in the fifty, fifty-one
years that l've been working.

177
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,075
lt's hard to generalize about the way type
designers work.

178
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,883
There isn't a generality of us.

179
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,087
But l think that most type designers if they
were sitting in this chair

180
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,386
would essentially start in much the same
way.

181
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,394
l'd probably start with a lowercase h.

182
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,164
it tells me, first of all, whether this is a sans
serif or a serif typeface.

183
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,534
lf it were a serif face it would look like this

184
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,003
here are the serifs so called, these little
feet

185
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,370
on the bottom and top of the principal
strokes of the letter.

186
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,871
Are they heavy, are they light, what is the
nature of the serif,

187
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,380
is there a lot of thick-thin contrast in the
letter form;

188
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,788
what are the proportions of the overall
height, the ascender, so-called of the h,

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,813
and the x-height part of it,

190
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,993
Then because an h is a straight-sided
letter,

191
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,485
l would then do a round letter like an o
along side it.

192
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:12,101
l can get a sense of how the weight of the
curved part of the o relates to the straight
part of the h.

193
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,473
And already there is a huge amount of
DNA is just a couple of letterforms like that.

194
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,839
l'd then probably do something like a
lowercase p

195
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,343
because it's half straight and half round;

196
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,448
and also it has a descending stroke,

197
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,587
which is another vertical dimension that l
would be interested in establishing.

198
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,389
Then l would then build on that.

199
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,391
lf you've got an h you've got an awful lot of
information

200
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
about m, n, and u in the lower case.

201
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,528
lf you've got a p you've got q and b and d
and so on.

202
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,468
And then just as soon as possible l would
get them into words

203
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,436
or something that looked like words

204
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:51,032
because for me the experience of reading
something is so critical in judging it as a
typeface

205
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:56,045
because l find that is the acid test of how a
typeface performs.

206
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,558
One of the most characteristic and to my
mind beautiful things about Helvetica

207
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,257
is these horizontal terminals, you see in the
lower case a and c and e and g.

208
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,629
The whole structure is based on this
horizontal slicing off of the terminals.

209
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,440
It's very hard for a designer to look at these
characters and say,

210
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,676
how would l improve them? How would l
make them any different?

211
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,667
They just seem to be exactly right.

212
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,271
l'm glad no one asked me to

213
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,017
second-guess Helvetica

214
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,485
because l wouldn't know what to do.

215
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,714
This is the original type specimen of
Helvetica

216
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,352
before it was Helvetica. lt had its original
name, Die Neue Haas Grotesk.

217
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,395
The whole story of how Helvetica came
into being

218
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,091
is not entirely clear, at least to me.

219
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,171
lt is said, and l think it's true,

220
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,767
that Eduard Hoffmann, who had been the
boss at Haas type foundry,

221
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:02,548
wished to make a modernized version of
Akzidenz Grotesk,

222
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,984
which was essentially a traditional
nineteenth-century German sans serif,

223
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,489
and his method of doing that was sort of to
clean it up and so on.

224
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,159
And it was of course Max Miedinger who
made the drawings for Helvetica.

225
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,823
l received the impression from people l
knew back in the sixties and seventies

226
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:24,770
that Hoffmann's part in this was a very
much more significant one

227
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,441
than you might just assume by reading in a
textbook

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,807
that Max Miedinger was the designer of
Helvetica.

229
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,077
You can easily say this was a joint product

230
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,615
of both Miedinger and my father.

231
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,574
Miedinger couldn't produce a typeface
alone;

232
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,021
neither could my father.

233
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:21,516
But when both were working hard together
then something good resulted.

234
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:33,537
Here are the first trials of Neue Haas
Grotesk,

235
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,302
which was the first name of Helvetica.

236
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,881
l knew the way things worked at Haas

237
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,341
and l had gradually picked up on the
importance of Eduard Hoffman,

238
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,153
and his almost pathological shyness

239
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:58,821
and the way that he would use other
people's hands.

240
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,863
But boy could you see his mind at work on
the faces

241
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,229
where he was deeply involved.

242
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,473
You have here a note by Eduard Hoffmann

243
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,979
indicating all the desired corrections.

244
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,082
''The capital Y is too slim.

245
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,779
The capital A is also too slim.''

246
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:29,127
When you talk about the design of Haas
Neue Grotesk or Helvetica,

247
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,768
what it's all about is the interrelationship of
the negative shape

248
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,137
the figure-ground relationship,

249
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,732
the shapes between characters and within
characters,

250
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,369
with the black if you like, with the inked
surface.

251
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,948
And the Swiss pay more attention to the
background,

252
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:56,012
so that the counters and the space
between characters just hold the letters.

253
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,857
l mean you can't imagine anything moving;

254
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,293
it is so firm.

255
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,229
lt's not a letter that's bent to shape;

256
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:11,101
it's a letter that lives in a powerful matrix of
surrounding space.

257
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,330
lt's . . . oh it's brilliant when it's done well.

258
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,578
My father had clear ideas

259
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,147
how the typeface should look.

260
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:28,017
So my father and Miedinger sat together,
and he started drawing.

261
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,385
Here you have a proof of an alphabet

262
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,983
with observations by Max Miedinger.

263
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,464
When Miedinger worked for Haas he did
not work as a designer.

264
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,166
He was actually a salesman.

265
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,068
His job was to travel around Switzerland

266
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,332
taking orders for fonts of type.

267
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,399
By profession he was a graphic artist,

268
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,376
but he realized that he could make more
money by selling foundry type.

269
00:21:54,246 --> 00:22:04,022
But my father said, lf ever l have an idea of
a new typeface, l'm sure that you could
design it.

270
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:09,153
l have here a type specimen book

271
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,398
of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas.

272
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:20,895
You have to know that Haas was
controlled by the German type foundry
Stempel.

273
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:28,479
And in turn Stempel was also controlled by
Linotype.

274
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,527
Now we go down to the cellar and see in
our archives where we can find Helvetica.

275
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,715
Here we have number 24.

276
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,382
And there it is, the Helvetica drawings.

277
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,825
The marketing director at Stempel had the
idea to give it a better name

278
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:27,595
because Neue Haas Grotesk didn't sound
very good for a

279
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:32,403
typeface that was intended to be sold in
the United States.

280
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:39,280
Stempel suggested the name of Helvetia.

281
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:45,016
This is very important: Helvetia is the Latin
name of Switzerland.

282
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,560
My father said, That's impossible.

283
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,625
You cannot call a typeface after the name
of a country.

284
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,461
So he said, why don't you call it Helvetica.

285
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,173
So in other words this would be the Swiss
typeface.

286
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,439
And they agreed.

287
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,850
l think Helvetica was a perfect name at the
time.

288
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,187
Swiss typography at that time

289
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,748
was well-known worldwide.

290
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,959
So it was the best solution for Helvetica

291
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,488
to get into the market.

292
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:28,322
Once we'd introduced Helvetica, it really
ran away.

293
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,862
lt was exactly what the designers were
looking for.

294
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,309
l mean, l don't think there's been such a
hot thing since

295
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,270
as the figure-ground relationship properly
executed

296
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:49,154
and it was. . . oh, just a landslide waiting to
go down the mountain.

297
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,452
And away it went.

298
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,085
l imagine there was a time when it just felt
so good

299
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:25,853
to take something that was old and dusty
and homemade and crappy looking

300
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,293
and replace it with Helvetica.

301
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:34,198
lt just must have felt like you were scraping
the crud off of like filthy old things

302
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,135
and restoring them to shining beauty. And
in fact

303
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:41,973
corporate identity in the sixties, that's what
it sort of consisted of.

304
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:49,812
Clients would come in and they'd have
piles of goofy old brochures from the fifties

305
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,040
that hide like shapes on them and goofy
bad photographs.

306
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,622
They'd have some letterhead that would
say Amalgamated Widget on the top

307
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,716
in some goofy, maybe a script typeface,
above Amalgamated Widget

308
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,162
it would have an engraving showing their
headquarters

309
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,360
in Paducah, lowa, with smokestacks
belching smoke

310
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:13,738
you know, and then you go to a corporate
identity consultant circa 1 965, 1966,

311
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,475
and they would take that and lay it here
and say, Here's your current stationery,

312
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,278
and all it implies, and this is what we're
proposing.

313
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,475
And next to that, next to the belching
smokestacks and

314
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,382
the nuptial script and the ivory paper,

315
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,615
they'd have a crisp bright white piece of
paper

316
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,459
and instead of Amalgamated Widget,
founded 1 857,

317
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,463
it just would say Widgco, in Helvetica
Medium

318
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,932
Can you imagine how bracing and thrilling
that was?

319
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,735
That must have seemed like you'd crawled
through a desert

320
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,538
with your mouth just caked with filthy dust

321
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,976
and then someone is offering you a clear,
refreshing, distilled, icy glass of water

322
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:57,816
to clear away all this horrible, kind of like,
burden of history.

323
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,019
lt must have been just fantastic. And you
know it must have been fantastic

324
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,011
because it was done over and over and
over again.

325
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:11,490
So this is what l'm talking about, this is Life
Magazine 1 953.

326
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:18,898
One ad after another in here, that just kind
of shows every single visual bad habit that
was endemic in those days.

327
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,907
You've got zany hand lettering everywhere,

328
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,240
swash typography to signify elegance,

329
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,077
exclamation points, exclamation points,
exclamation points.

330
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,817
Cursive wedding invitation typography
down here reading,

331
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,183
''Almost everyone appreciates the best.''

332
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,757
This was everywhere in the Fifties, this is
how everything looked in the Fifties.

333
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:43,895
You cut to - this is after Helvetica was in
full swing - same product.

334
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,455
No people, no smiling fakery,

335
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,502
just a beautiful big glass of ice-cold Coke.

336
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,528
The slogan underneath: lt's the Real Thing,

337
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,372
period.

338
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,203
Coke, period.

339
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:56,875
Punkt.

340
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,444
ln Helvetica, period.

341
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:03,715
Any questions? Of course not. Drink Coke,
period.

342
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,704
Simple.

343
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,852
Governments and corporations love
Helvetica

344
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,946
because on one hand it makes them seem
neutral and efficient,

345
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,125
but also the smoothness of the letters
makes them seem almost human.

346
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,256
That is a quality they all want to convey

347
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,435
because of course they have the image
they are always fighting

348
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,638
that they are authoritarian they're
bureaucratic,

349
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,129
you lose yourself in them, they're
oppressive.

350
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,543
So instead, by using Helvetica

351
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,147
they can come off seeming more
accessible, transparent, and accountable,

352
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,084
which are all the buzzwords for what
corporations

353
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,853
and governments are supposed to be
today.

354
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:46,257
Now they don't have to be accessible or
accountable or transparent

355
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,192
but they can look that way.

356
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,494
Our tax forms from the lRS are in
Helvetica.

357
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,138
The EPA uses it

358
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:04,666
now there's someone who wants to look
clean and official and efficient.

359
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:37,968
Designers, and l think even readers, invest
so much of the surroundings in the
typeface.

360
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,577
American Apparel uses Helvetica and it
looks cheeky.

361
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,449
American Airlines uses it and it looks
sober.

362
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,719
And it's not just a matter of the weight they
use and the letter spacing and the colors.

363
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,883
There's something about the typeface l
think really invites this sort of open
interpretation.

364
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,929
l suppose you could say the typefaces are
either

365
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,521
those that are fully open to interpretation

366
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,355
or merely have one association attached to
them.

367
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,738
A typeface made of icicles or candy canes
or something just says one thing.

368
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,872
And Helvetica maybe says everything.

369
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,806
And that's perhaps part of its appeal.

370
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,381
Typography has this real poverty of terms
to describe things.

371
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,184
Beyond x height and cap height and weight
and so on.

372
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,519
l find when Tobias and l work on projects
together

373
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,647
we tend to use a lot of qualitative terms
that are entirely subjective.

374
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:28,159
Working on the typeface for Esquire years
ago, l remember us saying,

375
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,765
l remember my saying, No this has that
Saturn 5 rocket early NASA quality.

376
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,870
lt needs to have that orange plastic Olivetti
typewriter, Roman Holiday espresso
feeling.

377
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,472
l know you got exactly what l was saying.
-l did. -

378
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,704
But it's that there's really no way to
describe the qualitative parts

379
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,912
of a typeface without resorting to things are
fully outside it.

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:52,050
And we're constantly saying, You know,
this has that, it feels kind of Erik Satie;

381
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,384
it needs to be Debussy.

382
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,716
Or this has a kind of belt and suspenders
look.

383
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,689
lt needs to be, you know, much more
elegant. . . hand-lasted shoe.

384
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,896
l've been collecting these signs for a
couple of years now

385
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:14,239
and one of my favorites is these signs. l
have a number of these.

386
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,674
This is what the street signs in New York
City used to look like.

387
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,078
This actually functions so much more
clearly

388
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,105
and so much more effectively than what we
see out on the street now.

389
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,485
The sort of classical modernist line on

390
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,155
how aware a reader should be of a
typeface

391
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,191
is that they shouldn't be aware of it at all.

392
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,360
lt should be this crystal goblet

393
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,964
there to just hold and display and organize

394
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:46,638
the information. But l don't think it's really
quite as simple as that.

395
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,540
l think even if they're not consciously

396
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:55,013
aware of the typeface they're reading,
they'll certainly be affected by it.

397
00:31:55,013 --> 00:32:00,417
The same way that an actor that's miscast
in a role will affect someone's experience

398
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,855
of a movie or play that they're watching.
They'll still follow the plot,

399
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,724
but, you know, be less convinced or
excited or affected.

400
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,963
l think that typography is similar to that,

401
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:18,732
where the designer choosing typefaces is
essentially a casting director.

402
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,174
There's very little type in my world outside
of work.

403
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:28,346
Like everybody else l'm aware of fonts
being used in my environment.

404
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,349
You know, the standing joke that graphic
designers can't see historical movies

405
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,544
because the fonts are always wrong is
certainly true.

406
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,486
lt definitely makes the world outside the
office very different.

407
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:43,895
My fiancé and l were trying to remember
the location of a restaurant

408
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:48,764
in our neighborhood, and she remembered
it as that new place

409
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,469
that's just a couple blocks down from the
dry cleaner.

410
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,105
l remembered it as that new place just a
couple blocks down from

411
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,471
the place with the bad letter spacing out
front.

412
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,678
Nobody doesn't know what Helvetica is,

413
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,148
l mean, at the beginning of our careers
certainly before anybody had a PC or a
Mac,

414
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,950
no one knew what fonts were.

415
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,441
l think even then people might have known
what Helvetica was.

416
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,657
The fact that it's been so heavily licensed

417
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,827
and made available through these very
populist technologies

418
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,321
has kind of furthered the mythology that it's
the ultimate typeface in some way.

419
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,566
And even for us professionals that's hard
to escape from.

420
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,136
l kind of find myself buying into the idea

421
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,205
that ''Oh, the sans serif evolved for a
hundred years

422
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,474
and the ultimate expression was
Helvetica.''

423
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,841
And realizing, wait a minute that's not quite
true, historically

424
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,780
or aesthetically or culturally or politically.

425
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,618
But there's something about it that does
the feeling of finality to it,

426
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:44,655
the conclusion of one line of reasoning was
this typeface,

427
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:49,217
and perhaps everything after it is
secondary in some way.

428
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,027
l'm obviously a typomaniac, which is an
incurable, if not mortal, disease.

429
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,469
l can't explain it l just love, l just like
looking at type,

430
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,801
l just get a total kick out of it. They are my
friends.

431
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:45,376
Other people look at bottles of wine or
whatever, or girls' bottoms,

432
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,707
l get kicks out of looking at type.

433
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,076
lt's a little worrying l must admit, it's a very
nerdish thing to do.

434
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,078
l'm very much a word person.

435
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,952
So that's why typography for me is the
obvious extension.

436
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,715
lt just makes my words visible.

437
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,492
A real typeface needs rhythm, needs
contrast; it comes from handwriting.

438
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,594
That's why l can read your handwriting,
and you can read mine.

439
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,863
And l'm sure our handwriting is miles away
from Helvetica

440
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,899
or anything that would be considered
legible.

441
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,501
But we can read it because there's a
rhythm to it, there's a contrast to it.

442
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,936
Helvetica hasn't got any of that.

443
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,372
|Why is it fifty years later still so popular?|

444
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,679
l don't know. What is bad taste ubiquitous?

445
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,341
No, actually, Helvetica was a good
typeface at the time.

446
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,118
lt really answered a demand.

447
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,620
But now it's become one of those defaults
that,

448
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,488
partly because of the proliferation of the
computer, which is now twenty years,

449
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,459
the PC l mean,

450
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,298
it was the default on the Apple Macintosh
and then it became the default on Windows

451
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,633
which copied everything that Apple did, as
you know.

452
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,537
lnterface and everything else, and then
they did the clone version, Arial,

453
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,940
which is worse than Helvetica but

454
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,677
fills the same purpose l think. Now it's
probably never going to go away

455
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:57,341
because it's ubiquitous; it's a default. lt's
air,

456
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,509
you know, it's just there. There's no choice.

457
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,019
You have to breathe, so you have to use
Helvetica.

458
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,056
lt brings style with it; every typeface does.

459
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,191
lt has a certain,

460
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,294
well, it's like a person, if you are slightly
heavy in the middle

461
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,630
you're not going to walk around in tight T-
shirts. You'd look like an idiot.

462
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,966
And Helvetica is heavy in the middle. So it
has a certain,

463
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,535
it needs certain space around it, needs a
lot of white space;

464
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,505
it needs very carefully to be looked at the
weight gradations.

465
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,474
lt needs a lot of space sideways also.

466
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,010
Then it's very legible, but

467
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,380
very small and very tightly done and very
lightly as modern designers do,

468
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,082
it's a nightmare, a total nightmare.

469
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,845
l wouldn't say this if l hadn't tried it.

470
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,854
Because all the letters . . . it's the whole
Swiss ideology;

471
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,557
the guy who designed it tried to make all
the letters look the same.

472
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,694
Hello??? You know, that's called an army.
That's not people.

473
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,730
That's people having the same fucking
helmet on.

474
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,132
lt doesn't further individualism.

475
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,502
And the aim with type design always is to
make it individual enough

476
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,737
so that it's interesting,

477
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,407
but of course ninety-five percent of any
alphabet has to look like the other alphabet

478
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,897
otherwise you wouldn't be able to read it.

479
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,583
l've never sort of woken up with a typeface
coming out,

480
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,386
you know, like some people . . . l've got to
do this, and they go to their,

481
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,082
whatever, their easel, and these amazing
brush strokes.

482
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,856
l don't have that urge.

483
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,983
You know, l wake up and usually l want to
go back to sleep.

484
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,155
l mean, everybody puts their history into
their work.

485
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,134
l certainly know that when l draw
something it has

486
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,470
l'm fast, l'm loud, l'm chaotic,

487
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,909
l'm not very rule based, even though l'm
German and l love rules,

488
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:37,281
l'm a Gemini, l had my birthday yesterday,
so l'm all over the place essentially.

489
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,251
l'm always on time, but a year late, you
know what l mean,

490
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,520
but then l'm on the second.

491
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,091
So l have this horrible thing, which comes
out in my typefaces.

492
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,593
They're never perfect. They always have a
little edge

493
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,255
in the sense that l leave them alone when l
get bored with them.

494
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,923
l know there's people who hate me, who
would never use one of my typefaces in a
million years

495
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,737
and vice versa, people who would use any
typeface l design

496
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,273
not because it's good for them or it fits the
purpose,

497
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,241
simply because l did it.

498
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,978
l think we all do that. Certain bands l buy
every CD from them;

499
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,313
some of them are crap.

500
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,748
But l buy it because l've always bought
their CDs

501
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:10,781
lch habe sie immer gekauft,

502
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,975
or their music.

503
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,982
Why do people buy certain things? The
brand rubs off on them.

504
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,590
And typefaces are a brand.

505
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,527
You're telling an audience, This is for you,
by using a certain typographic voice.

506
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,599
You'd recognize a Marlboro brand two
miles away

507
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,334
because they use a typeface that they only
use

508
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,472
You can buy it; l have it; anyone can, it's
called Neo Contact. Anybody can buy it,

509
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,340
but Marlboro have made the typeface
theirs.

510
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,143
You can recognize any Marlboro ad from
miles away

511
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,168
because of that stupid typeface.

512
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,237
lf they'd used Helvetica. . . Hello??? lt
wouldn't quite work.

513
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,810
The way something is presented will define
the way you react to it.

514
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:27,847
So you can take the same message and
present it in three different typefaces,

515
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:33,030
and the response to that, the immediate
emotional response will be different.

516
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,268
And the choice of typeface is the prime
weapon,

517
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,635
if you want, in that communication.

518
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:48,379
And l say weapon largely because with
commercial marketing and advertising,

519
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:54,051
the way a message is dressed is going to
define our reaction to that message in the
advertising.

520
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,588
So if it says, buy these jeans, and it's a
grunge font,

521
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:02,460
you would expect it to be some kind of
ripped jeans

522
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,565
or to be sold in some kind of underground
clothing store.

523
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,135
lf you see that same message in Helvetica,

524
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,637
you know, it's probably on sale at Gap.

525
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,731
You know it's going to be clean, that you're
going to fit in, you're not going to stand out.

526
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,978
All of us, l would suggest, are prompted in
subliminal ways.

527
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:30,521
Maybe the feeling you have when you see
a particular typographic choices used on a
piece of packaging,

528
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,558
is just, l like the look of that, that feels
good, that's my kind of product.

529
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,654
But that's the type casting its secret spell.

530
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:55,141
ln a way, Helvetica is a club. lt's a mark of
membership;

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,315
it's a badge that says we're part of modern
society,

532
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,852
we share the same ideals.

533
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,482
lt's well-rounded, it's not going to be
damaging or dangerous.

534
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:14,056
Helvetica has almost like a perfect balance
of push and pull in its letters,

535
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,197
and that perfect balance sort of is saying to
us,

536
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,328
well not sort of, it is saying to us,

537
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:26,010
Don't worry, any of the problems you're
having, or problems in the world,

538
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979
or problems getting through the subway or
finding a bathroom,

539
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,050
all those problems aren't going to spill over,
they'll be contained,

540
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,542
and in fact maybe they don't exist.

541
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,458
What l like is if this very serious typeface

542
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,940
tells you the do's and don'ts of street life,

543
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,876
and it must be Helvetica at that moment.

544
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,781
The image of Helvetica as the corporate
typeface

545
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:14,058
made it the so-called typeface of
capitalism,

546
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,860
which l would actually reject and say

547
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,920
it's the typeface of socialism

548
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:28,639
because it is available all over and it's
inviting dilettantes and amateurs and

549
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,444
everybody to do typography,

550
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:40,714
to create their own type designs, and l
think that's a good thing.

551
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,789
And l think l'm right calling Helvetica the
perfume of the city.

552
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:01,071
lt's just something we don't notice usually

553
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,842
but we would miss very much if it wouldn't
be there.

554
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:10,214
l think it's quite amazing that a typeface
can advance to such a status

555
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,148
in our lives

556
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:23,884
As is always the case with any style,
there's a law of diminishing returns.

557
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,664
The more you see it, the more the public
sees it,

558
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,568
the more the designer uses those
typographic and graphic solutions,

559
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,596
the more familiar, predictable, and
ultimately dull they become.

560
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:45,215
By the time l started as a designer, it sort
of seemed there was only one trick in town,

561
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,751
which was like, what can you use instead
of Helvetica.

562
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,020
You know, ABH, Anything But Helvetica.

563
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,256
And you do need lot of sans serif
typefaces,

564
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:56,493
but it seemed like Helvetica had just been
used so much and overused so much

565
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,697
and associated with so many big, faceless
things

566
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:04,201
that it had lost all its capacity even, to my
eyes at least, to look nice.

567
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,504
And by the seventies, especially in
America,

568
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,407
you start to get a reaction against,

569
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,411
what it seems to those designers is the
conformity,

570
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,649
the kind of dull blanket of sameness

571
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,518
that this way of designing is imposing on
the world.

572
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,388
So something that had come out of
idealism

573
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:29,018
has by this time become merely routine,
and there's a need for a change.

574
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,803
You come into design,

575
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,340
at the point that you start out in history,

576
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,042
without knowing that you're starting out in
history,

577
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,775
and often you don't have a sense of what
came before you and how it got there,

578
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,182
and you certainly don't know what's going
to come after.

579
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:57,855
And when l walked into design as a
student at Tyler School of Art,

580
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:04,061
what struck me was sort of two separate
cultures of design.

581
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,764
One was the corporate culture,

582
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,734
and the corporate culture was the visual
language of big corporations,

583
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,804
and at that time they were persuasively
Helvetica.

584
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,141
They looked alike, they looked a little
fascistic to me.

585
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,843
They were clean, it reminded me of
cleaning up your room.

586
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:25,415
l felt like, this was some conspiracy of my
mother's, to make me keep the house
clean,

587
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,943
that all my messy room adolescent
rebellion was coming back at me

588
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,854
in the form of Helvetica, and l had to
overthrow it.

589
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:38,054
Hey, l got some printouts of the stuff from
last night.

590
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,498
l also was morally opposed to Helvetica,

591
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,203
because l viewed the big corporations that
were slathered in Helvetica

592
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,006
as sponsors of the Vietnam War.

593
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,475
So therefore, if you used Helvetica,

594
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,111
it meant that you were in favor of the
Vietnam War,

595
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,942
so how could you use it?

596
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:04,655
What looked cool to me at that point were
record album covers, Zig-Zag rolling
papers,

597
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,025
the accoutrements of dope life and
counterculture,

598
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:13,930
obviously underground newspapers and
magazines, and Pushpin Studios.

599
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:19,703
Pushpin Studios was the height of, at the
time l was in college,

600
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:24,975
everybody's ambition. To work there, to do
work that was as inspiring as their work,

601
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:30,981
because it seemed fresh and alive and
witty and content-laden,

602
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:36,053
aside from the fact that Seymour Chwast
and Milton Glazer could really draw.

603
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,511
And l wanted to make work that looked like
that.

604
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,261
When l was at Tyler, l wanted to be an
illustrator,

605
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,064
and l had a teacher named Stanislaw
Zagorski.

606
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:52,536
And l never knew what to do with the
typography on my designs.

607
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,239
We would make book covers and record
covers as school projects,

608
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,611
and l'd go to the local art store, l'd go to
Sam Flax, and l'd buy Helvetica as press
type,

609
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:04,848
and l'd rub it down in the corner of the
album the way l thought it was supposed to
be, kind of flush left.

610
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,452
And of course it would never line up
properly and thing would crackle and break

611
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,853
and it'd be terrible.

612
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:15,492
And Zagorski told me to let go of the press
type,

613
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,892
and illustrate the type.

614
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,859
And it hadn't dawned on me that
typography could have personality

615
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,528
the way drawing did.

616
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,472
l realized that type had spirit and could
convey mood,

617
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,774
and that it could be your own medium,

618
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:41,884
that it was its own palate, a broad palate to
express all kinds of things.

619
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:53,221
So l painted this cover the AlGAAnnual,

620
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,200
and the title of the AlGAAnnual was
Graphic Design U.S.A.

621
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,803
And l decided l would take the title literally

622
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,640
and sort of analyze what Graphic Design
U.S.A. was,

623
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,912
so l decided what l'd do is list every state
in the United States,

624
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,648
and the percentage of people who used
Helvetica.

625
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:17,109
And l didn't have any scientific evidence of
knowing what percentage of people in
each state used Helvetica,

626
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,525
so l decided to base it on the last Reagan
election.

627
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,261
So that the states that went for Reagan

628
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,095
all had more than 50% of the people who
used Helvetica.

629
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,301
| lf Helvetica was the typeface of the
Vietnam War,

630
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,103
what's the typeface of this war? |

631
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,705
The lraqi War?

632
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,730
Helvetica.

633
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,180
Same time period, l mean it is, it's the
same, it repeated.

634
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,411
That's why we're there. Helvetica caused
it.

635
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:52,956
And so ln the Postmodern period,
designers were breaking things up.

636
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:57,661
They wanted to get away from the orderly,
clean, smooth surface of design

637
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,498
the horrible slickness of it all, as they saw it

638
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,490
and produce something that had vitality.

639
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,582
l myself got fairly disappointed

640
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,483
with Modernism in general.

641
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,019
lt simply became boring.

642
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,657
lf l see a brochure now, with lots of white
space

643
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,261
that has like six lines of Helvetica up on the
top

644
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,600
and a little abstract logo on the bottom

645
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,837
and a picture of a businessman walking
somewhere,

646
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:46,476
the overall communication that says to me
is,

647
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:51,209
Do Not Read Me, because l will bore the
shit out of you

648
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,951
not just visually, but also in content

649
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,411
because the content will likely say the
same as it says to me visually.

650
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:08,459
l was in terrible rock bands when l was
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

651
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:15,372
and l think through that experience got
close to the album cover

652
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,741
and essentially l went to art school
because of album covers.

653
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:26,182
l probably was the last generation who got
taught doing everything by hand,

654
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,283
so you know, we drew 1 0pt. type with a
brush.

655
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:39,262
ln general, l was always fairly bored, you
know, looking at type books

656
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:44,634
and deciding over and over again which
type to pick for a certain project.

657
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,570
lt just didn't seem a very interesting task to
do.

658
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,847
So here and there l think with the records,
with the CD covers,

659
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,583
we started to do our own type

660
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:04,654
and l think there was one instance, it was
for a Lou Reed cover,

661
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,750
where this hand drawn typography
resonated,

662
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,998
and numerous projects came out in that
vein, in all sorts of directions.

663
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:19,196
You know, in a more funny direction and in
a more serious direction,

664
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:27,676
where one time an intern carved a hand
type into my skin for a lecture poster.

665
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,983
The type in an instant, in a single image,

666
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,154
tells the story of its making, tells you about
its process,

667
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,749
in a very elegant way, in a very fast way.

668
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:48,431
That typography strangely became so well
known, just within the design community

669
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,867
of course, that some people thought that's
all we do,

670
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,364
which thankfully is not the case.

671
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:14,855
Well, l always thought that approach of
people using only three or four typefaces
very suspect.

672
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:19,095
l think this could be interesting to do for a
single project

673
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:25,398
as an exercise to put up additional
limitations in order to focus yourself.

674
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:30,063
But as a strategy over a lifetime

675
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,677
l think it's akin to a writer saying,

676
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,513
l'm only going to write in three or four
words.

677
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,550
Yes, you could probably do it, but for one
why would you,

678
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:48,286
and for the second would it really yield an
interesting body of work over a lifetime?

679
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,710
Designers wanted to express their
subjectivity,

680
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,845
their own feelings about the world,

681
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,616
their sense that they had something to say
through design,

682
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,642
through the design choices they made.

683
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,017
And of course this caused controversy.

684
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:24,584
lf you take a figure like Massimo Vignelli,
who'd been one of the Sixties' high priests,

685
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,652
with his company Unimark,

686
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:31,334
it's right there in the name, Unimark, the
idea of a uniform kind of expression.

687
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,802
When he looked at this new work,

688
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,774
this expressive, subjective, wayward,

689
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,244
to his way of thinking irrational new way of
designing,

690
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,236
lt seemed like the barbarians were not only
at the gate,

691
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,874
but they'd stormed through and they'd
taken over.

692
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,785
ln the '70s, the young generation was after
psychedelic type,

693
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,957
and all the junk that you could find.

694
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,895
And also in the '80s, with their minds
completely confused

695
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:04,634
by that. . . disease that was called
Postmodernism,

696
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:09,239
people were just going around like
chickens without their heads,

697
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:16,702
by using all kinds of typefaces that came
around that could say ''not modern''.

698
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
They didn't know what they were caring for,

699
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,916
they only knew about what they were
against.

700
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,147
And what they were against was Helvetica.

701
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,738
l had no formal training in the field,

702
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,775
ln my case l never learned all the things l
wasn't supposed to do.

703
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,676
l just did what made sense to me.

704
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,876
l was just experimenting really.

705
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,850
So when people started getting really
upset, l didn't really understand why.

706
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,127
l'd say, ''What's the big deal? What are you
talking about?''

707
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,893
And it was many years later that
somebody explained to me,

708
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,200
probably better than l can explain it now,

709
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,372
is that basically there was this group that
spent a lot of time trying to organize things,

710
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,474
and get some kind of system going,

711
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,637
and they saw me as coming in and
throwing that out the window.

712
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,382
Which l might have done, but it wasn't the
starting point

713
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,950
and it wasn't the plan.

714
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:34,721
Only much later did l learn the terms
Modernism, and this and that.

715
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,461
Raygun Magazine was very much
experimental,

716
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,532
it was completely experimental. Every
issue we'd try a lot of things

717
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,901
and a lot of them worked,

718
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,403
and a lot of them didn't work.

719
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,006
l never saw proofs so a lot of times there
were just mistakes,

720
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,675
flat-out mistakes, that people would write
long essays on

721
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:57,313
why l did this black type on a black boot, or
something.

722
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,907
No, l never saw a proof, what are you
talking about?

723
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,986
lt's very hard to do the more subjective,
interpretive stuff well.

724
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,091
You know, l can teach anybody off the
street

725
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,961
how to design a reasonable business card
or newsletter.

726
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,965
But if l bring the same group off the street
and play a CD

727
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,902
and say, ''Okay, now let's interpret that
music for a cover,

728
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,105
well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost

729
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,441
and are going to do something corny and
expected,

730
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,377
and one person is going to do something
amazing

731
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,147
because that music spoke to them and it
sent them in some direction

732
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:35,785
that nobody else could go. And that's the
area to me where it gets more interesting

733
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,922
and exciting, and more emotional.

734
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,516
And that's where the best work comes
from.

735
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,563
This is an article on the singer Bryan Ferry,

736
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:51,100
and when l read the article it was very
much like so many of these others l had
read,

737
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,971
and l was like, oh man, how disappointing,
how boring.

738
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,808
And l went through all my fonts, which at
the time would've been hundreds and
hundreds,

739
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,141
uhm, well, it still is for that matter, and

740
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:08,651
didn't find one that seemed to fit my
disgust and boredom with this article.

741
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,120
And l finally came to the bottom and there
was Dingbats,

742
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,657
which of course now it's Zapf Dingbats so
it's literally the last one.

743
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,491
And l was like, well it's boring and not
worth reading,

744
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,797
why not do it in Zapf Dingbats?

745
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:25,301
lt's a font. So it's all set in Dingbats,

746
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,939
it is the actual font, you could highlight it
and make it Helvetica or something

747
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,641
and you'd be able to read it

748
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,474
but it really wouldn't be worthwhile, it's not
very well-written.

749
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,781
Don't confuse legibility with
communication.

750
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,918
Just because something's legible, doesn't
mean it communicates.

751
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:45,445
And more importantly doesn't mean it
communicates the right thing.

752
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:51,094
And vice-versa, something that may be
difficult to initially read

753
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,162
could be sending a completely different
message

754
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,099
that is valid for where it's being used,

755
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,136
and that may require a little more time or
the involvement of the reader.

756
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:04,974
But it almost seems strongerthe other way,

757
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:11,714
if something is a very important message
and it's set in a boring, non-descript way,

758
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,551
the message can be lost.

759
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,042
l mean that doesn't say ''caffeinated''!

760
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,452
lt's just like, hello?

761
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,351
|Why Not?|

762
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,920
lt's just sitting there! There's nothing
caffeinated about it!

763
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,964
There's nothing ''extramarital'' about that.

764
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,001
There's no ''sunshine'' here.

765
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,097
That's no fun, that's not a fun sandlot.

766
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,375
Where's the explosion?

767
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,344
This could be the first date.

768
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:44,711
This might be close, these buses are kind
of boring.

769
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:50,253
There's a very thin line between simple
and clean and powerful,

770
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,984
and simple and clean and boring.

771
00:59:55,291 --> 01:00:00,251
That was sort of the rise of what's referred
to as grunge typography,

772
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:06,135
and that became an all-consuming
aesthetic for two, three, four, five years

773
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,239
as that trend worked its way down from the
masters who originated it

774
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,711
to anyone who sort of already had a
tendency to make mistakes

775
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,580
and all of sudden found that they looked
good now instead of incompetent,

776
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,945
which is how they looked the day before.

777
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:24,754
Typography was so broken by the end of
the grunge period,

778
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,290
just lying there in a twisted heap,

779
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,160
all rules cast aside, no apparent way
forward,

780
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,399
that all those designers could perhaps do
by the late nineties was to go back

781
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,836
to return to an earlier way of designing,

782
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,272
but with a new set of theories to support it.

783
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,505
For us, modernism does have a more
subversive side.

784
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,874
l think that the whole image of modernism

785
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:22,578
as something that is primarily concerned
with functionalism,

786
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,883
utilitarianism, that is something that
emerged much later,

787
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,552
that is a sort of a late-modernist thing.

788
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,521
l think the early-modernist movements,

789
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,624
like Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism,

790
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,994
all had their more subversive sides

791
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,930
and their more, how do you call it,

792
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,890
dialectical sides, so they went against
something.

793
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,142
lt's not that we are against that
experimentation

794
01:01:55,211 --> 01:02:01,946
that people like David Carson and Emigré
and Fuse, that Neville Brody did.

795
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,588
We think what we do is a sort of an
extension of that.

796
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:10,660
All that hunting to the next typeface every
time, it took a lot of energy,

797
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,864
and l can still remember as students that
we were really disappointed

798
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,925
because you wanted to use a certain
typeface and then you saw somebody else
had used it,

799
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:19,302
Dieses Problem gibt es mit der Helvetica
nicht, weil jeder sie verwendet.

800
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,938
and then you couldn't use it because you
wanted to be original.

801
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:26,398
And with Helvetica this whole problem is
non-existent because everybody's using
Helvetica.

802
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:33,216
A lot of people see the way a young
generation of designers uses a typeface
such as Helvetica

803
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:37,186
as a more superficial way, as a sort of
appropriation of a style.

804
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,089
l think we would very much disagree with
that.

805
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,525
l think all three of us grew up in the '70s

806
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:48,225
in the Netherlands which was dominated
by the last moment of late Modernism.

807
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,168
For example, the city l was born in and
grew up in, Rotterdam,

808
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:56,038
the logotype was designed by Wim
Crouwel,

809
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,041
the stamps were designed by Crouwel,

810
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,977
the telephone book was designed by
Crouwel,

811
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,112
the atlas that we used in school was
designed by Crouwel.

812
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:08,317
So for us it is almost like a natural mother
tongue,

813
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,919
that's something really natural.

814
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,956
lt's not that we ... l mean, a lot of people
think you sort of study it

815
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,592
from books and then copy it or something,
but

816
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:20,323
l would really say that it's almost in our
blood.

817
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,334
lt's also funny because a lot of people
connect Helvetica

818
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,471
sometimes with the dangers of
globalization

819
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,506
and standardization.

820
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,342
l'm not afraid for that quality at all

821
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,413
because l'm just know that everybody can
put a twist on it.

822
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,483
l think you can put as much nationality

823
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:44,453
in the spacing of a typeface as in the
typeface itself.

824
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:48,758
And l think the way people like Crouwel
use Helvetica is typically Dutch, l think,

825
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:54,030
and that's why l'm never really impressed
with the argument

826
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,990
that Helvetica is a sort of global monster.

827
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,442
l'm not one of those people who is a real
typographer,

828
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,481
l don't know all the fancy words for all the
letters,

829
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:57,386
and the sort of ligatures and ascenders
and descenders and all that kind of thing.

830
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,957
l just more, sort of, react to certain things,

831
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,859
and just do what l feel is right,

832
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,386
so l'm never sort of a classical type guy.

833
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,833
So l get obsessed about things, l collect
things,

834
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,641
you know, l've got so many bits and scraps
of paper, of things that you find on the
street,

835
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:23,179
or wrappers. lt's just making something
beautiful out of something very ordinary.

836
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,648
That's what l really enjoy, the ordinary
things

837
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:30,608
that most people would just gloss over, l
find really beautiful.

838
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,961
The biggest thing for me in terms of design

839
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,964
is to get a sort of emotional response from
a piece.

840
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,455
That's some of the best design, l think.

841
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:49,605
l see stuff and to me, if it makes me go,

842
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,075
l wish l'd done that, that for me is the
biggest thing, you know.

843
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:59,537
Or you just get this real whooo, kind of like,
oooh, that's nice.

844
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,977
lt's all about that emotional response.

845
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:14,730
One of the things l've always really wanted
to design is airplane signage,

846
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,266
an identity for an airline.

847
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:24,407
l'd love to do the uniforms, or you know,
seats and the whole thing, the trucks and

848
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:27,877
that kind of thing. l think it would be
brilliant.

849
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,881
You know, l've done these twelve-inch
sleeves for so long;

850
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,483
l want to go a little bit bigger scale now.

851
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:39,318
lt's that idea that something's designed to
stand the test of time,

852
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:43,893
and hopefully some of the things l'm
designing will be still being used in twenty,
thirty years.

853
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,361
l'd love to think that.

854
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,671
l got married about three years ago. l did
the wedding invites,

855
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:59,875
which believe me, is just the worst job you
can ever do as a graphic designer.

856
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,012
l've done other people's wedding invites,
and l'll never do one again.

857
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,503
lt's the most stressful job l've ever had,

858
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:10,719
dealing with mother in laws is just horrific.
But l did ours,

859
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,322
and on the order of service

860
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:20,062
l did a little credit to give thanks to Max
Miedinger for Helvetica.

861
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:26,102
But my wife vetoed that; l had to take it off
the invite.

862
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,434
But it was funny . . .

863
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:40,707
l think l fell into the step of Helvetica when
l was at DR.

864
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,948
l always really enjoy using Helvetica

865
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:51,348
because . . .some people say they use a
different typeface because it gives a
different feeling.

866
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:56,531
And l really enjoy the challenge of making
Helvetica speak in different ways.

867
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,003
lt's been around for fifty years, coming up,

868
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:07,510
and it's just as fresh as it was . . . obviously,
it wasn't intended to be this cool thing,

869
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,910
but it's just a beautiful font.

870
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:21,951
Well, we are less obsessed with Helvetica

871
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,819
than we used to be.

872
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:31,627
Yes, we were really obsessed with
Helvetica, yet not more so much.

873
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:37,930
We accepted it somehow ... We came to a
point where we accepted that it's just there.

874
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,766
We like restrictions.

875
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,737
We can't operate, we can do nothing
without restrictions.

876
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,171
The more restrictions we have, the more
happy we are.

877
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,872
When we started school,

878
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,311
the influences in graphic design were like
Brody and Carson.

879
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,386
lt's only after that we really looked at Josef

880
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,254
work, and '60s Swiss Typography.

881
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,559
When we started the office we really said

882
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,530
we wanted to look back,

883
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,297
to find more structured design.

884
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,705
For us it's very important to reduce the
elements we use.

885
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,946
When it comes to type, we will only use, if
possible, one typeface,

886
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,575
or two, and if possible we will use one size.

887
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,621
We don't like humanistic typefaces for
example,

888
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,715
it must be more rational

889
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,487
because otherwise it has too much
expression.

890
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:25,303
We think that Helvetica contains somehow
a design program.

891
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,677
lt will lead you to a certain language also,
and this is also

892
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:33,615
one of the secrets of the success of
Helvetica

893
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,719
that in itself it is already

894
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,089
it has a certain style, a certain aesthetic

895
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,359
that you will just use it like that,

896
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,695
because of the typeface, because the
typeface wants it like that.

897
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,531
You will do what the typeface wants you to
do.

898
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,534
lf you are not a good designer, or if you are
not a designer,

899
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:57,494
just use Helvetica Bold in one size,

900
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,968
like for a flyer. . . it looks good.

901
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,770
So it may very well be that when it comes
to trends,

902
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:07,109
at least in graphic design, we've reached
sort of the end of history.

903
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,413
The pendulum that swings back and forth
doesn't have any more directions it can
swing in.

904
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:19,688
The final trend may simply be the
completely democratic distribution of the
means of production

905
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:23,392
to anyone who wants it or anyone who can
afford it.

906
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,395
You can have a music studio for a couple
thousand bucks,

907
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,598
you can have a film studio for ten grand,

908
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:34,503
you definitely can be a designer with one
or two thousand dollars,

909
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:38,474
and have basically

910
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,577
similar tools as the people who do this for a
living.

911
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:45,080
lf all these people have the tools to make
good design,

912
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,682
they realize that it ain't that easy.

913
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,985
lt's not just opening a template in Corel
Draw or in Powerpoint.

914
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:54,656
lt's not about having the latest version of
whatever program.

915
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:58,360
lf you don't have the eye, if you don't a
sense of design,

916
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,523
the program's not going to give it to you.

917
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,935
l remember, years ago, a friend of mine
who produced radio commercials

918
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,206
had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS
Records

919
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:15,544
and sing the beginning of ''Round Round
Get Around, l Get Around''

920
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,745
by the Beach Boys.

921
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,682
And they really tried, they rehearsed for a
week to get their harmonies right,

922
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,953
and they were the best vocalists who
worked in that department on that floor,

923
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:25,854
and they loved music.

924
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:26,855
And they went out and they sang it,

925
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,016
and of course they were totally flat and
sounded horribly. . .

926
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,960
terrible. But they'd rehearsed. And then

927
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,298
the voiceover for the commercial said,
''Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.''

928
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:39,101
And it's really sort of the same thing.

929
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,435
The closer you come to it, and the more
you see it,

930
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,607
the more you appreciate it when it's terrific.

931
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,510
There are more good, young type
designers

932
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:53,415
now, by young l mean probably late
twenties, early thirties , than at any time in
history.

933
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,818
So who knows what typefaces they will
design

934
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,887
in terms of style and so on. But they'll be
good.

935
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:03,926
And to my way of thinking, that is a huge
gain,

936
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:09,421
a huge benefit that comes with this more
democratic, more accessible technology.

937
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,469
There's just something about Helvetica.

938
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:19,133
Something about the fact that people keep
saying l've come up with an improvement
of Helvetica.

939
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,937
And it never is really good.

940
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:28,150
You know, l wonder whether or not
somehow there's some whole
undiscovered science of typography

941
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,120
that would sort of say it's not just because
we're used to seeing it,

942
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,723
it's not just because it was associated with
all these things

943
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,125
that we consider authoritative,

944
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:41,330
but it somehow has this kind of inherent
rightness.

945
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,334
You know, the rightness of the way the
lowercase a meets the curve,

946
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,103
the rightness of the way the G has the
thing that comes down,

947
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:51,539
the rightness of the way the c strokes are
like that instead of that.

948
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:57,980
l mean, l wouldn't have believed that those
things actually could be right or wrong

949
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,314
as opposed to someone's tastes.

950
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:04,342
Yet we sort of have nearly fifty years of
history of the thing just sitting there

951
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:09,146
daring people to fix it. And it seems to be
unfixable.

952
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,930
lt's always changing, time is changing,

953
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,201
the appreciation of typefaces is changing
very much.

954
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,471
Why you grab a certain typeface for a
certain job

955
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:29,172
has a different meaning than we grabbed a
typeface in the fifties for a certain job.

956
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:35,912
You are always child of your time, and you
cannot step out of that.

957
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:48,296
What we have is a climate now in which
the very idea of visual communication

958
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,133
and graphic design, if we still want to call it
that,

959
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,969
is accepted by many more people.

960
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:59,408
They get it. They understand it. They're
starting to see graphic communication

961
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,844
as an expression of their own identity.

962
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:08,283
And the classic case of this is the social
networking programs

963
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:14,056
such as MySpace, where you can
customize your profile.

964
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,192
You can change the background, you can
put pictures in,

965
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,462
you can change the typeface to anything
you want,

966
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,833
and those choices, those decisions you
make,

967
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:29,371
become expressions of who you are. You
start to care about it, in the way

968
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,975
you care about the clothing you're wearing
as an expression of who you are,

969
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,011
or your haircut or whatever,

970
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,115
or how you decorate your apartment-all of
those things.

971
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,086
You know, we accept the idea of identity
being expressed in that way,

972
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,054
through these consumer choices.

973
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:49,458
Well, now it's happening in the sphere of
visual communication

974
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:54,930
and there's no reason as the tools become
ever more sophisticated,

975
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,627
why this just won't go on developing,
devoloping and developing.
