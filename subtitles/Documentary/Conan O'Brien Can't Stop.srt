1
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,231
I think these people
get on these cars

2
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,609
thinking they're gonna see...
"There's Brad Pitt.

3
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:30,156
He's sweeping off the sidewalk
in front of his house. Hey, there, Brad."

4
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:34,869
Hey, it's me, Conan O'Brien
from "The Tonight Show"! Hi!

5
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,377
I should have said,
"Formerly of 'The Tonight Show."'

6
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,927
O'Brien was announced
as Leno's "Tonight Show" successor

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,512
back in 2004,

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,057
and five years later,
his "Tonight Show" premiered.

9
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:59,935
But the network suits wanted to keep
the still-popular Jay Leno,

10
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,937
so they had an idea...

11
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,858
create a new prime-time talk show
for Jay Leno at 10:00 P.M.

12
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,111
That way they hold on to both
of their hosts and save money

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,031
on producing
original scripted programming.

14
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,824
But the experiment failed.

15
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,119
Critics panned Leno's show,
and the ratings went way down.

16
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,623
And Conan's "Tonight Show" ratings
were disappointing, as well.

17
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,335
So, they came up with another idea...
push the whole lineup later.

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,922
So, Jay Leno's show would go on
in the "Tonight Show" slot,

19
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,050
and "The Tonight Show"
would follow at 12:05 A.M.

20
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,260
I didn't want to be
the first "Tonight Show" host

21
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,805
to take "The Tonight Show"
into the next day,

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,518
so I said that didn't
really work for me.

23
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,103
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

24
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,979
Jay Leno's show has got to go!

25
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,606
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

26
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,692
Jay Leno's show has got to go!
Hey, hey!

27
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,612
Jay is a liar!
He said he'd retire!

28
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,325
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

29
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,887
I am prohibited
from being on television right now,

30
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,142
contractually, for the next 5, 6 months.

31
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,061
What if I could just go
out there and see these people

32
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,773
who were so nice and supportive
and put on a show for them?

33
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,400
And now it's... it's this.

34
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:35,698
It's... I don't know, 44 dates,
starting April 12th.

35
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:46,292
I'm 46, and what do I do now?

36
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,085
What else do I have to say?

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,210
And it's just trying
to figure that out right away,

38
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,591
and so the tour will be interesting, 'cause
I don't quite know what it's gonna be.

39
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,635
I just know that I've always liked
being in front of an audience.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,763
That's all I know, is I really like
being in front of an audience.

41
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,765
You haven't stopped at all.

42
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:07,062
You started thinking about this
the day after your final "Tonight Show."

43
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,148
Day... the day of. Yeah.

44
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,652
Why do you think that is, and what
would that mean for you to stop?

45
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,197
I don't know
what it would be like to stop.

46
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,909
What do you mean, stop?
What does that even mean?

47
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,704
Really, my main goal for this
is to have some fun.

48
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,958
Do you think you could have fun
without an audience in front of you?

49
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,715
- We're in E, right?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:43,599
I really have fun
when I'm with the... with writers

51
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:49,104
or when I'm with musicians
and we're working things out.

52
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,564
Then I'm content.

53
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,900
- Hey!
- Hey!

54
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,071
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey!

55
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,032
- Did the eating already happen?
- It just happened.

56
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,662
I had an idea a couple days ago,
which was striking me as kind of funny,

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,539
which is go out and say,
"As you know, there are, whatever,

58
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,000
the seven stages of grief
that people go through."

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,211
It turns out there are seven stages

60
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,089
that you have to go through
when you lose your television show.

61
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,633
The first one is denial.

62
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,721
The last stage is
you get your ass to Cleveland.

63
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,890
Like, you make them the last stage.

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,810
"We're from Cleveland!"

65
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,983
Now, the whole point of this tour
was let's have some fun.

66
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,693
Yeah, get him. Hit him.

67
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,362
If there's ever been a time
in my life to just say...

68
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,905
Whoo, whoo!

69
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,199
"To hell with it," it's now.

70
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,452
We're about to start a 32-city tour,
and it's coming up fast, gang.

71
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,981
"Hey, Conan, how'd the fight go?"

72
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,290
"it went pretty good, I guess."

73
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,293
And you guys are worried about me
filling an hour and a half.

74
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,753
Just have fun and feel it.

75
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,006
You guys know enough about...
Yeah.

76
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,717
And we're doing this where,
you know, we're playing it like

77
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,844
I just, you know... I've never
had backup singers in my life.

78
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,179
This is my dream, and then these
two beautiful backup singers come out.

79
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever, the Coquettes!

80
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,982

What's that?

98
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,017
- You are not playing.
- No.

99
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,353
It's like the Michael Jackson movie.

100

110
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,722
Then it just starts to
become this bitter...

111
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,350
It'd actually be funny to have it start
as "On the Road Again"

112
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,315
and then morph
into "I cannot wait for this"...

113
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,021
Comedy people, check this out

114
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,689
and see if I need to be pulled
over and given a ticket

115
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,066
or if we can possibly get away with this.

116
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,901
You want to sit over there,
Zack, on the floor?

117
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,903
We were playing
"On the Road Again,"

118
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,822
which is a song, you know...
♪ On the road again ♪

00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,617

124
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,794
Yeah.

There's fuel there because...

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,268
I am angry.
I'm really angry at times.

129
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:19,356
I'm trying not to be,
but I'm really, really angry about...

130
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,233
and I just have to be honest...

131
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,362
I'm very angry about the way
that I was treated,

132
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,864
and I'm a person who's...

133
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,783
I'm the least entitled person
you'll meet in the world.

134
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,327
I don't think I was entitled
to "The Tonight Show."

135
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,038
I don't think I'm entitled
to success in show business,

136
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,415
but I'm just...

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,876
sometimes I'm so mad,
I can't even breathe.

138
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:42,045
And I do think that this show

139
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,632
is some sort of,
at least, positive expression,

140
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:50,220
because all that... there's all
that steam energy of being angry,

141
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,683
and so it comes out
a little bit in performance.

142
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,977
You can get out there
and talk to people

143
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,397
at least about being unemployed,

144
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,066
being legally prohibited
from being on television,

145
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,360
which is gonna be something
I talk about.

146
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,030
You can have the...
I can play the executives.

147
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,492
And while that's not
any one particular person,

148
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,785
it definitely is me saying

149
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,706
to the whole idea
of non-creative people

150
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,542
screwing over people
that feed their bone marrow

151
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,004
into the wood chipper of television,

152
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,798
"Fuck you," you know.
That's part of it.

153
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,342
I don't know what this was.

154
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,093
Jeff just told me to sign...
to have you sign this.

155
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,512
Okay. He didn't say where or anything?

156
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,679
Did you want to...
No, I think...

157
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,431
No, no, I don't need to read it.

158
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,768
God knows I stopped reading things
I signed a long time ago.

159
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:43,106
Are there any, of all
the TV executives, like this at NBC?

160
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,692
I don't know. I haven't
thought about them in a while.

161
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,029
There are some
follicly challenged executives, I'm sure.

162
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,783
But... but, really,
this represents no one person.

163
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,451
It represents two people.

164
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,332
Or make it three.

165
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,964
Um, hey, Sweeney,
should we talk about how much

166
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,757
I want to look or not look like...

167
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,843
Hello, there!
I'm a generic network executive.

168
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,764
My name is...

169
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,684
I thought I'd stop in tonight

170
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,770
and check out
your pathetic little show

171
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,273
in your pathetic little city.

172
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,234
Is someone walking
in and out of the door?

173
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,112
Please, someone.
We need someone to guard the door.

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,615
Gonna announce this thing,
and then it's just time

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,995
for the nausea and the self-doubt
and the fear to take over.

176
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,371
That's the fun part.

177
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,957
All right, I'm gonna... where am I
gonna be doing this from?

178
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,584
You're gonna have to set it up
for me to submit.

179
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,543
Wherever you want.

180
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,420
Well, we're gonna do it
from your microcomputer.

181
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,297
It was made in Micronesia.

182
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,715
Are you...
do you want to pull it up?

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,591
No. Do it on the...

184
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,551
We're gonna do it early.
We're gonna do it right now.

185
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,761
I can't believe I'm here for this.

186
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,222
- Hit it.
- Good luck.

187
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,600
Hey, Internet, I'm headed to your town
in a half-assed comedy/music tour.

188
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,103
Go to http://teamcoco.com for tix.
I repeat, it's half-assed.

189
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,106
It's in God's hands now.

190
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,401
What time is it? 7:20.

191
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,737
- By 7:40, I'm out of the business.
- Sure.

192
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,615
The promoter in New York's telling me
the first Radio City show is sold out.

193
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,780
- It's what?
- So, everything's starting to go, huh?

194
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,202
So, when do you think we're adding
the second show in Radio City?

195
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,789
Both shows in Chicago and the one show
in Minneapolis are officially sold out.

196
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,085
700 tickets shy of selling out
the second show at Radio City.

197
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,420
Holy smokes.

198
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,171
Jesu...

199
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,381
Toronto will sell out today for sure.

200
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,924
Minneapolis will be done today.

201
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,553
- The West Coast stuff is a little slower...
- Right.

202
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,096
- Because it's early.
- Yes.

203
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,807
Uhh... It's great.

204
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,393
2,000 tickets already sold
on the second show in Chicago.

205
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,979
The teamcoco.com site
is taking too long to load.

206
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,523
Oh. Well, it's getting crushed, I'm sure.

207
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,107
Yeah.

208
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,402
Cynthia just got the tweet.
She can't get onto the site.

209
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,113
"The site right now is jammed with traffic.
You can't get on, go to Ticketmaster."

210
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,531
Let's write that up and send it out.

211
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,950
I think it's jammed with traffic... yes.

212
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,535
You're all dressed!

213
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,082
Nothing motivates you
to figure out what your show is

214
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,627
like selling a whole bunch
of tickets... to it.

215
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,214
After the band's done
their first two songs,

216
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,175
they stop playing, the place gets quiet,

217
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,763
all the lights go out, and we go.

218
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,058
♪ You see, my daddy
was lazy and no-count ♪

219
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,144
♪ He claimed he had a bad back ♪

220

222
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,653
We got... we're close.

223
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,783
I love staring into this black void
and getting no response.

224
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,159
What are you doing there?

225
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,788
A Brookstone catalog going on?
What are you doing? I'll buy it for you.

226
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,081
Let's come on.

227
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,541
You guys okay with the audio?

228
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,506
I'm not getting any response from anybody.
It's just looking into a pit.

229
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,130
All right.
Well, enjoy your death star.

230
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,465
I'm trying... you had
a problem with the audio,

231
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,884
and I'm trying to determine
if that's been set.

232
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,721
It's just a question of the mix
when you're playing...

233
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,683
I just wanted to see you stand up.
I appreciate it. Let's go.

234
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,019
I had this idea that I've talked about,

235
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:13,108
which is to wear... wear a suit
that's an exact replica

236
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,318
of the one that Eddie Murphy wore
in "Raw."

237
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,696
Bend over.
Touch your knees, please.

238
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,031
Monday, I think
I'm getting fitted for it.

239
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,700
Daddy, you look silly.

240
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,040
Fuck, yeah.

241
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,586
Oh, my God.

242
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,340
I don't even think
I can sit down in this outfit.

243
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,011
Well, it would be interesting to see you
try and sit in a bean bag chair.

244
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,682
Oh.

245
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,271
Is that a butter sauce?

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,732
Can you see
if you can find Sona?

247
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,819
Look at that fish.
I think that's butter sauce.

248
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,696
What'd it say
when you ordered it?

249
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,701
I just need just a simple piece
of grilled fish.

250
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,533
Sorry to have
to let you go over this.

251
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,994
Oh. I think the restaurant
just messed up, 'cause...

252
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,497
Either way, you're losing
your job over this.

253
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,626
I really do not want to lose my job.

254
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,295
That's what people
who lose their job say.

255
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,005
Who says,
"I'm glad I'm losing my job"?

256
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,298
- I think I could be good.
- Yes?

257
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,801
We have another one coming.
I just sent the other runner.

258
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,427
- Did you get me a new assistant?
- I'm trying to keep my job.

259
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,428
Do you mean
a new assistant coming?

260
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,721
That's cool.
I'm just trying to keep my job.

261
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,556
It's fine. This happens often.

262
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,684
With ordering food out on tour,
you have to check everything.

263
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,561
We can't... It's just...

264
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,729
Oh, so Sona should check things?

265
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,980
- Oh.
- No, no, no. Like...

266
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,273
Gus, I can't believe you would...

267
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,401
- No, I'm not throwing her under the bus.
- Gus, you're missing the point.

268
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,112
I want you to throw Sona
under the bus.

269
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,781
It gives me joy.

270
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,575
Tony can tell you what happened,
but it's gonna be fine.

271
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,953
- Over half the time, I do it right.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,746
That's great.

273
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,916
If you were an airplane pilot,
there'd be a lot of dead people out there.

274
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,459
And I'm trying to keep it lean,

275
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,255
and she keeps going out
and getting me fish that lived in butter.

276
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,048
It actually lived
and grew up in butter.

277
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,258
But you're gonna be fine.

278
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,634
I said no butter.

279
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,720
Usually I'm at a certain weight
and then when I went off TV...

280
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,099
There was a period there of...

281
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,725
Just... no, that's okay.

282
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,519
Of just, like, cheese popcorn.

283
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,564
There was, like, what I call
my "fuck it" period.

284
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,692
"Fuck them. Fuck them.
They're crazy."

285
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,409
Oh, God.

286
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,330
Hello? Job'?
Tell me it's a job.

287
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm still... we're making it up.

288
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,043
First you got to sell tickets.

289
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,170
We did that.
That's the hard part.

290
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,840
Then you come up with a show.

291
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,800
Apple's new iPad will be declared

292
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,177
the most revolutionary device
of the last 50 years

293
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:51,308
by the editors <i>of
Things</i> to Snort Cocaine Off Of magazine.

294
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,435
Oh, the TBS thing is at 4:00.

295
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,146
We find out how real that is,
if that's really happening.

296
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,106
Yeah, we're not going on TBS.

297
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,150
When is our meeting on Oxygen, Jeff?

298
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,196
All I know is that Sona
hears these things

299
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,449
and then moves
heaven and earth to make sure

300
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:12,329
that we cancel our rehearsals
so that you and I drag our asses to TBS.

301
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,830
And then it's USA.

302
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,540
My scheme is for Animal Planet.

303
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,167
All right, now, ladies and gentlemen,
I know you're glad

304
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,210
to see the masturbating bear,
but there is a problem.

305
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,881
The masturbating bear
is legally the property of NBC.

306
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
say good-bye to the masturbating bear

307
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,262
and say hello
to a brand-new character

308
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,389
that you're gonna see tonight
for the first time,

309
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,726
our own self-pleasuring panda.

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,063
Guys, guys, there's a problem here.

311
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,149
When I say, "the self-pleasuring panda,"
he never seems to know to go,

312
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,401
and then you guys keep playing,
so nothing happens.

313
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,154
- Can the actor who's playing... who is it?
- Blake.

314
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,990
Blake, can you not hear me
when I say, "the self-pleasuring panda"?

315
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,576
- What's that?
- Oh, fuck you.

316
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,370
Kiss LaBamba.

317
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,539
And then we cut to LaBamba.
Hold it. Hold it. That's important.

318
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,000
If we don't have the cut to Loco
Richie there, then we got nothing.

319
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,504
It's got to be LaBamba. Bang.

320
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,339
This thing's a train wreck.

321
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,677
Oh, I just rubbed this microphone
into my leaking eye.

322
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,389
Sorry. Seriously,
no one touch this microphone.

323
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,641
There's eye discharge on the mike.

324
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,395
Yeah, that's the problem.
Left and right, chopaholics.

325
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,521
I want these fucking people...

326
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,481
It's like bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

327
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,899
And I was trying
to make it happen today,

328
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,624
and you thought,
"Oh, he's insulting me."

329
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,778
- I know that.
- Check it out, guys.

330
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,948
Hello? Hello?
Banana Company.

331
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,910
Fuck.
Fuck. That's what he did.

332
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,997
No, there's no support here.

333
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,207
I went out on a limb
with Banana Company.

334
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,792
Hey, telephone call for you.
Pick it up.

335
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,461
- Hello? Banana Company.
- Yes!

336
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,005
I like using human puppets.

337
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,881
Can I ask a question about...

338
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,508
That was just to look
at all of 'em.

339
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,051
Yeah, we're not sure
if we're gonna do them all.

340
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,095
And from now on... and I'm not
even kidding about this...

341
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,472
when you want to speak, you have to talk
into the banana telephone.

342
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,141
- I'm not gonna talk into the banana.
- You have to.

343
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,978
Guys, Sona's on. Sona's got something
to say. What is it, Sona?

344
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,148
- This is really demeaning.
- Yes. Yes. I don't know why...

345
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,941
You're asking me
to talk into a banana.

346
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,527
I just did it seven times,
and you're too good to do it?

347
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,156
This is not a good work environment. What's
happening right now is not healthy for me.

348
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,783
We lost two songs,
"Seduce You" and "Creep."

349
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,076
Matt, what do you got?

350
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,321
Oh, yeah. Matt, make a suggestion
in the banana phone.

351
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,748
Does everyone like
"On the Road Again"?

352
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,961
I was just throwing it out there.

353
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,766
- You know.
- Well, guess what I'm doing...

354
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,006
- Throwing it back.
- Okay.

355
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,591
Okay? You're a guy
that works in the Louvre,

356
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,916
You saw the Mona Lisa,
and you tossed it out the window.

357
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,388
Luckily, I came by, saw it,
and brought it back, okay?

358
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,265
And you're like, "Well, I was
just throwing it out there."

359
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,854
You threw the Mona Lisa
out of the Louvre, you idiot.

360
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,607
You think doing
"On the Road Again" is the Mona Lisa?

361
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,068
- And this is the Louvre?
- Yes.

362
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,445
- All right.
- Yes. I like that.

363
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,531
And I'm sick of people saying
that I'm drunk with power,

364
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,033
that I've lost my perspective.

365
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,158
Who says that?

366
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,442
- Can I talk?
- Yes.

367
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,703
Ohh!

368
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,413
Now she comes over.

369
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,702
You had asked me earlier...

370
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,874
I can't hear you.

371
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,126
- You asked me earlier...
- Hold it.

372
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,878
- Just hold it.
- Can't concentrate.

373
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,964
So, we lost about 16 minutes
with all that stuff,

374
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,966
so it's about a minute, 13 now.

375
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,134
I mean an hour, 13.

376
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,887
You said a minute, 13,
and you said it into a banana.

377
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,225
I am extremely hard on myself.

378
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,393
Sometimes that spills
onto other people,

379
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,395
you know, because
I'm that hard on myself,

380
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,081
and then when things
aren't quite right,

381
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,025
I'm making these jokes
that have an edge to them

382
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,903
that are, like,
to Mike Sweeney, the head writer,

383
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,949
to Jeff Ross, like, "Oh, really?
So, that's the best we could do?"

384
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,202
Or this.
And they're little jabs.

385
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,956
And they're jokes with
quotation marks around them...

386
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,249
Just stretching out.

387
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,751
But it's me trying to keep... I'm trying
to keep everything in the stew pot.

388
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,464
I'm trying to just keep it all, you
know, there and not have it spill out.

389
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,968
Um, want to... want to oil that?

390
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,053
Um... See? That's an example.

391
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,098
That's me letting my wife know
I find that irritating.

392
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,975
But it's all fun and joking.

393
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,019
And she's gonna leave me,
and it's a 50/50 state, California.

394
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,190
How does the crowd look?
Who are they?

395
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,526
What will we learn?
What will we learn?

396
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,487
You'll learn
what comedy bits work.

397
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,530
Not necessarily.

398
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,781
That's actually true. Sorry.

399
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,746
'Cause you're doing
a lot of Eugene references.

400
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,035
You learn what former
"Tonight Show" staffers like.

401
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,288
What's your prediction?
Will they like what we're serving up?

402
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,374
Yes. I think so.
Why wouldn't they?

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
I don't know.

404
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,505
Thank you very much!
Everybody, please sit down!

405
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,217
Thank you for being here,
people that used to work for me.

406
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,179
That was great
coming out here right now,

407
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,763
'cause I'm gonna be
really honest with you.

408
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,975
I'm like Tinker Bell.
Without applause, I die.

Not having any of it.

415
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,821
I wanted to thank everybody
for being here tonight.

416
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,823
We're trying out a lot of stuff.

417
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,784
We know that I'm trying out...
throwing a million things at you,

418
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,453
and we appreciate people
coming all the way here

419
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,018
and being an audience
for us tonight.

420
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,561
So, thank you so much
for doing that.

421
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,957
I appreciate it
from the bottom of my heart.

422
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,460
Okay, everybody,
thank you very much!

423
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,764
- How are you?
- I was talking to Eddie Haskell.

424
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,432
- Oh... oh.
- Yes.

425
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,268
So, we got fixes and things to do,
but what'd you think?

426
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,189
It felt like... I think the energy you're
gonna encounter is not a seated energy.

427
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,941
- Do you know what I mean?
- Right.

428
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,235
How'd it feel?

429
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,696
Have you talked to the kids?

430
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,156
No. Mnh-mnh.

431
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,868
Are we gonna tell them that I'm gonna be
taking some trips to go do my show

432
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,495
but I'm gonna call them and...

433
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,901
- They know their old man's in vaudeville.
- That's right.

434
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,001
You know what Daddy has to do?

435
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,836
- I think I have to get ready to leave.
- Okay.

436
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,297
Daddy has to go and get
on the plane and go to... where?

437
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,132
Do you remember where I'm going?

438
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,378
Can I call you on the iChat?

439
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,303
- Who's gonna operate the computer iChat?
- We will operate.

440
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,310
In improvisational acting,

441
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,145
there's this great rule
that I've used in my life,

442
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,814
which is act as if.

443
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,943
Act as if this is completely normal.

444
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,611
Call me Conan, please.

445
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,864
Of course I'm supposed to be
interviewing Barack Obama

446
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,868
or of course I'm supposed to be
playing guitar with Bruce Springsteen.

447
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,912
And, of course,
there's a big part of you inside

448
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,757
that's saying,
"What are you talking about?"

449
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,209
This doesn't feel completely real.
It doesn't feel completely real to me.

450
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,505
This is just an extension of replacing
David Letterman at the age of 30.

451
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,049
How's that first show gonna go?
What do you think, Sona?

452
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,676
I think it's gonna go really well.

453
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,954
I think I saw a sign
that said Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

454
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,642
Sheboygan?
I kill 'em in Sheboygan.

455
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,773
Let's push this crowd back.
This is...

456
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,650
I need room here.

457
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,862
Everyone, give me some room.

458
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,613
Get these people back!

459
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,198
I want everyone back!

460
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,451
No! No photos!

461
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,952
For security reasons,

462
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,205
I think we should change our hotels
at the last second.

463
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,250
Right. To something
twice as expensive.

464
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,502
Yeah. It's something I learned
from Saddam Hussein.

465
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,503
Yeah.

466
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,254
All right, sir.

467
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,739
- At what time...
- Good luck, man.

468
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,466
- Hey, thank you very much.
- You got a raw deal, man.

469
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,384
- We're with you.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

470
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,553
Conan, you got the shaft, brother.

471
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,722
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'm okay.

472
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,808
I love how we got here early
so you could go out and get recognized.

473
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,518
Get the fuck out of here.
I didn't do that.

474
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,730
You're speaking tomorrow, right?

475
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,023
- Yes, yes.
- I hope it goes well.

476
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,068
It'll be more than speaking.
Why don't you just go?

477
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,819
Hi!

478
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,071
', guys.

479
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,280
Make it bigger.

480
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,656
Hi, Daddy.

481
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,664
Can you guys hear me?
Hello?

482
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,042
This thing is no good.

483
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,586
That's their actual reaction to you.

484
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,090
- Hello.
- Hi.

485
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,550
Daddy, you can...

486
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,469
They're usually more animated.

487
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,140
Did you call your folks and tell 'em
you're here all right and everything?

488
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,726
Oh, hi, Mom. How you doing?

489
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,728
Yeah, yeah, I'm in Eugene.

490
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,981
I have my own room.
I'm at the Hilton.

491
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,068
It was cool, Mom.
I was a baller.

492
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,780
- What?
- Private planes.

493
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,199
Tell your mother I don't understand
half of what you're saying.

494
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,244
Oh, Conan doesn't understand
how I speak sometimes.

495
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,537
?
Okay.

496
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,122
All right, dude.

497
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,456
Dude? Who calls...

498
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,667
All right, Mom. I love you.
I'll talk to you soon.

499
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,504
Do you know
which way we're heading?

500
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,629
No.

501
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:54,725
Should I be worried
that we're opening in a town

502
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,310
where nobody lives?

503
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,187
I don't see anybody.

504
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,860
There's nobody here.

505
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,073
Okay-

506
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,993
It's gonna be all right.
They'll show up.

507
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,497
So, you need a ticket.

508
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,458
Can you hold it up
a little bit for us?

509
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,168
I thought it was...

510
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,463
Stage is this way?

511
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:34,140
Over cheek area and forehead,
at hairline and temples.

512
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,184
Do not use heavily under cheek.

513
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,061
Will give too much depth
of cheek gaunt.

514
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,313
What does that do?

515
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,649
You're... it just adds color,
gives you a natural glow.

516
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,111
I wish I had a natural glow.

517
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,529
It's not your fault.

518
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,493
How are the Andy Richter
urinal mints selling?

519
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:54,826
His idea.

520
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,287
- Through the roof.
- Yeah.

521
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,164
People can't wait to pee on you.

522
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,416
He said everybody loves
pissing on my face.

523
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,503
At least get out in front
of a big, you know, crowd again.

524
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,298
It's been... a while.

525
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,135
And... l really miss it.

526
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,095
- Just before the plane crashes...
- Yes.

527
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,681
- The pilots from Aeroflot.
- One, two, three.

Ladies and gentlemen,

536
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,604
live in Eugene, Oregon,

537
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:09,610
it's Conan O'Brien!

538
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,712
Thank you for that.
That feels good.

539
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,631
I've been off the air for 31/2 months.
I missed applause.

540
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,092
This is... I got to tell you,
it's very nice.

541
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,552
There are eight stages

542
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,721
of mourning the loss
of your talk show.

543
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,640
Stage two... blame myself.

544
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,434
Folks, I didn't spend
a lot of time on that stage,

545
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,271
'cause what the hell did I do?

546
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,648
Yeah. So...

547
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,526
No. I blew past this stage,

548
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,236
and I went right to stage three...

549
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,114
blame everyone else around me.

550
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,366
I blamed everybody
and everything,

551
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,328
and this led to stage four... anger.

552
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,164
I was really, really angry.

553
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,709
And I wasn't just angry
that <i>I</i> wasn't on television anymore.

554
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:11,464
I was mad that I'm not on TV,
but other people still are.

555
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,383
That's right. Other people
still get to be on television,

556
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,843
but not Conan O'Brien.

557
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,095
Now, I don't want to be petty
and name names,

558
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,389
but what I will do
is show you photos of them

559
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,974
as I name their names.

560
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,645
And then, finally,
there's that last step...

561
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,189
that last step
that makes all the difference,

562
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,899
the step where you
win your esteem back.

563
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,234
You wake up one day,
you put on your clothes,

564
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,904
you pull yourself together,
you grow a pair, you look in the mirror,

565
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,782
and you get your ass
to Eugene, Oregon!

566
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:38,991
That's what you do!

567
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,536
This is a cool opportunity for me.

568
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,665
This is my opportunity
to tell you who I am,

569
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,583
how I grew up,
and how I came to be.

570
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,460
Do you want to hear this story?
It's a pretty good story.

571
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,087
You do?
Let's have some music, Jim.

572
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,428
Now, I'm gonna need a little more help
with this, ladies and gentlemen.

573
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,098
So, right now please welcome,
for the first time

574
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:06,477
on this stage or any stage,

575
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,521
the Coquettes!

576
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,023
Oh, my God.

577
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,069
Yeah.

578
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,697
You know, since this is a tour,

579
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,782
we were thinking about calling
them the Tourettes,

580
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,784
but they kept shouting, "Fuck."

581
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,245
It was kind of weird.

582
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,330
All right, I'm gonna tell you
a little something about me.

583
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,624
I don't know if anyone's
ever been back East much.

584
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,000
You've been back East much?

585
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:35,256
I come from a place
called Brookline, Massachusetts.

586
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,385
Yeah.
It's an affluent suburb of Boston.

587
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,805
It was pretty tough
growing up in Brookline,

588
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,101
'cause most people...
most people were upper-class.

589
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:51,397
But we... we were
upper middle-class.

590
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,108
It was hell.

591
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,737
My mama, my poor, old mama,
my sainted mama...

592
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,489
I love my mama,
but she had it tough.

593
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,825
You see, my mama is a lawyer

594
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,411
at Ropes & Gray Law Firm
in downtown Boston.

595
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,830
She specializes in tax and trusts,

596
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,749
and she made partner really quickly.

597
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,084
Pulls in a lot of money.
Did very well for herself.

598
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,880
And my daddy...
my daddy was no good.

599
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,631
My daddy is no good.

600
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,134
My daddy works
at Brigham Women's Hospital.

601
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,220
He's a microbiologist.
He studies infectious diseases.

602
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,723
He's done a lot of work
with the World Health Organization.

603
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,850

00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:04,386

Yeah, it's just a song

620
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,684
about growing up poor
in the South that I always liked.

621
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:15,523
And I wanted to sing it,
so kind of fudged the facts a little bit.

622

Two things and only two things

will get you out of a song like this.

Thank you, Eugene!

636
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,871
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,205
That's that.

638
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,840
What'd you think?

639
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,263
We have to do 44 more of those,

640
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,725
so I got to tone it down, maybe.
I don't know.

641
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:39,398
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel that euphoria.

642
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,400
I don't know.
I just... I like doing it,

643
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,403
and then when it's done,
you're just, like...

644
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,781
Everyone's just focused
on what could be better,

645
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,325
what could be fixed,
which is good.

646
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,659
That's how you get it
to be better.

647
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,121
But it's like... so, it's not like,
"Yeah! Let's all high-five each other."

648
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,206
It's really good
to have one done, though.

649
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,791
I have to say that.

650
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,086
I just don't know
how we're gonna do more of them.

651
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,049
It looks all right.
Great job, Bill.

652
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,675
Good to see you.
How are you?

653
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,677
Hey.
Hey. How are you?

654
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,721
Hey. How are you?
Good to see you.

655
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,723
Here's the thing that really got me.

656
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,183
At the end, you're going up the alley.

657
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,559
- Went right behind me, right?
- Right.

658
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,769
You came back down,
you kissed a girl.

659
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,312
You came down, you kissed a guy.

660
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,647
- Right. Of course.
- The row behind me.

661
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,815
The guy says.
"Now I can die happy."

662
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,069
You really looked happy, man.

663
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,279
Oh, I was thrilled... yeah, just thrilled.

664
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,739
You got to pack it up and go.

665
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,908
You're going to Vancouver tomorrow?

666
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,826
You got another show tomorrow?

667
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,995
Yay!

668
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,413
How you doing?

669
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,501
Good night, everybody!

670
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,929
Are you going to check in
and see what the press is saying,

671
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,555
or are you going to avoid it?

672
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,140
- What's your plan?
- I don't read that stuff.

673
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,350
He's never read it.

674
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,435
No. I'm fine, thanks.
I've never read it.

675
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,979
He's never read it.

676
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,606
It's pointless to do that.

677
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,068
Because it's...
at the end of the day, it's all opinions.

678
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,487
- The online buzz...
- Yeah.

679
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,155
That's all I like to hear.

680
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,908
And I'm like, "Good. Let's move on."

681
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,953
We got to keep moving
and evolving this show.

682
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,788
I like this part, you know?

683
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,542
I like the travel aspect of it.
I like the adventure of it.

684
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,044
I love walking around a city
for the first time.

685
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,839
You know, when aliens come...

686
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,716
When aliens come,
they're gonna land there,

687
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,552
'cause they're gonna think
that's where our leader lives.

688
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,679
Come on now.

689
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,222
What am I always
hitting people for?

690
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,641
It's not acceptable.
It's not acceptable.

691
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,603
I like that. One in two shows
by popular demand.

692
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,647
How do we get back to that
where we came from?

693
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,537
I know a lot of people came to Vegas
this weekend to see the fight,

694
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,110
but I think this is
the main event tonight.

695
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,779
Audience... Bleh! Bloviate.

696
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,657
I could do the scene for you.
I can do that.

697
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,868
What's that?
Did you talk over me again?

698
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,828
Get your radar straight.

699
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,663
Seriously, man.

700
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,540
When Mozart's playing the old 88s,

701
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,918
you don't sit on his lap
and play "Chopsticks."

702
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,629
- Ooh, wow.
- I might be a fucking genius,

703
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,381
and I might be
the biggest dick ever.

704
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,008
I don't know.
Or maybe both.

705
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,468
That's what Patton was.

706
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,470
- Napoleon.
- Maybe.

707
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,971
- Clemenceau.
- Pulitzer.

708
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,057
About 15-ish.

709
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,979
Hello, Las Vegas.
How's everybody doing?

710
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,190
You ready?
What else is forbidden?

711
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,441
I'll tell you what's forbidden.

712
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,235
This is how crazy this thing got
between me and NBC.

713
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,198
It got so crazy,
anyone who even looks like me

714
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,450
can't be on television right now.

715
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,785
Yes. It's true.

716
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,430
Yeah. Say good-bye
to the Wendy's girl.

717
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,872
She can't exist right now.

718
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,499
Say good-bye
to Jimmy Neutron.

719
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,084
Jimmy Neutron's gone.

720
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,086
And, of course, say farewell
to Oscar-winning actress

721
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,337
Tilda Swinton.

722
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,130
She's just out of here.

723
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,679
Are you looking
for a good time?

724
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,265
I mean a really good time?

725
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,518
The kind of good time
where you wake up

726
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,019
with body glitter in your mouth

727
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,064
and the smell of grandma
on your clothes?

728
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,900
Then look no further than

729
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,112
Las Vegas' oldest topless bar.

730
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,866
Located north of the Strip,
opened in '72,

731
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,745
which is also the average age
of their dancers.

732
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,164
These fossilized beauties
give new meaning

733
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,959
to the term "flappers."

759
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,478
Are people
happy with that show?

760
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,480
Nobody was unhappy.

761
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,778
You know something?

762
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,447
That night when you were talking
about how angry you sometimes feel

763
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,282
and how you're kind of
working that out in the show

764
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,659
and a lot of, you know...

765
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,701
Right.

766
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,329
Well, now that you've been doing it,
has that changed at all?

767
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,249
It feels really good to go out
and perform in front of people...

768
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:39,424
and be in contact with people that are
enthusiastic about me and what I do,

769
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:43,136
and so that's obviously
healthy or feels good.

770
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,139
And then there are other times
where I'll just...

771
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,102
be back at the hotel, and I'll be thinking
about what went down

772
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,730
with those, you know, people at NBC,

773
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:58,360
and I'll be really mad
about it all over again.

774
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,195
So, yeah, I think it's... that'll...

775
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,364
It's gonna take a little while.

776
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,824
It's like a gallstone.

777
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,411
It just has to work its way
through my urethra.

778
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:12,165
And eventually that stone
and a little bit of blood

779
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,503
will drop into the toilet, and...

780
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,338
I'll be done with those fuckers.

781
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,341
Have you seen
the new In Touch magazine?

782
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,095
It's time to really kick things
up a notch now.

783
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:29,141

I will never let Eddie Vedder
borrow my tambourines again.

794
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,478
Jesus.

795
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,603
This is a big show.

796
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,481
It's a big show, yeah.

797
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,819
It started out as a small idea,
and it kept getting bigger and bigger.

798
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,654
Where'd you get
these musical chops?

799
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,572
What's the difference
between doing it here

800
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,825
and doing it in front
of a live audience in New York?

801
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,410
Are you making
any money on this?

802
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,161
Yeah, I hope so.

803
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,913
How's your voice holding up?

804
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,082
It's so far, so good.
It's not the show.

805
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,418
It's the interviews right after
the show that are killing me.

806
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,254
Let's get to that fake birthday party.

807
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,298
Oh, what an awkward situation.

808
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,926
This is the exact opposite
of what I wanted.

809
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,261
This is great!

810
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,056
This is amazing!

811
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,769
I've always wanted to have a 47th birthday
with "60 Minutes" here,

812
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,815
and this is such an intimate way
to celebrate my birth.

813
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,650
How are you?

814
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,110
Good to see you, pal.

815
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,488
This'll be good TV, see.
We'll get B-roll of the old birthday.

816
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,664
Yes, it's really good!

817
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,214
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

818
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,636

Now shut up.

822
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,232
Like, I ran into someone
on the street, and he said,

823
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,109
"Yeah, a friend of mine said
he asked you for an autograph,

824
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,394
and you, like, blew him off,"

825
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:30,906
and I said, "That's not possible."

826
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,408
I said it with authority,
like the way you would say,

827
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,244
"A friend of mine said you shot at him
with your .22 handgun."

828
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,121
"That's not possible."

829
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:41,208
It's Conan O'Brien's birthday.

830
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,962
I can't leave the venue right now.

831
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,167
Can you explain... will you go outside
and get that from him and I'll sign it?

832
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,636
I have no authority here.
Thank you, one guy.

833
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,721
You're done in this business.

834
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,432
He asked if you could use
the red pen on that one.

835
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,100
Oh. A controlling dick.

836
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,854
I've never denied anybody anything.

837
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,397
Okay, and you want me
to sign your back?

838
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,316
- Yes.
- Okay. Why?

839
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,570
So I can get it tattooed. It's my first
one, so it's gonna be really special.

840
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,908
Dah! Paparazzi!

841
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,995
That's why, you know, it's important...
like, you're really nice.

842
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,625
Sona's really nice to people on the phone
and sort of warm and personal,

843
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,835
and I think a lot of people
can't get to me.

844
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:30,298
That's important if the person
who's my voice to the outside world

845
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:34,427
is telling people to...
like, being cold.

846
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,096
I just think that's huge.

847
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,931
- It's a compliment?
- I complimented you.

848
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,266
Thank you.

849
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,437
How long
did you drive to be here?

850
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:48,275
Well, I drove seven hours to Calgary
and then like three here.

851
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,442
Just to come see the show?

852
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,571
- Yeah.
- Oh, get in here, man. Jesus. Uh.

853
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,115
Now, what's your...
you had a situation here?

854
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,452
I had this I.D. card that I bought specifically
so I could see this, 'cause I am 18.

855
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,121
So, what's the problem?

856
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,529
I wrote my learner's and passed it two
days ago, and they took my I.D. card away.

857
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,711
I'm just wondering if they're gonna Jew me
and not let me in here.

858
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:08,836
If they're gonna what?

859
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,383
They're gonna gyp me
and not let me in here.

860
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,595
And that would just not be cool
after getting a ticket.

861
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,221
I've been really excited to see this.

862
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,223
- Right. Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

863
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,184
Okay, I'll just have to look
past the anti-Semitic remark.

864
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,147
I love Mel Gibson, dude.

865
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,483
Uh, wow. Okay, now I
don't think I want to let you in.

866
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,693
No, no, no, no.

867
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,653
Have to promise to never use
that expression again.

868
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,613
Okay, I promise.

869
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,365
Jeff Ross!
Can you come here for a sec?

870
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:40,160
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.
My producer's Jewish.

871
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,205
So, when you start saying... when you start
saying, "I got jewed out of something,"

872
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,208
and you're asking my producer,
who's Jewish, and I'm half-Jewish...

873
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,046
so, this kid has a situation where
he's driven like 60 hours to get here.

874
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:54,507
- And?
- And he doesn't have his government I.D.

875
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,259
that will get him into the casino.

876
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,148
Now these guys are saying
he can't come in.

877
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,263
I don't know if there's anyone here
at the casino we can ask.

878
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,139
Maybe.

879
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,141
♪ Conan's vocal ♪

880
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,685
♪ Don't have enough Conan's vocal ♪

881
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,650
Hold on. Dave?
Testing, testing.

882
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,737
Welcome to it.

883
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,742
I do feel like we've been arrested at the border
and asked to wait in this room. Don't you?

884
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,535
What happened to us, Andy?

885
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,790
We'll get a giant poster of Jay Leno.

886
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,083
- No.
- Eee!

887
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,502
Well, 'cause everyone
who's performed here has a poster.

888
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,170
Oh. Eee!

889
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,815
It actually says that
when you walk by.

890
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:38,284
Apply it with the brush
and then tap it in with your finger.

891
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,887
- I will. I will. I will. Please.
- Oh. Okay.

892
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,431
- Covering up the eye vein...
- Oh, boy.

893
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,809
That most people love,
buy you guys insist I cover.

894
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,603
You are aging wonderfully, Millicent.

895
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,273
I'm ready to meet my groom.

896
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,109
Send him in.

897
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,027
You use whichever
makes you feel prettiest.

898
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,030
If it's blowing off
like that, it's too much.

899
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,825
I think I know... would you get
your arm out of the mirror?

900
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,827
- You insane Armenian.
- Oh, my God!

901
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,913
Did you see her lunge at me
with a cutlass?

902
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,249
How much more deodorant
do you need?

903
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,458
I want more.

904
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,960
Is it like one for each armpit?

905
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,878
You know what I do?
I pretend they're awards.

906
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,588
Out when I get naked.

907
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,090
- Oh, no.
- Sorry.

908
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,260
Hey, I'm sorry I said that shit about you
in the Edmonton Gazette.

909
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,512
Don't be sorry.
It needed to be said.

910
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,180
But you're not a fucking asshole

911
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,474
who's the worst piece of shit
that anyone's ever seen.

912
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,652
When do I do my meet and greet?

913
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,195
What? Don't be nervous.

914
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,488
I've, like, loved you for so long.

915
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,450
- Oh, really? You have?
- Yes.

916
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:44,826
- All right, well...
- I love you.

917
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,244
Well, thank you so much.

918
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,122
No. Truly, I love you.

919
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,750
She won't send you...
I'll make sure...

920
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,210
- It was awesome. And it was fun.
- Oh, good.

921
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,670
I'm telling people
this is my prom photo.

922
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,089
Hello.

923
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,425
This won't go well.

924
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,638
Oh, yay! Yay!

925
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,267
This is weird.
I just heard about this.

926
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,602
There's a WME...

927
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:14,147
William Morris Endeavor's
throwing a party before the show.

928
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,817
I'll do a show for them before the show,
blow out my voice.

929
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,989
My inherent neediness will dominate.

930
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,450
I'm just gonna make it
my mandate not to talk.

931
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,818
How are you? Good to see you.

932
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:27,869
Hi. How are you?

933
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,162
I really...
I just really love it.

934
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,039
There's like a...
it sounds crass,

935
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,334
but kind of like a Make-A-Wish Foundation
element to the whole thing.

936
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,419
Like, Conan's got 3 months to live.

937
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,104
Let's not tell him, but let's let him have
this complete fantasy.

938
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,574
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

939
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,217
How are you?
Good to see you.

940
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,342
How are you?
Yes, I do.

941
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,706
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.

942
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,638
The chairman
of Warner Bros. Television.

943
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,003
Ah, yes, very nice to meet you.

944
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:48,765
I'm not used to...

945
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,850
They told me, like, yeah,
they have a party before the show,

946
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,310
and I said, "Before the show?"

947
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,730
This is Nellie Andreeva, who writes...
she writes nice things about you.

948
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,455
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You got to go.

949
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,192
- What's that?
- They want you backstage.

950
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,568
I know this guy. How are you?

951
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,403
How are you?
Everything okay?

952
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,615
Let's have a new rule
about parties before the show.

953
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,117
It's just... I'm out
there, like, working it.

954
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,828
I'm like, "This is fucked up."

955
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,830
Well, it doesn't... okay.

956
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,581
Well...

957
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,833
- Hey.
'Yes?

958
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,211
- Oh, no.
- I smell... I smell wet hay.

959
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,336
There he is.

960
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,713
Yay, yay-
Did you get my e-mail?

961
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,006
Yee-haw.

962
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,424
You don't read your e-mails?

963
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,717
How are you?
Great to see you.

964
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,637
- So, have you...
- I e-mailed him, but he doesn't read e-mails.

965
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,347
- I didn't get the e-mail.
- Oh, for God's sake.

966
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,016
Gee, gawrsh, what's an e-mail?

967
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,728
Doing, doing, doing.

968
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,355
Get him.
Get him, Jon Hamm.

969
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,608
- Doing, doing, doing.
- We're best friends.

970
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,943
No, look at this.
Check this out.

971
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,444
Oh, yeah.

972
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,864
That is so stupid.

973
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,325
That's called the toilet, Jack.

974
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,452
What a rube.

975
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:56,040
We'll just do a little...
little tune here.

976
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:59,043
It's a song I wrote
about Jack McBrayer.

977
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,337
♪ You stupid hick ♪

978
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,217
♪ You were born in shit ♪

979
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,137
- Oh, that's not nice.
- What?

980
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,473
But, anyway, there's a whole part
about a mule calling you on the phone.

981
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,434
Why am I working this hard
before a show?

982
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,685
I don't know.

983
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,770
I'm not sure I know.

984
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,607
Hey, Jon, guess who I'm doing.

985
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:24,652
: Hey, Jon,
you want to go out and try and get...

986
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,362
Jim Nabors. Jim Nabors.

987
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,156
No. Keep thinking.

988
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,950
Hey, I love Los Feliz, too.

989
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,037
These will save my throat.
Do you have any cocaine?

990
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,914
- What is wrong with you?
- Come on.

991
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,791
- He's changed.
- I need it.

992
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,671
I had a different Jack McBrayer
on the phone.

993
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,217
Okay, he can't help...

994
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,472
Stop it!

995
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,895
Ha ha ha, I can't help it.

996
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,563
How come you get
to hang out with him?

997
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,273
There's such an inequality.

998
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,485
- I don't want to sound rude.
- Too late.

999
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,820
But it is. It's like watching
the Monopoly money guy

1000
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,322
walking around with a pig on a leash.

1001
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,783
It's ridiculous.
Yee-haw!

1002
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,326
Come on.

1003
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,705
Will you say that this is crazy
for me to be doing this before a show?

1004
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,833
Well, who's in control of things
around here?

1005
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,920
No, you can't put this on Sona.
She's like 18.

1006
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,327
So far, it's been the most fun
I've had in show business.

1007
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,717
Crazy. Who has a party for...
Who does that?

1008
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,469
Who entertains people
before a show?

1009
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,887
I want to find someone.

1010
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,639
Jeff's acting like, "I didn't do this."

1011
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,891
I'm like, "Aren't you fucking in charge?"

1012
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,060
- I think you're in charge.
- I'm tired now.

1013
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,688
Voice. Voice.

1014
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,112
Walk of death. Let's do it.

1015
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:49,988
Walk?

1016
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,450
Guys, follow me.

1017
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,077
But I'm telling you guys something.

1018
00:49:56,202 --> 00:50:00,206
Doing this tour is a huge milestone
for me... huge milestone for me.

1019
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,001
And I will tell you why.
I will tell you why.

1020
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,629
This is the first time
in my 20-year television career

1021
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,257
that anyone has paid to see me.

1022
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,551
Isn't that amazing?

1023
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,303
First time anyone's paid to see me.

1024
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:15,555
Yeah.

1025
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,975
Oh, don't get me wrong.
They've paid to make me go away.

1026
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,029
It was good, right?

1027
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,447
Yes, it was good.

1028
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,536
I think I lost 30 pounds on that one.

1029
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,873
I'm what they called
in vaudeville a sweat act.

1030
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,750
We're gonna have a problem.

1031
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,115
- What's that?
- There's always an excuse for me to talk.

1032
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,629
Like, "Well, it would be good if you run this
phone call. It'd be good if you came by.

1033
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,673
It'd be good if you talk to these people.
It would really help.

1034
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,301
It'll just take 10 minutes. It'll
take 15 minutes." But it never does.

1035
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,970
You could shoot me in the left lung
and I'll do this show,

1036
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,222
but if I lose my voice, we're done.

1037
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,766
Everyone's thrilled.

1038
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,768
- They're all outside.
- I'll go say hi.

1039
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,146
That was fantastic.
That was so much fun.

1040
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,606
We melted minds.

1041
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,024
Thank you so much.

1042
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,862
It doesn't matter if it's frickin' U2.

1043
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,655
If I go to a concert,

1044
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,785
I always have this intense compulsion
to go onstage, no matter who's onstage.

1045
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,746
Invariably, security
gets in the way. Yeah.

1046
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,581
I'm gonna tell people
that you just showed up.

1047
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,458
- I can't stop him.
- What the hell?

1048
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,503
Thanks for having me.
Thanks.

1049
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:29,962
Thank you for doing it.
This was amazing.

1050
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,380
I'm gonna take a hot tub.

1051
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,633
You go right ahead.

1052
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,401
- That was amazing.
- I had so much fun.

1053
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,677
So fun to see that.

1054
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,387
- Hi.
- Here we go.

1055
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:39,972
Get the hot tub going.

1056
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,391
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey. Thanks so much.

1057
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,935
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.

1058
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,780
- Great job.
- Am I in trouble if I don't...

1059
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,063
Can I go do this
and then come back?

1060
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,314
Yeah, yeah, you can do this.

1061
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,679
Now I go do the meet and greet.

1062
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,651
- Oh, do it.
- It's the part that makes it all happen.

1063
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:52,776
It's all right.

1064
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,948
- Hey, how are you?
- I have a bromance with you.

1065
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,242
I've always just kind of wanted
to run away and join the circus,

1066
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,326
and that's what this show is.

1067
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,869
One, two, and three.

1068
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,788
Now, I made you
some cookies, Conan.

1069
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,748
Now, I know...
and it's not poisonous.

1070
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,918
On three.
One, two, and three.

1071
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,671
- Thank you for liking what I do.
- Whoo!

1072
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:12,797
You make us so happy.

1073
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,132
At the end of the day...
Oh, that's...

1074
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:16,300
That's, at the end of the day,
that's all I've ever wanted.

1075
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,177
- Are you gonna bring...
- And money and real estate.

1076
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,305
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, that was amazing.

1077
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:26,519
I can't shut up, so I will talk to cab
drivers for 40 minutes when I don't have to.

1078
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,521
Hey.
How do we get to each...

1079
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,190
Hey. So, this is Karen Lee.

1080
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,650
Hi. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

1081
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,255
Nice to see you.
Oh, hey, how are you?

1082
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,403
- Hi. Tab.
- How are you?

1083
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,612
- Nice to see you.
- This is Sydney.

1084
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,446
Hi, Coco.

1085
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,993
Hi. How are you?

1086
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:43,558
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1087
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,912
This is my cousin Leonard.

1088
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,247
- Hey, how you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

1089
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,540
Nice to see you.

1090
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:48,916
This is my Auntie April.

1091
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,668
Hi, precious.
How are you?

1092
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,253
Do you see any pizza on my face?

1093
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,588
No, I don't see any pizza.

1094
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,673
- This is my mama.
- Hi. How are you?

1095
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,967
- How are you?
- Good. Good. Good.

1096
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,720
You have such a talented,
amazing daughter.

1097
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,805
Mom, Mom, get on the other side.

1098
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,599
Treat the man right.

1099
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,184
Get my good side now.

1100
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,312
I don't have a good side.

1101
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,147
Let's use the real camera.

1102
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,940
Yeah, right. Right.

1103
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,984
Not something that's really a phone.

1104
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,569
Three.

1105
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,238
One, two...

1106
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,740
Did it work out?

1107
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,783
- Really nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1108
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,037
- Thanks a lot.
- Nice to see you.

1109
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,497
- Nice meeting you guys.
- Nice meeting you.

1110
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,042
- Thank you.
- Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1111
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:38,674
Because it's the fucking craziness
afterwards that is kind of killing me.

1112
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,319
It's not the show
that's gonna kill me.

1113
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:43,095
And there's this whole culture
of backstage,

1114
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,390
and, you know, I have real friends
that I want to talk to,

1115
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:50,019
but other people just come in,
and I don't even know them.

1116
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,688
Let's have a system...
Where's Jeff Ross?

1117
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,316
We start it with Jeff Ross.
This is not your job.

1118
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,694
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah, but I could be like, "Hey, you got to go."

1119
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,404
And then you could be like, "Ooh."

1120
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,240
I could be very authoritative.

1121
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,075
I'm gonna make you a tea...
a throat coat.

1122
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,701
- Mom.
- Yes, throat coat.

1123
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,286
No, you don't have to...
Don't make me a throat...

1124
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,371
I don't want to drink that shit.

1125
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,872
- Seriously.
- You want it with chamomile?

1126
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,237
No. You know what I want to do?

1127
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,044
Not talk to 100 people, you know,
who I don't even know,

1128
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:18,756
not have each Coquette
bring in 35 people.

1129
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,259
I'd like somebody to help me.

1130
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,302
People take the hinges off the door,

1131
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,972
and everybody from the audience
comes in here afterwards

1132
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,182
and want different combinations of photos.

1133
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,141
"I want a photo.

1134
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,067
Now I want a photo
where you can string dance.

1135
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,520
Can you hold this banana?

1136
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,314
It's a private joke
with my friend from lowa."

1137
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,067
See which Coquette that is.

1138
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,070
We're going in.
There we are, man.

1139
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,155
Borgata. Atlantic City.

1140
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,617
We're gonna hit it,
we're gonna quit it.

1141
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,035
Two shows. One night.

1142
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,208
- How are you?
- Good.

1143
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,710
Good. I got to go do
some meet and greet.

1144
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,003
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1145
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,796
Think I'll give a little piece
of my soul away.

1146
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,631
One, two, and three.

1147
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,134
And I know she definitely
wants one one-on-one.

1148
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,846
You made this.
Thank you so much.

1149
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:10,057
Do you have any advice
how to get our children into Episcopal?

1150
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,058
Uh...

1151
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,561
Idiot! Stupid...

1152
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,730
Fat little man.

1153
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,149
- Is that frickin' pizza?
- It's frickin' pizza.

1154
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:19,567
What's this?
Is this a telegram?

1155
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,610
It's from Jay Leno.

1156
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,237
"Hope stand-up's going well.

1157
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,407
Ha ha. See, it's not so hard after all.
Anyone can do it.

1158
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,242
What's it like to have a soul?"

1159
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,202
I don't even know what he's...

1160
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,665
Oh, they're hardcore about
the support for Conan O'Brien.

1161
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,709
I-A-N.

1162
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,879
"We told The Chin
on his recent trip there..."

1163
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,130
What the fuck?

1164
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,215
"Masturbating bear pizza."

1165
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:46,594
- No way.
- "Conan is a hero in our eyes.

1166
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,722
He honorably stepped down,
poked a little fun all the way,

1167
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,435
and dignifiedly let The Chin place himself
on a pedestal of garbage."

1168
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,520
I'm not making this up.
This is real.

1169
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,688
Who is this for?

1170
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,274
This one's Goldie Olson.

1171
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,860
"This is a huge and monumental day
in the history of Atlantic City,

1172
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:06,113
and everyone should roll out the red carpet
for our old Irish pal."

1173
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,449
It looks like terrible, terrible pizza.

1174
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,872
Anyway, the point is,
I'm feeling pretty sexy right now.

1175
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:15,997
You know how it works.

1176
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,459
Sexy man on tour
equals groupies.

1177
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,003
I'm looking for some
Coco groupies right now.

1178
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,546
We got to find some.

1179
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,132
My friend Andy Richter
has a camera,

1180
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,801
and Andy is gonna
scan the crowd right now,

1181
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,677
and he's gonna find us
some groupies.

1182
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,596
Yes, okay.
Oh, my goodness.

1183
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,723
Whoo! Please keep it...

1184
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,433
What are you doing?

1185
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:38,104
Are you spanking a pony?
What are you doing?

1186
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:40,439
Oh, God.

1187
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,900
I don't think we sell that t-shirt.

1188
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,944
Hi.

1189
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,821
Hey. What the fuck?

1190
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,322
Wait a minute.
What is that?

1191
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,727
He knows how to work it.

1192
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,993
- Whoo!
- I like your hair.

1193
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,662
Wait. Oh, my God.

1194
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,497
Aah!

1195
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,375
I would.

1196
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,547
Hey, it's me.

1197
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,341
I'm just calling you in between...
in between shows.

1198
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,468
10 minutes, Conan.

1199
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,845
Sona, 10 minutes.

1200
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,304
See that crowd right there?

1201
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,140
That's the crowd tonight.
That's tonight's crowd.

1202
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,308
I'm like, "Hey, how you folks doing?"

1203
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,727
Yeah! Kick 'em in the face!

1204
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,563
Powder.

1205
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,481
Oh, sweet powder.

1206
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:26,277
Protect my skin, powder.

1207
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,112
Absorb all moistures.

1208
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,158
Oh, powder.
Sweet powder.

1209
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,911
Paint the illusion
my skin is dry.

1210
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,163
Oh, powder.

1211
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,540
Shut the fuck up.
You got a show to do.

1212
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,625
Oh, powder.

1213
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,921
I can't... I can't breathe.

1214
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,090
Powder,
your natural enemy is sweat.

1215
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,054
I walked away
from the greatest franchise in history

1216
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,098
'cause I refused
to go on at midnight,

1217
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,892
and here I am on at midnight.

1218
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,103
Hey, folks,
how you doing tonight?

1219
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,396
We're great.

1220
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,441
Okay, that was horrible.
How are you doing tonight?

1221
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,526
We're great!

1222
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,445
Are you enjoying the show so far?

1223
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,656
Yeah, it's fine.

1224
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,452
It's fine?
It's fine?

1225
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,370
I'm trying to give you
the best show I can.

1226
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,955
If I'm not doing something
you want to see,

1227
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,749
you got to tell me right now.

1228
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,502
Kiss LaBamba!

1229
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,129
No.

1230
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:30,508
Kiss him
like he's your girlfriend

1231
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,677
and you've been on a submarine
for six months.

1232
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,056
Let's get out of here.

1233
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,808
Let's make like a cold wind and blow.

1234
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,604
Another day, another dollar.

1235
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,564
♪ On the road again ♪

1236
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,944

to get on the road again ♪

1237
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,028
♪ Wa-ooh ♪

1240
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,578
Why are we stopped here?

1241
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm getting off this goddamned bus
and finding out what's happening.

1242
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,044
Boy, this will be good.

1243
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,255
Okay, Sona, what's happening?
Why did the bus stop?

1244
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,590
How are you?
What's your name?

1245
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,800
- Elaine.
- Elaine.

1246
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:13,842
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, Lindsay.

1247
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,427
- How are you?
- I'm Jen.

1248
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,304
How's it going?
We're headed to Boston.

1249
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,931
I have a band, and...

1250
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,225
So, I do comedy,
but then I jump in with them

1251
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,018
'cause I play guitar and sing,

1252
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,436
and we do...
it's a mix.

1253
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,272
I like your glasses.
Those are cool.

1254
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,482
- You like this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1255
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,109
Take care.
Nice to meet you.

1256
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,777
Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.

1257
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,279
Keep the bling.
Get more bling.

1258
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,155
Yeah, we wish you all the best.

1259
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,116
I'm sorry they did what they did.

1260
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,909
No, you know what?
I was sorry at the time, too,

1261
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,245
and then it turns out to be...
I wouldn't have been able...

1262
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,497
I wouldn't have been able
to do the tour.

1263
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,958
We're headed to Martha's Vineyard.

1264
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,626
Ooh, that's gonna be nice.

1265
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,461
Can we pray for you?

1266
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,046
- Can you what?
- Pray for you?

1267
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,673
Oh, pray for me?
Sure, you can.

1268
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:53,799
Yeah.

1269
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,218
Dear God, I thank you, Father,
for this moment, oh, God,

1270
00:59:56,343 --> 01:00:01,223
for allowing us to meet Conan O'Brien,
Lord, on our journey, Father,

1271
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:05,060
but I'm asking, oh, God,
that you open doors for this man, oh, God,

1272
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:08,022
that his finances
are in your hands, oh, God.

1273
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,274
Keep him safe and his family, God.

1274
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:14,361
Bless him unconditionally,
in Jesus' name. Amen.

1275
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,363
Wow.
That's really beautiful.

1276
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,865
- Thank you for doing that.
- Take care.

1277
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,326
There's a reason why you're here
and we're here.

1278
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,704
♪ I can't wait to get
on the road again ♪

1279
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,625
♪ Dear God, please let me
have a show again ♪

1280
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,086
So, we'll stay over
after the second Boston show,

1281
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,505
leave in the afternoon
as late as possible,

1282
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:36,800
probably 3:00
to go to Uncasville,

1283
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,677
where we're on
after the basketball game.

1284
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,930
Then we'll overnight
after that to Nashville.

1285
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,224
It's an 11-hour drive.

1286
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,518
Can we talk about Bonnaroo
for two minutes?

1287
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,062
Oh, nice.

1288
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,898
The dressing-room situation
is very primitive.

1289
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,900
One of the van buses
will be backstage.

1290
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:54,401
That's fine.
You look at me.

1291
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,111
- I'm a road dog now.
- I know.

1292
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,738
Don't you worry about me.

1293
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,074
I'll piss in a bucket,
I'll shit in your hat.

1294
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,533
It doesn't matter to me.

1295
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,995
I know you don't enjoy
"Rock this Town,"

1296
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,247
but I have more fun doing that
than anything else,

1297
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:08,733
and I'm entitled to have some fun.

1298
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,710
Yeah, but at whose expense?

1299
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,719
Bye-bye, Beantown.

1300
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,180
There are showers in here,
but they look very suspicious.

1301
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,432
I'm not sure I love
these Wang showers.

1302
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,267
I'm suspicious, but I think
I have to take a shower.

1303
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,894
What's the worst
that could happen?

1304
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,196
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Conan.

1305
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,240
No pictures, guys.
No pictures, guys.

1306
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,576
No pictures, guys.
No pictures, guys.

1307
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,288
No pictures.

1308
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,791
They don't let us keep
these buses here.

1309
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,001
Bye, Conan!

1310
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,255
See you guys in a while.

1311
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,636
Hi, Mr. O'Brien.
My name's Andy.

1312
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:03,804
Just don't speak to me.

1313
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,556
All right, I won't.
Don't worry.

1314
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:10,769
The entire ride home, don't worry.
I won't say a word to you.

1315
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,481
you lived here
for 20 years of your life,

1316
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,442
and you have an emotional
connection with this town?

1317
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:17,317
Yeah.

1318
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,694
I really like this town.
But I didn't...

1319
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,697
I'm not from here, so I never felt
like this was my home.

1320
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,449
But now I don't even feel
like Boston's my home.

1321
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,576
Los Angeles doesn't really feel
like my home.

1322
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,619
I don't know where my home is.

1323
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:28,871
- Hey, Chelsea.
- Hi. How are you?

1324
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,622
Would you like to do
any photos or anything?

1325
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,040
It it okay to do
one of these things?

1326
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,000
I can...

1327
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,543
- But you won't?
- Okay.

1328
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,503
What the fuck?
You do that, you do this.

1329
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,130
It's all about moving these hips.

1330
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,048
I love Flight of the Conchords.

1331
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,759
- Oh, thank you.
- So nice to meet you.

1332
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:42,885
Nice to meet you, too.

1333
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,179
Um, let me see
if he's still talking to her.

1334
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:46,384
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. How are you?

1335
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,639
- Good. I'm Kristen.
- Hi.

1336
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:49,057
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

1337
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,184
I just wanted
to give you a present.

1338
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,810
Look at that.
That's great.

1339
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,271
Thanks, dude.
All right, bye.

1340
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,929
You think David Hockney's queer?

1341
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,778
No. I said it's hot in here.

1342
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,613
I haven't talked to Sweeney yet

1343
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:04,323
about the plan with Colbert.

1344
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,328
Is it a surprise?
Is he just gonna walk onstage?

1345
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,534
I don't... This is the least re...

1346
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,819
I mean, there's no rehearsal.

1347
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,455
- I hereby grant to you...
- No!

1348
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,457
- Right. You do one of those.
- That's great.

1349
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,292
So, they know to stop the music
when you get hurt?

1350
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,417
Do they know to stop...

1351
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,544
No. I'm gonna tell them.

1352
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,010
Conan O'Brien.

1353
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,970
You challenge me...

1354
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,095
Then I give you another.

1355
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,723
So, you dance first. Right.

1356
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,392
Then I... then maybe we go together.

1357
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,937
And then, Jon... you walk out
and you stop it.

1358
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:37,147
You stop the music.

1359
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,900
Okay, you should get ready.

1360
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,528
Andy comes out and shoots Jon.

1361
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:46,073
- Andy shoots Jon.
- Wait, what?

1362
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,033
That's a bit lazy.

1363
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,453
Does anyone here think
that seems a bit lazy?

1364
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,250
That was
a big milestone to get past...

1365
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,001
I mean, to do, you know?

1366
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,128
Radio City, New York.

1367
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,214
- Thanks for holding the elevator.
- Yeah, thanks for doing that.

1368
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,757
Oh, no problem.
No problem, Mr. O'Brien.

1369
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:04,882
Conan. Call me Conan.

1370
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,718
- Yes, sir.
- See? "Sir."

1371
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,721
He called me "sir."
No one calls me "sir."

1372
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:10,931
I don't call you "sir."

1373
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,683
Talk to me for a second.

1374
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:13,851
- Hey-
- Hey-

1375
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:14,726
It seemed good.

1376
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:18,397
You gave this audience so much.

1377
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,482
They have no faces left.

1378
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:26,738
- Oh, my.
- What is it?

1379
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,490
No, they just have barricades up

1380
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,534
'cause there's quite
a few people out there.

1381
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:31,827
Here we go.
I'm not going to bed.

1382
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,162
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You are not going out.

1383
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,581
Yeah, I'm not.
I can't go to bed.

1384
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,291
I'm not gonna go home...
Jeff, you don't get it.

1385
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,084
I can't go from this
to doing what?

1386
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,378
Sitting and reading a Kindle?
That's not gonna fucking happen.

1387
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,633
Hey. Hey, buddy!

1388
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,510
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

1389
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,355
Hi. Thanks for coming.
You guys are awesome.

1390
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,597
Guys, I can sign things.

1391
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,266
It's kind of hard to take photos
with everybody, you know.

1392
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,894
- Come on.
- Oh, you mean just for you, you mean?

1393
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:58,729
You're the nicest guy.
Come on.

1394
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:00,772
That guy said
that was the only one.

1395
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:04,401
Oh, so I guess
that guy was lying.

1396
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,737
I guess that guy was a dick.

1397
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,739
Guys, we're done
with the pictures, 'cause...

1398
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:11,450
"Come on!"
Is that your catchphrase?

1399
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,452
You can keep saying,
"Come on, come on,"

1400
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,788
but it's really
not coming across too well.

1401
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,499
Can we get a picture?

1402
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,376
It's much easier to sign stuff.

1403
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,629
Hey, everybody, I got to go.
Thank you so much!

1404
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:27,174
See you.

1405
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,676
Can you shut that fucking door?

1406
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,321
- Thank you.
- Take care. See you, man.

1407
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,888
Thanks.

1408
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:38,352
From here on in, I want to make sure
that the days off are really days off.

1409
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,229
I Bagpipes playing 1

1410
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,572
Why do I feel
like a fireman died?

1411
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,380
We are 2 minutes away to start.

1412
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,590
Oh, there's a TV
over there in the corner.

1413
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:12,052
Does someone want to monitor
what the show's...

1414
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,139
How far are we
into the schedule?

1415
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,891
Please tell me. How much further
do we have to go?

1416
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,060
- Top of page 2.
- And where am I?

1417
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,812
It doesn't really matter how many.

1418
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,457
- Stop saying that.
- It's 10-minute...

1419
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,402
It's how many 10-minute
performances before you.

1420
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,192
We're dead. It's over.

1421
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,069
I want everyone on the bus.
We're getting out of here.

1422
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,154
This is crazy.
It's gonna be 11:30.

1423
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,413
What's happening now?
What's happening?

1424
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:42,124
68 minutes from now,
you will take the stage.

1425
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,751
- 68 minutes from now?
- 68 minutes from now,

1426
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,420
if they stick
to the schedule closely.

1427
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,796
I need a cab.

1428
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,464
I'm going to the Four Seasons Hotel.

1429
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,259

What if I run right now...
Just said, "This has to... Stop it."

I think that's it.

1475
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,222
I'm going to the hospital now.

1476
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,229
Sorry I missed you.

1477
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:34,064
Ah, it's too small a space.

1478
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,859
One thing. No photos.
One thing. No photos.

1479
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,986
One thing. Hello.
Speak English?

1480
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,155
One thing. No photos.
Right on.

1481
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,156
One thing. No photos.

1482
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,574
One thing. No photos.

1483
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,951
It's actually my shirt.

1484
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,871
Hey.

1485
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,165
Thank you.

1486
01:10:57,629 --> 01:10:59,798
It's like being in a zoo.

1487
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,901
Ooh, drum tower!

1488
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,778
I hate these.

1489
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,488
I think these look like shit.

1490
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,032
- They don't look good.
- They don't look good.

1491
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,534
I'm a known human being.

1492
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,661
I can't be seen looking like this.

1493
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,080
I'm gonna look like a freak.

1494
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,915
- Andy...
- You look good. You look good.

1495
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,585
It's all a fashion thing, Andy.
For Christ's sake.

1496
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,031
And I can't wear a white hat
if you're wearing a white hat.

1497
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,549
Oh, good.
It's miserable again.

1498
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,218
This is ours
until right after the show.

1499
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,583
- What about that?
- You want to do... anything you want.

1500
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:49,481
This is all stuff
I bought for you for today.

1501
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,725
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

1502
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,185
Don't put up with it.
Just stand up for yourself.

1503
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,022
"Raw" suit?
Oh, poor Conan.

1504
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:03,111
People started lining up today
at 5:30 for this show.

1505
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,865
So, we're gonna do a bunch
of jokes about saps?

1506
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:32,599
15 minutes ago, they told me
the air-conditioning went out in this tent.

1507
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:40,023
It's like we're doing comedy
in a Native American sweat lodge.

1508
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:43,360
This is great. In 6 months,
I've gone from hosting "The Tonight Show"

1509
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:45,862
to performing at a refugee camp.

1510
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,503
You seem to want to get
a picture close up.

1511
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,035
Do you? Do you want
to get a closer picture?

1512
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,953
Come on up.
That's okay. That's all right.

1513
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:55,914
It's all fine.

1514
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,124
Let's get a picture together.

1515
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,835
Right here.
Let's turn this way.

1516
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,545
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1517
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,506
Right here.
This is all Bonnaroo, baby.

1518
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:11,805
I love you.

1519
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,851
Where are you going?

1520
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,561
Come back.

1521
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,784
Yeah!

1522
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,833
Two words to you, buddy.

1523
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,000
You're amazing.

1524
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,566
Why? Why today
and not any other day?

1525
01:13:42,669 --> 01:13:44,671
I'll tell you later.

1526
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:45,797
You will?

1527
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,467
That's me. Whenever I hear
someone say "That was amazing,"

1528
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,845
I think, "What was wrong
with the other ones?"

1529
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:00,687
He got stopped, of course.

1530
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,480
When I first met Jack,

1531
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,689
it was a couple years
before the White Stripes hit,

1532
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,374
and I was in a bowling alley in Detroit.

1533
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:07,443
Conan, we got to run.

1534
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,279
I know.
Just give me one second.

1535
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,786
- I guess you're good?
- Thank you, Missy.

1536
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,082
- This is Nella Page.
- Oh, my goodness.

1537
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,376
As in Jimmy,
and that's Alex Lennon.

1538
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,505
Good. Great. Thank you.

1539
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:32,552
I mean, can it be something as easy
as just coming out and saying,

1540
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,013
"How's everybody doing? Blah.
You can be louder. Blah."

1541
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:38,141
And then be like, "Here. Here's
the fucking nuts" or something.

1542
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:41,686
I mean, couldn't it be just like, literally,
"How you doing?", one joke and then...

1543
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,648
Again, I don't think you're contractually
obligated to do bits out there.

1544
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,066
No, it's not that.

1545
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:49,903
I'm always disheartened

1546
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,628
when the people that actually made
the arrangement are never here.

1547
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:53,823
Right. Right.

1548
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,951
No one's here. Nobody ever knows
what the fuck they're talking about.

1549
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,454
It's always, "Yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine."

1550
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,372
And then Jeff's on a plane,
and later he can say,

1551
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:02,749
"I didn't know. I didn't know."

1552
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,434
- It's almost over.
- I know.

1553
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,588
People keep saying that, but that's
what they said to Anne Frank, you know?

1554
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,673
You did not just
compare yourself to Anne Frank.

1555
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,383
- You didn't do that.
- We both took a stand.

1556
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:15,220
My point is that I definitely
got signed up for too much.

1557
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:16,345
I know.

1558
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,349
And moving forward, you know,
there's a lot of not...

1559
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,768
No one's thinking
about burning me out.

1560
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,061
Nobody's thinking about it.

1561
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,813
And when I burn out and everyone
doesn't have a job anymore,

1562
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:27,482
they're gonna be pissed.

1563
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,902
We have to be thinking about,
like, "Wait a minute. Really?

1564
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,531
He's doing a whole day with Jack White
and he's doing Bonnaroo

1565
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:36,937
and he's introducing all the acts
and he's gonna stay late

1566
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,410
and introduce Jay-Z
and Stevie Wonder?"

1567
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,329
Jim is informing me that, you know,

1568
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,624
the festival would like more
than just a line or two.

1569
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,751
Just... that's been their take all along.

1570
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,504
I honestly... I didn't even know
he was introducing

1571
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,422
until I e-mailed Jeff two days ago.

1572
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,466
I thought he was introducing one act.

1573
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,468
One act every three hours.

1574
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,762
- Okay.
- I hate Jeff right now.

1575
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,305
Let's start at the beginning.

1576
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,140
We've got Nas and Goo Goo.

1577
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:05,812
Let's start thinking of funny lines
for Nas and Goo Goo and how to do it,

1578
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,313
and then we'll get through that.

1579
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,941
Then it's on to the 55 other things
I have to introduce

1580
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,403
that someone at WME agreed to
that Jeff checked off on a box.

1581
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,449
Do you like reggae
without all the drug-king violence?

1582
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:21,119
You're in the right place.

1583
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,413
There's been trouble
down in Sri Lanka.

1584
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,917
People told me when a comedian
comes out in front of a festival crowd,

1585
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,420
he should keep it short
and get right to the music.

1586
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:32,130
But I'm gonna go a different way.

1587
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:39,596
I'm about to do two hours
on the life of Bess Truman.

1588
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,307
Everyone have a seat.
This is gonna take a while.

1589
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,308
No, I'm telling you,

1590
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:45,602
all you got to do is say,
"Are you ready to rock?"

1591
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,187
Or hip-hop or whatever the fuck it is.

1592
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,483
Here we go.
It's Nas and the Nozzles.

1593
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,068
No, no, no,
we have some good stuff.

1594
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,695
I do a whole thing
about Bess Truman.

1595
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,615
- I'll find you later.
- Bess Truman?

1596
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,033
Just listen.

1597
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:01,618
All right, this is embarrassing,

1598
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:04,787
but someone's gonna have to help me
write these names on my hand.

1599
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,912
'Cause I'm telling you, I'll get out there,
and my life is so fucking crazy,

1600
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,709
that's all I need
in front of 70,000 people

1601
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,377
is to forget Nas and Jojo.

1602
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,879
Just put N-O-Z-Z.

1603
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,589
Are you guys ready to rock?

1604
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,174
Yeah!

1605
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,217
Okay, that's nice,
but not quite accurate.

1606
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,928
Are we ready to reggae?

1607
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:24,682
Are you ready to...
and hip-hop.

1608
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,933
Yeah, and hip-hop.

1609
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,395
Are you ready to get your freak on
in 95% humidity?

1610
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,441
Yeah! We be jammin'.

1611
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:37,570
Ladies and gentlemen,
Damian Marley.

1612
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,739
And Nas!

1613
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:51,084
How are you?
How do you do?

1614
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,299
I do, too. I do, too.

1615
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,884
Sona?

1616
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,472
- Why?
- Because it's a habit.

1617
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,599
- And sometimes...
- it's all good. It's all good.

1618
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:07,892
I'm cool.

1619
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:11,771
I'm not doing it out of nervousness,
'cause I have complete faith in you.

1620
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,147
Are you ready to rock?

1621
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,360
Are you ready to laugh?

1622
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,114
Well, gentlemen,
good luck to both of you.

1623
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:25,326
Are you ready to rock and laugh
but first urinate?

1624
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,830
Who's urinating now?

1625
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:35,712
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Tenacious D!

1626
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,888
You have 40,000 people
in the palm of your hand.

1627
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:50,393
It was like seeing Hitler up there,
but like a nicer version.

1628
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:57,191
In just a couple of minutes
is the great Stevie Wonder!

1629
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,366
Hi. Damian Marley, please.
Thank you.

1630
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,455
Hey. Yeah.
I was just talking to Nas.

1631
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,207
That's right.
What are you guys doing?

1632
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,835
For take-off and landing,
I need everybody's seat belt on,

1633
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,630
shoulder harness attached,
seats upright position,

1634
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:24,177
tables stowed, items stowed,
electronic devices turned off and stowed.

1635
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:26,179
Cabin's pressurized
for your comfort.

1636
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,389
If there's a change of pressure,
masks will drop.

1637
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,851
If they ever do drop, just pull
so that piece is engaged

1638
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:34,479
and put that mask
over your nose and mouth.

1639
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,648
Two fire extinguishers on board.
They're both up front.

1640
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,650
One's behind the captain
on the bulkhead,

1641
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:41,416
and the other's
by that main cabin door...

1642
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,404
Which part's the bulkhead?

1643
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:46,449
Okay. Thank you very much.
I introduced Nas. What's that?

1644
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:48,493
Damian Marley. Okay.

1645
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:51,704
I introduced them both.
I know Nas.

1646
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,539
All right.
Thank you.

1647
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,249
Nom, nom, nom.

1648
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,753
Okay-

1649
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,588
Oh, my God.

1650
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,508
- Oh, come on.
- I know Nas.

1651
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,635
I introduced Damian Marley and Nas.

1652
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,375
Hey, did you guys see me
introduce Damian Marley and Nas?

1653
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,682
Gus, did you see that?
Hey, Jeff?

1654
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:13,935
Did you know that I introduced
Damian Marley and Nas?

1655
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,269
- I did know.
- Okay.

1656
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,104
- Hey, Andy?
- What?

1657
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,565
Did you know that I introduced
Damian Marley and Nas?

1658
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,943
- Yeah, I did. I heard that.
- Okay, cool.

1659
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:24,403
That's awesome for you.

We got to get out and walk.

1675
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,616
I'm ready.

1676
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,245
It's been a long day.

1677
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:15,872
Oh, hi. Is this Nas?

1678
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,582
Hey, it's Conan.

1679
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:19,417
- I'm cool.
- "I'm cool."

1680
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:20,960
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Dude, what'd he ask?

1681
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,962
Are you cool or are you uncool?

1682
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:26,299
So, Conan,
who's your hip-hop heroes?

1683
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:28,342
- Well, I guess it would be Nas.
- Yeah.

1684
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,011
And if it was reggae,
it would be Damian Marley.

1685
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:30,845
Yeah.

1686
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,138
I should probably go pretty soon.

1687
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:33,472
- But anyway...
- All right.

1688
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,349
Well, keep it hip-hop,
then, Conan.

1689
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,154
Listen, I'll tell you
something, my friend.

1690
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,896
A-rap-rap ribbety-rap,
a-rap-rap rabbity rat.

1691
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:43,149
I said, rap-rap ribbety-rap, rap-rap.
I said, a-rap-rap ribbety-rap.

1692
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:47,403
It's got to stop, you know, 'cause
it's... it's very Peter Pan, you know?

1693
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,740
It's very, "I'll never grow up,"
you know what I mean?

1694
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:53,784
I'll just jump around
in the Eddie Murphy "Raw" suit forever.

1695
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:58,164
This is the most satisfying thing
I've ever done in show business.

1696
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,082
And I've been in show business
since 1985,

1697
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,711
and this is the purest hit
of excitement and adrenaline

1698
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:06,839
and everything that I love
about show business, but...

1699
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,053
One can see the sickness of it, too.

1700
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:16,098
If I was away all the time...
I mean, I haven't seen my kids in...

1701
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,976
It's this weird problem
where I absolutely love this

1702
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,896
and I also understand that
this needs to stop pretty soon.

1716
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,417
There's, like, an elation
to this, you know,

1717
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,203
which is coming out of
the utter despair of what happened.

1718
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,038
Good night, everybody!

1719
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,254
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, you, too.

1720
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,256
- Thanks for doing this with me.
- Just doing what you love.

1721
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,383
- Thank you for asking me.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

1722
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,068
It's been the best... uh, the best
summer camp I've ever been to.

1723
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:35,970
I know. It was crazy.

1724
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,895
I don't know what this was
that just happened.

1725
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:41,100
This is a special thing.
It's chocolate cake.

1726
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,477
You don't want to make it
every meal, you know?

1727
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,646
Hey, you eat chocolate cake every meal.

1728
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:48,190
Yeah.

1729
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,775
You did...
you did a great, great job.

1730
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,901
So did you.

1731
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,362
You did a great job.
You should be very proud.

1732
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,615
You did great.
You really helped me.

1733
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,328
See that? I'm crying.

1734
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:03,873
Does it look like I'm crying?

1735
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:11,589
My whole career has been
trying to get closer and closer and closer

1736
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,508
to the real gritty core of show business.

1737
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:17,353
You know, I used to have these gigs
where I was in a bungalow with...

1738
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,888
thinking of concepts.

1739
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:21,390
I kept thinking, "This isn't it, this
isn't it, this isn't it, this isn't it."

1740
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:22,850
"Saturday Night Live"
felt much closer.

1741
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,477
"The Late Night Show"
felt much closer

1742
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:28,064
'cause there's people
in the hallway in horse costumes.

1743
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:37,531
This thing... anyone who knows me
who watches this says,

1744
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:41,786
"Now that's just raw you."

1745
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,086

to school, do you know what I mean?

1748
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:07,812
