1
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,135
Teddy bears, they're not real.

2
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,076
He is a Polar, look at his claws.

3
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,934
This was no ordinary outing to the zoo.

4
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:22,936
It was a very special occasion.

5
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:25,842
This was part of the 
program filmed in 1964...

6
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:28,462
when we brought together a group
of seven year old children...

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,570
from vastly different backgrounds.

8
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,018
We went to prep schools,

9
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:34,923
primary schools,

10
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:36,940
state schools and private schools...

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,395
and picked out fourteen children.

12
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:41,819
We brought them together because...

13
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:47,200
we wanted a glimpse of the shop stewards
and the executives of the year 2000.

14
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,412
Give me a child until he is seven...

15
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:51,996
and I will give you the man.

16
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,702
These children are now fourteen,

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,426
half way between childhood and manhood.

18
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,904
This is our interim report.

19
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,178
If we did all love Jeffrey

20
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,154
we all want to marry.
-Yeah.

21
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,332
I think I know the one that
he'd like best and that's her.

22
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,017
Jackie, Lindsay, Suzan.

23
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,090
Plenty of boy friends, but not one.
-Several ones.

24
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:19,736
Not one particularly. We're friends
with plenty of boys you know.

25
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:24,565
My heart's desire is to see my daddy
who is six thousand miles away.

26
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:25,492
Bruce.

27
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,230
No, I'm having... 
I'm getting along well.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,280
With my step father.

29
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,919
And I like to see my
 father occasionally.

30
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:34,887
And he does come over from Rhodesia

31
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,681
Do you have any girl friend?

32
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,119
Nicolas from Yorkshire Dale.

33
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,638
I don't want to answer that.

34
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:47,815
I don't want to answer 
those kinds of questions.

35
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,904
No I'm not answering that one

36
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:56,824
Suzie.

37
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,405
I gave that up as a failure.

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,688
I was gonna be a policeman but I
thought how hard it would be to join in.

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,742
Paul.

40
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,857
Baseball appeals to me
 most but in the school...

41
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:12,878
I'm one of the best players in form two

42
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,737
But when I got into the team...

43
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:16,841
they make me look like I can't play.

44
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:22,652
I feel like joining in when
there's already a fight.

45
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,426
I was going to be a film star.

46
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:25,900
Simon.

47
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:29,762
Now I'm going to be
 an electrical engineer.

48
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,932
It's more to reality.

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,004
Singing Waltzing Matilda in Latin in an
exclusive pre-prep school in Kensington,

50
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:44,963
we chose three boys.

51
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:47,205
Charles,

52
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,476
Andrew.

53
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,729
I read the Financial Times.

54
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,415
and John.

55
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,747
I read Observer and The Times.

56
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,860
What do you like about it?

57
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,251
Well, I like...

58
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:03,722
I usually look at the
 headlines then read...

59
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,188
about them...

60
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:07,311
about it.

61
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,940
I like my newspaper because I
got shares in it written and...

62
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,322
I know everyday what shares are
-The stuff misers like you like

63
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,425
No. But...

64
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:21,537
on Mondays they don't move
up so I don't look at it.

65
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:24,418
I made several blunders on Seven Up.

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,152
For instance, I said I was going to
Trinity Hall instead of Trinity College.

67
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:32,292
They didn't like that too
 much, nor did my father.

68
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,857
Also I rather exaggerated when I said
that how much I like stocks and shares

69
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,466
because I don't any more.

70
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,312
How do you think you've changed since you were seven?

71
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:44,965
What I mean...

72
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,092
one grows so slowly
 that one never notices

73
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:52,060
I feel the same the way I felt
at seven I may not be the same.

74
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:58,825
When I leave the school, I'm
going to College Court...

75
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,171
and then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam.

76
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:08,222
John passed the entrance exam and is
a weekly boarder at Westminster School.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,923
When I leave school, I'm going
to the Dragon School, I might.

78
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:19,620
and mummy is... then I go to...after I 
might go to Charterhouse, Marlborough

79
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:22,011
Charles is at Marlborough

80
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:27,341
When I leave the school, I go
to Broadstairs, St. Peter's Court.

81
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,857
And after that I'm 
going to Charterhouse.

82
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,752
Andrews is at Charterhouse.

83
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:40,935
When I leave the school, I'm down
for Heathfield in Southover Manor

84
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:43,486
Suzie is at Southover Manor

85
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,770
Would everybody please sit round now?

86
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:46,805
One third of our children...

87
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,973
their education was 
pre-planned and paid for.

88
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:54,337
The remaining went to State schools
and their future seemed less certain.

89
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,037
I want to be a jockey when I grow up.
Ya, I want to be a jockey when I grow up.

90
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,478
Tony is on the way
 to achieving his ambition.

91
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:12,370
He spends all his free time at Tommy
Gosling Racing Stable at Epsom.

92
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,958
My dad put me onto Mr. Gosling

93
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:18,891
Mr. Gosling tells me that I've to
come here on every school holidays.

94
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:20,640
and learn a bit more.

95
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:30,279
Next year I'll be leaving
school and work here for good.

96
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,226
Did your parents
 encourage you to do this?

97
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,241
Ya they're pleased... knowing what I'm gonna do.

98
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,833
They always have wanted 
me to be a Jockey.

99
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,967
Why?

100
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:53,499
Enjoyment. To say, `my son is
a Jockey', you know what I mean!

101
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:58,974
Tony's change from Elementary school to
Secondary  didn't alter his ambition.

102
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:03,467
But how about the other children?
Has the change of school, changed them?

103
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,438
Bruce was at the pre-preparatory
 boarding school in Surrey.

104
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:14,454
And that's Farmer.
 He gives me nightmares.

105
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:19,400
I was about five when
 I went there and then...

106
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,072
I suppose, I was too young 
really to understand it and...

107
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:26,381
I thought it was a bit severe at
that time then I just got used to it.

108
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:30,269
And didn't have sort of any impulses
to do things wrong or

109
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:34,707
Then I think that I just 
got into the track of...

110
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,911
you know... what they said you 
must do and you mustn't.

111
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:53,232
at St Pauls I like the 
companionship you know...

112
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:54,451
with other boys...

113
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:56,173
really.

114
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,996
and you get that much 
more in a boarding school.

115
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:05,408
Well I think boarding makes
 you feel self-sufficient.

116
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,193
And also teaches you to
 be away from your parents...

117
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,774
and to live with
 people for a long time...

118
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,964
which you've to do
 in later life any way.

119
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,650
I don't agree with that
...a certain amount

120
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:24,514
when you board on the weekly bases,
you've the best of best worlds 

121
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,992
One sees one's parents at the weekend...

122
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:31,624
and one gets all the benefits from a
English Boarding School.

123
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,795
I think prep school boarding
 is a bad idea. -Yes.

124
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,462
Because  I'm...

125
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,992
up till about twelve,

126
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,577
may be its different
 with other people...

127
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,007
I found that...

128
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,008
you are much more 
attached to your parents.

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,405
Once you come to 
about thirteen-fourteen,

130
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,592
you're not quite so attached to them.

131
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:55,119
Two of our boys who didn't have the 
chance to be attached to their parents

132
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:56,779
were those brought up 
in the children's home...

133
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,645
supported by charity.

134
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:00,257
Simon.

135
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:04,233
I had one dream when... 
everything flew up in the air...

136
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:07,664
and that all landed on my head.

137
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,500
Simon stayed there till last Christmas,
when he returned to live with his mother.

138
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:14,837
they say where's 
your father then...

139
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,455
you know... when your
 mom's out at work...

140
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,321
where's your father,

141
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,904
I just tell them I haven't got one

142
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:29,067
What effect does that have on you?

143
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:33,878
Well... I don't think it's had
 any effect on me because...

144
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,367
what you don't have you
don't miss as far as I can see

145
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,127
Also at the children's home
 with Simon was Paul.

146
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,292
He and his family immigrated 
when he was eight.

147
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,404
I don't like big boys hitting us

148
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:55,591
the staff up in the washroom sends
the nurse out, well there's no talking 

149
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,958
I wasn't talking today and...

150
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:00,444
Brown sent me out for nothing.

151
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,292
What do you remember of England?

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,624
It seemed to be raining all the time.
I wouldn't stake my life on it

153
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,338
I can't remember very much!

154
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,969
He went to Australia
 to start a new life.

155
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:21,396
Well, I was going to become a bank
accountant but its more book taking...

156
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,513
than maths and that's the main reason...

157
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,909
I was thinking about
 becoming a panel beater

158
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:28,800
And...

159
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:32,513
I don't know why.. I 
stopped thinking about that.

160
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:37,847
I just hadn't made up my mind yet
I was gonna be a gym teacher but...

161
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,917
one of the teachers told me that...

162
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,999
I had to get up on to the University.

163
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,489
Were you happy at the 
Children's Home in England?

164
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:49,550
I didn't mind that really because
I didn't know what was going on.

165
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,453
I was a bit young

166
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:55,904
You were happier
 than you are now?

167
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,908
In a way... yes, I was.

168
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,555
But then I'm happy for being home.

169
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,791
At the school everything 
you wanted you just had.

170
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,764
You know, everybody was your friend.

171
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,316
And you never knew any enemies, really.

172
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:13,557
But here...

173
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,936
people are undecided about you.

174
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,575
They can be friend one 
day and not the next.

175
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:22,490
Then I moved to Comprehensive School.

176
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,397
I found it much bigger, of course and...

177
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:26,954
I found it hard to
 settle in to it first.

178
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,812
From the Liverpool suburb returning home
from the School, Neil and Peter.

179
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm much more happy
now than when I first came...

180
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,284
we have different types of people.

181
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,448
People have different sorts of brains

182
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:42,238
from ways of very 
clever people, you know...

183
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,482
to people haven't
much sense at all really.

184
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,697
Well... we pretend we've got swords...

185
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:49,868
and then we make the
 noises of the sword-fighting...

186
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,865
and then once we 
get stabbed we'll go...

187
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,313
'aaaaaahh'!

188
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:58,722
I've been playing since I started at the
Comprehensive School in the first year.

189
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:03,600
We play international wrestling.

190
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,949
Ya, that's right. That's
 summer time though.

191
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:07,774
Yes, and we can go on the grass.

192
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,946
there used to be a senior
team...but they lost interest.

193
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:14,837
Watch this.

194
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,595
Check, mate.
- O...k.

195
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,886
Gosh it is, how did
you do that?

196
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,228
This is a very good idea
 to have competition...

197
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:30,300
other wise we start to relax really 
and not so try hard enough.

198
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,331
What do you think?

199
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:35,143
I could say, yes.

200
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,994
It's a good thing.

201
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:40,538
For if no one competes with you,
you won't be trying it this hard.

202
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:42,499
The three little girls from East End...

203
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,737
had a choice of going to a Comprehensive
or a Grammar School.

204
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,649
I am going to work in woolworths

205
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,075
Lindsay chose the Grammar School.

206
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,813
Why am I using a wooden spoon please?
to stir this saucepan?

207
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,441
The noise.

208
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,101
The noise, yes. we got 
16 people. 16 sauce pans.

209
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,594
We don't want noise from 16 people
stirring with metal spoons.

210
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:06,205
This is my first choice
and this is where I turned up...

211
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,669
even though...

212
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,822
my friends were
 going to the other school.

213
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,999
I just didn't feel like going to 
the Grammar School, I just...

214
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:15,360
Comprehensive School,

215
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:18,806
it just seemed more friendly, you know
yes.. and at that time but now...

216
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,724
It's different.
-Grammar School is fantastic.

217
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:26,575
If you say so.
- we've all got our opinions.

218
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,271
What advantages has a 
Comprehensive School got?

219
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:34,550
Especially this school, it’s new they've
got everything you could want

220
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,212
equipment and...

221
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,619
What I enjoy in this school is...

222
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,980
in this school we do metal 
work and wood work

223
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:49,150
The boys do cookery. we get a
share of everything, sort of thing...

224
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,358
It's though, metal
work and that

225
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:56,284
In the Grammar School, I don't think you
find many girls want to do wood work

226
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,818
That's the difference.
-That's a different school.

227
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:04,257
that shows the difference in the people.

228
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:10,872
One of the keys to the character of the 7
year old was how they spent their free time

229
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,479
Bruce had a school band.

230
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:18,217
When I go home, I come...

231
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:21,519
I come in and mummy 
gives me a cup of tea...

232
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,610
and then I go out and play.

233
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,703
And when it starts to get dark...

234
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:28,483
I come in again and put on T.V.

235
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,346
last night i didn't go
to bed until seven.

236
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:44,982
I usually go to bed at ten o'clock
or eleven o'clock.

237
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,735
sometimes i go to the dog racing.

238
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:51,884
i like...

239
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,954
going there for
something to do at night

240
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:55,852
So I don't really do anything at night.

241
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:59,010
Only go to the dogs or other things
other things... watch Telly.

242
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:02,840
I don't watch very much television.

243
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,483
I used to watch a lot but
I'm not watching it so much.

244
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:10,862
And I think its good because lot
of it is corrupting me a bit.

245
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:16,726
I like soap operas, i always
watch them with my parents

246
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,574
For one thing, the 
advertisements you know...

247
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:24,278
I can recite about six
tunes off and it just seems

248
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,895
a worthless
thing to know

249
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,784
There’re too many things
 going on at school...

250
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,894
though we do have a television and...

251
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,093
at the weekend I can be
 more selective and there's

252
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,520
not much that I like

253
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,332
Well, I am quite
 interested in Archeology.

254
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,958
And we are doing a local
dig in Binscombe near our school.

255
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,703
being in set one is very very
hard to keep up with the leaders

256
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,177
And I've no time to relax at all.

257
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,834
What do you do then in the evening?

258
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:53,891
I go out with friends normally.
-Yes.

259
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,267
Or to clubs sometimes.
-Yes.

260
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,454
There aint many clubs 
round here. It's disgusting.

261
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,785
It really is.

262
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:04,007
You hear people're talking
about it on television...

263
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,647
but it's really bad here in the Eastend

264
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,173
There's hardly anything.

265
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,223
There's always something to do here

266
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,546
I'm never ever bored.

267
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:15,112
Suzie now lives in Scotland on
her father's 4000 acres estate.

268
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,742
its very very small really
we've only got one phone

269
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:20,524
There is my zone.

270
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:22,793
it's so small there's a
kitchen and dining room...

271
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:24,450
a drawing room...

272
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,311
and a room we mostly 
sit and let people in.

273
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,829
that's really it!

274
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,204
What sort of things do you do?

275
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,487
Write, swim, play tennis.

276
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,248
ping-pong,

277
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,622
might play croquet,

278
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,589
things like that.

279
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,639
What about social life? What's that?

280
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,002
In Perthshire?
-Yes.

281
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:56,658
It's quite fun

282
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,601
There's lots of
things going on.

283
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,753
Your dog's got a rabbit.

284
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,331
What are you gonna do?

285
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,472
do you want to save it.

286
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,534
Max, bring it here.

287
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,200
It's disgusting dog!

288
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,841
This is a second one you have
given me in a second week.

289
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,353
For God's sake leave it alone.

290
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,129
Does that worry you?

291
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,425
Nope. Not at all.

292
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,126
I see this birds been
wounded. I don't like that.

293
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:32,596
They run off and you
never get a chance to kill them.

294
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:37,323
Why does it worry you if
things should have to be killed?

295
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,004
Because I've been
brought up with it

296
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,707
That mustn't be delayed there.

297
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:49,919
Quiet quietly! Its a very
nonchalant little theme.

298
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,480
butter wouldn't
melt in its mouth

299
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,622
Take it very quietly and
let it just present itself

300
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:04,520
We have...

301
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:10,406
about ten pianos with practise rooms and
Orchestras Choral Societies and 2 choirs

302
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,523
It's a marvelous music system.

303
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,949
there is too much competition now a days

304
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,282
And there are so 
many good pianists...

305
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,814
and only a very few
 make the grade one...

306
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:33,822
and I think its very disparaging
if you can get it only half way.

307
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,672
Are you ambitious?

308
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:36,743
Yes.

309
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:37,998
What for?

310
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,119
Well...

311
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:43,678
for fame...

312
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:47,677
and power.

313
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,761
What sort of power?

314
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,843
Political power.

315
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:55,194
Are you ruthless?

316
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:56,711
Not really.

317
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,922
You think you can have political
power without being ruthless?

318
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:00,585
Yes.

319
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,556
Then what qualities do you need to have
political power if not ruthlessness?

320
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,495
Great strength of mind.

321
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,443
They'd like to come out for a holiday...

322
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,286
in the country when we like...

323
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,440
when I like the holiday in the town.

324
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,160
No, I 've been to Leeds
 a couple of times and...

325
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:25,542
I haven't been to Manchester.

326
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:27,649
And...

327
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:34,270
I went to London with the others when
you did the first program with us.

328
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,338
That's the only time I've been.

329
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:38,759
Nicholas won a scholarship
to Yorkshire Boarding School.

330
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:43,950
In this village there's me and then the
next oldest is Andrew there.

331
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,066
i'm not unhappy...

332
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:52,481
living on the farm and going to the
school and boarding there.

333
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,656
All right, it would be better than
 living on the farm all the time.

334
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,992
I won't like to live in the 
school all the time either.

335
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,420
You want to take up farming?
-No.

336
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,728
I'm not interested in it.

337
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:13,556
I was interested in Physics and
Chemistry but I'm not going to do that here.

338
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:18,946
When I grow up I like to find out
all about the moon and all that.

339
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,126
Did your father want to be a farmer?

340
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,860
I don't think he really wanted to be...

341
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:25,143
but he got stuck with it.

342
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:33,850
 because my grand father, he certainly
probably wanted him to be a farmer.

343
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:37,760
But I don't think my father
wants me to be a farmer.

344
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,261
And...

345
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:48,100
my youngest brother is deaf. if he can't
do anything else he can run a farm

346
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,814
but as a last last resort.

347
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:57,523
Not till these holidays
have I been out of Europe.

348
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:00,672
These holidays I went to America,
stayed with somebody from the school.

349
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,013
Have you been abroad?

350
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,889
Austria.

351
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:05,748
What was it like?

352
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,344
Not bad!

353
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,682
Would you like to travel?

354
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,557
No.

355
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:16,949
Well, I ski in Switzerland and
I enjoy that immensely and then...

356
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,100
we went to France this time and...

357
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,967
I lived in Rhodesia.

358
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,117
I enjoyed Switzerland most I think

359
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,010
I think it's a beautiful country.

360
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,544
I went to very interesting places.

361
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,818
I also enjoyed Austria but not to such a great extent.

362
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,845
Well, I've never been abroad.
-Nah... neither did I.

363
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:40,532
I've, you know.
-Oh yeah, because you went on that cruise.

364
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,198
I've been to Spain and...

365
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,998
Gibralter and... Casablanca. yeah
- Oh you loved it

366
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,990
That was interesting though!

367
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,290
Traveling doesn’t really
 interest me a lot.

368
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Happy where I'm.

369
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,436
I've been to so many places.

370
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,942
Sicily, Italy, France and Spain
and Switzerland... many times.

371
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:04,995
Have you traveled much?

372
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,923
When I was at the School,
we used to go... to...

373
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,286
have outings.

374
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,318
We used to go to Boxhill and places....

375
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:17,899
And we used to go to mystery tours.

376
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:19,695
and...

377
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,357
travel in country.

378
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:28,030
We went to History Museums
 for outings and...

379
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,599
Geographical Museum and...

380
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,356
Science Museum.

381
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:40,247
I've been to Madame 
Tussauds with my mom.

382
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:41,799
And the...

383
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,862
Planetarium Museum.

384
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,765
Do you want to go abroad?

385
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:54,733
Ya...

386
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,131
Ya, I would like to go to Majorca

387
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,002
take a couple of weeks out
there from everything

388
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:04,995
sort of relax myself

389
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,993
No but I said that when
boys go around with girls...

390
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:11,079
they don't pay attention
 to what they're doing.

391
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:16,056
My Grand mother had an accident
because a boy friend was kissing...

392
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,173
his girl friend in the street.

393
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:26,197
The girls never do what the boys want
They always start playing with dolls...

394
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,282
when the boys want to 
play rough and tumble.

395
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,224
It's quite true!

396
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:34,815
Beginning to become more important.
-Ya!

397
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,533
In what way?

398
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:41,231
Well, they're no longer just bores.

399
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:43,811
"We won't play this" or some thing.

400
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,966
well, its half of the 
community and they're there.

401
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:49,488
And you can begin to talk to them.

402
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,879
I think they're still
bores for the most part

403
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,829
When I get married I will 
like to have two children.

404
00:22:56,803 --> 00:23:01,164
You want a Nanny to 
look after them or you ?

405
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,146
No, I want Nanny to look after them.

406
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:08,357
Do you have any boy friend Suzie?

407
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,419
Well, my girl friend...

408
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:22,883
is in Africa and I don't think I have
 another chance of seeing her again

409
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:27,589
And there're two in Switzerland which
I liked too in a hotel.

410
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:28,931
Do you have any girl friend?

411
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,428
No... not yet!

412
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,833
I'm sure it will come but not yet!

413
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:38,320
Say... you had a wife...

414
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,100
Say... say you have to
 eat what they cook you...

415
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,464
and say I don't like
 greens well I don't...

416
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,534
and say... she says you have to eat...

417
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:54,271
what you're given... so...

418
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:59,822
I don't like greens so if she gives
me greens then that's it

419
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,786
I prefer to be alone really

420
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,975
I wouldn't mind living with
my brother you know...

421
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:10,074
but otherwise I prefer to live alone.

422
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:12,438
Sometime on Saturday mornings
I go to the cinema

423
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,217
Sometime with my friends
and sometimes with him.

424
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,904
You don't!
-I do!

425
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,988
She don't. I don't
always see you

426
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,827
you go to different cinema

427
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,341
Have you got a girl friend?
-No.

428
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,221
Would you like to have a girl friend?

429
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:35,031
No.

430
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:40,497
I thought that one would 
come up because when I was...

431
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:44,114
when I was doing the other film
said `what do you think about girls?'

432
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,052
and I had said that I don't answer
questions like that

433
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,331
is that the reason you're
asking it? yeah i thought so

434
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,674
What do you want me to say?

435
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:04,323
I don't know what to say.

436
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,114
Once... Caroline Tetford said
she was good, she loved me.

437
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,272
What happened after that?

438
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,765
And I am going to marry
 her when I grow up.

439
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:18,443
I hate her. She's always cursing
bad temper and cross with me.

440
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:19,567
Is she?

441
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,443
Yes! Neil Hughes! Move
your desk forward.

442
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,348
perhaps I'm not mature enough
yet to be interested.

443
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:30,335
See, he loves Suzan
 because Suzan loves him.

444
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,117
He loves Lindsay and Lindsay loves him.
-I doubt it!

445
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:34,760
Have you got any boy friends?

446
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:35,877
oh...

447
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,273
that's personal isn't it!

448
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,943
i don't like the way you
came out with that

449
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,804
We shouldn't 
tell him... shall we?

450
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:54,635
What do you think 
about making this program?

451
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:01,167
I think this is ridiculous. 
There's no point in doing it.

452
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,706
Why not?

453
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:07,347
What's the point people going
into peoples lives and saying.

454
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:11,124
why do you like this, why don't
you like this. i see no point in it.

455
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,024
What's the point of the program?

456
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:17,381
if the point is to reach a comparison.

457
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:18,714
I don't think it is!

458
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,101
Because we're not necessarily
typical examples.

459
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:24,546
And I think that's what people seeing
the program might think.

460
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,244
Yes
-Falsely.

461
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,498
And they would intend to type-cast us.

462
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,273
So everything we say,

463
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,806
they will think, Oh!
 that's a typical result...

464
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:36,848
of the public school system.
-Ya!

465
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:39,281
Well, in what way aren't you typical?

466
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:43,089
Well, I'm bit more 
reactionary than most.

467
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:50,919
I don't know. None of the parties
really seems to agree with me.

468
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:53,636
I think if I had voted, I had voted Labour.

469
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,043
I would've voted Conservatives.

470
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:58,826
I don't think I would vote for any of them.

471
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,701
Conservatives.

472
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,735
The Conservatives would do the
best for the country.

473
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:05,169
I think they're all as
bad as each other really

474
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:06,957
Labour.

475
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,660
I don't really know.

476
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,309
I know what i wouldn't vote though

477
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,091
what way?

478
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,158
Labour.

479
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,490
Conservatives.

480
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,508
Why?
-Why?

481
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,099
I don't know i don't know

482
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:28,894
I really don't know much about
politics and it doesn't interest me, so

483
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,223
I don't really bother.

484
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:35,596
I didn't agree with the conservatives,
what they're doing with the Black people

485
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,144
You know...the racial policy

486
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:41,811
Jacqueline, what do you
think about colour people?

487
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:47,016
You said to me once you like them
but what do you really think about them?

488
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,314
Well, they're nice and its
as same as us really.

489
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:53,859
But one thing...

490
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,866
it's only because their skin is brown
and we're white, sort of pinkish we're...

491
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:03,052
Do you think of a purple person...

492
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,594
with red eyes,

493
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:05,828
yellow feet and...

494
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,018
I can't really think of
what they really look like.

495
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:12,375
They are just the same
as me, isn't it?

496
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,122
I don't... anybody who is coloured.

497
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:21,001
I don't want to know anybody who
is coloured. Thank you very much!

498
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,759
I'm not against coloured people...

499
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:27,510
but I wouldn't worry if I didn't know
one until the day I died.

500
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,447
People have got to get used to

501
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,578
knowing coloured people.

502
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:35,632
And coloured people in turn
have got to get used to

503
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,072
being with white people...

504
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,226
because... if either side
doesn't work proparly,

505
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,415
then no side work properly.

506
00:28:48,015 --> 00:28:49,442
People just got to mix in with

507
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,517
every body else.

508
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:55,295
I do think it's wrong but
in a country...

509
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:57,452
like England...

510
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:01,424
there should be places where the...

511
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:07,146
there are more coloured people
than the white people.

512
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:08,771
Good old Enoch Powell

513
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:11,160
personally I've nothing
against coloured people.

514
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,513
I think they're same as every body else.

515
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:17,839
But it seems that they...there's lot
of argument about them because...

516
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,765
as any foreigner really...

517
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:22,170
they're taking up
 people's jobs in England.

518
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,372
I don't care what colour sombody is.

519
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:28,380
unless they're blue
that would be pretty peculiar.

520
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,748
But...

521
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:31,683
might find somebody yet

522
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,272
You know, I don't care about colour.

523
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:37,271
Well, I think both Black 
and Whites are equal.

524
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,033
As long as they are there,
they as well educated each other

525
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,013
What do you feel about
 racial discrimination?

526
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,596
strong avow

527
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:48,724
Why?

528
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,879
Because so is any kind of discrimination

529
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:57,902
Of a basic nature that you can't change,

530
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:01,089
I mean I couldn't care less
if people discriminated

531
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,259
against because they are...

532
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,764
nasty or selfish or any thing but...

533
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:09,920
I mean one can't help one's colour.

534
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,634
So

535
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,760
Now that you are interested in politics
would like to be a politician

536
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:18,716
what kind of things would you change?

537
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:21,095
I won't allow any strikes!

538
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,063
How would you do that?

539
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,937
I would set about a Tribunal...

540
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:28,533
where people...

541
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,217
workers could apply for...

542
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,877
better wages and...

543
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:36,093
this Tribunal would
 have the final word and...

544
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:39,253
if it says `no wage rise', no wage rise.

545
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:42,905
It’s a big problem because
 of the discussion i think

546
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,905
The workers do tend to take
fewer liberties as regards strikes.

547
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,932
Who do you think to blame for strikes?
The workers or the management?

548
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:52,772
The manager probably…

549
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:57,641
say the workers and we will probably get
a load of letters or something like that

550
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:01,008
It seems to me iniquitous
that people should be paid...

551
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:03,383
when they don't do any work.

552
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,068
Which is what unions do do

553
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,693
I'm not commenting because mom
has been out on strike.

554
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:09,075
Ya… so is mine!

555
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:13,367
Very irresponsible because we all want
more money as much money as we can get.

556
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:17,841
And what will happen if we all stopped
working just because we want more money?

557
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:20,585
I want money. Why shouldn’t
 I strike for it? I am sure anyone.

558
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,831
If you want more money, you will strike for it.

559
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:24,056
That’s right! Ya! That’s right!

560
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,502
They're going to strike for it,
they're going to get more money.

561
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,303
the school meals are going up so they're
going to strike, they want more money

562
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,730
It's going to keep on going
going going you know...

563
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:34,177
Truly by crushing...

564
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,137
strikes.

565
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:37,979
Then in a way that’s defeating…

566
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,902
a small part democracy.

567
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,925
It's not because they'd still have their...

568
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,206
They'll still be able to
 ask for more money.

569
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,637
But they wouldn't be able to
strike for it which I mean...

570
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,487
it's so damaging

571
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,843
It's still depriving them
their freedom to strike.

572
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,187
so is putting people in prison

573
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:59,558
depriving them their freedom to go on
 killing people and stealing from people

574
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:04,184
Who is going to do this, they're not
 going to be voted in the parliament.

575
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,301
So its not worth it.

576
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,581
You can always decide a new
policy once you are in.

577
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:21,788
What do they think about each other?

578
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,196
And how'll they act together?

579
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:27,127
To find out, we invited 
them all to one big party...

580
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:28,621
and joined in.

581
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:55,807
Yes, they were bit too
tough for my liking.

582
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,824
Somebody hit me right in the back
and I 've still got some pain there.

583
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,140
The posh ones O! Yes. O! yes. O! Yes.

584
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:06,213
They're nuts!

585
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,798
you just have
to touch them

586
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:13,073
And some of them were rather dirty.

587
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:18,713
what did you think about them?
-I played with them quiet naturally.

588
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:20,796
I think they were rather nice, really.

589
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:22,655
What do you think about rich people?

590
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:28,844
Well... not much.
-Tell me about it.

591
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,867
They think they can do everything
without you doing it as well...

592
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:34,932
they think just because they're rich...

593
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:37,501
they have to have people

594
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:41,161
that have to do all
their work and stuff.

595
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:45,721
What would you do if you have lots
of money, about say... two pounds?

596
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:48,316
I would help the poor.

597
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:53,659
Ya because the poor if you
don't, they all would die.

598
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,383
Wouldn't they?

599
00:33:55,985 --> 00:34:00,139
And everytime we've a harvest
festival, we send them food.

600
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:07,463
Once these two went round 
giving food out with Mr. Floyd.

601
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,118
I don't think much of the accents.

602
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:11,767
Neither do I.
-Neither do I.

603
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,219
That doesn't prevent me liking them.

604
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,889
Rich children always 
make fun of poor children.

605
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:24,619
Yes. -Yes they say, O! look at that
lovely little sissy over there

606
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:26,203
Yes, and they throw things at them.

607
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:27,123
Yes.

608
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:29,171
And poor child gets scared to death.

609
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:38,827
Do you meet here many boys from
very different social backgrounds?

610
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,158
Not really.

611
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,419
Do you find that a lack in your life?

612
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:45,951
No.

613
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:48,295
Why?

614
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,560
I don't feel any lack any where.

615
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:57,155
Do you feel you should be meeting broader
 persons from the different back grounds?

616
00:34:58,847 --> 00:34:59,893
Not really.

617
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,706
You don’t think you are missing?

618
00:35:03,456 --> 00:35:04,259
No.

619
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:09,208
I don't see what 
background's got to do with it

620
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:10,455
They are people
 from so many...

621
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:13,302
I think it's the interest
 that makes it worth

622
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:16,647
there's people with so many...
varied interests in the school,

623
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:20,080
I can't imagine of any more.

624
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,667
I don't really see why
background enters it

625
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,862
If everybody is the 
same as every body else...

626
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,146
no body would be missing any thing.

627
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:32,634
And people...

628
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:35,405
rich people... they've
 all different things.

629
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:37,356
Have everything they want.

630
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:38,584
Where as poor people...

631
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,645
they don't have nothing
 and they know that.

632
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:42,417
And they know that
 they have got nothing.

633
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:45,051
So they know they are missing something.

634
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,022
What are you missing?

635
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:50,772
Well... possibly

636
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:55,147
a bike and a fishing rod and...

637
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,742
Ya, they like...they can get
what they want, can't they?

638
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,959
We've got to work for it.

639
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,458
they just ask for money.

640
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:05,555
and get it.

641
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:06,920
and buy what they want.

642
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,413
What effect does
that have on them?

643
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:10,899
Spoilt

644
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,333
it spoils them doesn't it

645
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:15,087
if you want to accuse us

646
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,625
The public schools 
are producing snobs...

647
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,046
by mixing only a

648
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,760
couple of classes, the upper and middle

649
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:27,607
And Comprehensive Schools can be
accused of producing proles

650
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:30,640
because they only mix with lower and the middle.

651
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:35,261
So its like saying that public schools
like Tom Brown school days...

652
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,109
We do mix with people from the town.

653
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,427
They can be all right.

654
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:42,744
Yeah, but I don't like 
people who are too posh

655
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:45,060
they look down on every body else.

656
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,402
They think they are better.
-Yeah.

657
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:51,484
I think the people are much more
conscious of wanting to become snobs...

658
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:52,964
because the difference that...

659
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:54,873
the differences that use to
separate the classes...

660
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:56,860
have diminished greatly.

661
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:02,026
I mean everyone was a Duke when
he used to be set above...

662
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:04,213
everybody else...

663
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:05,466
but now...

664
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:08,427
look at the Duke of....!

665
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:13,642
I think people climb
less class cultures...

666
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:14,732
beacuse I mean...

667
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,032
with hippies you don't 
get the impression...

668
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,782
that one hippie says...

669
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,986
I'm so big guy because I'm
upper class and you're...

670
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:27,597
some petty person because
you're lower class.

671
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:28,722
Yes.

672
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:30,304
And any body can become a hippie.

673
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:33,331
I think this is happening through
out the country.

674
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:36,259
........they don't enforce...

675
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:39,273
being upper class and...

676
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:40,965
things like that...

677
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,533
as st pauls..they suggest that you don’t
have long hair and do get it cut.

678
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:54,363
they teach you to be well mannered 
but not to sniff on the poor people.

679
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:56,521
some are good with their
money and money and give it...

680
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:58,291
for charitable purpose.

681
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:00,972
Some of them just do not know
what to do with their money.

682
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,925
They just spend it...waste it.

683
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:05,871
People need it.

684
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,104
I don’t like poverty for any body.

685
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,718
It kinda depresses me.

686
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,411
When I went to Glasgow...

687
00:38:21,945 --> 00:38:23,350
and I saw the Gorbals

688
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,242
That rather upset me.

689
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:28,715
Why?

690
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:32,021
Well, to think that people
are living in that state.

691
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:34,554
When we waste things... every day.

692
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:38,776
Some people are just born into
rich families and they're lucky.

693
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:42,060
I don’t see why they should have the luck
when people worked all their lives

694
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,031
and they've got half 
of as much as they have

695
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:46,056
doesn't seem fair.

696
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:51,019
I usually get about a
five or six pounds a week

697
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:53,509
What do you do with it?

698
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:55,718
I save some, spend some.

699
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,920
Well, I get a pound a week.

700
00:38:59,291 --> 00:38:59,978
And...

701
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,728
what I usually do

702
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:02,872
in the middle of the week...

703
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:03,982
my mom takes half back

704
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,603
and I save the other half

705
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:08,374
as much as possible.

706
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,138
Well, out of my permanent job
I get four dollars fifty.

707
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:14,138
40 pence a week

708
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:16,437
What do you spend it on?

709
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:20,785
Well, I need to spend 
very little on schools.

710
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:22,937
I collect stamps so...

711
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:25,875
I spend quite a lot on them.

712
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,550
My dad gives me about
 three pounds a week...

713
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:32,253
And mum gives me one pound fifty pence

714
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:34,748
And my brother give me some.

715
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:40,284
Mr.Gosling gives me four pounds,
pocket money every week.

716
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:49,103
I don't want to be rich but I
like to have enough money.

717
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:52,810
What do you mean by enough?

718
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,833
Enough to have a nice house and...

719
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:01,290
be able to send the children to
a private school if I want to.

720
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,389
I mean almost everybody likes money.
Not for the fact that it....

721
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:10,982
I don't like looking at money
It doesn't give me any pleasure like that.

722
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:15,952
But I certainly don't want to be
poor or live in a slum but...

723
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:20,532
I had...I don't...

724
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:24,312
I mean a person with one million pounds
is not going to be much...

725
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,141
is not going to be more or less happy
 than a person with two million pounds.

726
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:30,563
Money is not every thing.

727
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:32,365
It means a lot
to us now

728
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:37,988
the clothes and new fashions
and skirts and that

729
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:41,264
You need money because...
-Yeah what's skirts

730
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:44,229
they're clothes... yeah,
you need clothes

731
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:48,757
money can’t buy happiness. -Oh no! you
got to work for that yourself havent you

732
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,435
Do you want to be rich?

733
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:54,285
I don't mind i like
staying where i am

734
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:59,777
I don't want to be very rich but
I don’t want to be poor either.

735
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,146
What about you Jackie?

736
00:41:03,486 --> 00:41:07,238
Just live comfortable. -Ya just have
 what you want, nothing stressfull

737
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,049
as long as you've got all you need.

738
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,598
Do you want to be rich?

739
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:14,596
I won't mind.

740
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,474
Do you want to be rich?

741
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:22,698
Yes, because I don't want
to be tied down to the...

742
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,412
the dullness of an every day job.

743
00:41:25,678 --> 00:41:28,069
I want to be able to have enough
money so I can indulge in...

744
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:31,599
things that interests me...

745
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:33,599
like collecting paintings.

746
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:39,170
No! No because if you're rich
you get bored of being rich.

747
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,718
Same... if you're poor, you
get bored of being poor.

748
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,334
You can't have too much of a good thing.

749
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,990
And if you're healthy and have good
friends, you can get on perfectly well.

750
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,117
but everybody
would like to be rich.

751
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:54,923
Mainly to be self-sufficient.

752
00:41:55,456 --> 00:41:59,324
To feel that you don't have to
owe anything to any body.

753
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,343
I would help people...

754
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:02,815
if I had a chance.

755
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,356
By say, giving...

756
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:11,701
little bit of money to charity or
sponsoring things or things like that.

757
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:13,718
I mean it is wrong,

758
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,301
one should drive oneself...

759
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,577
to make a lot of money 
because in the end...

760
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:22,596
you might have caused
so many people....

761
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,824
ruined so many people

762
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:29,978
that you will be unhappy

763
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,738
and what's the use of lot
of money if you're unhappy?

764
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:33,990
You've to have it to live and...

765
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:39,965
though, sort of problems you have to
face and every thing is concrete and

766
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:44,281
doesn’t seem to be possible for
anything to be invisible or...

767
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:50,596
you can’t see it.

768
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,179
I mean people...

769
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,016
all the sciences said

770
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:58,404
we've looked up into the space and we
 haven't seen God so there isn’t a God.

771
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,665
And it just seems fatuous

772
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,637
Do you believe in God?

773
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:07,700
I'm not sure whether I believe in God
I think to myself I don't know.

774
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,335
So...I don't know.

775
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:14,308
Yes, I'd say I believed in God.

776
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:15,926
Are you religious?

777
00:43:17,572 --> 00:43:19,552
Well I go to Church with
 my parents on Sundays.

778
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,397
You got to believe in something.

779
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:25,119
So God seems to be
the most logically really.

780
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:28,894
I am not deeply religious. No,
I don't believe in God.

781
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,331
Why?

782
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:36,096
That's a difficult question
 to answer `why?'

783
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:37,691
I just do

784
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,471
It's either a `Yes' or `No' question.

785
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:41,582
You're brought up to
believe in Him and i do.

786
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:44,923
You must've your own
opinion on that as well.

787
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:47,488
Ya...
-I don't really know

788
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:50,876
I mean if I do or not.

789
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:53,868
Don't really think about it very much.

790
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,612
No, you don't have much time to
think about it

791
00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:02,302
No when there's so much activity in
in school and after school.

792
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:07,877
I would like to certainly think
about or talk to some one about.

793
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:12,356
When I sit down and think...

794
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:14,444
I think I believe in God.

795
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,431
But if somebody just
 asks me I will say `no'!

796
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:20,393
Supposed just to be big

797
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:24,625
Why do you believe in God?

798
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,812
I believe in God because...

799
00:44:30,308 --> 00:44:31,948
somebody had to
make the world

800
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:33,444
this world

801
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:40,196
they call Him what everybody
else calls Him Which is God.

802
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,722
You can't really say if there
is God or not. Can you?

803
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:46,090
You haven't seen him.

804
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,642
You can't say!

805
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:52,133
When you were seven, you wanted to
be a Missionary. any thoughts on that?

806
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:55,834
No I don't want to be a Missionary 
because I can't talk about it to people.

807
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,524
You know...

808
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:59,336
I'm interested in it myself but..

809
00:45:00,137 --> 00:45:01,866
I wouldn't be very good at it at all...

810
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:04,137
and I wouldn't enjoy it.

811
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:06,792
Why won't you be good at it?

812
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,619
Well...

813
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:11,525
I'm just not very good at...

814
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:16,681
at standing up in front of people and
making a speech or any thing like that

815
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,137
I like to keep it private, you know

816
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,417
Well, going to Africa...

817
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:26,169
and try and teach people
who are not civilized...

818
00:45:27,264 --> 00:45:29,835
to be more or less good.

819
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:35,780
And after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

820
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:37,743
I am going to work in woolworths

821
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,368
I might go to Oxford.

822
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:42,743
I'll just walk around...

823
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:45,384
and see what I can find.

824
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,227
Then we think, I am going...

825
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:50,742
to Cambridge and Trinity Hall.

826
00:45:51,656 --> 00:45:55,212
I don't think I need to go to university
 because I'm not gonna be a teacher.

827
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:58,682
I don't think you want to go to university
 if you want to be an astronaut

828
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,107
What does university mean?

829
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:03,969
Well...

830
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,015
When I grow up I like to find out
all about the moon and all that.

831
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:13,823
If I can't be an astonaut I think
I'll be a coach driver.

832
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,900
It is probably linked up with the
fact that now I like traveling.

833
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:20,696
My thought hasn't really changed 
I would like to be a Coach driver now.

834
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,053
You wanted to be an astronaut
when you were seven.

835
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:24,138
Ya!

836
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:26,000
What feelings have
 you got on that subject?

837
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:29,577
Well, changed now completely of course.

838
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:34,542
I mean it was just the imagination
of a seven year old.

839
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:38,604
I'll buy myself a nice
new made house

840
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,653
that's all nice and comfy.

841
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,076
I would like to be a...

842
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,468
have a happy family.

843
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:49,605
I mean I know it's not possible
to be happy all the time...

844
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,316
but as much as the time it was possible.

845
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:56,309
Just... be content with what
I'm doing and be happy with it.

846
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:59,237
And to know where I'm going...

847
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:02,393
and to remember fondly what I've done.

848
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:05,770
I think I'm following a legal career...

849
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:09,440
with a view to ending in parliament.

850
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:15,307
I would like to do may be shorthand
typing or some thing like that.

851
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:17,655
Nothing too much, just wonder.

852
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:22,734
Be like every body else.

853
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:26,744
Nothing too... marvelous!

854
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,323
What would you do if you don't
make it as a Jockey?

855
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:33,790
I don't know. If I knew
 I couldn't be one...

856
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:35,230
I would get
out of it

857
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,969
wouldn't bother.

858
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:39,989
What do you think you would do then?

859
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,547
i'll learn taxi's

860
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:44,529
A Taxi driver.

861
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:46,829
There is a danger that 
you would get married...

862
00:47:47,304 --> 00:47:49,521
at the early twenties and have
children quickly and then be...

863
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:51,255
stuck at home.

864
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,440
Have you any thoughts on that?

865
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:01,398
I don't really think very much.
-I know.

866
00:48:02,137 --> 00:48:03,196
I don't think...

867
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:08,594
I'll get married too early. I like to
have a full life first and...

868
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:11,511
Get some job before.
-Ya.

869
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:13,383
before you commit
yourself to a family

870
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:18,375
How do you think England would
change over the next few years?

871
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,815
England?
-Yes.

872
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:23,188
Not very much!

873
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,446
England is too English, 
you know what I mean.

874
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,314
Are you a traditionalist?

875
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:30,492
Yes!

876
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:31,911
In what way?

877
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:34,476
I like tradition.

878
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,151
Do you expect to live 
your life in England?

879
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,386
I think it's just about the best place
you can live your life in England 

880
00:48:44,386 --> 00:48:45,386
Why?

881
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:48,244
I think the

882
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,449
Parliamentary System is agreeable.

883
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:52,328
I mean...

884
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:54,560
to me at least and...

885
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:00,870
and that's about it.
 One's free in England.

886
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,841
one has good opportunities
 for everything.

887
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,794
Well, we've got much
 more equal opportunities.

888
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,286
In those days the people at the
bottom really had to work.

889
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,760
Like Blacks...so that they
could achieve something.

890
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:17,511
Now a days...

891
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:19,718
to get kicks out of life...

892
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,713
you've to use synthetic
 means where originally...

893
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:24,330
earlier on...

894
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:25,747
forty years ago...

895
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,527
these things came in life.

896
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,005
With the coming...

897
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:33,115
with all the modern world...
we are in the modern world today.

898
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:36,446
All... lots of these things've been stopped.

899
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:39,868
Lot of enjoyment of life
has been taken out of it.

900
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,362
Yes! The natural enjoyment.

901
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:43,958
Nothing is being taken out.
It’s just people.

902
00:49:44,424 --> 00:49:45,770
It’s still there if you look for it.

903
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,753
How many people can look for it?

904
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:51,770
- how many people can look for it.
- Every body can pursue happiness.

905
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:04,074
At the end of their very special day in London...

906
00:50:04,913 --> 00:50:07,023
after their trip to the zoo and the party...

907
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:10,416
we took our children to an adventure play ground...

908
00:50:11,148 --> 00:50:12,616
where they could do just what they like.

909
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:18,471
There's from a children's 
home set about building a house.

910
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:31,675
That's Nicholas.

911
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:37,787
And Tony.

912
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,195
Andrew.

913
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:49,929
And Bruce.

914
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:58,572
John.

915
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:03,769
Suzie.

916
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:09,031
Jackie and her friends.

917
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:18,443
Give me a child until he is seven
and I will give you the man.

918
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:31,399
This has been a glimpse
 of Britain's future.
