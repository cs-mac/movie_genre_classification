434
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,337
媽媽最想要的是什麼
What mom really wants.

435
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,339
你難道還不知道嗎 當然是讓你結婚啊
You still don't know? Of course, 
is to let you get married.

436
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,942
我打算滿足你的願望
I intend to fulfill your wish

437
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,178
真的嗎
Really?

438
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,698
你是哪個高中的
You are that high school student?

439
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,537
啊是同光高中嗎
Tong Guang High School?

440
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:58,705
是
Yes

441
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:00,740
是修行評價練習嗎
Are you practice for evaluation exercises

442
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,910
你們班是愛你羅 還是稻田
You class is Ai niLo or Ricefield

443
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,778
什麼
What?

444
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:07,647
啊 是在花園裡
Ah is at the Garden

445
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,416
什麼
What?

446
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,787
換音樂老師了嗎
Changed music teacher?

447
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,824
反正今天不能教你唱歌哦
Anyway I can't teach you singing today.

448
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:21,061
暫時練習呼吸法和發聲
Temporary just exercises on breathing and vocal

449
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,195
什麼
What?

450
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,932
不過我真的很急 那種東西能不能pass掉啊
Is quite urgent, can I skip that?

451
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,969
我們身體裡發出的聲音可以分為鼻音和頭音
Sound can be divided into nasal sound and head sound.

452
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,938
鼻音是從鼻子裡發出的聲音
Nasal sound is the sound from the nose

453
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,274
那麼頭音是從哪裡發出的聲音呢
Then where is the head sound from?

454
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,311
很聰明 是從腦袋裡發出的聲音
Clever, is the sound from the head.

455
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,779
那麼先練習腹呼吸
Then will starts from abdominal breathing

456
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,781
腹呼吸是拉屎時候用力一樣的呼吸
Abdominal breathing is the same force when shiting

457
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,084
我們拉尿的時候瞬間發力的那個重點
The moment when we force to shit, that's the focal point 

458
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:49,923
要記住那個重點才可以
Remember that focal point

459
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:50,790
發聲的時候也一樣
Is the same when vocalize.

460
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,360
像拉屎時候一樣用力 像是要把便排到體外一樣
using the same force when shiting,
is like forcing shit out.

461
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,128
方向雖然是相反
Although it's at the opposite direction

462
00:29:55,128 --> 00:30:00,100
但是想要排出去的東西會一樣的順暢
But whatever you have force out, 
you'll feel clear and coherent

463
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,267
好累啊
Really tired

464
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:04,971
來 那麼起來練習一下吧
Come on, let's practice.

465
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,607
起來吧
Get up

466
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,512
來 在肚子裡吸滿呼吸 慢慢吹
Inhale into your belly slowly blow out

467
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,987
來 這種方式 跟我做
This way, follow me.

468
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:22,422
快來
Come on

469
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:27,293
不對不對
Wrong, wrong

470
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,728
你的肚子沒有凸出來啊
Your stomach need to protrude out.

471
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,196
要讓肚子凸出來 像是青蛙一樣
stomach protrude out like a frog

472
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,232
青蛙肚子 好好看我
Frog stomach. Ok, look at me.

473
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:37,370
哎喲 真是的
Oh Damn

474
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:38,538
對不起了
Sorry

475
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,042
那個 稍微休息一下吧
Then, rest for a while

476
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,743
去幫我倒杯水吧
Get me a glass of water

477
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,381
喂喂 喂
Hey,hey,hey

478
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,920
真是髒死了
So disgusting.

479
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,297
脖子太疼了我今天就先走了
My neck is too pain so I'll call it a day.

480
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,866
剩下的課讓院長幫你上吧
The rest of the lesson, Professor will take over.

481
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,335
老師 你怎麼了
How are you teacher.

482
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:11,204
沒關係 沒關係 別碰我脖子 別碰
No problem, I'm ok, Don't touch 
my neck, Don't touch

483
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,939
脖子怎麼回事啊
What happen to your neck?

484
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,875
關你們什麼事
Hey mind your own business

485
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,346
該死
Damn

486
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,381
今天的課就到此結束了
Is end of today's class

487
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,717
啊 課結束之後又畢業生歡送會

488
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,185
請大家留下來吃肉吧
Hope everyone could stay for BBQ

489
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,220
東珠學生也是

490
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,221

493
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,430
完美的脫離音癡境界
And break away from tone deaf 

494
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,066
啊 今天的乾杯主題是像家族一樣
Ah today's cheers topic is "Like a family"

495
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,570
是要院生們象家人一樣相處的意思
It means all students will get along like family

496
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,437
我說家
I'll say "We are"

497
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,374
你們就說人一樣 就可以了

498
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,409
來 舉杯

499
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,312
祝賀各位 家
Congratulations to all " We Are"

500
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,280
族一樣
Family

501
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,623
從江原道來回跑參加補習班 確實有效果
From Gangwon Road run here and back 
to attend tution class really got effect

502
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:06,259
但是每個章節都需要準備兩首歌呢
But required to prepare two song for every chapter

503
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,595
因為別人總是會搶走我的歌
Because others will always steal my song

504
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,798
弄的我心臟撲通撲通 緊張個不停的感覺
Making my heart beats fast and feeling nervous.

505
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:12,665
我也是
Me too.

506
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:14,434
我們要不重新開始學習吧
Why don't we start learning again. 

507
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,404
所以我有屬於我自己的Rap啊
That's why I have my own rap.

508
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,006
--靠近 盡情的大聲尖叫!--
--Get near, Enjoy and scream--

509
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,008
怎麼樣

院長 我先走了

520
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,535
我媽媽會在家等我的
My mom will wait for me to go home.

521
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:25,171
東珠學生 你不是說你媽媽去世了嗎
Dong Joo, I thought you said 
your mother has passed away.

522
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:29,809
喂 學生怎麼能這樣
Hey, how can a student be like that.

523
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,211
什麼

524
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,315
要理直氣壯地喝 理直氣壯
Wanna drink, be bold and straight.

525
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:37,050
這算什麼啊 偷偷喝
Why have to hide?

526
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,253
喝酒要從一開始學好了才行 喝吧
To drink have to learn from the beginning. Let's drink.

527
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:42,555
老師
Teacher

528
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:43,423
怎麼了

529
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,026
我們呢
How about us?

530
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,494
你們是中學生啊
You guys are high school student.

531
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:50,997
老師 我和她是留級了一年的
Teacher, I and her retained one year

532
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:53,600
切 這個姐姐是高3
This sister is in year 3

533
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,902
但是看看 好好看 仔細看
But take a look, see carefully,a closer look 

534
00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:59,706
像不像留級2年了似的 或者是3年
Does she look like retain for 2 years or 3 years?

535
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,609

我去趟洗手間

537
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,918

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,105
是靠實力去的

546
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:44,784
他是在這裡學習才成這個水平的嗎
Is he learn from here to reach this level?

547
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:47,721
是哥哥好不好
Could you address him as senior?

548
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,456
那麼小怎麼這麼沒禮貌啊
So young and no manners.

549
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,092
他聽了該多不高興啊
He will be upset if he heard you.

550
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,463
我看起來真的像是高中生嗎
Do I really look like a high school student?

551
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,798
身為學生怎麼能這麼說啊
How could you says such thing?

552
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:02,302
你媽媽該為你操心啊 不是高三嗎
Your mom should be worry about you. 
Aren't you high school 3rd year?

553
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:03,770
是高一嗎
Or first year?

554
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,273
不是不是 是高三 在校生
No, no. Is 3rd year.

555
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,930
這是宮社長
This is Deputy Chief.

556
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,833
有很多錢
Very rich

557
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,469
像他這樣的人是與生俱來迷人的重低音
People like him are born with a charming bass vioce

558
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,772
可以看做是特有的體聲
Can be treated as special voice

559
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,975
但是唱歌的時候總是會结巴
But always stammered when singing

560
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:47,213
结 结巴的毛病需要改一改
This st- st-stammer problem needs to be alter.

561
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,282
太结巴了
Too stammer.

562
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,887
出聲啊 出聲
Sing out, Sing out.

563
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,229
挺直腰板
Straighten your back

564
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:14,341
那大嬸性格很好 很外向
That aunt has a good personality, very outgoing.

565
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:18,144
但是一拿麥克風就會抖的要命
But once touches the mic she will start trembling.

566
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:21,348
根本出不了聲
Can't sing out at all.

571
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:05,392
停 停
Stop! Stop!

572
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,930
Bravo Bravo太棒了 太棒
Bravo, Bravo, Fantastic, Wonderful!

573
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,098
我教了十年
I've taught for 10 years

574
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:15,568
你是我見過的最棒的音癡 節奏癡
You are the most tone deaf and rhythm retard.

575
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,604
你得花不少時間啊
You have to take quite some time.

576
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,240

00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,917
就當你運氣好30歲左右能結婚吧
Consider you lucky enough by 30 year old got married

581
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,486
還運氣好的生下了女兒
and very lucky give birth to a daughter.

582
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:37,290
等到那個女兒好好長大成為高三為止
Wait until your daughter grow up and in high school 3

583
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,158
什麼

584
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,796
那之前 都不知道你能不能好好唱首歌啊

585
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:44,831
什麼
What?

586
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:51,237
把飛機降落的聲音改成歌曲 反而會更簡單啊
By changing a plane crash sound 
into song will be better for you

587
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,573
怎麼有這種人渣啊

31歲

590
00:37:58,244 --> 00:37:59,679
你剛剛對我平輩相稱了嗎
You've just address me as same generation?

591
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,981
是啊 平輩想成了
Yeah, so what.

592
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:03,750
你这個乞丐德行
Act like a beggar.

593
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,086
你 乞丐喂
You! Beggar hey!

594
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,121
怎麼能這麼沒禮貌
How dare you be so rude.

595
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:11,324
怎麼能這麼隨便對學生說話啊
How can he talk to a student in such manner.

596
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:14,527
口臭加狐臭 我再也忍不住了
Bad breath, body odor, I can't endure anymore.

597
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:18,298
最起碼沈老師有穿鞋啊 這已經很不錯了
Consider not bad, at least 
your teacher still wear a shoe.

598
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,501
脫鞋的話 所有的學生估計都會逃走的
If is slippers, all students would have gone 

599
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:25,572
但是他實力確實不錯 稍微忍一忍 加油
But he's quite competent. 
Just endure and keep it up.

600
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:27,307
大哥 不行啊
Bro, no way!

601
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:29,876
用教學的方式改變歌聲也是有限度的
There's a limit on using teaching 
method to change the way she sing.

602
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:31,644
哪有不可救藥的音癡啊
There's no hopeless tone deaf.

603
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,113
連餅家的大嬸也能改啊
Even that aunt from the flat cake 
shop can also be change.

604
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:37,484
那種人肯定會到時候帶著媽媽來要退錢的
End of the day she sure bring 
along her mom and ask for refund

605
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,952
喂 臭小子
Hey, idiot!

606
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,987
突然喊什麼啊
Why suddenly shout?

607
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:42,989
她沒有媽媽
She don't have a mother.

608
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,991
沒有媽媽不是還有爸爸嗎
No mother, but still have father, right?

609
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:47,627
媽媽沒在 怎麼可能有爸爸啊
No mother, how could she has father?

610
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:50,230
學音樂的人 心胸怎麼這麼乾枯啊
Being a musician, why is you heart so dry?

611
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,364
像是沙漠似的
Like desert.

612
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:55,168
我說 你帶她去吃點好吃的 好好勸勸她吧
Bring her out for dinner and try to persuade.

613
00:38:57,804 --> 00:38:59,239
怎麼給這麼多啊
Why so much?

614
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,707
哪多了 才一萬而已
Not a lot, just 10,000Won

615
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:02,475
是十萬啊

621

你為什麼想學唱歌
Why you want to learn singing.

625
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,202
不想跟我說話嗎
Don't feel like telling me?

626
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,237
好吧 吃飯 吃飯
Alright, eat, eat.

627
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,176
雖然不知道是什麼原因
Although I don't know what's the reason.

628
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:38,745
但是光把歌唱好並不能解決一切的事
But can't solve any problem by singing well

629
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,047
够了
Enough!

630
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,215

石頭剪刀布

怎麼自己在這坐著啊

1042

啊 養活兩個孩子弄的我體力不夠啊

You have to thanks your mom, you have a baby face.

I hate my mom because I look old.

1049

不想練了
Don't feel like practice.

1051
01:17:43,863 --> 01:17:45,632
越來越覺得累了
Feeling more and more tired.

1052
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,501
雖然不知道发生什么事

1053
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:50,501
不過一定要加油哦

1054

我也在堅持呢

1055
01:17:55,241 --> 01:17:57,877

1059
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,432
我的寶貝兒子
My lovely son.

1060
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:27,907
媽媽真的想給你们唱催眠曲
Mom really wanted to sing to you a lullaby

1061
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:35,448
但是 媽媽一开始唱
But once I start sing.

1062
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:42,455
大家就會笑我

1063

and unable to carry on.

1064
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:53,867
再等等我吧 媽媽能做到的
Give me sometime, mom will make it.

1065
01:18:54,434 --> 01:18:59,706
為什麼每个星期都要去練歌廳2到3次呢
Why every week have to go karaoke 2 to 3 times?

1066
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:03,476
聲音不好聽的話 大家也不會期待啊
Everyone wouldn't expect me to sing, if I don't sing good.

1067
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,812
我都要瘋掉了
I'm going mad.

1068
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:10,216
要是這種聲的話 也就不會有人叫我唱歌了
No one would want me sing if I sing really bad.

1069
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:13,653
為什麼選歌手非得看臉蛋啊
Why choosing a singers have to go for the looks first?

1070
01:19:13,653 --> 01:19:15,422
就是
Yeah!

1071
01:19:15,655 --> 01:19:18,591
你們歌唱得也不好啊
You guys don't sing good too.

1072
01:19:19,726 --> 01:19:22,328
啊 煩死了

And me...

1074
01:19:28,968 --> 01:19:32,439
不是為了讓大家看才學習唱歌的
I don't intent to learn singing just to let everyone see.

1075
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:36,776
我呢
And me...

1076
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:43,249
對於脫離音癡之類, 沒有一點期望
I don't have any any expectation on getting rid of tone deaf.

1077
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:48,755
只是 想在喜歡的人面前
Just wanted to show the one I love...

1078
01:19:50,757 --> 01:19:53,360
想要好好的唱一首歌而已
I can sing well.

1079
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:57,464
不是因為缺乏自信
I'm not lack of confidence.

1080
01:20:01,534 --> 01:20:05,038
我真的只想好好唱一首歌

1081
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:12,312

小事而已 試試看不就行了

有時間唱歌

要不是他太過分, 你也不會那麼做啊
You won't do that if he's not pushing his luck.

1146
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,803
他們就知道站在男人那邊說話
They always stand at the man's side of view.

--不賣活章魚--

1154
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:01,934
世界上沒有能隱瞞到底的事
You can't hide something forever in this world.

1155
01:25:02,669 --> 01:25:04,137
唱歌雖然很好
Although singing is good...

1156
01:25:05,005 --> 01:25:08,007
但是不想被別人搶走那個男人的話

1157
01:25:10,643 --> 01:25:12,746
就直接告白吧

1158
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:19,000
親口對他說的話 不是會有個結果嗎
You'll have your answer if you tell in front of him.

1159
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:25,725
走到底才會知道不會有回頭路
You will know when you go to the end,
and there is no turning back.

1160
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:30,030
我上次也是因為收到女朋友的結婚請帖
Me too because of receiving a wedding invitation ...

1161
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:32,665
在酒吧钢管那邊耍瘋

1162
01:25:32,665 --> 01:25:35,200
不小心掉下來 才打的石膏

你第一次見到我的時候

1164

就是因為那件事才弄成那個德行的
That's what happen.

1165
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:47,213
所以現在反而慶幸再也不用回頭去看她了
That is why I'm glad instate and never think of her again.

1167
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:14,874
啊 真是要瘋掉了
Ah... really hard.

1168
01:26:19,546 --> 01:26:22,182
有個非常絕妙的方法

很奏效的 很適合
Sure works, very suitable.

1170
01:26:27,053 --> 01:26:30,557
但是身為院長 不太好開口說
But not so good for me to speak out as a principle.

1171
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,493
院長大人
Principle, sir.

1172
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:36,663

沈勇唱歌真的很好聽

In this song, add in Dong Joo's voice.

1175
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:10,697

Is it nice?

01:27:10,697 --> 01:27:13,867
哇 怎麼做到的

1192
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:22,469

What is this?

1193
01:28:23,336 --> 01:28:25,038
邀請函
An invitation card.

1194
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:30,276
我的演唱會
My concert.

1195
01:28:31,144 --> 01:28:32,612
演唱會嗎
Concert?

1196
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:35,515
是參加的一個組織開的演唱會
That organization I joined, holds this concert.

1197
01:28:35,515 --> 01:28:36,983
哦
Oh

1198
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:39,319
你能來嗎
Can you come?

1199
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,621

Um

1200
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:43,656
真的嗎
Really?

1201
01:28:43,957 --> 01:28:44,824
嗯

1202
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:49,129
謝謝
Thank you.

1209
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,269
真的很好聽
Really so nice.

1211
01:29:58,398 --> 01:30:00,265
你來找這個嗎
Looking for this?

1212
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:04,804
還是放棄吧 要不就用你的聲音去唱
Why don't you give up or else use your own voice.

1213
01:30:05,105 --> 01:30:06,573
這算什麼啊
What is this?

1214
01:30:12,445 --> 01:30:13,313
給我
Give me.

1215
01:30:14,214 --> 01:30:16,182
你想用這個去參加演唱會嗎
You wanna use this for the concert?

1216
01:30:16,182 --> 01:30:17,584
把你的真實的模樣表演給他看吧
Use the really you.

1217
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:20,153
除了這以為沒別的方法 你知道的
Other than this, there is not other way. You should know. 

1218
01:30:20,153 --> 01:30:22,255
就算節拍和音調完全正確也並不能證明它就是歌
Even the beat are right doesn't mean is a song.

1220
01:30:22,255 --> 01:30:23,423
要把唱歌的人的真心投入到歌裡
Use the really emotion and apply to the song...

1221
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:25,125
才能把它稱之為歌
Then that is called a song.

1222
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:26,893
你算什麼
Who are you?

1223
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,796
你有什麼資格對我指手畫腳
You don't have the right to comment me.

1224
01:30:30,096 --> 01:30:32,132
那麼喜歡就直接跟他告白啊
So like him then tell him.

1225
01:30:32,132 --> 01:30:33,299
別逞強要唱歌
Don't overexert wanting to sing.

1226
01:30:33,299 --> 01:30:35,068
把所有學員當成傻子來耍
You are treating all participants as a fool.

1227
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:39,973
你是想說這次表演是為了我才開的嗎
Are you saying this concert organised because of me?

1228
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:44,644
你不會是喜歡我吧
Don't tell me, you liked me.

1229
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,748
那就說出來啊
Then say out.

1230
01:30:51,651 --> 01:30:53,353
你不是讓我說出來的嗎
Aren't you want me to say out?

1231

01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:49,529
把舌頭伸出來說話吧
Stick out you tongue and speak.

1365
01:43:49,529 --> 01:43:51,831
別說什麼錯不錯的 反正以後也不用見面了
Who's wrong I don't wanna know.
Don't want to see you again.

1366
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:55,602
我有很好的反省 還花錢去練習唱歌了呢
I felt remorse and I took up singing lesson too.

1367
01:43:55,602 --> 01:43:57,037
你聽聽看吧
Give me a chance.

1368
01:43:59,372 --> 01:44:01,708
烏拉拉的歌曲是
Wulala is the song of

1369
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:06,946
烏拉拉烏拉 烏拉拉烏拉
Wu lala wula wulala wula

1370
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:10,650
怎麼樣 是不是好一點了
How is it? Is it better?

1371
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:13,887
反正你也沒有找到替補啊
Anyway you haven't found any substitute yet.

1372
01:44:13,887 --> 01:44:15,055
我得進去了
I have to go in.

1373
01:44:15,055 --> 01:44:19,993

喂 5分鐘後進來吧
5 minutes later come in.

1375
01:44:24,597 --> 01:44:27,801
不是說導演不是官嗎 還飯費
I thought you said director is not 
a judge? And meals expenses?

1376
01:44:27,801 --> 01:44:31,304
你敢再來那種態度試試
Don't you dare try your bad attitude toward me again.

1377
01:44:33,006 --> 01:44:35,075
你當導演是什麼人啊
What kind of person you think a director is?

1378
01:44:35,642 --> 01:44:39,145
我做錯了 導演 我再也不這樣了
Is my fault. Director, I won't do it again.

1379
01:44:39,145 --> 01:44:42,949
看羅東珠小姐確實很深深的反省的份上
Miss Da Dong Joo, give you a chance since you repented

1380
01:44:43,249 --> 01:44:44,417
教訓就不用了
No need to teach you a lesson.

1381
01:44:44,684 --> 01:44:48,788
從上次烏拉拉那個錄音開始重新錄吧
Start record from that wu lala all over again.

1382

01:45:42,308 --> 01:45:46,379
嗯 不過寶拉怎麼沒在啊
Un, but why Bo Ra not here?

1394
01:45:47,247 --> 01:45:48,148
你不知道嗎
You didn't know?

1395
01:45:49,015 --> 01:45:50,183
他們分手了
They broke up.

1396
01:45:52,752 --> 01:45:54,821
喂喂 喝吧 喝吧
Oh...lets drink...lets drink.

1397
01:45:54,821 --> 01:45:56,556
女人又不是只有寶拉一個
Bo Ra is not the only woman.

1398
01:45:57,157 --> 01:45:59,492
是啊 有紫色（寶拉的諧音）
Yup, There's purple (Bo Ra's Homophonic)

為什麼啊
Why?

1404
01:46:19,346 --> 01:46:22,015
每次和我見面 她總是會想到你
She always think of you, everytime we meet.

1405
01:46:22,015 --> 01:46:23,717
所以覺得心裡難受了
Thats why she feels sad.

1406
01:46:25,752 --> 01:46:27,520
估計是沒有緣分吧
I guess we're fated can't be together.

1407
01:47:01,087 --> 01:47:02,255
餅還沒好嗎
Is the flat cake ready?

1408
01:47:02,255 --> 01:47:05,425
好 馬上就飛過去了
Ok will fly there soon.

1409
01:47:06,826 --> 01:47:07,694
哎喲

1412
01:47:14,934 --> 01:47:19,000
哎喲就因為你没控制火喉才飛不起來啊
AHH!! because of you never control the 
fire, thats why it can't fly.

1413
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:23,410
這麼烤的話只會考糊外邊 裡邊都是生的
This way the outer part is over cook 
and the inner still not cook.

1414
01:47:23,943 --> 01:47:26,813
知道嗎 這個和戀愛差不多
Understand? This one and lover almost the same.

1415
01:47:26,813 --> 01:47:27,681
戀愛嗎
Lover?

1416
01:47:27,681 --> 01:47:30,617
嗯 用溫火 先烤熟裡邊
Un, use warm fire to cook the inner.

1417
01:47:30,617 --> 01:47:32,352
覺得裡邊烤熟了之後
Inner is cooked then...

1418
01:47:32,352 --> 01:47:36,156
那時候在用大火把外邊烤一層
use big fire to cook the outer.

1419
01:47:36,156 --> 01:47:39,959
哎喲 就你這麼烤是談不好戀愛的
Ah...the way you cook, you won't 
have a good relationship.

1420
01:47:40,527 --> 01:47:44,330
媽媽就是用這個手藝勾引了你爸爸啊 
This is the skill that your mom 
use to seduced your father.

1421
01:47:46,366 --> 01:47:47,834

Oh you still alive. Long time no see.

1426
01:47:57,777 --> 01:47:59,512
可以用代金券吧 社長
Chief, Can I use voucher?

1427
01:48:00,347 --> 01:48:03,283
真是厚臉皮 怎麼就知道用代金卷啊
Always use voucher, really thick skin.

1428
01:48:03,283 --> 01:48:05,018
開玩笑的開玩笑
I'm Kidding, kidding.

1429
01:48:05,018 --> 01:48:07,954
你當我是天天白天喝酒耍酒瘋的人嗎
You thought I'm a everyday drunken person?

1430
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:10,557
是不是就算了
