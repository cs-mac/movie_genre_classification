1
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:24,845
People are awfully forgiving

2
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:30,163
They just don't understand what's been done to them

3
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:37,500
We are at an epochal shift,
there's a point where the west

4
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:41,308
could tip into a complacent
and quite well off redundancy

5
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:44,721
or we could play
a decisive role in the future

6
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,017
what the banks did was reprehensible

7
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:52,431
that was why there was the outrage
of the greed of the bankers

8
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:57,701
when we gave them money that was
supposed to help them lend to others

9
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:03,088
but they decided to use that money to pay themselves bonuses,
for what? ....For record losses?

10
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,082
We are governed by corporations today

11
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,585
often by corporations that don't
have very much interest in the USA.

12
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:16,208
I don't know what happened man,
what happened to the the USA

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,503
it was so far in the ditch, you know what,
in what moment did it all go bad?

14
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:24,265
Was it disco,
was it Donna Summer,
is that what killed America?`

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,973
We are entering the age of consequence

16
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,196
A rapacious financial system,
escalating organised violence

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,024
abject poverty for billions,
and the looming environmental fallout

18
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:51,920
are all converging at a time when
governments, religion, and mainstream economists

19
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,081
have stalled.

20
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:03,971
War, conquest, famine and death

21
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,640
The Four Horsemen are Coming!

22
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,826
This is not a film that sees conspiracies

23
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,100
It's not a film that mongers fear

24
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,187
It's not a film that blames bankers or politicians

25
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:34,134
It's a film that questions the systems we've created

26
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,130
and suggests ways to reform them

27
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,562
Over centuries systems have been subtly modified,

28
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,418
manipulated and even corrupted.

29
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:48,995
often to serve the interests of the few

30
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:52,385
We have continually accepted these changes

31
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,751
and because man can adjust to living
under virtually any conditions

32
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,467
the trait that has enabled us to survive

33
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,416
is the very trait that has suppressed us

34
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,456
Most societies have an elite,

35
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,105
an elite tries to stay in power

36
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:09,916
The way they stay in power is

37
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,749
not merely by controlling the means of the production
(to be Marxist),

38
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,910
i.e. controlling the money,

39
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,231
but by controlling the cognitive map,
the way we think.

40
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,181
and what really matters in that respect

41
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,248
is not so much what is actually said in public

42
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,127
but what is left undebated, unsaid.

43
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,444
For centuries,
gatekeepers have manipulated our cognitive map

44
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,808
but in 1989, a computer scientist
by the name of Tim Berners Lee

45
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:38,221
implemented the first successful communication between

46
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:43,051
an http client and a server,
the www was born.

47
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,372
It has since unleashed a tsunami of

48
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,576
instantly accessible,
freely available information.

49
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:54,127
Just as Gutenberg's printing press wrestled control of

50
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,796
the cognitive map
away from an ecclesiastical and royal elite,

51
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,627
today the internet
is beginning to change governments,

52
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:03,136
finance and the media

53
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,876
We are at the cusp of change

54
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,963
But to enact it
we must first understand the things

55
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:12,308
that have been left unsaid for so long

56
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,138
to do that, we need context
from people who speak the truth

57
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,135
in the face of collective delusion.

58
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:23,570
Because, to understand something,
is to be liberated from it

59
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,720
At the end of world war 2
we had 50% of the World's GDP

60
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:05,505
we were making 54,000 airplanes a year,
7000 ships etc.

61
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:09,127
and we were the new Rome
and we recognised it.

62
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,446
We devised a power-management scheme in
the 1947 national security act

63
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,350
to we thought manage it,

64
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,998
it worked fairly well during the cold war

65
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:19,762
but we haven't done anything since,

66
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:24,058
and I think that's another sign
of our inability to grasp

67
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,683
the new world,
if you will.

68
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,878
Empires do not begin or end on a certain date

69
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:36,690
but they do end.

70
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,012
And the west has not yet come to terms

71
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:40,776
with its fading supremacy

72
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,536
At the end of every empire,
under the guise of renewal,

73
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:48,973
tribes, armies and organisations appear

74
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,015
and devour the heritage of the former superpower

75
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,663
often from within

76
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,906
In his essay, "The fate of empires",
the soldier diplomat and traveller,

77
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:06,411
Lt.General Sir John Glubb
analysed the lifecycle of empires.

78
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:10,359
He found remarkable similarities between them all

79
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:19,066
An Empire lasts about 250 years
or 10 generations from the early pioneers

80
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:23,640
to the final conspicous consumers who
become a burden on the state

81
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,026
6 ages define the lifespan of an empire

82
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,580
The age of Pioneers

83
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,902
The age of Conquests

84
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,085
The age of Commerce

85
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,010
The age of Affluence

86
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,402
The age of Intellect

87
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:46,698
Ending with bread and circuses in
the age of Decadence

88
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,551
There are common features to
every age of decadence

89
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:57,704
an undiciplined, overextended military

90
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:01,814
the conspicouous display of wealth

91
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:08,641
a massive disparity between rich and poor

92
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,867
a desire to live off a bloated state

93
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,025
and an obsession with sex

94
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,430
But perhaps the most notorious trait of all

95
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,915
is the debasement of the currency

96
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:35,576
The US and Great Britain both began on a gold/silver standard
long since abandoned

97
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,269
Rome was no different

98
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:42,472
So it started on a principle that was very sound

99
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,121
and it was on a silver standard

100
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,046
but as it corrupted further and further

101
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,248
the Roman Dinaris got to the point
where it was basically a copper coin

102
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,455
and they learned how to plate it

103
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,686
It was washed in silver,

104
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:56,706
and in circulation the plating came off

105
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,280
At the end, all the senators that really did at
one time represent the people,

106
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:05,553
only were interested in representing how much
wealth they could steal at the top.

107
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:11,334
Great Empire wealth always dazzles,
but beneath the surface

108
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,816
the unbridled desire for money,
power and material possessions

109
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:19,090
means that duty and
public service are replaced by

110
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:22,643
leaders and citizens
who scramble for the spoils.

111
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:27,031
Historically all the signs of the demise of

112
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:28,889
the empire are beginning to develop,

113
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,118
some are more trenchant than others

114
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,835
this current economic and financial crisis,

115
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,246
that sort of thing always accompanies
the demise of Empire

116
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:43,192
the people of Rome were constantly
being distracted by the gladiatorial events,

117
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,305
and the politicians knew that they did this.

118
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:48,835
whenever there was unrest,
there was a huge event going on

119
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:51,644
The politicians created new events,
with lots and lots of gladiators

120
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,316
and everyday we are doing
that very same thing.

121
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,497
That is a common trait of declining empires.

122
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:02,093
So today in the US for example
you'll find a tremendous emphasis on all kinds

123
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:05,437
of TV-programmes that distract
people from what's really going on.

124
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:08,572
Sports is a big part of that,
as it was in gladiator times.

125
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:15,422
In essence we've been
lulled into a lethargy

126
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,720
and we've accepted that

127
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,109
Just as our sport stars today earn vast sums,

128
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,524
so did Roman charioteers

129
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,567
in the second century one by the name of

130
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,446
Gaius Appoleius Diocles amassed a fortune of

131
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,140
35 million Sesterces in prize money

132
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,275
equivalent to several billion dollars today

133
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,222
Strangely perhaps,
there's another profession that is

134
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,241
disproportionally hallowed
as an empire declines

135
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:48,046
The romans, ottomans and the spanish
all made celebrities of their chefs

136
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:53,224
This again is typifying the end of an empire

137
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,937
where things were so great we
have this last oomph of momentum

138
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,166
that we used to be great,

139
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:03,533
we felt great, we don't feel it anymore

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,366
so everyone is out searching for it.

141
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:10,662
Maybe it's in the best food or the best clothes

142
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:15,677
or the best music or the best movies
or reality TV-show or another magazine

143
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,696
but you can never get enough
of what you don't need

144
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,877
what you need
is a strong moral conviction that is

145
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,476
pervasive throughout the society
and integrity reigns.

146
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:33,951
there's a vast apathy, there's a vast
amoralism, even a political nature to it

147
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,852
that is to say there are vast numbers of people
who don't give a damn

148
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:42,543
So, there's this natural entropy,

149
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:46,095
any living organism,
which an empire is of course,

150
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,486
over time dies.

151
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,551
The question is how does it die?

152
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,221
Does it die devoured in a
cascade of events or,

153
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,171
does it die over a long period of time

154
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:02,094
The babyboomer generation were
born into this age of decadence,

155
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:07,620
perhaps unwittingly they've broken
the unspoken intergenerational contract

156
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:12,636
through unfettered consumerism,
spiraling house-prices,

157
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:15,120
and a desire for eternal youth

158
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:19,254
the babyboomers have squandered
future generations' inheritance

159
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,458
My generation and the generation
right after my generation

160
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:27,079
I think we forgot that little phrase
in the preamble to our constitution

161
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:32,884
which says, "and our posterity"
All of a sudden it became "us", period.

162
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:36,854
The babyboom generation
which I'm a part of is gone

163
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:41,429
and the biggest mis-allocation of
capital in the history of mankind.

164
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,305
We've had cheap oil
or cheap energy is a better way to phrase it

165
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:55,175
we've had an abundance of ideas,
and we've chosen a system and perpetuated it

166
00:13:55,871 --> 00:14:00,957
That is probably one of the worst ways
to use the blessings

167
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:05,229
that were bestowed upon us
and we're going to pay a price for that

168
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,872
Human beings are inconsistent and paradoxical

169
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,867
we hope for peace and immortality

170
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,791
but continually invent new ways to destroy each other

171
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,785
we're capable of the kindest, most noble acts

172
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,896
and the most horrific atrocities

173
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:30,678
Human beings are complex creatures

174
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:37,807
We're capable, right now,
at this minute, of acting in such a way

175
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:42,660
as to make it likely if not certain

176
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,675
that our grandchildren are
going to face terrible disasters

177
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:52,853
and we're consciously acting to
accelerate that likelihood

178
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:54,664
even though we all love our grandchildren

179
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,963
How can it be more contradictory than that

180
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:04,324
In spite of all the economic activities of
the last 50-70 years

181
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,551
since the World War 2
and all the industrialization

182
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:14,076
we have not yet managed to
solve the problem of poverty,

183
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,002
depravation, hunger or malnutrition..

184
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,830
Millions of people,
every night go to bed without food

185
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:27,822
and millions of people are throwing away their food.

186
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:33,558
Waste on one hand, and poverty
and depravation and hunger on the other

187
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,550
Malnutrition on one hand,
and obesity on the other

188
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,685
What kind of system have we created?

189
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,354
Why with such brilliant knowledge on the planet

190
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:48,488
are we still struggling to distribute wealth fairly?

191
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,970
How has the human race
developed a flawed system of

192
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:57,033
government and economics that serves
the few at the expense of the many?

193
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,140
And with such poverty in an age of plenty,
why have we not had the will

194
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,741
to change such a vicious social structure?

195
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:13,798
Greed is the fundamental kind of
ingredient for the immoral economy

196
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:20,114
The problem is not that there's
not enough in the world

197
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:24,595
people say that poverty...
that we have to create more wealth

198
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,125
"There's enough in the world for everybodys need"

199
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:32,374
as Mahatma Gandhi said
..."but not for anybody's greed".

200
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:37,088
But is it just greed,
or does it go deeper than that?

201
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:40,083
Is the problem systemic?

202
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:25,710
As a civilization,
we've obviously had a great run

203
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:28,636
we've done very well,
we had the industrial revolution

204
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:32,723
having survived that
we built a lot of modern military technology

205
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,416
we've survived that so far.
We built a banking system,

206
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,899
and we're still struggling with that part

207
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:40,687
We've had a good run...

208
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:43,682
It's kind of like when
I was working at wall street for 7 years

209
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:48,326
I had the experience some people would have
say, working at a meat processing plant...

210
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:49,627
...they become vegetarian

211
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,365
When you work on Wall Street and
you see how these banks like Goldman, JP Morgan,

212
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,410
how they make money,

213
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:57,707
when you see money,
it kind of makes you sick.

214
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:01,678
I think if the people knew what
the banking system is up to,

215
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,045
as Henry Ford said
there would be "a revolution tomorrow morning".

216
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,198
The fact is most people think is,
that what a bank does is lend you money that

217
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,427
someone else has put in the bank
previously.

218
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:19,789
But what a commercial bank actually does,
is to create money from nothing

219
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,484
and then lend it to you at interrest.

220
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:27,313
If I do that, if I manufacture money in my own home,
it's called counterfeiting

221
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:31,399
If an accountant creates money out of nothing
in company's accounts,

222
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,769
it's called "cooking the books".

223
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,138
But if a bank does it,
then it's perfectly legal.

224
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:41,198
So long as you allow
fraud to be legalised,

225
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:46,167
then all kinds of problems are gonna pop up
in the economic systems,

226
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,259
which you can't do anything about.

227
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,300
Private banks create money out of nothing

228
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,856
and lend it at interest.

229
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:58,892
Now that sounds absurd, but when i teach
sophomores about money and banking

230
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:03,048
they never believe it,
so you have to go through it again and again...

231
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,158
Yes!  Banks do create money,
here's how it happens

232
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:14,287
And it's absurd and they're right to doubt that
that could possibly be what's really going on

233
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:15,610
but it is

234
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:19,093
Now if the banking lobby is very strong
they're going to say

235
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,856
"well we dont wan't to change the system,
we're making so much money out of it,

236
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,087
what we have to do is:

237
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:26,036
A: Try and convince the people that it's their fault;

238
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,887
that "Their wage claims are too high,
that's why we are having lots of inflation".

239
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:36,090
Or: "People are speculating on housing,
that's why housepricing is going up..."

240
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:37,716
what they're not going to say is;

241
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,316
"This is happening because the banks are
creating money out of nothing,

242
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:43,103
and pumping it in to the system,
that's why the prices are going up".

243
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:49,117
But how is it we've ended up with a system
in which banks have the power to create money?

244
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:58,776
Since 1971 when president Nixon took the US off
what was left of the Gold standard,

245
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:02,886
the world has operated under a system of money
known as FIAT.

246
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,761
The dollar, pound and euro are all
government FIAT currencies.

247
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,988
FIAT is a latin word,
meaning "let it be so".

248
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:15,657
It's the law that this government currency be money.

249
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:20,649
Indeed, without that legal enforcement,
and the fact that we must pay taxes with this money,

250
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,341
that dollar bill, or that computer
digit that represents the dollar,

251
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,408
would be pretty much meaningless.

252
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:30,193
Only the government has
the power to issue FIAT money.

253
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,933
But banks can create it through lending.

254
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:38,645
Over the last 40 years, since this system of
FIAT money became the global norm,

255
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,385
the supply of money has grown exponentially.

256
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:45,704
In fact we've seen the greatest
growth in the supply of money in history.

257
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,072
But who benefits?

258
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:52,716
Of course those who have
the power to issue the money,

259
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,667
governments and banks.

260
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:58,405
Then those companies and individuals
that get this money early,

261
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,306
they can spend it before the prices of
the things they want to buy,

262
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:05,464
have risen to reflect
the new money in circulation.

263
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:11,501
In other words they get services,
products or assets cheap.

264
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,102
But prices soon rise.

265
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,653
So, holders of assets such as houses
or shares will then see gains

266
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:21,091
without there necessarilly being any improvements

267
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,041
to the company or the house in question.

268
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,246
Often this can lead to speculative bubbles.

269
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,171
But what about those
at the bottom of the pyramid?

270
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:34,466
Those on fixed wages or incomes,
those who live in remote areas or those with savings?

271
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:38,111
By the time this newly created money
has filtered down to them,

272
00:21:38,738 --> 00:21:41,223
the prices of the things they
want to buy have increased.

273
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:43,521
Their savings buy them less however

274
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,168
and their wages remain largely unchanged.

275
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:51,277
In some cases they have to take on debt,
just to be able to afford the things

276
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,181
they were previously able to buy.

277
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,874
which means they have to go back to the banks.

278
00:21:56,873 --> 00:22:01,401
In reality this process of creating money,
only redistributes wealth

279
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,676
from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.

280
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:07,252
And thus that ever increasing gulf
between the rich and poor

281
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,339
gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

282
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,494
When you get off the gold standard
and switch to FIAT currency,

283
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,932
combined with a fractional reserve banking system,

284
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,950
you end up compounding debt
faster than you can ever

285
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,458
possibly produce to support that debt.

286
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:28,127
So eventually you're going to
find yourself back into debt slavery

287
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,472
and that's what's happened in the US.

288
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:37,183
For every dollar of GDP, you also
create something like 5 dollars and 50 cents worth of debt.

289
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:43,011
This is what happens when our
economy flips over and basically capsizes.

290
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:50,581
The government solution now
to address all the problems, is to create more debt.

291
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:53,483
You can never get enough of
a currency that doesn't work.

292
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,271
You can print it to kingdom come.

293
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,940
You can't print wealth, and you can't
get out of debt by making more debt.

294
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:04,187
If you could print wealth, Zimbabwe would be the largest
most prosperous country on the planet,

295
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:05,650
we know it doesn't work.

296
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:11,896
Of the money in the world today
97% of it is debt.

297
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:19,373
The french philosopher Voltaire once said:
"All paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value,

298
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,347
Zero!"

299
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:30,681
For three generations the world watched
the fight between capitalism and communism,

300
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,722
but in the 1980s the Russian economy
started to collapse.

301
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:40,434
The Soviet Union capitulated,
and "so called" capitalism reigned supreme.

302
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:50,697
Before 1989 we had a battle between
communism and the market.

303
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,155
And in that battle there was a sense of;

304
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:59,288
"Let's not expose the flaws in the market economy".

305
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:02,470
"This is too important of a battle;"

306
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:06,928
"you don't criticize our team
while we are fighting their team".

307
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:11,316
And their team; social with authoritarianism,

308
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:15,984
with their failure to deliver well being to their society...

309
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:19,420
It was very clear that if you had to choose between these two,

310
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:20,511
which one was better.

311
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,996
Communism failed first,

312
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:30,241
for various reasons, it was inefficient,
human rights, lack of respect...

313
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:37,973
Capitalist West has been continuing
in a triumphalist mode thinking,

314
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,686
"Our adversary has failed
that means we are doing everything right"

315
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:47,447
Both systems are trying to do something
which is fundamentally impossible

316
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:49,118
grow forever...

317
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:52,137
And they are both going to fail,
one failed first.

318
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:58,314
Capitalism is going to fail later,
or it's failing now.

319
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,868
America now is in an interesting position.

320
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,792
In the past 200-300 years of its history,

321
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:09,204
it's a culture and country
which has almost always existed on

322
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:11,804
the assumption that
the resources could be expanded.

323
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,752
If there was a problem,
you always try to deal with it by expanding the pie

324
00:25:16,402 --> 00:25:18,538
go west young man,
make the pie bigger...

325
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,698
...so that everyone's got a bigger piece.

326
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:24,738
Now it's facing a world where possibly
resources are beginning to be more constrained.

327
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:29,289
It's going to have to divide up that pie
and inflict pain on people.

328
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:31,959
That's something which it's
not well prepared for.

329
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:38,577
How has the country moved so far from
the intentions of its founding fathers?

330
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:42,640
How has the American Dream
become so distorted?

331
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:47,284
Over the last 30-40 years,
capitalism has taken this extreme form

332
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,885
and a lot of it goes back to the economist

333
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,673
Milton Friedman from the chicago school.

334
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:56,781
Ronald Reagan and Margret Thatcher
and others buying in to these policies

335
00:25:57,199 --> 00:26:01,449
They really encouraged people
to take on huge amounts of debt

336
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:08,484
encouraged privatisation,
smaller governments supposedly although, bigger military.

337
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:12,524
It's about deregulation;

338
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:18,399
getting rid of rules that govern
the people who run our institutions

339
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:19,839
especially our corporations.

340
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,320
It's as though we're suddenly supposed
to believe that human beings that sit

341
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:28,105
at the top of corporations
don't need to be regulated,

342
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,357
that they're some sort of Gods.

343
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:37,532
Milton Friedman; his proteges,
the Chicago Boys and the neoclassical ideology

344
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,503
beat the classical approach to
economics and became the framework

345
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:43,755
for what we today call capitalism.

346
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:49,119
There are 2 main competing economic
approaches, which determine how

347
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,975
we humans manage the world
and distribute wealth.

348
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:56,782
These are the classical and neoclassical schools.

349
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:59,824
The classical school favours
less government interference,

350
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:03,794
more personal autonomy
and recognises that humans cannot

351
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,814
function without natural resources

352
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:10,064
The neoclassical school which has a
more dissmissive view of natural resources

353
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:13,918
thinks government should rule the economy,
solve social problems and

354
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,540
leave the free market to
look after the distribution of wealth.

355
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:21,395
The neoclassical school
emerged around 100 years ago

356
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:24,878
due to vested interests' desire to protect their assets.

357
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:29,220
This meant that neoclassical mathematical
models and assumptions

358
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:31,426
were divorced from reality.

359
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:37,022
They're based on what ought to be, instead of the
classical model which are based on what actually is.

360
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,341
It's these neoclassical models
which favour large corporations,

361
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:46,008
that have been used to legitimise the
financialization of the global econonomy,

362
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:52,835
Championed by Reagan and Thatcher, neoclassical
economics still dominates policy making today.

363
00:27:54,135 --> 00:28:01,101
The Reagan/Thatcher Revolution,
was a big change in power-structure

364
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:05,211
and a big transfer of opportunity and wealth.

365
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,856
It's not that the poor it gave to the rich,

366
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:11,341
it was a transfer within the well-to-do.

367
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:16,264
So the financial sector in the US,
UK and other places

368
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:21,953
became vastly more profitable
and wages in that sector went up a lot.

369
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:25,018
We would focus on bonuses
but also base salaries went up.

370
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:30,683
So it's a transfer from the non-financial
to the financial part of the economy.

371
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,931
That is unprecedented as far as we can see
in any of the available data to us.

372
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,114
I'm talking of all the recorded human history.

373
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:43,640
In 1932, in the aftermath of America's
great stock market crash,

374
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,193
a piece of legislation was passed to protect society.

375
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,556
The Glass Steagall Act was introduced to
separate ordinary highstreet banking

376
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,182
from investment banking.

377
00:28:55,621 --> 00:29:01,264
67 years later in 1999 under the
influence of treasury secretary Larry Summers and

378
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:06,419
his predecessor Robert Rubin,
president Bill Clinton repealed the Glass Steagall Act,

379
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:10,738
Once again banks could take
ordinary depositor's money and

380
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,314
speculate with it on virtually anything they liked.

381
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:22,162
Wall street has become a very
particular type of Casino...

382
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:30,150
Unfortunately not the kind of casino they have in Las Vegas
which is perfectly legitimate form of entertaiment...

383
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:36,651
It is a Casino that has massive negative
repercussions on the rest of society.

384
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,459
It's not just losing your money on a few wild nights,

385
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:44,592
it's about the way in which those
organisations lose their money

386
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:49,306
impacting the whole of society,
leading to massive loss of jobs.

387
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:57,154
This unfettered gambling pushed the entire
global financial system to near collapse

388
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:02,077
with balances and debt obligations
larger than the GDP of entire countries.

389
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:06,698
The banks had become too big to fail,
the west was unprepared,

390
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,715
and bankers met their reeling and
disorientated governments.

391
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:15,707
"You have to bail us out!"
"We need money."

392
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:19,910
"If you don't give us the money
the whole thing goes down".

393
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,624
"What are you going to do with
millions and tens of millions of people

394
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:27,596
who have lost everything in
their bank accounts?"

395
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,707
"You will have a revolution on your head!"

396
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,820
"So fork over the money!".

397
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:40,599
"Borrow, create it out of nothing and give it to us,

398
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:50,537
so that we can face our problems and
not go under, or otherwise".

399
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:55,483
This is what Mr Hank Paulsen did in the US congress,

400
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:56,760
he went there one day and told them:

401
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,452
"We need 700 billion dollars,
and we need it now!...

402
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,054
Or else...."

403
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:06,210
Is this system we call capitalism really capitalism?

404
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,204
In a capitalist system,
government is supposed to be small

405
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:14,639
but today the state is more bloated
and invasive than it has ever been.

406
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:21,420
Individuals and companies are
supposed to operate in a free market,

407
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:24,345
good enterprise is rewarded with profit,

408
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:26,365
and flawed enterprise with failure.

409
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,709
But during the 2008 banking crisis

410
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,401
the people saw the western
economic system divided in a way

411
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,282
they were told could never happen.

412
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:39,136
Socialism for the rich

413
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:40,181
Capitalism for the poor

414
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,525
In America for example the banks that got in trouble

415
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:44,686
got bailed out by the government

416
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:46,358
That's socialism.

417
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:50,328
And people are arguing against
socialism in america and yet this is probably

418
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,559
the most socialist country in the world right now.

419
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:56,714
We have a system which isn't even
a proper capitalist system

420
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,175
rich people make mistakes,
they don't get punished

421
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,869
poor people make misstakes
they get punished, yeah?

422
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,305
or even worse,
that they even don't make any mistake,

423
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:06,188
and they are being forced to...

424
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:08,672
...pay for the mistakes of the rich.

425
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:14,152
When the taxpayer is footing the bill for
the mis-placed speculation of the bankers

426
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,914
then suddenly instead of the
economy serving the human being

427
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,603
the human being is now in perpetual service
to amoral financial organisations

428
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:47,798
It was the head of the Federal Reserve Bank
Alan Greenspan who after 9/11 slashed

429
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:49,516
interest rates to encourage lending

430
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,114
Bankers needed new participants
to keep cash flowing into

431
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,946
a system that had become a global pyramid scheme

432
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:01,056
All this newly created money
entered the housing market

433
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,494
and created unprecedented inflation

434
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,770
houseprices rose and rose

435
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:09,625
new mothers were forced back into the workplace
to service huge home-loans

436
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,363
and the anglo-american dream became
all about land speculation

437
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,080
The housing market in the west isn't about ownership

438
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,956
Because it's the only way
ordinary people can get ahead

439
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,765
and ordinary people can't get ahead by wages

440
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:27,434
What we've created is a mass bubble
economics around housing

441
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:30,314
that sucks in a huge amount of capital

442
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:36,188
takes capital meant for genuine innovations in the economy
and puts it into a speculative use

443
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,905
that has no genuine productive outcome

444
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,249
If you talk to people in germany,
they don't see any connection

445
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:46,451
between owning a piece of property
and then being inclined towards being democratic

446
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:50,283
there's lots of people who rent their housing there,
and they're perfectly comfortable with that arrangement

447
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,834
But it is true that in a somewhat different
context Reagan & Thathcer pushed

448
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,715
for more people to own housing

449
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,199
and this is part of the problem because

450
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,428
if you push people to buy
housing before they are ready,

451
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:03,495
if you push dubious loans on them

452
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:05,585
and they don't understand
what they get themselves into

453
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:08,464
You could have huge adverse repercussions.

454
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:14,199
exactly what led to, in part,
the subprime housing crisis in the US

455
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:18,657
It's not anything to do with democracy,
it's just a bad economic idea

456
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:23,278
The breakthrough that occured around 2000 in the US

457
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:26,343
was when bankers found out that the poor are honest

458
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,987
they realized that if you are poor...

459
00:34:31,312 --> 00:34:34,865
if you are not rich,
you have a different set of values

460
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:38,859
and you'll think that a debt is a debt,
and that it's something that has to be paid

461
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,342
and that people will try to pay the
debts that they're stuck with

462
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:48,077
even if the debts aren't valid,
even if the debts are much more than expected

463
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,190
even if they really can't pay the debts

464
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:55,066
When lending, them banking institutons...uh,
when they drew up contracts

465
00:34:55,833 --> 00:35:00,987
with flexible interest rates, I think they knew
in the beginning that these problems

466
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,820
were going to come back later on
where folks wouldn't be able to

467
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,025
afford the mortgages
as the interest rates increased

468
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:09,950
They put a lot of people in situations where they

469
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,296
were taking food out of the refrigerators,

470
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:14,478
taking kids out of higher education

471
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,056
They were not able to afford college anymore,

472
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,142
and it's making a really bad situation worse

473
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,276
The banks engaged in what was a criminal conspiracy

474
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,783
they charged more to the blacks and the Hispanics

475
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:30,036
The banks got together,

476
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,447
backed the Bush administration
to block the state proscecutions of

477
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:39,788
racial lending in order to charge more
and to exploit the minorities

478
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:46,197
These were loans made by one of
the major lenders in this city and in the country

479
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:47,451
Wells Fargo.

480
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:51,305
They targeted minority communities in the city,

481
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:55,299
put borrowers into loans that they could not afford,

482
00:35:56,228 --> 00:36:00,384
and put borrowers into loans
of the subprime variety,

483
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,215
therefore more expensive and less
advantageous to the borrowers

484
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,392
Hiding predatory lending practices in the
small print of complex financial products

485
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,968
was only ever going to enrich one set of interests

486
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:17,311
Many of the communities in which
African-Americans live in the city

487
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:19,169
were establishing momentum.

488
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:21,398
There was development activity that was occuring.

489
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,229
We were seeing signs of vitality
in many of these communities.

490
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:28,550
The results of the Wells Fargo forclosures,

491
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:32,497
and the subprime lending practices
of that lender and others,

492
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:37,652
has significantly impaired that progress
and brought it to a halt.

493
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,996
They don't worry about it,
they dont come in to the heart of it

494
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,271
like, you are in the heart of it,
so you see,

495
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,778
they really don't see the struggle
if they stay outside of it

496
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:48,449
That's like looking at the cover of a book,

497
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:54,092
but if you don't go inside the book
you'll never know what the book is about

498
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,041
So they're not worrying about
anyone except themselves

499
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,086
and I think it's wrong.

500
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,524
Because, if they come into the heart of it
and if they'd see, they'd be willing to help.

501
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,539
What happened in Baltimore is just one example of

502
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,838
what's happening all around the world.

503
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,041
One way to frame this injustice is by branding it a

504
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:15,292
race issue, but when we look really closely,

505
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:19,982
we can see that there's something at play here
that transcends race...

506
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:21,631
Profit!

507
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:26,460
It's not an accident for instance,
that we had the de-regulation on the financial industry

508
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,411
that was such a disaster.

509
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,121
The lobbyists of the Finance industry
amount to 5 per congress person

510
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:42,807
They pay 5 people for every
congressman to explain to them,

511
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:47,614
persuade them that they should
pass legislation that is favourable

512
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,843
to the financial industry

513
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,601
The poor people that are devastated
don't have the money.

514
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:59,526
They couldn't hire 5 per congressman.

515
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:04,936
So the way our democracy works
is on an unlevelled playfield

516
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,537
The financial sector has aquired enormous power,

517
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:11,252
partly through political contributions
by buying favours,

518
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:14,108
but mostly through ideological control

519
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:16,267
convincing people that finance is good,

520
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:17,823
more finance is better and

521
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:21,352
unregulated finance without limits is best

522
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:27,924
that's the cornerstone what we call in the US,
the Wall-Street-Washington-corridor

523
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:31,430
I mean if people need any proof
as to who is controlling Washington,

524
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:35,470
when the bail out came after
the Lehman Brothers collapsed

525
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:38,512
80% of the poulation was against the bail out

526
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:44,201
Not withstanding that, the congress
passed the bailout just showing in my view

527
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:47,428
that it's really under the control of banking interests

528
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:56,670
It's not a reflection of good democracy,
when a company or group of companies or an industry says that

529
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:02,289
our interests are more important
than the national interests

530
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,961
How can that happen?

531
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,955
Very easy.
thanks to the role of campaign contributions, lobbying,

532
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:09,998
in america's political structure.

533
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,460
We have a flawed democracy

534
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,077
There's an advanced oligarchy in the sense that
it's main mechanism of control

535
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:25,950
is through convincing people that
you really need the six biggest banks in the US

536
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:31,570
in the particular form they exist today,
with a very light level of regulation

537
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:37,003
and if you don't have them if you try to change that
all kinds of awful things will happen.

538
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:42,111
And this is not really blackmail, it sounds like blackmail,
they convince you it's not blackmail,

539
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,642
it's just the way the world is
there's nothing you can do about it.

540
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,755
You just have to cooperate with them.
It's very clever

541
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:51,724
The fed is essentially the lobbyist for
the commercial banking system

542
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:56,508
When you say you want to turn regulation
over to the fed you're saying that

543
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,666
the financial sector and wall street
should be self regulated.

544
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:04,844
Wall Street has veto power over
whoever is going to be the

545
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,283
head of the federal reserve.

546
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:10,208
As long as you give veto power over
the regulators to wall street,

547
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:14,387
as long as you pick the bank regulators
from the banking industry itself

548
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:18,149
you can forget any thought of calling it regulation.

549
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,565
It's deregulation...

550
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:24,232
and to call it regulation instead of
deregulation is using Orwellian double-think

551
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:32,220
Democracy is government by the people,
Plutocracy is government by the rich

552
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:37,793
In a typical plutocratic state
economic inequality is high,

553
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:43,195
social mobility is low, and because of
continouous exploitation of the masses

554
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:47,452
workers find it nearly impossible
to climb out of poverty.

555
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,538
The equal voting rights movement
in the early 20th century

556
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:56,508
abolished a system where the rich people
had more votes than the poor

557
00:40:57,576 --> 00:41:02,870
But today lobbying has put paid to that
and reduced the American political system

558
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:06,237
to a mere clearing house
for the concerns of the rich.

559
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:18,196
The Goldman Sachs machine is one of
using profits to buy influence in Washington

560
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:22,422
to change laws to make it easier to
make money on wall street to be used to buy

561
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:23,606
influence in Washington.

562
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:31,268
So it's a self-reinforcing
malfeasance-machine that is continuing to grow

563
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:35,564
as a parasite in the economy
and continuing to kill the host

564
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:41,950
Famous for claiming it did God's work,
Goldmann Sachs is one the most influential

565
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:43,691
investment banks in the world.

566
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:54,001
Its alumni often occupy positions of
great influence in governments and central banks.

567
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:59,875
In september 2008, barely a month before
the stock market crash

568
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:06,958
Goldmann, supposedly a pillar of the free market,
changed its banking status from investment to commercial.

569
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,696
This meant it was now elligible for state protection.

570
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:14,132
Socialism for the rich right there.

571
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:19,961
Golman Sachs are extremely efficient at what they do.
Their task is to make money.

572
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,623
They make bank robbers like Willy Sutton
look like modest amateurs.

573
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:33,150
They are huge bank robbers, but it's legal,
the system is set up so they can do it

574
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,744
In the recent years they've been selling securities
put together from mortgages

575
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:45,456
that they knew were worthless,
selling these things to unwitting consumers,

576
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:47,639
making a ton of money on it,

577
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:51,424
meanwhile they're betting that they're
going to fail because they know what they

578
00:42:51,563 --> 00:42:56,741
are peddling is rotten,
so they placed bets with the credit default swaps

579
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:05,123
with a huge insurance company AIG, and
that was insuring Goldman Sachs against the failure of

580
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,586
the stuff they we're peddling

581
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:11,718
During America's Subprime collapse
Goldmans traders Michael Svenson and

582
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:16,153
Josh Birnbaum made a 4 billion dollar profit
by shortselling junk mortgages,

583
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:22,701
Backed by Dan Sparks
internally Goldman Sachs called their position the big short

584
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,396
and bet against their own clients.

585
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,551
Senator Carl Lewin called Goldman Sachses
chief executive Lloyd Blankfine to a

586
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:32,035
senate sub committe to testify under oath.

587
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,376
Much has been said about the supposedly
massive short Goldman Sachs had on the US housing market.

588
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:42,624
The fact is we were not consistently or
significantly net short the market

589
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:46,710
In residential mortgage related products in 2007-2008

590
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:51,029
We didn't have a massive short against
the housing market and we certainly didn't

591
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:52,399
bet against our clients.

592
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,693
Riding the big short in 2007
made billions of dollars for Goldman

593
00:43:58,645 --> 00:44:02,732
And so far they've got away scot free
with this massive heist.

594
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:07,771
So they're now back bigger than before,
richer than before, biggest profits they've

595
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,486
had in history, huge bonuses,
they are doing great

596
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:21,006
A lot, if not all, of what they're doing
has nothing to do with the benefit of the economy

597
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:26,927
Can there be any objection to
genuinely talented people earning big money?

598
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:30,109
if they bring something new
and tangible to the world?

599
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:34,033
If they take great personal risks
with their own money,

600
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,655
and actually bring greater prosperity for all

601
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:43,483
In a free market If I have a brilliant idea,
that I can run an Automobile on grass-clippings

602
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,226
as an example

603
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:50,681
And i produce that car,
my motivation might be to make money

604
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:56,672
But if the market says
this is the greatest automobile ever invented by mankind

605
00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:59,830
and I make a billion dollars,
I've not only served myself,

606
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,313
but I've served everyone else
that needs a transportation.

607
00:45:03,592 --> 00:45:07,237
That is the brilliance of a free market,
there is that paradox, you can serve yourself

608
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:11,231
and simultaneously serve
others and that's what it's all about.

609
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:15,271
But how many of the general public have achieved

610
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,895
greater prosperity through a banker's bonus?

611
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:23,166
It was against the holy backdrop of
st Paul's Cathedral in London

612
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,810
that Goldman Sachs vice chairman and mouth piece,
Lord Griffith gave insight

613
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:30,132
into how certain bankers really think.

614
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:36,169
The devoted christian defended
extortioned bonuses.

615
00:45:54,908 --> 00:46:00,063
The fundamental christian view,
and Islam as well, and certainly of Judaism is that

616
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:04,985
Wealth should be shared,
money has to be shared

617
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:11,626
you can't take it with you...
And from that develops stuff such as justice in the economy

618
00:46:12,787 --> 00:46:16,200
And we've lost that,
instead we've got people accumulating more and more

619
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:27,137
I think that's disgusting that people have
lost their homes, lost their jobs,

620
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,368
they can't pay their mortgages

621
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:32,617
from bankers who made a big mistake
and got paid enormous bonuses,

622
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,382
that is simply wrong

623
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:43,321
And I can't understand
why we are not more vociferous about that

624
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:47,083
When rich people tell you that
they specifically have to be rich

625
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:53,933
through these egregious rip off mechanisms
that's just self serving propaganda

626
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:55,419
and you should be disregarding it.

627
00:46:56,371 --> 00:47:00,574
It is true that when you organise human society
some people will get ahead and

628
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:03,407
some people struggle
that is a natural mechanism.

629
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:07,563
But to say we have to got to have inequality
therefore Goldman Sachs must be organised

630
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:10,094
along the following lines,
that's a complete non sequitur

631
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:17,269
At what juncture, what point does morality
enter into the economic calculus

632
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:26,371
In a way many people think that
Adam Smith gave us a free pass

633
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:34,545
A way not to think about morality,
because what Adam Smith said was that

634
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:39,212
individuals in the pursuit of their self interest
are led as if by an invisible hand

635
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:41,766
to the general well being of society...

636
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:44,181
To make it clear,
Adam Smith didn't really say that

637
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:49,939
Adam Smith was very much aware that
businesses, when they got together,

638
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:53,562
conspired against the public interest,
raised prices,

639
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,001
he was aware of monopoly

640
00:47:55,466 --> 00:47:57,579
he was aware of the importance of education

641
00:47:57,974 --> 00:47:59,761
that the private sector couldn't provide.

642
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:02,664
So he himself was aware of all the limitations.

643
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:07,308
But his latter day descendants
have forgotten all those caveats.

644
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:14,344
Adam Smith was the godfather of classical economics,
but since its publication,

645
00:48:14,878 --> 00:48:17,176
his work has been used as a political football

646
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,241
financiers twisting his words to suit them

647
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:25,884
Lord Griffith advocates
ruthless individualism to push this idea that

648
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:29,646
if bankers get rich,
then we get rich too through a process

649
00:48:29,924 --> 00:48:31,828
known as trickle down economics.

650
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:34,104
Or Horse and Sparrow theory

651
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:37,494
If you feed the horse enough oats

652
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:42,115
Some will pass through to the road for the sparrows

653
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:48,407
the idea is that extreme wealth
concentrated on a small minority

654
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:51,124
would eventually trickle down to everyone else

655
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,328
But it doesn't work.

656
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:57,301
Because,
by the time the money reaches the people

657
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,109
at the bottom of our money pyramid,
it's lost it's purchasing power

658
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:10,791
But the public are now confused as to
why our politicial leaders

659
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:15,017
have allowed this to happen,
and quite naturally now ask why?

660
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:19,963
Because our political processes
are badly flawed

661
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,607
because of the dependence on
lobbyism and campaign contributions

662
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:35,892
That's why a lot of people view
we have to restructure our political processes

663
00:49:37,192 --> 00:49:46,202
to give more voice to the ordinary citizen
and less to the interest groups, to the monied groups

664
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:52,843
Those who have taken such a
large role in shaping our tax code,

665
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:54,909
our regulatory regulations and so forth

666
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,058
I stood on the front step of Collin Powell's house

667
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,471
And I looked at him and said:
-"Whats next boss?"

668
00:50:08,145 --> 00:50:08,841
He said:
-"What do you mean?"

669
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:10,861
I said -"What next,
where are you going next?"

670
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:12,208
-"I know you're going to write your book,

671
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,832
but you're not going to do that for
the rest of your life"

672
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:15,668
-"What are you going to do next?"

673
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:21,357
He said:
-"Maybe a cabinet position, but first money"

674
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,351
I said: "Money?"
He said: "Yeah, millions"

675
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,834
-"That's the only way you can be a
cabinet officer in the american government"

676
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:37,007
The democrats and the republicans
are beholden to corporate interests

677
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:41,628
and until they become unbeholden
to those corporate interests

678
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,439
we will never have a well governed republic.

679
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:28,137
The inherent inequity in our system of
money, banking and politics

680
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:34,105
has not just had consequences domestically
but also on a massive scale globally.

681
00:51:57,325 --> 00:52:00,576
Western leaders have presented
their military campaign in Iraq,

682
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:03,803
Afghanistan and Pakistan as a moral obligation

683
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:06,427
but are there other reasons for it?

684
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:12,650
The first financial beneficiary of
America's foreign policy is the military

685
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:16,969
in particular those who supply it
with arms and equipment

686
00:52:18,153 --> 00:52:19,639
The military has won wars.

687
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:24,539
But how successful has it been
in its bigger aim to eradicate terrorism?

688
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:33,084
The drone attacks not only failed,
but they've created extra extremism

689
00:52:33,385 --> 00:52:37,542
they've helped in radicalization of
youth in the north west frontier

690
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,282
and also in certain parts of
Punjab and Pakistan.

691
00:52:40,677 --> 00:52:45,274
And because time after time,
there's a feeling that

692
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:49,941
America does this deliberately
to destabilize Pakistan.

693
00:52:50,336 --> 00:52:53,703
I'm not so sure about that,
but I certainly think those people who

694
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:55,839
actually support this policy

695
00:52:56,536 --> 00:53:03,479
every time you kill 10 so called terrorists,
you create 500 more

696
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:08,192
because they see the drone attacks as
an attack on the sovereign state of Pakistan

697
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:16,064
If they really wanted to flush them out,
there was no need for a huge military operation in Swat,

698
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:20,104
causing an entire district to
become internally displaced persons.

699
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:25,607
The population of Swat is 1.8 million
there are 2.3 million refugees in the country

700
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,022
The whole district has been emptied

701
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:34,315
This wouldn't have been necessary had they
carried out a surgical commando operation

702
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:42,093
To get the militant leaders.
But they allowed them to escape, all of them.

703
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,920
After the military,
the next financial beneficiary

704
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:52,705
are those who win the contracts to
conduct the rebuilding process.

705
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:56,861
In the west people, might even feel optimistic
when they hear that

706
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,414
the US is pumping tens of billions
newly created dollars into

707
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:02,411
develeping nations to build infrastructure.

708
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:06,753
But often this too doesn't seem to
achieve the publicized goals.

709
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:10,282
Is there another reason
we give these countries aid?

710
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,553
We Economic hitmen have created
the world's first truly global empire,

711
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:18,572
and we've done it primarily without the military.

712
00:54:19,245 --> 00:54:22,612
We work in many different ways
but perhaps the most common is

713
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:27,558
that we'll take a third world country
that has resources our corporations covet

714
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:30,786
like oil,
and then arrange a huge loan to that country

715
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:33,108
from the world bank
or one of its sister organisations.

716
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:35,546
However that money never goes to the country.

717
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:39,865
Instead it goes to our own corporations
to build infrastructure projects like

718
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:45,553
powerplants, highways, industrial parks,
things that benefit a few wealthy families

719
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:47,945
in that country as
well as our corporations.

720
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,824
But it doesn't help the majority of people at all.

721
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:54,749
They are too poor to buy elecricity,
or drive cars on the highway.

722
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:57,233
They don't have the skills
to get jobs in industrial parks

723
00:54:57,814 --> 00:54:59,485
but they are left holding a huge debt.

724
00:55:02,225 --> 00:55:08,843
Infrastructure which has used heavy loans
from the world bank and the IMF

725
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:17,295
and made from grounds from western countries,
they've all gone into benefitting the elite

726
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:21,893
and the feudal classes.
They have not benefitted the people.

727
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:32,481
A lot of money goes to these consultants
and companies from the west who

728
00:55:32,899 --> 00:55:37,566
charge huge amounts of money and
actually the real money on projects and

729
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,353
on ordinary people is very limited

730
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:47,504
The masses have very little already so
those landlords who have the infrastructure

731
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,543
who are going to make money because of
the infrastructure that is built through their roads

732
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,305
they will prosper,
but the ones who don't have any resources

733
00:55:56,769 --> 00:56:02,202
that do not have jobs, there isn't any
economic activity for them in terms

734
00:56:02,435 --> 00:56:06,939
of manufacturing goods so they can sell
and they could also prosper.

735
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:09,401
When you don't have that
what do they do?

736
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:13,952
They resort to joining the taliban
because they see the enemy coming in

737
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,972
and taking away what little bit they have.

738
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:21,893
President Obama I understand wants to
invest 7.5 billion dollars in

739
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:30,345
Pakistan's infrastructure
to alleviate poverty and to take away all the divisions

740
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:35,082
and all the
anti-American sentiment away over here.

741
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:38,913
Whatever his reasons are,
we can do without it.

742
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:43,836
In fact it's the worst possible thing he can do.

743
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:50,036
This kind of help is actually a hindrance
it's just going to make matters worse.

744
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,771
It will bring this contrived war on terror
into the rural areas.

745
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:01,390
How much of US foreign policy is genuinely altruistic?

746
00:57:02,203 --> 00:57:04,989
And how much is it influenced by
the banks and corporations that

747
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:07,218
profit so tremendously from it?

748
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:13,186
America's evangelism of democracy
is riddled with contradictions not least

749
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:18,573
this idea of promoting democracy
at the point of a gun or opposing regimes

750
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:21,545
which are democratic but
not in the way that America wants

751
00:57:22,102 --> 00:57:26,003
So too this idea that america have been
promoting free market capitalism has also

752
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,629
been riddled with contradictions

753
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:31,646
Because the reality is that american
firms tend to make the most money when

754
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:35,756
countries are at the cusp of change,
certainly american financial firms.

755
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:39,726
And in a sense they want the markets
to change structurally

756
00:57:40,284 --> 00:57:42,861
but not too free and too transparent

757
00:57:43,465 --> 00:57:46,205
Because they make money when
markets are a bit opaque

758
00:57:48,155 --> 00:57:51,894
Is it any wonder developed nations are
fighting in underdeveloped countries

759
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:55,214
when so many are
making so much money out of it?

760
00:57:55,702 --> 00:58:01,182
Without ever really having to face up to,
or even witness the consequences of their actions

761
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:05,826
So what if 5 million kids died in africa
because of debt last year?

762
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:10,795
"I got a bonus of a million pounds",
if I have that conversation..

763
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:16,739
I've had it with some bankers who
have been in the business a long time

764
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:21,336
they listen politely,
they're very polite, very charming,

765
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:24,727
and at the end they say
"well Tarek, it's lovely meeting you again,"

766
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:28,488
and then they get back to the office
and do another loan deal with Tanzania or something.

767
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,993
I've known a lot of "terrorists"
I've met them,

768
00:58:33,086 --> 00:58:34,038
I've interviewed them for books,

769
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:35,617
I've known them since I was an economic hitman,

770
00:58:35,756 --> 00:58:38,403
I've never met one
who wanted to be a terrorist.

771
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,143
They all want to be with their families
back on their farm

772
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,391
They're driven to terrorism
because they've lost their farm,

773
00:58:47,296 --> 00:58:50,013
it's been inundated with water
from a hydro electric project

774
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:52,451
or with oil from oil derricks.

775
00:58:52,939 --> 00:58:55,748
Their farms have been destroyed,
they can't make a living for their kids,

776
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:59,882
or in the case of the somali pirates
their fishing waters have been destroyed,

777
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:02,111
that's why they turned to this.

778
00:59:02,204 --> 00:59:05,083
It isn't because they want to be pirates or terrorist,

779
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:09,611
now there may be a few crazy people,
people with their nuts loose,

780
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:14,464
there will always be serial killers,
maybe Usama Bin Laden was one of them,

781
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:19,874
but they do not get a following
unless there is a terrible injustice going on

782
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,335
and people are starving and
they're deprived

783
00:59:22,707 --> 00:59:24,355
and then they will follow these crazy people

784
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,608
because they seem to offer an alternative

785
00:59:27,537 --> 00:59:29,139
If we want to do away with terrorism,

786
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,645
If we want to have, what we in the Unites States call
'Homeland Security,'

787
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:36,825
We have got to recognise
that the whole planet is our homeland

788
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:42,119
What does the word terrorist actually mean?

789
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:47,761
Many terrorists would sooner describe themselves
as freedom fighters

790
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:55,517
Could it be that the charge of terrorism
could just as easily be made

791
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:59,325
against western corporations,
speculators and policy-makers?

792
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:01,740
When we talk about terrorism

793
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:04,340
it means what they do to us,
not what we do to them.

794
01:00:05,037 --> 01:00:06,918
And what they do to us can be pretty ugly,

795
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:11,817
although it's a slight of a fraction of
what we do to them.

796
01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:16,206
Take say 9/11
that was a pretty serious act of terrorism,

797
01:00:16,507 --> 01:00:19,689
maybe the worst single act of terrorism in history,

798
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:21,500
but it could have been worse

799
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:25,842
Suppose for example that
Al Qaida had bombed Washington,

800
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:29,511
bombed the white house and killed the president

801
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:32,576
and installed a fresh military dictatorship,

802
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:37,080
and brought in a bunch of economists
who drove the economy into

803
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:39,124
its worst disaster in history.

804
01:00:39,588 --> 01:00:42,096
That would have been worse than 9/11?

805
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:43,884
I am not making it up,
it happened.

806
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:47,831
What's called the first 9/11,
in south america namely in Chile.

807
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:51,686
On the 11th of september in 1973

808
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:54,704
the democratically elected president of Chile

809
01:00:54,797 --> 01:00:57,305
Salvador Elende was overthrown in a coup,

810
01:00:58,745 --> 01:01:01,763
a dictarorship under
Augusto Pinochet was established

811
01:01:02,111 --> 01:01:07,336
that ruled Chile until 1990
there was the systematic suppression of

812
01:01:07,475 --> 01:01:11,330
all political dissidents,
thousands were imprisoned and murdered.

813
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:14,975
Who was involved in that first 9/11?

814
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:16,694
It's not hard to find them...

815
01:01:17,413 --> 01:01:20,478
Right in Washington and London and so on.

816
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:24,658
But that's off the agenda,
it doesn't count.

817
01:01:25,355 --> 01:01:26,934
There is this principle of ideology,

818
01:01:27,328 --> 01:01:30,300
that we must never look at our own crimes.

819
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:35,618
We should on the other hand
exalt in the crimes of others

820
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:38,126
and in our own nobility in opposing them.

821
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:45,022
The root causes of so called terrorism

822
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:48,900
will not be solved by
increasing economic inequality

823
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:53,358
If governments really are serious
about combating terrorism,

824
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:57,654
then they must start with
real structural reform back home

825
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:03,133
As long as banking empires
chase infrastructure and debt deals

826
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:06,222
in pursuit of profit,
the west will continue to

827
01:02:06,338 --> 01:02:08,497
export injustice through finance

828
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:13,025
Millions more will be displaced,
terrorism will thrive,

829
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:16,717
and neo colonialism will continue to

830
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,457
end more and more lives around the world

831
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:14,140
What's happened is that we've
moved from a relatively empty world

832
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,509
to a relatively full world.

833
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,877
That is, empty of us and all of our stuff,

834
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:21,361
is now full of us and our stuff

835
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:25,100
In my lifetime
the world population has tripled,

836
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:30,858
and the populations of other things,
of cars, houses, boats,

837
01:03:32,252 --> 01:03:34,736
all these other things
that put a load on the environment too

838
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:36,176
just like human bodies

839
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:39,241
those have vastly more than tripled,

840
01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:44,256
so the world is very very full of what we might call,
man made capital.

841
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:48,041
And it's becoming more and more empty of

842
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,897
what used to be there,
what we might call natural capital

843
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:52,639
We are the first generation,

844
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:55,472
we in the rich developed world are
the first generation that

845
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:59,164
have got to the end of the real benefits of
the economic growth

846
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:06,176
For hundreds of years
the best way of raising the real quality of human life

847
01:04:07,058 --> 01:04:09,218
has been to raise material living standards,

848
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,235
and that's what's driven the huge rises in life expectancy

849
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,671
and increases in happiness and
other measures of well being

850
01:04:17,484 --> 01:04:20,735
But all those have now come
detached from economic growth,

851
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:25,007
although life expectancy continues
to rise in the rich world

852
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:31,277
it's no longer related to the amount of
economic growth a country has at all,

853
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,645
and the same is true of measures of happiness

854
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:35,317
and the measures of well being

855
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:38,823
The paradox is the more we grow
the more poverty we create

856
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,168
Our self interested economic system

857
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:43,258
seems to be continually missing a trick

858
01:04:43,908 --> 01:04:46,254
So as we keep plundering the earth's natural capital

859
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:49,528
is it time to rethink our western definition of progress?

860
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,060
When I look at the world

861
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,707
I look at it much the way
royal Dutch Shell looks at it,

862
01:04:54,195 --> 01:04:58,049
they have one of the
best strategic entities in the world,

863
01:04:58,235 --> 01:04:59,071
private or public.

864
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:02,113
And Royal Dutch shell is posited two scenarios,

865
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:05,317
one is called blueprint and is obviously a

866
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:10,635
planned corporate structure
where the world leaders get together

867
01:05:10,913 --> 01:05:13,607
and they think about things like
energy transformation,

868
01:05:13,932 --> 01:05:17,833
planetary warming and
dwindling fossil fuels and so forth

869
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:20,503
The other is called "Scramble".

870
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:25,751
and Scramble is pretty much what it sounds like too,
it's a mess.

871
01:05:26,912 --> 01:05:28,700
Interestingly enough in 2075

872
01:05:29,048 --> 01:05:31,649
the ending year for these scenarios as I recall,

873
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:33,808
we get to about the same place.

874
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,825
It's just that blueprint leaves
a lot less blood on the floor

875
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:40,844
Scramble leaves a lot of blood on the floor

876
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:43,468
as people fight for these resources and so forth.

877
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:47,810
The reason oil companies
are drilling miles under the sea,

878
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:50,201
is that the world's easily accessible oil

879
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:52,895
has already been found and largely consumed

880
01:05:55,472 --> 01:05:57,260
Not only are our oil supplies dwindling

881
01:05:57,655 --> 01:06:00,674
Major new metals' discoveries are
becoming increasingly rare

882
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,828
40% of the world's agricultural land
is seriously degraded,

883
01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:10,217
and ever more volatile yields
continue to be unevenly distributed

884
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,327
It may be that the looming environmental threat

885
01:06:14,629 --> 01:06:15,906
is not global warming,

886
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:18,344
but the exhaustion of the world's resources.

887
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:23,592
We are going to have struggles for

888
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:26,912
finding land sufficient to grow
the agricultural products

889
01:06:27,051 --> 01:06:28,932
for what the UN says

890
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:31,765
is going to be a 9 billion earth population.

891
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:33,716
We are going to struggle over

892
01:06:34,226 --> 01:06:36,363
non renewable fossil fuels as they run out

893
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,660
I think shell posit's about 2075 they'll be gone,

894
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:42,911
and we're going to struggle over things like water

895
01:06:43,073 --> 01:06:45,117
and other precious resources that are necessary to

896
01:06:45,326 --> 01:06:46,579
our life and to our economy

897
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,505
This could be as shell says,

898
01:06:49,853 --> 01:06:55,682
a blueprint affair with world leaders
working together to share and share alike

899
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,423
or it could be a real mess,

900
01:06:57,632 --> 01:06:59,443
and shell incidentally bets on the mess

901
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:05,364
Just like the babyboomers' failure
to look to the next generation,

902
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:09,730
our outdated competitive mentality
for a world of depleted resources

903
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,400
could have devastating consequences.

904
01:07:13,724 --> 01:07:17,834
Our economic setup encourages
one upmanship, competition, and comparison

905
01:07:18,553 --> 01:07:18,878
where as

906
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:20,875
the progress the humans have made over millenia

907
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:23,499
has been largely based on co-operation.

908
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:27,981
In any species, in almost any animal,

909
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:33,228
there is always the potential for huge conflict,

910
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,550
because within any species

911
01:07:36,618 --> 01:07:39,033
all members of that species have the same needs

912
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:41,820
so they might fight each other for food and shelter

913
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:45,581
and nest-sites and territory and sexual partners

914
01:07:45,906 --> 01:07:46,998
and all that kind of things.

915
01:07:48,554 --> 01:07:50,922
But human beings have always had the other possibility

916
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:54,985
We have the possibility to be the best source of support

917
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:57,609
and love and assistance and cooperation.

918
01:07:58,422 --> 01:08:00,140
Much more so than any other animal

919
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:03,554
And so other people can be the best or the worst

920
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:08,244
You can be my worst rival
or my best source of support

921
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:11,959
In a progressive society

922
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:15,373
to meet our common economic, social and cultural needs

923
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:18,577
we must move from globalization to localization

924
01:08:19,459 --> 01:08:21,781
The benefits of a communal sense of fellowship,

925
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:25,450
responsibility and purpose in a life driven by production,

926
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:28,840
not consumption would lead to
happiness and satisfaction.

927
01:08:29,722 --> 01:08:30,675
Indeed we must ask;

928
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,925
Have our modern consumerist lifestyles made us happy?

929
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,012
I think if one had been living in the 19th century

930
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:40,334
and somebody told you that a 100 years later

931
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:45,442
people were going to be living in this
extraordinary wealth and comfort

932
01:08:46,348 --> 01:08:47,346
with central heating,

933
01:08:47,602 --> 01:08:51,689
being able to throw away such a
high proportion of our food as we do,

934
01:08:52,153 --> 01:08:56,751
we'd imagine that we'd be living in
a state of extraordinary social harmony

935
01:08:57,168 --> 01:08:59,583
and everything would be rosy.

936
01:09:00,326 --> 01:09:01,998
It's really quite remarkable

937
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:06,456
the contrast between, if you like,
the material success of our societies

938
01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:08,244
and the social failure.

939
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:13,051
The growth economy demands that
we make consumption a way of life

940
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:16,813
He who dies with the most toys became the ambition,

941
01:09:17,138 --> 01:09:19,994
and retail replaced spiritual satisfaction

942
01:09:20,992 --> 01:09:25,520
Unsurprisingly, sales of anti-depressants skyrocketed.

943
01:09:27,587 --> 01:09:31,720
The fact is that the world economy
over the last few years,

944
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:33,972
a good share of my lifetime has been built either on

945
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:38,268
the military or on producing items
that most people don't need,

946
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:40,404
and really don't even want.

947
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:47,347
Consumerism is driven by an extraordinarily social nature

948
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,783
that we want to have the stuff

949
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:53,012
so that we look good in other people's eyes.

950
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,751
It's because I experience myself
through other people's eyes

951
01:09:57,262 --> 01:09:58,910
the feelings of shame and embarrasment

952
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:03,856
or pride and maybe feeling envied;
all those things.

953
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:09,661
The goods are just a way of mediating the relationship

954
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,934
between yourself and others in this
extraordinarily alienated hierarchy

955
01:10:14,561 --> 01:10:17,811
What has really suffered is human relationships,

956
01:10:18,044 --> 01:10:20,621
family life, the things that really matter to us,

957
01:10:20,969 --> 01:10:21,619
and in the end

958
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:24,336
the only thing that makes
human beings happy isn't money

959
01:10:24,476 --> 01:10:29,328
it's very clear that past a certain level
you only get marginal gains from wealth

960
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:31,511
What really makes us happy is other people,

961
01:10:31,883 --> 01:10:33,276
it's our relationship with other people that

962
01:10:33,485 --> 01:10:35,644
has really been damaged by the last 30 years

963
01:10:35,993 --> 01:10:36,875
We trust them less,

964
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,663
we have less interaction with them,

965
01:10:39,058 --> 01:10:40,590
we bond less than ever before,

966
01:10:41,147 --> 01:10:44,677
we marry less and marriage is under
more threat than ever before

967
01:10:45,188 --> 01:10:48,021
and all the associations that represent

968
01:10:48,322 --> 01:10:51,086
sort of permanent unconditioned human affection

969
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,966
are being eroded or damaged.

970
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:55,381
And that's the real legacy of the last 30 years

971
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:59,305
in some sense we've got to
recover and rehumanise our lives

972
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:05,482
otherwise not only will they be nasty,
brutish and short, but we'll be lonely

973
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:09,429
The west is coming to the realization

974
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,541
that its human project is failing

975
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,093
the west was so convinced that

976
01:11:16,256 --> 01:11:19,066
if you push people to achieve as individuals

977
01:11:20,157 --> 01:11:23,338
the accumulated achievement of individuals

978
01:11:24,081 --> 01:11:26,124
would make for a successfull society

979
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,445
And what the west is now beginning to realize

980
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:32,928
is that the individual achievement

981
01:11:33,694 --> 01:11:39,778
without incorporating the vulnerable community
is a myth.

982
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,239
The idea was, make your own life,

983
01:11:43,052 --> 01:11:44,468
be individually aspiring,

984
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:46,279
and then you'll be individually achieving,

985
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:48,462
and then you'll be individually prosperous,

986
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,250
and then you'll be individually happy.

987
01:11:51,945 --> 01:11:54,824
You end up doing that in a glass jar

988
01:11:56,009 --> 01:11:58,586
and the glass jar has a limited height

989
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:01,094
and it is encapsulating

990
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:05,366
and in the end you die of lack of oxygen

991
01:12:07,363 --> 01:12:10,916
Human beings are alive because they seek attachment

992
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:14,445
and because they are propelled by affection

993
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:20,738
so the isolated achieving individual in the end implodes.

994
01:12:22,317 --> 01:12:25,451
In order to find a purpose in life
it has to be outside yourself

995
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:30,815
It matters not how you're constructed outside yourself

996
01:12:30,955 --> 01:12:32,789
as long as it is a positive value

997
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:34,739
added to the society pursuit

998
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,410
But it has to be outside yourself,
it can't be yourself,

999
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:42,495
if you're pursuing yourself
you're pursuing the abyss as Nietzsche said

1000
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:45,769
You're going to wind up in the abyss.

1001
01:13:45,305 --> 01:13:48,602
One of the most powerful cultural frameworks

1002
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:53,455
that shapes the way we think today in the west
is the hollywood film construction.

1003
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:57,588
and it follows a particular cultural pattern

1004
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,839
in that there's a beginning,
there's a middle and an end

1005
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:03,788
There is drama, tension, there's resolution,

1006
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:05,715
there's usually a goodie and a baddie

1007
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:08,571
and it's usually a story told for the
medium of human beings

1008
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:14,376
This Hollywoodisation of the way
that people communicate

1009
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,697
and the way they tell stories about themselves

1010
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,695
and view their recent history

1011
01:14:19,276 --> 01:14:22,526
has very much impacted how we look at
the financial crisis

1012
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,290
in that people look at the beginning

1013
01:14:25,684 --> 01:14:26,660
and the middle and the end,

1014
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,215
they look at the drama around the Lehman Brothers

1015
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:30,328
and they want to see a resolution

1016
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:31,582
and they wanted baddies

1017
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:33,626
they wanted sacrificial victims as well

1018
01:14:34,322 --> 01:14:36,273
so people have focused on a few individuals

1019
01:14:36,923 --> 01:14:39,825
The idea that somehow it
wasn't just one or two individuals

1020
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:40,963
who were the root of the problem,

1021
01:14:41,637 --> 01:14:42,844
it was a systemic problem,

1022
01:14:43,285 --> 01:14:46,118
that actually almost everyone who participated

1023
01:14:46,327 --> 01:14:47,163
was in some way guilty

1024
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:50,274
either of outright negligence or

1025
01:14:50,414 --> 01:14:52,503
simply failing to ask the right questions

1026
01:14:52,782 --> 01:14:53,595
or simply failing to ask

1027
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:55,568
why money was so cheap for so many years

1028
01:14:56,265 --> 01:14:57,983
The idea that it was a systemic flaw

1029
01:14:58,355 --> 01:15:00,189
is something which is very hard for people to grasp

1030
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,929
and even harder to depict as a good story

1031
01:15:04,276 --> 01:15:06,389
Perhaps there's this feeling of helplessness

1032
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,035
because we don't understand
what the real problem actually is.

1033
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:12,589
Cleansing a few bad apples

1034
01:15:12,844 --> 01:15:16,211
will not rectify the flaws at the heart
of the western economic system

1035
01:15:17,256 --> 01:15:19,090
a system that should be protecting people

1036
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:21,064
is in fact the very thing

1037
01:15:21,412 --> 01:15:24,524
that is enabling our four horsemen
to ride with such vengeance

1038
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:27,008
The modern day Four Horsemen

1039
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:31,908
our rapacious financial system,
escalating organised violence,

1040
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,183
abject poverty for billions,

1041
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,807
and the exhaustion of the earth's resources

1042
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:40,453
are riding roughshod over those who can least afford it

1043
01:15:41,196 --> 01:15:42,124
They gallop unchallenged

1044
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,934
because the cognitive map
that has been put in place by

1045
01:15:45,143 --> 01:15:47,140
our schools and universities and our media

1046
01:15:47,883 --> 01:15:50,507
does not encourage us to question accepted norms.

1047
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,478
Instead there is apathy.

1048
01:15:54,872 --> 01:15:57,101
In a sense i think we're a rather depressed society,

1049
01:15:57,543 --> 01:16:01,211
we've got used to the idea that
there's nothing that can be done,

1050
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,558
there is no alternative.

1051
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:06,552
That we're never gonna deal
with these environmental problems

1052
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,385
and we live in a dog eat dog society
and that's it.

1053
01:16:10,755 --> 01:16:13,820
I think what we have to take away from this
is a recognition

1054
01:16:15,956 --> 01:16:19,393
that most of these problems
can be very substantially improved

1055
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:22,040
by making our societies more equal,

1056
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:23,642
reducing the income differences,

1057
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:28,123
and that also helps us to solve
the environmental problems

1058
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:32,163
we can reach a society that is
qualitatively better for all of us

1059
01:16:33,324 --> 01:16:35,345
All the apathy is sort of engineered

1060
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,688
because we don't have any discussion of this
in the public media

1061
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:41,591
hardly by surprise,
the public media are owned by

1062
01:16:41,753 --> 01:16:43,681
the real estate and the financial interests

1063
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,467
and they're not going to explain to people

1064
01:16:46,839 --> 01:16:52,899
the integration between the financial,
insurance and real estate sectors the F.I.RE-sector

1065
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:55,500
There's this disinformation going on

1066
01:16:56,521 --> 01:16:57,682
passing the buck

1067
01:16:57,984 --> 01:17:01,188
denying what the real driving factors are

1068
01:17:02,373 --> 01:17:03,743
All of these are common strategies

1069
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,877
in fact even in education
you can see that banks have helped to

1070
01:17:06,993 --> 01:17:08,874
set up universities, they funded them.

1071
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,798
They fund think tanks,
they have educational foundations,

1072
01:17:13,147 --> 01:17:14,261
they own newspapers.

1073
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:19,137
All of this stuff is going on as a
kind of propaganda excercise

1074
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,156
so that the people
don't actually work out what the problem is.

1075
01:17:22,295 --> 01:17:26,823
You should not assume
because you don't have a background in economics or in law,

1076
01:17:26,963 --> 01:17:28,843
that these issues are too complex for you

1077
01:17:29,192 --> 01:17:30,353
They're not complex at all,

1078
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:31,165
it's very simple,

1079
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:35,275
it's about power and it's about democracy

1080
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:38,549
and you understand that just as well as I do.

1081
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:41,382
One source of this disinformation

1082
01:17:41,707 --> 01:17:43,843
is the neoclassical school of economics

1083
01:17:44,679 --> 01:17:47,396
These economists and academics
have been successful in

1084
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,602
convincing the world that their models were gospel

1085
01:17:50,484 --> 01:17:54,176
but just as Gutenberg's
printing press was revolutionary in the 16th century,

1086
01:17:54,827 --> 01:17:57,241
today we're at the dawn of
internet enlightenment

1087
01:17:57,566 --> 01:18:01,909
which will remove the cloud of ignorance upheld
by academic and media gatekeepers.

1088
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:05,229
Education can be a form of mass mind control,

1089
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,875
and it's astonishing that today neo classical economics

1090
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:11,777
continues to be taught in all ivy league universities

1091
01:18:14,912 --> 01:18:20,345
I do get letters from students
in economics departments

1092
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:21,738
at other universities

1093
01:18:22,946 --> 01:18:25,848
they're in to some graduate program
or something

1094
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,239
and they say;
"You know I just read such and such that you wrote"

1095
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:31,769
This is the kind of thing that interests me,

1096
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:34,649
"I am stuck in this program here in which"

1097
01:18:35,415 --> 01:18:39,641
"I can't even talk about any of that,
what is your advise?"

1098
01:18:39,804 --> 01:18:40,570
"What should I do?"

1099
01:18:41,615 --> 01:18:44,587
What they're teaching you
is what you're going have to oppose

1100
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:52,087
A lot of it, well some of it is useful,
so go ahead and learn it.

1101
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,386
and the other reason for learning the rest of it, is...

1102
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:55,454
Know your enemy.

1103
01:18:56,801 --> 01:18:59,355
An individual might not be able to change the system

1104
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:02,420
but they can change themselves

1105
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:04,974
If we're not offered proper education,

1106
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:06,576
we must begin our own

1107
01:19:07,273 --> 01:19:08,271
and a good place to start

1108
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:11,476
is to become re-aquainted with the classical economists

1109
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:14,425
and with something that so few question,

1110
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:16,096
but that affects us all,

1111
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:17,490
our system of money

1112
01:19:18,813 --> 01:19:22,900
If the monetary system of the world is not reformed

1113
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:30,052
then we're heading towards the end
of industrial civilization

1114
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:33,070
I won't say that we're going to the end of humanity,

1115
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:40,477
but it's just going to be an absolute
collapse of our world as we have known it

1116
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:43,380
Because it can't function on FIAT money.

1117
01:19:46,306 --> 01:19:48,976
None of those who are responsible for this

1118
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:51,298
want to admit it, but that is the fact

1119
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:55,152
The FIAT system of money is a man made law,

1120
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:56,940
and it has been abused.

1121
01:19:58,612 --> 01:20:01,816
Is there a form of money
whose law is not set by man?

1122
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,948
When you look at natural law and gold,

1123
01:20:07,505 --> 01:20:10,408
I sort of describe gold as being a natural form of money

1124
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:12,846
All of the gold that has been mined throughout history,

1125
01:20:13,148 --> 01:20:18,279
still exists in its above ground stock
it's about the size of 2 and a half olympic swimming pools

1126
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:20,207
if you put all that gold together in one place

1127
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,852
The key is this that this above ground stock of gold

1128
01:20:24,038 --> 01:20:27,405
grows by about 1.75 percent per annum

1129
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,470
which is approximately equal to
new world population growth

1130
01:20:31,004 --> 01:20:33,210
and is approximately equal to new wealth creation

1131
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:36,205
So the net result of this is that

1132
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:41,917
you have this very good consistency in
gold's purchasing power over long periods of time

1133
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:44,982
because the supply demand equation
is very much in balance

1134
01:20:46,027 --> 01:20:49,394
To achieve human liberty
you really need to have sound money

1135
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:51,321
and gold is the only way to do that

1136
01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:54,363
because only gold is outside of
the control of politicians

1137
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,357
With modern man made monetary processes

1138
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:02,351
a chronic excess of debt
is built up at every level of society

1139
01:21:03,512 --> 01:21:05,137
debt is now regarded as normal...

1140
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:06,159
..it isn't.

1141
01:21:06,577 --> 01:21:07,970
It's a form of slavery!

1142
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:10,176
But how much do we question our debt?

1143
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:12,800
and what should we now do about it?

1144
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:17,096
The classic example,
most recently of a debt cancellation

1145
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:20,695
was the German economic miracle in 1947

1146
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:26,662
The Allies cancelled all domestic and
international german debts

1147
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:30,308
except for the debts that
employers owed their employees

1148
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:31,631
for the previous few weeks.

1149
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:34,720
And except for a basic working balance that everybody

1150
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:36,740
was able to keep in the bank

1151
01:21:36,856 --> 01:21:40,339
in order to buy food for the next few weeks or so.

1152
01:21:41,593 --> 01:21:44,960
Essentially you would follow the five or six pages

1153
01:21:45,122 --> 01:21:49,023
that the currency reform of 1947 did in germany.

1154
01:21:49,464 --> 01:21:51,113
You would start with a clean slate,

1155
01:21:51,554 --> 01:21:54,573
that means that everybody would own
their own property free and clear.

1156
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,105
And the problem here is

1157
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:59,518
that you would wipe off the savings
that are the counterparts of that

1158
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:02,282
That actually would not be such a bad thing

1159
01:22:02,444 --> 01:22:06,717
if you look at the fact that the
wealthiest 1% of the Americans

1160
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:10,989
have concentrated an enormous
amount of wealth in their own hands,

1161
01:22:11,477 --> 01:22:14,286
more than at any earlier time
since statistics have been kept.

1162
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:18,373
Our system of taxation also needs addressing

1163
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:21,090
currently we're taxed on what we produce

1164
01:22:21,902 --> 01:22:24,759
perhaps it would be more progressive
to tax what we consume

1165
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,542
How many american people realise that
the founding fathers never intended

1166
01:22:29,704 --> 01:22:31,678
for americans to be taxed on their labour

1167
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,534
in other words they weren't meant to pay income tax

1168
01:22:35,393 --> 01:22:37,460
The tax system that was exported from britain,

1169
01:22:37,785 --> 01:22:40,339
a relic of colonialism, has duped the world.

1170
01:22:42,893 --> 01:22:45,517
The most important element of a tax system

1171
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:51,020
is to do what everybody expected
to be done in the 19th century

1172
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,921
and that is to base the tax system on land taxation,

1173
01:22:55,223 --> 01:22:57,336
on the free lunch of land value

1174
01:22:57,731 --> 01:22:59,635
and on what John Stewart Mill called

1175
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:01,075
the unearned increment

1176
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:05,231
The income that landlords made
in their sleep as he put it.

1177
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:12,313
Who made oil in the ground? Coal or iron ore?

1178
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:16,585
These are things which are not
the product of human effort

1179
01:23:17,654 --> 01:23:20,765
Of course extracting them is,
but their existence is not

1180
01:23:21,856 --> 01:23:28,776
and so the rents from natural resources
are a wonderful source of taxation

1181
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:31,051
nobody made them so,

1182
01:23:31,818 --> 01:23:36,415
and when you do tax them,
you cause all of us to use them more efficiently

1183
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,945
so this seems like to be an excellent thing to tax

1184
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:43,288
rather than labour and capital

1185
01:23:44,682 --> 01:23:49,279
If the governments used this land site value
that is supplied by nature,

1186
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:50,974
not by human labour.

1187
01:23:51,508 --> 01:23:53,041
not by a personal enterprise

1188
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:58,753
then the government would not have to tax
wages in the form of income tax

1189
01:23:59,357 --> 01:24:03,327
it wouldn't have to employ sales tax
that add to the price of doing bussiness

1190
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:07,205
and it wouldn't have to add the
proliferation of business taxes

1191
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:14,101
This tax system advocated by all of
the classical economists

1192
01:24:14,659 --> 01:24:16,563
would begin to address global poverty

1193
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:19,628
as it would allow citizens in developing countries

1194
01:24:19,813 --> 01:24:21,114
to keep their resource wealth

1195
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:21,579
In developed countries
it would begin to address

1196
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:25,990
our housing and debt crisis

1197
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:30,495
and unleash the kind of entrepeneurship
needed to refloat our economies

1198
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:36,044
perhaps we should also resurrect
another timeless principle for workers

1199
01:24:36,532 --> 01:24:38,738
that was promoted during the industrial revolution

1200
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:43,475
The idea that people who work in a plant
ought to own it

1201
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,467
is just deeply built in to working class culture

1202
01:24:49,326 --> 01:24:51,880
so right around here at the early industrial revolution

1203
01:24:52,182 --> 01:24:56,338
in the late 19th century, the working people
simply took for granted

1204
01:24:57,128 --> 01:25:00,936
that yes of course the workers
should own the mills in which they work

1205
01:25:01,377 --> 01:25:05,859
anything else is an
attack on their fundamental rights as free citizens

1206
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:12,337
They also took for granted
that wage labour is hardly different from slavery

1207
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:15,495
it's different only because it's temporary

1208
01:25:16,168 --> 01:25:17,004
then you can be free

1209
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,930
one of the ways to be free is by owning your own plant

1210
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:22,948
That was not an exotic view,
that was Abraham Lincoln's view

1211
01:25:23,668 --> 01:25:23,854
In fact,

1212
01:25:23,924 --> 01:25:28,870
it was a principle of the republican party
in the late 19th century

1213
01:25:29,427 --> 01:25:32,515
It has taken a lot of effort
to drive these ideas out of people's heads

1214
01:25:33,165 --> 01:25:35,557
but they're still there and they are very relevant

1215
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:40,201
It was the greek philosopher Plato
who said the ratio of earnings

1216
01:25:40,363 --> 01:25:43,475
between the highest and the lowest paid employee
in any organisation

1217
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,704
should be no more than 6 to 1

1218
01:25:46,795 --> 01:25:51,950
In 1923, banker J.P. Morgan declared
no more than 20 to 1 was optimum

1219
01:25:52,763 --> 01:25:54,458
Yet today's salary difference between

1220
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:56,873
the top and bottom earners in global corporations

1221
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,588
can be higher than 500:1 or a 1000:1

1222
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:05,186
When you're up in the range of 500:1 inequality

1223
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,854
the rich and the poor become almost different species

1224
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:12,012
no longer members of the same community

1225
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:15,008
Commonality of interest is lost

1226
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:19,303
and so it's difficult to form community

1227
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:23,808
and to have good friendly relationships across

1228
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:26,432
class differences that are that large

1229
01:26:29,427 --> 01:26:32,585
When the public do vent their outrage
at inappropriate earnings

1230
01:26:33,212 --> 01:26:36,416
the common defence is to move the debate to
the psychological realm

1231
01:26:36,765 --> 01:26:39,644
and quote Mecurial British economist Herbert Spencer

1232
01:26:40,433 --> 01:26:42,570
He coined the phrase; survival of the fittest.

1233
01:26:42,918 --> 01:26:45,681
And his words are now used to justify excess

1234
01:26:48,212 --> 01:26:50,093
Competition in business is a good thing

1235
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,368
but the playing field must be level.

1236
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,248
Monopolists have too much because

1237
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,989
the system they game is rigged

1238
01:26:57,663 --> 01:26:59,033
Under the current economic setup

1239
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:03,607
the fitnes of the vast majority of the world's population
is irrelevant.

1240
01:27:05,256 --> 01:27:07,183
Those that are made to pay for this crisis

1241
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:09,273
are not those that caused it

1242
01:27:10,805 --> 01:27:13,011
But those who caused it for survival

1243
01:27:13,406 --> 01:27:16,703
will no doubt try to marginalize this film as socialist

1244
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:18,096
or even marxist

1245
01:27:20,465 --> 01:27:22,949
I'm a capitalist, I am a businessperson

1246
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,084
I believe in the basic principles

1247
01:27:27,082 --> 01:27:29,613
that's why I am completely appalled by seeing

1248
01:27:29,729 --> 01:27:33,143
these principles destroyed by monarchs, monopolists

1249
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:37,787
who are totally destroying the system
from within, on Wall Street

1250
01:27:38,228 --> 01:27:41,200
And this is completely unacceptable

1251
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:43,476
I'm a capitalist, I think capitalism can do it

1252
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:46,099
It's not a question of getting rid of the capitalism

1253
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:49,768
It's a question of getting rid of this terrible
form of capitalism

1254
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:54,714
Capitalism, more broadly understood as
market economy

1255
01:27:56,316 --> 01:27:57,291
not only has a future

1256
01:27:57,431 --> 01:27:59,335
I can't see any other future in the world without it

1257
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:03,166
But the question is; what kind of capitalism?

1258
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,442
What kind of market economy?

1259
01:28:06,835 --> 01:28:10,689
A system of reformed capitalism,
built on independent money

1260
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,033
a tax system based on consumption, not income

1261
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:16,378
and employee owned businesses

1262
01:28:16,587 --> 01:28:19,374
would begin to build an economy
that's not dependent on

1263
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,696
constant growth to service its debt

1264
01:28:22,857 --> 01:28:25,573
We've endured the so called free market for centuries

1265
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,498
but far from being free,
it has led us to destroy nature and

1266
01:28:29,892 --> 01:28:32,493
each other in a vain attempt to progress.

1267
01:28:34,234 --> 01:28:36,905
It's absolutely ludicrous to suggest

1268
01:28:37,299 --> 01:28:41,177
that some of these scientifically
defined boundaries of the market

1269
01:28:41,386 --> 01:28:42,849
that we should never change

1270
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:46,471
and then scientists of the free market economy
wants you to believe

1271
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,861
Once that they convince you of that

1272
01:28:50,303 --> 01:28:54,041
and claim that they have the truth

1273
01:28:54,482 --> 01:28:57,315
because they are PHDs in economics,

1274
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,682
then they can tell you whatever they want

1275
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:02,377
And then you'll have to accept it

1276
01:29:03,074 --> 01:29:06,348
But that's the way that we have to take these guys on

1277
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:10,295
Politics is about drawing the boundary of the market

1278
01:29:11,897 --> 01:29:13,174
When you think about it

1279
01:29:13,732 --> 01:29:15,125
all other things have been taken

1280
01:29:15,427 --> 01:29:18,190
out of the market over the last 2 or 3 centuries

1281
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:22,485
2 or 3 centuries ago you could
buy and sell human beings

1282
01:29:22,927 --> 01:29:24,297
child labour

1283
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:28,523
a lot of things that you
didn't imagine you could buy and sell today

1284
01:29:28,987 --> 01:29:31,843
So over time we have redrawn this boundary

1285
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:34,560
and there's nothing wrong in
redrawing the boundaries again

1286
01:29:35,047 --> 01:29:37,927
Things that were considered
absolutely reasonable in the 1850s like

1287
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:41,944
selling any chemical on the street-corner

1288
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,637
telling you it's a pharmaceutical drug
and it would be good for you

1289
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,332
things like that were absolutely common place then

1290
01:29:46,402 --> 01:29:48,306
are now serious criminal offences

1291
01:29:48,538 --> 01:29:49,328
The same thing would be true of

1292
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,000
active money management in a hundred years

1293
01:29:52,811 --> 01:29:54,645
The breakdown we saw in the great depression

1294
01:29:54,947 --> 01:29:57,524
and wittnessed again at the
beginning of the 21st century

1295
01:29:58,175 --> 01:29:59,591
occured because in the name of growth,

1296
01:30:00,055 --> 01:30:03,469
much was taken out of the system
by those who contribute very little

1297
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,860
Multinational corporates and banks

1298
01:30:06,255 --> 01:30:08,740
will always want to grow without having to compensate

1299
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:12,107
those people who actually
do the work to produce the surplus

1300
01:30:13,012 --> 01:30:15,497
In the past, everytime too much was taken

1301
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:17,168
by those who contributed little

1302
01:30:17,772 --> 01:30:19,235
People rose up to halt

1303
01:30:19,305 --> 01:30:22,463
the violent practices enacted by a tangible enemy

1304
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,274
Today the question is

1305
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:27,617
with such a formless enemy pervading every element of

1306
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,333
our economic and democratic process,
can it be done again?

1307
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:33,748
Of course it can be done again, it's a cycle

1308
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:36,000
I mean we're not debt peons

1309
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,183
we're maybe rats running around in a little wheel

1310
01:30:38,322 --> 01:30:40,458
in somebody's big cage somewhere

1311
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,800
The finance rises, finance becomes organised,

1312
01:30:44,963 --> 01:30:46,356
you make a lot of money in banking,

1313
01:30:46,565 --> 01:30:47,958
it's easy to go out and buy politicians

1314
01:30:49,096 --> 01:30:50,071
but the essence of democracy,

1315
01:30:50,234 --> 01:30:51,534
the essence of american democracy,

1316
01:30:51,929 --> 01:30:55,156
is a repeated confrontation,
a repeated showdown

1317
01:30:55,644 --> 01:30:58,152
and in the 1830s Andrew Jackson
beat the second bank in the USA

1318
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:02,796
in the early 1900s Teddy Roosevelt
beat JP Morgan and J Rockefeller

1319
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:07,834
In the 1930s Franklin D Roosevelt
beat everyone from Wall Street

1320
01:31:07,997 --> 01:31:09,994
and now we have to do it again!

1321
01:31:10,946 --> 01:31:14,057
The one single thing that makes me optimistic

1322
01:31:14,429 --> 01:31:13,153
rather than cynical, pessimistic,
are my students.

1323
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:22,788
First I do not see the desire to
go to Wall Street amongst them

1324
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:23,879
I see the opposite

1325
01:31:25,203 --> 01:31:30,358
Second I see a disdain amongst them
for people who are motivated

1326
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,285
not just that they do not want money

1327
01:31:32,424 --> 01:31:36,000
I see a disdain amongst them
for people who do just want money

1328
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:42,293
The crises we face today are created by humans,

1329
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,028
and what is created by humans
can be changed by humans

1330
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:53,346
So we are all capable of transforming our world

1331
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,664
Revolutions are philosophical,

1332
01:31:58,593 --> 01:32:02,471
getting organised in preventing the culprits
camouflaging the real problem

1333
01:32:03,028 --> 01:32:05,861
means it's possible to embark on a bloodless revolution

1334
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,483
against the voilent organisations and barbaric leaders

1335
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:10,807
who've trashed the economy

1336
01:32:11,945 --> 01:32:12,688
Central banking,

1337
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:14,035
rigged capitalism,

1338
01:32:14,661 --> 01:32:15,637
land speculation,

1339
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:18,423
income tax and neo-classical economics

1340
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:20,420
have corporatized democracy,

1341
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:21,790
stunted progress,

1342
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:24,042
perverted the course of human destiny

1343
01:32:24,553 --> 01:32:26,573
and compromised the future of this planet

1344
01:32:27,177 --> 01:32:28,477
If these issues aren't addressed

1345
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:31,751
then the next implosion will be on a scale unimagined

1346
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,443
Whatever the propaganda

1347
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:41,504
at the beginning of the 21st century
central banks unregulated cheap money,

1348
01:32:42,038 --> 01:32:44,383
pumped up land values which created

1349
01:32:44,638 --> 01:32:46,357
an unsustainable asset bubble

1350
01:32:46,891 --> 01:32:48,841
in a world which once again operates

1351
01:32:49,073 --> 01:32:52,603
a rigged tax system that enriches entrenched privilege

1352
01:32:56,481 --> 01:33:00,033
Neo classical economics have ruined
life for the bottom billions

1353
01:33:00,939 --> 01:33:03,632
tempted everyone into inter-generational conflict

1354
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:07,185
and created massive suffering that has no limits

1355
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:12,758
Human beings go mad in crowds

1356
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:16,357
and come to their senses slowly and individually

1357
01:33:18,702 --> 01:33:20,722
History is littered with examples of people

1358
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:23,114
who threw themselves
off the yoke of oppression

1359
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:27,920
to adopt radical change,
only to end up with popular new rulers

1360
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,755
that maintained the status quo

1361
01:33:31,102 --> 01:33:34,701
To really understand something is to be liberated from it

1362
01:33:36,651 --> 01:33:40,831
Dedicating oneself to a great cause,
taking responsibility,

1363
01:33:41,527 --> 01:33:44,662
and gaining self knowledge is the essence of being human

1364
01:33:45,986 --> 01:33:50,653
A predatory capitalist's truest enemy
and humanity's greatest ally

1365
01:33:51,396 --> 01:33:56,086
is the self educated individual
who has read, understood,

1366
01:33:56,992 --> 01:33:58,478
delays their gratification,

1367
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,611
and walks around
with their eyes wide open.
