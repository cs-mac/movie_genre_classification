1
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:52,383
Four turtles...

2
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,562
four brothers...

3
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,737
genetically reborn
in the sewers of New York.

4
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:06,948
Named after the great
Renaissance masters...

5
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:09,752
and trained as ninjas.

6
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:19,261
They battled many creatures and foes
before defeating their archenemy...

7
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,655
 the Shredder.

8
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:30,143
But now a greater evil is poised
to destroy their very brotherhood.

9
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,937
An evil born 3000 years ago.

10
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,296
It was in that time
that a warrior king named Yoatl...

11
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:50,853
Ied a brotherhood that fought
side by side with one purpose:

12
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,991
To conquer all the kingdoms
of the world.

13
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,949
Nothing could stand in their way...

14
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:07,466
as they left a trail of destruction
behind them.

15
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:25,745
In his quest,
the warrior learned of a constellation...

16
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,713
known as the Stars of Kikan.

17
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,470
Every 3000 years,
the stars would align...

18
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:37,045
opening a portal
to a world of unknown power.

19
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:42,196
He became immortal...but at a price.

20
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,573
His brotherhood was turned to stone.

21
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,785
And upon the portal's opening...

22
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:58,817
 1 3 monsters were released
into our world.

23
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:29,356
The warrior king was left
to eternally walk the Earth...

24
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:34,471
unable to die
or forget his horrible mistake.

25
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,963
And the monsters
that were unleashed...

26
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:51,906
continue to plague mankind
to this very day.

27
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,002
Monsters.

28
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:19,421
No.

29
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,779
We appreciate the generous donation...

30
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,502
for the continued protection
of your village.

31
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:33,231
After all, the jungle
can be a very dangerous place.

32
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,618
-Mama!
-Oh, she is dangerous.

33
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,672
There's monsters out there.

34
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,035
Watch where you're going.

35
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:05,122
There's a log on the road, señor.

36
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,986
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it.

37
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,966
Who are you? Show yourself.

38
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:32,436
The ghost of the jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.

39
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:33,870
He's coming.

40
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,513
I just remembered I left the stove on.
My wife hates that.

41
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,606
-Coward. Get back here.
-You're on your own, jefe.

42
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,679
Show yourself.
Do you realize who you're dealing with?

43
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:54,133
What is this... ? What?

44
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,782
I am not afraid of a myth.

45
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,865
I'm not afraid of a ghost.

46
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,601
What are you?

47
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,641
It's a miracle.

48
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,538
The ghost of the jungle.

49
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,645
There. That's where I saw him.

50
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,792
Thank you.

51
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,965
You'd better get home now.

52
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,284
Do you know the ghost?

53
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,992
He wasn't always a ghost.

54
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:30,102
Hello?

55
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,487
Is anyone here?

56
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,107
Hello?

57
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:50,493
It's a long way from the city
to just drop in.

58
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,822
Leo.

59
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,014
You came all the way down here
to look for me?

60
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,072
Actually, I was already here
on business.

61
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,617
But then the local legend
started sounding familiar...

62
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,209
so I decided to snoop around.

63
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:09,231
-What kind of business?
-Ancient artifacts.

64
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,592
Some tycoon with too much time
on his hands...

65
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,433
has his heart set on a collection
of 3000-year-old statues.

66
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,413
Well, you always did run
with a strange crowd, April.

67
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:21,832
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.

68
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,480
Things aren't looking so good
back home.

69
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,267
How bad could it be?

70
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,369
Donnie's probably got everything
under control.

71
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,004
Sir? Sir. Sir.

72
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:35,922
Did you turn the computer on?
Have you plugged it in?

73
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,528
Yeah, that would help.

74
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:39,112
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

75
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,718
I'm telling you, sir,
it's not that kind of phone line.

76
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:45,179
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly lT tech support...

77
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:47,624
here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.

78
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,890
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.

79
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:55,372
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?

80
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,743
At least he's keeping busy.

81
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,823
Well, if he's doing that,
who's keeping an eye on Mikey?

82
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:03,867
Mike's gotten into
the entertainment business.

83
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:10,985
Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.

84
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,451
Take it easy, little dudes.
I bruise easily.

85
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,391
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green,
dudes. Hey, that's...

86
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:20,887
He's a big hit.

87
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,127
All right. Let's hear it.
What's Raph doing?

88
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,729
No one really knows.
He just sleeps all day.

89
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,796
Well, what's he do all night?

90
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,798
2802, 2802, burglary in progress
at 55th and Broadway.

91
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,653
Suspects considered
armed and dangerous.

92
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,998
Time to punch in.

93
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,525
Good work, boys. That was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

94
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,296
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.

95
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,824
I love your work ethic, Tommy.
It's an inspiration to us all.

96
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,387
What was that?

97
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,414
What's going on, guys?

98
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,500
What in the... ?

99
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,217
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.

100
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:49,491
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...much.

101
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,670
I love when they play hard to get.

102
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,199
The Nightwatcher.

103
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,524
-He's doing our job for us again.
-Tommy.

104
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,622
-Keep your hands to yourself.
-Hey, who's tickling me?

105
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:23,032
Your training period ended a year ago.

106
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,955
And Splinter says
you don't write anymore.

107
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,553
Splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader.

108
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,142
I can't go back a failure.

109
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,926
Besides, these people need me
more than my brothers do.

110
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:38,298
When they were here... They would ask you,
"What is your heart telling you?"

111
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,032
I don't know.
I just know something's missing.

112
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,493
Your brothers need you, Leo.

113
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,094
They're lost without you.

114
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,428
Leo?

115
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,599
Why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe?

116
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,224
Sewer's up, bra.

117
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,561
Hey.

118
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:04,718
Cowabunga.

119
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,316
Dude. Going down.

120
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,195
Yeah.

121
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,258
Here's Mikey.

122
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,292
Guys? Anyone?

123
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:36,971
Hello?

124
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:38,896
Whatever. This place used to be fun.

125
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,235
And with rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners...

126
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:49,986
as the real-estate market
continues its downward spiral.

127
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:54,391
Coming up, the vigilante known
as Nightwatcher strikes again.

128
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,987
Now, I can 't say for sure,
but he was definitely an alien.

129
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:01,165
I think it's a disgrace, taking the law
into your own hands like that.

130
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,330
-Leave it to the police.
-Up next....

131
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,583
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.

132
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,846
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns.

133
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,985
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.

134
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,900
Forget about them. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.

135
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:23,047
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.

136
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,891
Well, look who woke up.

137
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,206
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher
is some kind of hero.

138
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,789
Beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free.

139
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:34,255
I would love to know what it is
that you do that's so great.

140
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:37,254
At Least w e're contributing around here.
All you do is sleep all day

141
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,323
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.

142
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:45,217
I know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team.

143
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,625
You think fear is the best way
to accomplish things.

144
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,937
But you are wrong. First of all, this team you speak of
doesn't exist anymore.

145
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,252
And second of all.... Raphael.

146
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,798
Enough.

147
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:01,432
I think I made my point.

148
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,323
That doesn't prove anything.

149
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,406
Why couldn't you send him away
for training?

150
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:12,047
Donatello, this home
has become like an empty shell.

151
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,564
Each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses.

152
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,677
You must learn to be strong
when they are weak.

153
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,223
If you don't learn to recognize this...

154
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:26,316
then all hope is lost for our family.

155
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,192
Keep it coming.

156
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,944
Hey, careful.

157
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,013
Those aren't souvenirs.

158
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,449
Sorry about that, ma'am.

159
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,318
Where are you, Casey?

160
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:03,980
Come on. Come on, pick up.

161
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:06,286
Don't do this to me again. Not now.

162
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:11,572
Casey can't come to the phone right now
because we're hardly working.

163
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:15,650
This better be good.

164
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:21,091
Casey, I am standing on the dock with
a priceless statue and no delivery truck.

165
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,282
-So my question is, where are you?
-April.

166
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:28,175
Hey, babe. I am so sorry.
I set the alarm clock, but....

167
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,755
But it' s broken. The clock....

168
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:38,370
It' s bad enough that you ' re
out every night playing vigilante...

169
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,742
-...but we've got a deadline to meet.
-I'm sorry.

170
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:45,479
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.

171
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:48,096
-I mean, is he there with you?
-No.

172
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,137
I found him. He's not coming back.

173
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,627
But didn't you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the Turtles?

174
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,962
Look, Casey, we're gonna lose
the biggest client we have...

175
00:16:58,436 --> 00:16:59,235
if you don 't get down here.

176
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:01,944
All right. I'm on my way.

177
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,676
Please tell me we're getting paid
by the pound here.

178
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:14,348
Is this place a museum or what?

179
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,852
-You're telling me you've never heard of Winterscorp?
-That's what I'm telling you.

180
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,723
They're into everything: real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.

181
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,839
-I don't wear hair gel.
-Really?

182
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,204
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.

183
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,150
Just make sure you don't
touch anything in here.

184
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,221
Hey, I was born careful.

185
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,685
Hope that wasn't expensive.

186
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:39,578
Oh, wait... Just... I'm...

187
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,038
-Oh, boy.
-Please tell me that wasn't you.

188
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:58,143
-Mr. Winters.
-Miss O'Neil. All the pieces are coming together.

189
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,311
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.

190
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:03,641
-Nice to meet you, Kenny.
-Boyfriend. It's Casey.

191
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:07,017
-So you were successful?
-Yes. The fourth general.

192
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,422
I want to ask you before I go...

193
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,703
if I could take one last look?

194
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,720
I believe this is the one
they call General Akeela?

195
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:28,704
It's actually "Aguila,"
but that was a good try.

196
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,872
These statues may appear
to be only stone...

197
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:37,303
but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.

198
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,007
Friends you can choose,
but never your family.

199
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,002
Okay, then.

200
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,800
Take care, Mr. Winters.

201
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,637
If you've come to kill me,
could you make it fast?

202
00:18:57,668 --> 00:19:00,341
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 1 0.
I'd rather miss it.

203
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:07,935
If we had come here to hurt you,
you'd be hurting already.

204
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,479
The Foot Clan and l
have come to hear your offer.

205
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:15,190
Well, it appears that today
is my lucky day.

206
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,274
I must warn you,
we do not come cheap.

207
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,863
Does it look like
money is of any concern to me?

208
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:23,565
Only time is of the essence, my dear.

209
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:28,796
Since you're so rich and powerful...what is it we
could possibly have to offer you?

210
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,322
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

211
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,620
I have some friends coming to town...

212
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,175
that I'd like to roll out
the red carpet for.

213
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:40,745
Greet them warmly
and bring them to me.

214
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,575
And how will we know these friends?

215
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,440
Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.

216
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:16,792
And you keep them up. Got that?

217
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,038
And don't let me catch you
calling the cops.

218
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:21,605
What? Not again.

219
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,990
Didn't I take care of you last week?

220
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:32,282
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.

221
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,637
I'm very disappointed in you,
knucklehead.

222
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:38,895
- Guess night school's in session.
- Hope I'm not disturbing class.

223
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,336
Hey, Nightwatcher,
need any teaching assistants?

224
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,035
Oh, no. Casey.

225
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:47,878
I got this one covered, pal.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

226
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,869
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.

227
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,875
And I could use a sidekick.

228
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,244
You may have everyone else fooled,
but you haven't fooled me, Raph.

229
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,806
Yeah, well, guess what, pal.
Now you...

230
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,629
Hey, wait a minute.
How did you know it was me?

231
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:07,338
Wasn't that hard, man.
You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.

232
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,055
It's that obvious, huh?

233
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:15,159
-I should've stayed in law school.
-Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.

234
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,756
Well, looks like I got a sidekick.

235
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,827
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.

236
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:32,162
-What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
-What was I supposed to do...

237
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,962
sit around, wait for Leo to come back
and save the day?

238
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,857
I mean, we haven't
heard word one from him...

239
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,902
since Splinter sent him away
on his little vacation.

240
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:42,893
Come on y ou think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure?

241
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:46,685
No. The criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things...

242
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,380
but being quitters ain't one of them.

243
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:52,407
You know, I don't even care
about Leo anymore.

244
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,022
Kind of hope he never comes back.

245
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:56,174
Come on, aren't you being
a little hard on the guy?

246
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,500
I don't know. It's possible.

247
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,384
I guess if I could live anywhere
other than the city, I'd go too.

248
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,440
But I could never leave this place.

249
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,758
I can't even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head.

250
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,214
I guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers.

251
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,136
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

252
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:16,152
I'm just saying that if it was my brother,
I'd find a way to work it out.

253
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:18,730
But that's just me.

254
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,816
I got my own issues, you know?
Like back at home, with April.

255
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,376
There's this whole thing
about settling down...

256
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,503
that makes me miss the old times.

257
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,133
I don't know if I can be the grownup
she needs me to be.

258
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,290
Good talk, Ralph.

259
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,930
Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.

260
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,984
The Stars of Kikan align.

261
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,824
All ye generals,
wake from your stone slumber.

262
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:10,642
Dude.

263
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,854
Enter.

264
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,536
Kneel, my son.

265
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,820
I return from my training, master.

266
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:38,350
I was so caught up in my own world,
I forgot about everyone else.

267
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,678
I'm sorry I failed.

268
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,969
On the contrary, my son...

269
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,015
now you are much stronger.

270
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:04,874
Your strength is needed here now.

271
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:09,886
You owe me no apology,
but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.

272
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,392
Your absence has been
particularly difficult for him...

273
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,523
though he'll never admit it.

274
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,086
I'm certain things will be back to normal
in no time, master.

275
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:27,266
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.

276
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,083
Yes, sensei.

277
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,370
I have missed you, Leonardo.

278
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,343
I've missed you too, Father.

279
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,111
Raphael.

280
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:41,544
Your brother is home.

281
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,848
-Hey.
-Hey.

282
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,807
Welcome home.

283
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,968
Yeah. Thanks.

284
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:57,647
Well, I'm going to bed.

285
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:03,651
Hey, Leo's back.
Better go say hello before he leaves again.

286
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,380
-What? Leo.
-Hey.

287
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:07,248
-Hey.
-Huh, Leo?

288
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:11,317
-ls that really you?
-Yeah.

289
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:15,109
-I'm, like, dreaming, aren't l?
-No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.

290
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:18,708
Oh, good.
I have nightmares about birthday parties.

291
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:26,028
Okay, Leo, I'll bite.
What are we doing up here?

292
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,497
I told Splinter
I'd get this team in shape again.

293
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:33,341
Hey, I've been training. Since you left,
my video-game scores have, like, doubled.

294
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:36,141
Right, and while you've been
playing games, brother...

295
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,951
Nightwatcher's come into the neighborhood...
Iike some kind of vigilante showboat.

296
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:41,496
But his days are done.

297
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,238
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...

298
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,834
and the Nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack.

299
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,064
Crime never took a break. You did.

300
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:53,249
I heard his bike turns into a plane or,
like, a jetpack.

301
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:56,865
Hey, Don, you're so smart,
why don't we have jetpacks?

302
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:59,640
 Yeah that's good, Mikey. I don't even
trust you with a driver's license.

303
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,213
Have you seen
the way this guy behaves...

304
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:08,868
Someone's cranky.

305
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:15,935
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. -Raph, wait.
Splinter told us not to fight.

306
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,969
"Jungle boy." Good one.

307
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,315
All right. But remember,
we're only up here for training.

308
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,505
You know what I always say,
"Train by doing, dude."

309
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,811
Mikey, when have you ever said that?

310
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,751
You smell that?
It's like a monkey cage up here.

311
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:41,440
Wow, good news is, there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...
getting the snot kicked out of them.

312
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:48,579
Bad news is, this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon.

313
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,012
Yeah, so?
You think we should help these guys?

314
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:55,500
I'd rather enjoy the show.
What do you say, fearless leader?

315
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:57,559
I say we stop talking.

316
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:06,890
Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.

317
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,060
You.

318
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:13,411
I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

319
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,274
-We're trying to help you.
-Never.

320
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,049
Team.

321
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:26,401
Wait, the Shredder's dead.

322
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:30,346
Who are you working for?

323
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:36,593
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.

324
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:42,729
That was too easy.

325
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:45,424
Like I said, too easy.

326
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:49,659
Bad dog.

327
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:56,988
Look at me. Found the elevator.

328
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:03,381
- Oh, my shoulder.
- My spleen.

329
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:17,181
This place needed a skylight.

330
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,867
This is why we need jetpacks.

331
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:27,877
-Okay, any more bright ideas?
-How about this?

332
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:34,107
When this is over,
I'm totally calling the architect.

333
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:08,557
Wait a minute. How did something
that big just disappear? It doesn't...

334
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:12,157
Dude, it's the cops.

335
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,605
Raph. Raph!

336
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,684
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.

337
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:33,573
I give us a 1 0 for style,
an eight for skill... and a two for stealth.

338
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:43,653
 What seems to be the problem?

339
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,350
What seems to be the problem?

340
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,931
The problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city...

341
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,497
and report anything strange to you.

342
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:03,808
You never said anything about monsters.

343
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:09,159
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns...

344
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:16,102
but I believe we made a deal, Karai.

345
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,589
And I expect you to honor it.

346
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,740
You do understand honor, don't you?

347
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,051
So how did we fare?

348
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:37,035
My, my, my. And what is your name?

349
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,715
Were there any problems, general?

350
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,898
None, my lord.

351
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:47,281
Then show these fools
how a true warrior acts.

352
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,174
Keep them on schedule
in completing their task.

353
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,074
We do not need any help.

354
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,045
Nevertheless, Karai,
I trust my family more than I trust you.

355
00:31:56,988 --> 00:32:00,253
You may be the eyes and ears,
but they are the muscle.

356
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,426
They will help you gather
the remaining 1 2 of these abominations...

357
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:06,060
so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled.

358
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,483
It's going to be quite a party.

359
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,937
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night?

360
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,307
My head.

361
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:25,098
Okay, that was just weird. I mean,
first the Foot, then that hideous monster.

362
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,612
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.

363
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,171
Yeah, that would make her
your mom too, doofus.

364
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,353
Yeah, whatever.

365
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:36,547
Keep laughing.
Last night was an embarrassment.

366
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:40,125
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't follow a single order.

367
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,822
Oh, how cute.
You've been back for five minutes...

368
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:45,077
and now you're schooling us
on your master plan?

369
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:47,779
Okay, so this is my fault now,
huh, Raph?

370
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,483
I'm the only one
that has to be responsible?

371
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,659
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.

372
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,865
Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.

373
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:05,473
Good morning, my sons.
- Good morning, sensei. Sup?

374
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,522
Every ninja's day should start
with a healthy breakfast.

375
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:18,100
It fills me with pride
to see you boys together again.

376
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,876
If anyone needs me,
I'll be watching my stories.

377
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,285
-Hothead.
-Splinter Jr.

378
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:31,321
Cody is going to break up with Donna.
I just know it.

379
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:35,180
We interrupt the Gilmore Girls
for this special news report.

380
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,020
Monsters loose in the city?

381
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:39,744
Strange reports are coming in
about an incident...

382
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,067
that sounds like something
out of science fiction.

383
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:43,955
Boys!

384
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:48,847
Leonardo,
I am most disappointed in you.

385
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:51,272
You are the eldest of your brothers.

386
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:56,038
I was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family.

387
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,879
This is why I have forbidden
any surface activity.

388
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,489
We cannot return to the surface
to fight evil...

389
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,983
if we continue to fight each other.

390
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,794
But Master Splinter,
how can I be expected to do so...

391
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,973
There are no excuses
when you are the leader, my student.

392
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:18,678
We have to go out
and find who's responsible for this.

393
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,394
There ain't no other solution.

394
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:23,227
Save the brute-vigilante junk
for that Nightwatchman.

395
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:25,664
-Nightwatcher.
-Nightwatcher.

396
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,063
Yeah, whatever.

397
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:29,086
I'm going out.

398
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,450
Witnesses say
there are holes in the floors...

399
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:28,217
as if something or someone had just
blasted straight down through them...

400
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,051
Ieaving authorities
scratching their heads.

401
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,309
Well, at least some people
care about justice these days.

402
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,430
Hey, Casey.

403
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,609
-Raph?
-Meet me on the roof, okay?

404
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,684
What is it?

405
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,373
The roof.
You know what the roof is, don't you?

406
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:46,002
Pushy sidekick.

407
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,677
We've gotten this image
in from an amateur cameraman...

408
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,726
and I do stress "amateur."

409
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,149
Casey, come look at this.

410
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,094
Be safe.

411
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,444
What's this all about, Raph?

412
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,574
We got bigger things to worry about
than criminals.

413
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:10,281
Like what?

414
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,001
Come on.

415
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:33,192
I think we lost it.

416
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,232
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

417
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,450
I don't think so.

418
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:48,791
What's going on, Raph?

419
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,931
Did I mention
we ran into a monster last night?

420
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,581
No, you kind of failed to tell me
about that one, buddy.

421
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:58,085
You do know I only have
a wooden bat, don't you?

422
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:07,579
The Foot? I thought they were history.

423
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,133
And now we got walking statues?
You got a plan for those?

424
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:20,364
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.

425
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,675
And who knows?
These guys might be friendly.

426
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,010
Friendly.

427
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,111
Wait a second. Those statues look...

428
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:50,892
Witnesses.

429
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,200
Watch out.

430
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,328
I don't feel so good.

431
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:05,535
That can't be good.

432
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:10,337
That's just rude.

433
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:14,468
Hey, wait up.

434
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,380
-Raph?
-Come here.

435
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,163
-What, you never heard of smoke pellets?
-Warn me next time.

436
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,990
I got allergies.

437
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,726
Come on.
That's the second mask this week.

438
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:29,935
They'll never find us in here.

439
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:33,453
Stay with me, now.
We'll be out of here soon.

440
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:34,853
  No.

441
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,810
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.

442
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,663
Some people just can't take a hint.

443
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:57,125
This is the police. You on the roof,
put your hands behind your....

444
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:01,107
What is that? Tommy, you see this?

445
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:05,376
Yeah, you better run.

446
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,462
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...

447
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,718
you sure know how
to show a lady a good time.

448
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,739
Raph?

449
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,624
Oh, no.
I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.

450
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,211
My compliments to the chef.

451
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,166
Anyone for dessert?

452
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:34,919
-No.
-Yes.

453
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:37,927
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.

454
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:40,840
-Raph 's hurt. You need to get over here.
-Slow down, April.

455
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:43,244
-What happened to Raph?
-I don 't know. He's unconscious.

456
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:45,942
We'll be right there.

457
00:40:54,354 --> 00:40:56,255
Leo. You came back.

458
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:57,952
Leo.

459
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,943
Sorry the reunion
isn't under better circumstances.

460
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:03,903
Wah hoho. Nice pad, kids.

461
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:06,687
Oh, hey, Raph.

462
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:10,017
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.

463
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,252
Pupil dilation is normal.

464
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:25,048
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.

465
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:27,423
Well, is he gonna be all right?

466
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:30,356
You're still here?
Go back to your jungle.

467
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:33,214
Well, at least
his personality's still intact.

468
00:41:33,414 --> 00:41:36,972
And there's an engraving on it.
Looks South American.

469
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,783
That's your department, April.

470
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:45,854
Would it help if I told you that those statues
you collected for Winters guy...

471
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:48,038
were shooting these things
at me and Raph?

472
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,918
"The legend of Yoatl." It can't be.

473
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:56,699
It was just a myth...

474
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,410
a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire.

475
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:03,020
Whoa, what are you talking about?

476
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:08,347
They say 3000 years ago,
some great warrior...

477
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,719
actually found a portal
to another dimension.

478
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:21,443
And when the portal opened...

479
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:25,066
the energy from it
gave the warrior eternal life.

480
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,157
But it also turned his generals to stone.

481
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:33,050
What if this warrior
just kept living forever?

482
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,451
He would spend
the rest of his days in regret...

483
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:40,427
spending all of his riches
and all of his power...

484
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:43,906
 to find a way
to revive his stone generals.

485
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,990
Maybe, just maybe...

486
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:54,119
he 's built a new empire.

487
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,813
But, hey, like I said, it' s just a myth.

488
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,237
Hmm if you ask me, guys,
this has Winters' name written all over it.

489
00:43:16,788 --> 00:43:19,490
-How do you figure that, Donnie?
-Yeah.

490
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,661
Because this has Winters' name
written all over it.

491
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:25,839
Now I know who to thank
for this shot in the arm.

492
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,225
So where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers?

493
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,752
We're not going
until we get Splinter's blessing.

494
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,128
You're gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?

495
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:37,742
Look if you got something you wanna
get off your shell, now's the time.

496
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:40,944
But I'm not gonna stand here
and debate Splinter's orders with you.

497
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:45,557
Fine, then. I quit.

498
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,637
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.

499
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:54,056
Sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do.

500
00:43:55,976 --> 00:43:57,592
Whatever.

501
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:30,371
To picking up the pieces.

502
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:33,003
What is it?

503
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,227
Two creatures remain, my lord.

504
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:39,296
Well, by all means, then,
let's finish it.

505
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:43,140
And you will finally be free
of your stone prison.

506
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,761
But if the curse is broken,
we will no longer be immortal.

507
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,170
Brother, do not question my command.

508
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,564
-Here we go, now.
-So, what are we looking for?

509
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:02,564
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open...

510
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:06,342
directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.

511
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:09,250
So the legend is right.
Three thousand years.

512
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:13,331
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.

513
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:18,103
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.

514
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:24,529
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet,
only monsters come out?

515
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:28,695
Yes. I guess so.

516
00:45:29,846 --> 00:45:31,841
I'm smart.

517
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:35,824
I'm okay.

518
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:37,472
Why do we need Raph, anyway?

519
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:40,472
It's his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions.

520
00:45:40,632 --> 00:45:44,027
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say.
Nobody was talking about him.

521
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:50,109
Leonardo, this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete.

522
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,842
You know what you must do.

523
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:56,663
Yes, sensei.

524
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:10,721
Generals, I think our brother
has plans to betray us.

525
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:15,976
The 1 3th monster must not be found.

526
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,110
Why don 't we take one more call
about these monster sightings?

527
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:24,404
Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.

528
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:28,156
Monster sightings.

529
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,920
A monster!

530
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,668
A ttention, all on-duty officers:

531
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:54,241
Report of a disturbance on 32nd.
No units available.

532
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,342
They're playing my song.

533
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,040
Where are the cops?
How come the cops haven't shown up?

534
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:05,059
Just remember what my analyst said,
just go to my happy place.

535
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:08,277
Everything's gonna be fine. Happy place.
I'm feeling good. I'm thin.

536
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:11,143
Don't get up. I'll serve myself.

537
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,422
Look at you. Ain't you cute?

538
00:47:18,591 --> 00:47:22,019
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
Yes, you do. You do.

539
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:26,384
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you
to hurty town. Come on, little guy.

540
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,786
Get off of me, you little monster.

541
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:38,147
You're scratching the helmet.

542
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:42,926
Okay, that was different.

543
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:55,174
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof.
Get off of me.

544
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,377
Come on.

545
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,668
How about a snack, little fella?

546
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:22,083
Catch.

547
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:38,789
Keep on running,
you filthy little hermit crab.

548
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:41,494
That spicy meatball's on the house.

549
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,201
Big guy, please don't hurt me.

550
00:48:44,364 --> 00:48:46,653
What? I'm not robbing you,
I'm helping you.

551
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:49,797
Okay, whatever you say, sir.
Please, I got kids in college.

552
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,038
Community college.

553
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:53,176
Here you go, pal.
Make sure this is safe.

554
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:55,235
Take everything.
I'm not even looking. Go.

555
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:59,244
Why is it everyone's got such a hard time
believing I am a good guy?

556
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,984
I just saved your life.

557
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:10,607
This night just keeps getting
better and better.

558
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,057
Get off my car.

559
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:13,823
I want you to know
that I appreciate your intentions...

560
00:50:13,988 --> 00:50:16,179
but you can't change the world
like this.

561
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,916
-The road you're on is a dead end.
-Ls he kidding?

562
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,728
-I've tried it.
-He's lecturing.

563
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,334
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to just walk away...

564
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:26,267
and stop this vigilante nonsense.

565
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:28,842
Okay, Leo...

566
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:32,433
time to teach you a lesson.

567
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:40,392
Look, trust me when I tell you,
you don't wanna do this.

568
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,563
Oh, yeah.
Well, I notice you got quite a temper.

569
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:50,889
Hey, have you ever done this before?

570
00:50:53,694 --> 00:50:56,102
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?

571
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:07,466
All right. Finally, some excitement.

572
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,996
Funny thing about anger:

573
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:22,703
Let it consume you,
and soon enough...

574
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,752
you lose sight of everything.

575
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:41,378
Good night, dark prince.

576
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,401
Raph?

577
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:48,917
What?

578
00:51:51,788 --> 00:51:54,012
You are so smug, you know that?

579
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,431
You think the world revolves around you,
don't you?

580
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:59,424
We couldn't survive without
the mighty and powerful Leonardo...

581
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,329
to guide us through our problems.

582
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:04,985
Well, I got a news flash for you:
We got along just fine without you.

583
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:09,793
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?

584
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:13,708
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

585
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,060
Don't push it.
You can't leave and come back...

586
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:18,924
expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers.

587
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:23,533
Hey, I was training.
Training to be a better leader, for you.

588
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:26,877
-Why do you hate me for that?
-And whoever said I wanted to be led?

589
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,774
I'm better off calling my own shots now.
Get used to it.

590
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:33,688
You aren't ready.
You're impatient and hot-tempered.

591
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:37,601
And more importantly,
I'm better than you.

592
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,325
Oh, you know something, big brother?

593
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:44,814
I'd have to disagree with you
on that one.

594
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:49,051
Don't do this, Raph.

595
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,331
I'm done taking orders.

596
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:58,027
Not human...but clearly not the final monster.

597
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:02,410
Yoatl won't know the difference.

598
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:08,753
By the time our brother discovers this
turtle is not the 1 3th monster...

599
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:11,824
it will already be too late.

600
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:18,347
Leo.

601
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:33,218
Leo. Hang on.

602
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,366
Leo.

603
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:42,290
Leo.

604
00:55:52,362 --> 00:55:54,690
No!

605
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:16,966
Raphael. What is the matter?

606
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:19,097
I was out. I was out and I did...
I did something.

607
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:21,772
Something happened
and then l... And l....

608
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,707
Raphael. Kneel.

609
00:56:28,078 --> 00:56:29,824
I did something.

610
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:32,124
I did something really stupid,
Master Splinter.

611
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:34,534
Go on.

612
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:37,790
I know why you chose him now.

613
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,880
I know that there's a reason
why he's the better son and I'm not.

614
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,790
Raphael, you always bear
the world's problems on your shoulders.

615
00:56:47,959 --> 00:56:53,936
It is an admirable quality
when you are a protector of others.

616
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:58,934
But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student...

617
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:03,470
it does not mean
that you are my least-favorite son.

618
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:08,872
You are strong, passionate
and loyal to a fault.

619
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:12,686
These are the merits
of a great leader as well...

620
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:17,468
but only when tempered
with compassion and humility.

621
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,730
But, Master Splinter,
I messed up big tonight.

622
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,476
I mean big.

623
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,867
They took him.

624
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:36,017
Leonardo.

625
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:38,112
Yeah.

626
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:47,923
Then the time for hiding is over.

627
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:53,687
We must return to the surface
to take back what is ours.

628
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,330
By your wish, Father.

629
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:05,078
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.

630
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:08,160
Well, what do we do now?

631
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,977
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

632
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:14,308
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.

633
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,858
I got it on my last trip to Japan.
You like it?

634
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,838
Oh, yeah.

635
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:26,937
No way.

636
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,554
You can't go trick-or-treating
without your mask.

637
00:59:32,544 --> 00:59:35,429
Oh, babe. Thanks.

638
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:54,262
As ordered,
no one gets into the tower...

639
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:59,357
no one interferes,
no one bears witness.

640
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:10,844
You've got to be kidding me.

641
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:16,887
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here
for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.

642
01:00:17,053 --> 01:00:18,323
Leave now.

643
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:21,186
Oh, but you don't understand, lady.
I got....

644
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:12,664
At last. After 3000 years,
the time is finally at hand.

645
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:35,475
What... ? What have you done?

646
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:39,136
Your time for giving orders is over.

647
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,629
You don't understand.

648
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,722
I want to send these creatures back...

649
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:45,429
to undo the damage
that was done so many years ago.

650
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:48,513
Time has done nothing
but made you weak.

651
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,840
We have our own plans.

652
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:53,096
Immortality is a curse, brother.

653
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:55,550
Trust me, I've lived long enough to know.

654
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:58,695
We have to find that 1 3th monster.
It's time to end it.

655
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:00,380
No.

656
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,678
Our time is just beginning.

657
01:02:26,223 --> 01:02:28,576
-Little help, Don.
-I'm on it.

658
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,157
Heads up, dudes.

659
01:02:40,317 --> 01:02:42,378
Goal.

660
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:48,520
Guys, front door's open. Now.

661
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:51,315
Two minutes for high sticking.

662
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:58,411
Dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.

663
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,788
-Dudes, what do we do?
-I'm working on it.

664
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:13,784
You break it, you buy it.

665
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,617
Yeah. All right.

666
01:03:20,786 --> 01:03:23,292
All right. Nice.

667
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,441
-Nice work, Jones.
-I have my moments.

668
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:28,539
Whoa, check it out.

669
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:32,136
That would be the swirling vortex
to another world, I assume.

670
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:34,202
Cool. I want one.

671
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,592
Leo, is that you?

672
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:42,162
Sorry, wrong cage.

673
01:03:44,902 --> 01:03:47,603
-Leo. I got him.
-Out of the way, please.

674
01:03:54,574 --> 01:03:57,687
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.

675
01:03:58,265 --> 01:04:00,043
There you go.

676
01:04:10,768 --> 01:04:13,914
You're gonna need these
if you're gonna lead us out of here.

677
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,635
I'm gonna need you too.

678
01:04:24,004 --> 01:04:26,921
-Winters.
-Looks more like fall. Get it?

679
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:28,705
Mikey, remember our talk.

680
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:34,082
Looks like someone got to him
before us.

681
01:04:39,287 --> 01:04:40,708
Is he dead?

682
01:04:45,873 --> 01:04:48,129
Not so immortal, huh, dudes?

683
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,685
Your time's run out, Winters.

684
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,679
Miss O'Neil.

685
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:01,199
I must have hit my head pretty hard.
I'm seeing giant turtles.

686
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:04,197
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal...

687
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:07,471
and we think that it's time
you sent all these monsters home.

688
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,625
I couldn't agree with you more.

689
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:16,596
It is time to put an end to the curse
that I have brought upon myself...

690
01:05:16,766 --> 01:05:18,957
and this world.

691
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,318
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil:
Penance.

692
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:28,534
I must return all 13 beasts
or our curse will continue.

693
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:32,927
And that is a torment
I can no longer bear.

694
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:36,992
Then you should be
put out of your misery.

695
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,910
I think we walked in
on a family feud, guys.

696
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:45,778
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.

697
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,816
Nothing will stand in our way...

698
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,807
when we have an army
at our command.

699
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:54,330
-My brothers, l...
-We are no brothers to you.

700
01:05:54,499 --> 01:06:00,031
With one monster still free,
the curse will never be broken.

701
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:04,424
We shall finish what we began
all those years ago.

702
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:07,219
And we will finally have our victory.

703
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:10,214
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.

704
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:14,127
Swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you.

705
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:21,502
The Foot ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.

706
01:06:25,804 --> 01:06:27,995
Okay, what does that mean?

707
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,012
It means we're going to help you.

708
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:35,856
My ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here.

709
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:37,666
Hurry, we don't have much time.

710
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:43,428
Hey. I got shotgun.

711
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,074
Forget about them.

712
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:48,899
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed...

713
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,567
with you inside it.

714
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:53,792
I hate to see brothers fight like this.

715
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:56,695
Unless it's together.

716
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:02,797
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.

717
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,796
We're going to enjoy this.

718
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:14,572
If you please. They can defeat them.

719
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,960
They are a team.

720
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:20,653
Let's hope so, because if not,
Aguila will use the portal...

721
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:25,802
to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost.

722
01:07:27,462 --> 01:07:31,498
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.

723
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:38,814
Temper, temper.

724
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,373
Come to daddy.

725
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,471
Thing about you immortal stone guys is...

726
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:06,207
you know, you're immortal
and made of stone.

727
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:08,271
I sound like Mikey.

728
01:08:09,554 --> 01:08:12,472
You fight well. You should join us.

729
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:15,023
No, thanks, I'm good.

730
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:26,572
These guys really don't die.
Sensei, are you all right?

731
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:29,912
We must do this more often.

732
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:34,302
I still got it.

733
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,202
They'd better hurry
with that last monster.

734
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,099
I'm sure my man Casey's
got it all under control.

735
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:45,377
That's what I'm afraid of.

736
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,434
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

737
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,563
-Wanna drive?
-I would, as a matter of fact.

738
01:08:54,732 --> 01:09:00,362
You would think they would be
more concerned about the 1 3th monster.

739
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:26,034
Boys, we must finish this now.

740
01:09:50,504 --> 01:09:51,925
So did we win?

741
01:09:58,871 --> 01:10:03,102
Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone.

742
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:05,898
Without the final monster
to break our curse...

743
01:10:06,062 --> 01:10:08,915
we will never be stopped.

744
01:10:11,184 --> 01:10:12,930
Special delivery.

745
01:10:18,629 --> 01:10:19,767
Look out.

746
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:00,969
So did we win now?

747
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:03,770
-Yeah, I think we did.
-We won.

748
01:11:03,934 --> 01:11:05,040
-All right.
-Yeah!

749
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:08,038
All right. That's what I'm talking about.

750
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,689
Yeah!

751
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:12,358
Nice parallel parking.

752
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:15,637
Next time, I'm driving.

753
01:11:19,746 --> 01:11:22,316
Hey. Watch the hair.

754
01:11:26,872 --> 01:11:30,365
Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.

755
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:39,278
You are every bit the warriors
I was informed you were.

756
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:40,860
You have passed.

757
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,828
Savor your victory tonight.

758
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:47,709
For soon, we will have
further business together.

759
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,351
The kind that involves familiar faces
from your past.

760
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,466
She doesn't mean....

761
01:12:00,311 --> 01:12:04,281
Come on. What is it with ninjas
and smoke pellets?

762
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:12,395
Looks like you picked a good time
to come home.

763
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:16,183
Thanks for bringing me back.

764
01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:22,380
Winters?

765
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:29,606
I'm never usually that happy
to be in pain.

766
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:32,624
He's happy because he's mortal again,
Mikey.

767
01:12:32,794 --> 01:12:35,875
April. I've had my eye on you
for a long time.

768
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,437
I knew it.

769
01:12:37,598 --> 01:12:43,130
I've always known that you'd be the one
to help me find my way home.

770
01:12:44,374 --> 01:12:45,990
And thank you...

771
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:47,963
brothers.

772
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:54,171
You've made a very old man
very, very happy.

773
01:12:55,128 --> 01:12:58,273
So, what happens now?

774
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:44,500
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.

775
01:13:45,364 --> 01:13:50,571
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no...
My no... My no...

776
01:13:54,702 --> 01:13:57,196
Gross. Somebody give me a hankie.

777
01:13:57,295 --> 01:13:59,222
Now he's in my mouth.

778
01:14:00,548 --> 01:14:03,236
Tastes awful.

779
01:14:32,616 --> 01:14:33,908
You got room for one more?

780
01:14:50,838 --> 01:14:53,190
Can I get rid of this too?

781
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:12,386
We live together. We train together.

782
01:15:12,951 --> 01:15:15,522
We fight together.
We stand for good, together.

783
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:17,848
We are ninjas.

784
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,729
We strike hard, defend, protect,
and fade into the night.

785
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:25,991
And there ain 't no bad guy or monster
gonna ever change that.

786
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:29,036
That's what's important.

787
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:31,553
And that's why
we'll always be brothers.

788
01:15:33,722 --> 01:15:35,787
Oh, I love being a turtle.
