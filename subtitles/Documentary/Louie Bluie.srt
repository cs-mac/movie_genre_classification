Wait, where did that guy go?

34
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,878
Did he go inside and is he
sleeping indoors all by himself?

This little rascal! Aish...

Hey! Where did you go?

37
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,238
- Have you seen Bok Sil?
- No.

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,268
This is strange.

39
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,788
I was supposed to meet up with her, but she did
not come and I can't get in touch with her.

40
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,048
Just the ring was lying on the ground.

41
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,448
First of all, calm down.
Let's go to her room first.

42
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:09,999
She might have gone back to her room.

43
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,259
Okay.

44
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,728
So noisy.

45
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,248
No manners.

46
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,718
What are you doing so late at night?

47
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,699
- What about Bok Sil?
- Huh?

48
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,989
Wait.

49
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,818
Did she tell you anything?

50
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,739
She left to go meet Louis.

51
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:41,199
You weren't together?

52
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,268
Team Leader Baek, wake everyone up
and let them know what's going on.

53
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,708
We'll go look outside for her first.

54
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,668
What's going on?

55
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,919
Go Bok Sil has gone missing.

56
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,968
Omo! What to do?

57
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:07,878
Ji Sung! Bok Sil!

58
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,328
Bok Sil. Bok Sil!

59
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,029
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

60
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,488
- She's not there?
- No.

61
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:20,268
Her cellphone is off and the
ring was on the ground.

62
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,378
I don't think it's just a
simple case of disappearance.

63
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,928
Then?

64
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,928
I have to check first.

65
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:31,019
I'll go to the surveillance room first.
Please keep searching.

66
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,619
Let's go together.

67
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,788
Keep looking for her. If you find anything,
get in touch with us right away.

68
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:40,828
You give us a call if
you find anything too.

69
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,848
Alright, I understand.

70
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,758
- Let me go with you!
- Let's hurry up and go.

71
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,548
- Ma Ri, let me go too, then.
- In Seong.

72
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,548
- Yes?
- You come search this way with me.

73
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,179
Okay. But I... I...

74
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,189
I have your daughter.

75
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,018
What?

76
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,688
Tomorrow at noon, bring the money
to the Clock Tower at Gold Plaza.

77
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,228
I'll let you know where your
daughter is once I get the money.

78
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,688
If you let the police know,

79
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:20,048
I can't guarantee what'll
happen to your daughter either.

80
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:23,379
Hello? Hello?!

81
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:35,948
Oh, Dad!

82
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:41,408
M-M-Ma Ri! Are you okay?
Where are you right now?

83
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,848
<i>Where would I be? I told you I
was going on a company outing.</i>

84
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,958
Oh, you did. You're really okay, right?

85
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,868
Oh, hang up if you've got
nothing else to say.

86
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,939
Go Bok Sil suddenly disappeared,
so I'm quite distracted!

87
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,419
Is this it?

88
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,529
What's this now about Go Bok
Sil suddenly going missing...

89
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:11,669
Did this bastard possibly take
Go Bok Sil instead of Ma Ri?

90
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,138
How can this bastard not
do even one thing right?

91
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,618
I mean... What is he trying to
do by messing with Bok Sil?

92
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:21,079
I'm going to go crazy, seriously!

93
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,209
No.

94
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,148
He said that he'd let me know where
she is if I just give him the money,

95
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:34,578
so all I have to do is give him
the money and save Go Bok Sil.

96
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,459
That's right.

97
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,909
Stop! Zoom in there.

98
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,479
- Here?
- Yes.

99
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,808
It's not definite yet. You can't
see her face that well either.

100
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:58,028
- You can't make it any clearer?
- No, this is the clearest.

101
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:00,818
Wait, that is Go Bok Sil!

102
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,659
I let her borrow that coat. I'm sure!

103
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,519
Bok Sil!

104
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,578
I feel like I've seen him a lot somewhere before.
Does anyone know who that man is, by any chance?

105
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,319
I can't really tell because of the mask.

106
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,988
I don't know either.

107
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:24,268
Why is he kidnapping Bok Sil? There's no one who
hates her, and she doesn't have any money either.

108
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,408
You have a lot of money, though.

109
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,359
Goldline heir, Kang Ji Sung.

110
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,978
You're saying Bok Sil got
kidnapped because of me?

111
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,919
Because of me?!

112
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,758
Because of me...

113
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,328
Get a hold of yourself, Kang Ji Sung! You
have to keep grounded at times like this!

114
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,429
You're the only guardian the kidnapped
Go Bok Sil's got! You understand?

115
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:57,828
Yes. I'll find her, no matter what.
So what do I need to do, then?

116
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,748
If he's really after your money, then
he'll get in touch with you soon.

117
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,518
Keep checking your phone. Let's stop the
search and go to Seoul for right now.

118
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,139
I should go to the station and
pull up the car records first.

119
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,849
Bok Sil...

120
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,428
<i>This woman is...</i>

121
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:31,888
<i>This woman is involved with Louis,</i>

122
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:34,928
<i>so find out about her
and keep an eye on her.</i>

123
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,019
<i>This is Go Bok Sil!</i>

124
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:42,549
<i>I bought it from a boutique that I go to
often. Do you think it'll look good on Ma Ri?</i>

125
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,728
What in the world happened?

126
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,239
I definitely double-checked her clothes.

127
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,878
Are you insane? What are
you doing right now?

128
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,638
There was a slight misunderstanding.

129
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,408
I told you that I would give you money in the first
place. Why do you keep making bigger problems?!

130
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,298
<i>You first acted in such a way
that I couldn't trust you.</i>

131
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,189
What in the world are you talking about?

132
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,198
Anyway, I just have to give you the money.

133
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,818
I'll give you the money right
now, so let Go Bok Sil go.

134
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:19,769
Come to the place we met
before with the money.

135
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,959
Sorry, for keeping you waiting.

136
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,028
I checked on the car 1511
and it's a stolen vehicle.

137
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,488
So, as of now, I won't be
able to point out a suspect.

138
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,698
What about security camera footage?

139
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,328
Nothing from there yet, either.

140
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,078
We're looking through all the footage around the retreat
center and toll gates, so we'll get a call in no time.

141
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,359
We put the stolen vehicle in the wanted
list, so let's just wait a little longer.

142
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,558
Have you got a call from the kidnapper yet?

143
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,118
No.

144
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:51,228
If he asks for money, I'll give it to him,

145
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:53,738
but he's not contacting me,
it's driving me crazy.

146
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:57,329
Cheer up. You'll get a call soon.

147
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:28,219
What's taking him so long?

148
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:43,149
<i>The police people can trust and rely on.</i>

149
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,248
I can't wait anymore. I'm
going to go look for her.

150
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,228
Where the heck are you trying to go to?

151
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:56,288
I don't know. I have to
look for her anywhere.

152
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,938
I'm worried sick for Bok Sil.

153
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:02,999
If you act like this, you'll be
worn out first. Brace yourself.

154
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:06,448
I wish I just get the call.

155
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,469
<i>Go Bok Sil</i>

156
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,519
Bok Sil!

157
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,478
Bok Sil?

158
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,699
Do you know the owner of this cell phone?

159
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,138
Are you not Bok Sil? Who are you?

160
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,528
<i>This is a hospital.</i>

161
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,498
<i>The owner of this cell phone was in a
traffic accident and brought in here.</i>

162
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,249
What?

163
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,449
Where is this? What hospital is it?

164
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,439
That bastard. Why isn't he coming?

165
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,218
He gets the money I gave him stolen,

166
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,409
he kidnaps someone else and
screws up the matter even more.

167
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,298
Why isn't he coming when I
brought the money again?

168
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,179
Seriously!

169
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,309
Bok Sil!

170
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,338
It's not Bok Sil.

171
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,378
What's going on here?

172
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,899
T-this guy..

173
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,779
Why is this guy...?

174
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,578
It's Secretary Goo!

175
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,538
You know him?

176
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,468
Yes. He's a brother of Ahjussi
Seon Gu's hometown friend.

177
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,468
I saw him at Ahjumma Audrey's
book store the other day.

178
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:25,608
What?

179
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,748
He's the guy who got hit by a hammer
and collapsed at your rooftop place.

180
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:30,509
What?

181
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:36,478
Has the patient injured his head before?

182
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:39,268
Yes. He lay unconscious for a long while,

183
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,748
and he left the hospital
without getting treated.

184
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:45,459
There is a chance that he
might never wake up again.

185
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,418
Then what about Bok Sil?

186
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,008
He knows where Bok Sil is.
What about Bok Sil!

187
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,758
Calm down. There must be a way.

188
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,478
Bok Sil... Are you talking about
the lady who came together?

189
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,479
Where is she right now?

190
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:08,608
Hey! Detective Nam seems to have found that Eunseong-dong
case victim who had run away from the hospital.

191
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:09,429
From where?

192
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,598
He was brought to a different hospital
after an accident. Go join him.

193
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,129
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,338
Detective Lee? What do I owe this call to?

195
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,498
That victim is at a hospital.

196
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,858
W-What did you just say?

197
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,158
He got into a traffic
accident and hurt his head,

198
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,678
<i>so he's unconscious again.</i>

199
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,968
We, the police, will take care of him from now on,
so don't concern yourself with him any longer.

200
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:43,858
W-Why? Did he do something?

201
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:49,019
He tried to kidnap someone tonight,
so a full-scale investigation is on.

202
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,759
Bok Sil!

203
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,508
Louis!

204
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,808
Bok Sil, are you hurt?

205
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,019
Where? How much?

206
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:09,539
I'm okay. I just pulled a ligament.

207
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,828
Louis...

208
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:18,049
Bok Sil... You must have been shocked.

209
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:23,039
I said I'd protect you. I'm sorry
for not keeping my promise.

210
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:26,148
I'm okay though.

211
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:28,789
I'm so sorry, Bok Sil.

212
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,898
Aren't you hungry? You had a tough night.

213
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,208
A little.

214
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,429
Then wait a little. I'll go get some stuff.

215
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,539
That male human detective is
really the best civil servant.

216
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:55,038
But why did he kidnap me?

217
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,098
We thought it was for the money at the
beginning, but now we don't think so.

218
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:02,798
That culprit is the one who got hit
with the hammer at our rooftop.

219
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,529
What?

220
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:08,788
Are you sure that guy is an
acquaintance of President Baek?

221
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:13,949
Yes. He surely said he was a younger
brother of his hometown friend.

222
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:20,699
It's really strange, right? Why did Ahjussi
Seon Gu's acquaintance come into our house?

223
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,768
Honey.

224
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,248
Where were you all night long?

225
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:40,488
You look terrible.

226
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,209
Jae Sook...

227
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,468
Are... you not feeling well?

228
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:54,029
Could you take the box on my
desk to Mother's house in Busan?

229
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,788
There is a secret space under the
floorboards in Louis' attic,

230
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:02,329
you can just put it in there.

231
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:06,858
Why do I have to put it there?

232
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,578
Please, don't ask any
questions and do me a favor.

233
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,829
Get going now.

234
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,459
O-Okay.

235
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,558
Attorney Hwang, it's me.

236
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,059
Can we meet right now?

237
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,728
Is it good?

238
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,378
Yeah.

239
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,609
Here, eat some more.

240
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,259
Just a sec.

241
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,868
What are you trying to do?

242
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,878
I'm making a ponytail.

243
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:16,869
Make it pretty.

244
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,819
Of course.

245
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,179
Wow!

246
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,778
Whoever did it, it's really pretty.

247
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,479
Really?

248
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,638
Then... let's eat.

249
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,369
Okay.

250
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:51,939
I spilled.

251
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,399
I just have to wipe it for you.

252
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,188

Miss Go Bok Sil, you can go home today.

Okay.

283
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,928

I'll get it.

You got one here.

289
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:19,778
It's not all clean here yet.

290
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,488
No, no. Let me.

291
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,988
- Why?
- I'll get it.

297
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,748
Yes, yes.

298
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:38,238
Move, move.

299
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,128
Oh, Bok Sil! Are you alright?

300
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:43,158
Yes.

301
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,229
- What do I do?
- Here, lie down.

302
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:51,688
Our Bok Sil, you must've been really
shocked. <i>Maid 1, Maid 2, Maid 3, Maid 4</i>

303
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,478
You got hurt a lot.

304
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,169
I'm okay.

305
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:00,668
It was tough, right?

306
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,758
I'm okay. You're treating
me like a patient.

307
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,598
You need to take a rest. Sleep.

308
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,528
Why did he take our innocent Bok Sil
and make her go through all that?

309
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,408
That damn bastard. Wait until I catch him,
I'll break his legs into three pieces!

310
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,778
So, did they catch the culprit?

311
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,538
He's hurt and still unconscious.

312
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,948
That guy at the hospital has high chances of
being an illegal immigrant and a hit man.

313
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:27,778
We've been keeping an eye
on him for that reason.

314
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,479
What?

315
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,918
How can a person like that be a brother of
President Baek's hometown friend? Isn't it weird?

316
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,738
It's just my speculation, but I think he
could be a person President Baek hired.

317
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:42,129
If President Baek hired a hit man...?

318
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:44,689
<i>Aish...</i>

319
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,978
<i>That guy is such a weirdo.</i>

320
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,678
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

321
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,098
<i>Hello.</i>

322
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:56,128
<i>Yes... Where did the guy who
was in front of you go?</i>

323
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:58,598
<i>He just left.</i>

324
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,528
<i>Do you know him well?</i>

325
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:04,428
<i>No. What's the matter?</i>

326
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:07,838
<i>Yeah... It's nothing.</i>

327
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,638
<i>President Baek might
have known much earlier</i>

328
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,488
<i>that dead Louis was actually alive.</i>

329
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,149
<i>But why was he hiding it?</i>

330
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:31,199
<i>Louis</i>

331
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:43,208
<i>I just wanted a minor fender
bender, not such a huge accident!</i>

332
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:48,068
<i>What are you going to do? How will you
take the responsibility?! A person died!</i>

333
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:52,048
<i>You think we did it on purpose?
We just followed our plan,</i>

334
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,529
<i>but he suddenly started speeding
making the accident big.</i>

335
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,068
<i>Only if the matter hadn't
gotten out of hand back then,</i>

336
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:09,859
<i>I wouldn't have attempted a
plan to cover up that crime.</i>

337
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:15,639
What does it matter now?

338
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:29,728
Detective Nam, Secretary
Goo's still unconscious?

339
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:33,968
You have to ask him right away when he
wakes up, why he kidnapped Bok Sil, okay?

340
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:37,738
I will take care of things here,
you should try to get some sleep.

341
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:40,528
You've exhausted so much
energy since yesterday.

342
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,888
You did too, Detective. Alright.

343
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:47,479
Thank you for your trouble. Bye.

344
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,498
It's warm milk.

345
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:54,059
Drink it and take a nap.

346
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:01,668
Butler Kim.

347
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,548
Yes, Young Master.

348
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,008
May I drive?

349
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,508
Why all of a sudden?

350
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,818
I want to drive Bok Sil myself.

351
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:18,218
You always whined to drive,
even back in France.

352
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:21,358
You're right.

353
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,098
But you screwed up by taking President Baek's car without
permission and driving away on the day of your return to Korea.

354
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,879
I'm not sure if Chairwoman would let you.

355
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,668
What? What do you mean
driving without permission?

356
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,868
I heard that you took off in the car while
President Baek went to the restroom.

357
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:43,659
<i>You go ahead. Something urgent came up,
so I have to stop by the company first.</i>

358
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,858
<i>- You can drive, right?
- Okay.</i>

359
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,308
I didn't do that.

360
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:56,219
Excuse me?

361
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:04,158
<i>To be honest, I was very suspicious
about President Baek in many respects.</i>

362
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,008
<i>Like that time he had your baby tooth
and watch taken from the Busan house,</i>

363
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,308
<i>and the time I ran into him, while
I was asking around about you.</i>

364
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,288
<i>But he ended up bringing you back,</i>

365
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,199
<i>so I had to believe him.</i>

366
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:31,249
<i>Hello. He did seem pretty
shocked to see me that time.</i>

367
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,578
<i>I got all my memories back.</i>

368
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,658
<i>It was the same when he
heard I got my memory back.</i>

369
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,808
<i>What?</i>

370
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,899
<i>The reason I shouldn't return alive...</i>

371
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:50,409
The reason I shouldn't
get my memory back...

372
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,599
What could it be?

373
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,659
Who is here at this hour?

374
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,299
I'm sorry for stopping by so late.

375
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:34,739
No problem. I was planning on
going to see you tomorrow anyway.

376
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:41,169
Does that mean you know why I'm here?

377
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:53,029
Ji Sung... I'm sorry.

378
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,249
I did a terrible thing to you
for which I deserve to die.

379
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:01,018
Ahjussi...

380
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,578
I didn't plan,

381
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:07,689
such a huge accident from the beginning.

382
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:13,758
<i>I mean to leave Gold Group to Louis.</i>

383
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,498
<i>Without consulting me
at all, the Chairwoman</i>

384
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:20,898
<i>all of a sudden said that
she'd give Gold Group to you.</i>

385
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,558
At that moment, I got so mad. Gold Group

386
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,459
was a company that I spent
my youth to build up.

387
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:34,518
After your father died, I served
the Chairwoman like my own mother.

388
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:39,398
It was so easy for her to
push me aside and decide

389
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,189
to give you everything, when you
were in a faraway foreign land.

390
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:46,589
That decision really aggrieved me.

391
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:55,818
If I get you hurt a little
bit with a traffic accident,

392
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:01,419
I thought the Chairwoman would get
scared and send you back to France.

393
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,408
But things got bigger.

394
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:13,038
The accident spun out of control.
It's the truth, Ji Sung.

395
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,548
Since the day you, who were
thought to be dead, came back,

396
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,958
I didn't have a single
day of peace of mind.

397
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:25,288
I was always worried that
my crime would be revealed,

398
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,259
and I lived like a fugitive.

399
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:58,699
Ahjussi...

400
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:04,179
I'm thankful to you for staying
by Grandma's side up to now

401
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:10,518
in place of my late parents and me.

402
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,579
Louis...

403
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,359
I think that I'll be able to
forgive you just because of that,

404
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:24,119
but still... someone died
because of the accident.

405
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:29,649
I'm going to accept the
punishment for my sins.

406
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:36,359
I was already getting things
ready to turn myself in.

407
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:40,788
I already told Lawyer Hwang to
transfer all the company shares

408
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:46,269
that I got from the Chairwoman to you, too.

409
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,529
Ahjusshi...

410
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:54,829
When it comes to people,

411
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:59,058
when they start getting greedy,

412
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,409
their conscience also begins
to dwindle without an end.

413
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,468
There's one thing that's
still weighing on my mind.

414
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:12,558
The Chairwoman might collapse
if she finds out about this.

415
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,919
That worries me.

416
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,258
Don't worry about that.

417
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,029
I'll make sure Grandmother never knows.

418
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,639
I don't want to make her sad.

419
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,839
Thank you, Louis.

420
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,999
<i>Detective 1-3 Team</i>

421
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:58,738
Please take good care of Ma Ri and
her mother while I'm not there.

422
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:02,029
Okay. Don't worry.

423
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,059
I came to turn myself in.

424
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,718
I'm thankful to you for putting down
everything and admitting your crimes,

425
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:11,718
but there's a part of your statement that doesn't coincide with
Mr. Goo Jeong Hoon's, so I'll have to interrogate you together.

426
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,678
What?

427
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,528
President Baek ordered me to do everything,
from the car accident to kidnapping Go Bok Sil.

428
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,008
What are you talking about? This
man threatened me for money.

429
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,809
Me?

430
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,898
I've never asked him for money.

431
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,298
That's not true. He's framing me.

432
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:35,368
This man was trying to kidnap my daughter, and
ended up kidnapping Go Bok Sil accidentally.

433
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,628
I'm just an employee at a
private investigator's office.

434
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:40,749
I just did what he ordered me to do.

435
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,378
That's not true.

436
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:47,408
I didn't do that!

437
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:53,068
I know it won't be easy to believe
what I say in this kind of situation,

438
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:55,608
but I really didn't do it, Louis.

439
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,958
I heard a rundown of
everything from Detective Nam.

440
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,278
Do you have anything you can use as proof?

441
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,258
I definitely brought the bag of
money and went to the bookstore,

442
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,128
but it was after Secretary
Goo had disappeared.

443
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,268
They said there are no CCTV's
around the bookstore area.

444
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:14,238
There's no way to prove it.

445
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,269
The bookstore, you said?

446
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,389
Director Cha. I've got
something for you to do.

447
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,788
Are you sure that's the car?

448
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:38,629
Ah, you surprised me.
Don't whisper in my ear.

449
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,578
Yes. He's been there for a few days now.

450
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,669
In that spot, just like that.

451
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:53,529
Then shall we head over first?

452
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,619
He's excited, so excited. Jeez!

453
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,109
This is the police. I have
a few things to ask you.

454
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,329
I caught him!

455
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:29,289
Stay still. Stop moving!

456
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:35,268
Wow, where did all these
pictures come from?

457
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:38,148
There was a stalker following Mrs. Audrey.

458
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:39,778
- A stalker?
- Yes.

459
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:45,049
He set up camp in front of the store and
took pictures. We confiscated all of it.

460
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,358
Detective, you have to take
care of this one. Okay?

461
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,469
Of course.

462
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,688
If you look at this picture, you
can see the both of them talking.

463
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:57,568
And look here. You can see that Ahjussi Seon
Gu brought the bag of money the very next day.

464
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:58,638
Now, his story is proven, right?

465
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,308
Wow. You could become a detective.

466
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:04,048
Your eye for things is awesome.

467
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,938
But! Why did you go to the
bookstore, Detective Nam?

468
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,708
The atmosphere looks so warm and cozy.

469
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,728
It's hard for a woman to run
a bookstore by herself.

470
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:15,368
Also, she was a big help in finding Louis.

471
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:18,908
Since I was so thankful to her, I'd carry heavy
books for her and help her out from time to time.

472
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:23,989
Anyway, you're so nosy. You're in the final
stages of your Servant's Disease. Terminal!

473
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:30,158
Why did you go so far as kidnapping
Go Bok Sil, no, I mean, Baek Ma Ri?

474
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,398
What did you do with the bag
of money you got before?

475
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:37,858
My bag of money got snatched,
so I had no other option.

476
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:42,098
That grandmother seriously had
unreal skills like a ghost!

477
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,789
A professional pickpocketing grandmother?

478
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,618
Detective Nam, what are you doing?

479
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,848
Oh. Did you get the CCTV footage?

480
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,388
I got her identity as well.

481
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:55,098
Her name is Jo Ha Ni. She has
9 prior larceny convictions.

482
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:57,688
She's someone I've caught before.

483
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,748
Do you know her residence as well?

484
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:04,068
This is my field of specialty.
I've already sent the guys.

485
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,819
Good work.

486
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,829
Stop trying to get out of this now.
The CCTV captured everything.

487
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:15,948
That isn't me.

488
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:18,649
It's someone who looks like me.

489
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,489
Seriously.

490
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,869
I'm glad that it's all better.

491
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,598
Still, you can't overwork it, okay?

492
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,808
Okay.

493
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:37,008
Let's stop by the police
station on our way out.

494
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:40,578
I told Ahjussi Seon Gu to
apologize to you in person.

495
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,158
He's not even the one who did it.

496
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,818
But still, he must be having a hard time.
Let's at least greet him and then go home.

497
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:49,589
Okay.

498
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,358
Ms. Jo Ha Ni, let's hurry and finish up.

499
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,868
Where did you hide that bag of money?

500
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,518
You really don't believe
what other people say.

501
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,518
Omo, what time is it already?

502
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:07,448
Is it okay to detain a person like
this without any proof, Mr. Detective?

503
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,749
Ah, this grandma, seriously.

504
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:13,328
Detective!

505
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,419
Oh, Bok Sil.

506
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,229
Grandmother!

507
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:23,679
<i>Grandma!</i>

508
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:27,889
<i>Grandma!</i>

509
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:42,649
My grandma also had cold hands, you know.

510
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:53,239
Grandmother, I won't ask or argue with
you about you lying about your grandson.

511
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:59,958
I just want you to give that money back.
It belongs to someone that I know.

512
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:04,319
I-I told you that I don't
know anything about that.

513
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,029
Mr. Detective must be waiting for me.

514
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,668
I see your hurt leg is all better now.

515
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,789
That's a relief.

516
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:23,248
<i>Aigoo, what kind of clothes are
these for a young girl to wear?</i>

517
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:25,408
<i>It's so old-fashioned.</i>

518
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:27,978
<i>I don't wear this kind of stuff.</i>

519
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:31,008
<i>Then give me those clothes
back and go in your undies.</i>

520
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:35,208
<i>This is the first time I've seen a
girl so obsessed with her clothes!</i>

521
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,559
<i>This was my late mom's.</i>

522
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,089
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

523
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,208
<i>Don't take to heart what a silly
old woman like me says to you.</i>

524
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,769
<i>Go and live well.</i>

525
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:53,719
<i>Living in Seoul is pretty tough.</i>

526
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:58,229
<i>Yes, ma'am. You find your
grandson too, Grandmother!</i>

527
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,189
<i>Grandmother!</i>

528
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:13,668
<i>With this, at least buy yourself a meal.</i>

529
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:15,689
<i>Return home safely.</i>

530
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:33,149
I'm remembering such useless things.
It's so annoying.

531
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,018
Call the Detective for me.

532
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:43,858
I'll tell you where the bag is.

533
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,569
Really? Then I'll go get the detective.

534
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:03,009
I never knew I, the Black Sable, would
exchange 1 million USD with $10.

535
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,888
Kang Ji Sung wanted to clear
you of your false accusations

536
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:11,308
and even found evidence. You
shouldn't be like this.

537
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,898
Someone died in that accident. Who would
believe that you had no intent to kill anyone?

538
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:18,829
Detective, this is so unfair.

539
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,538
Frankly, wasn't it your guilty conscience

540
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:25,318
which led you to even bribe me?

541
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,658
<i>Please make sure to give me a call when the
unconscious patient in the hospital wakes up.</i>

542
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,408
<i>You don't have to give
me something like this.</i>

543
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:36,918
That was... because I was worried about
when Secretary Goo would wake up.

544
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:39,479
There was no other hidden motive behind it.

545
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,568
I retrieved the money bag.

546
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:46,848
And we discovered this.

547
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,359
There's an audio recording in here.

548
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:57,648
<i>- Secretary Goo, you just have to cause a simple fender-bender.
- Isn't it better to get rid of him while you've got the chance?</i>

549
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:03,658
<i>No, even if Ji Sung gets hurt a little bit,
the Chairwoman will send him back to France.</i>

550
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:07,639
<i>Don't complicate the matter needlessly.</i>

551
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,958
<i>There aren't any more copies
of this recording, right?</i>

552
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:13,839
<i>Of course not.</i>

553
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:19,238
Secretary Goo lied to me!

554
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,818
This is a relief.

555
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,118
Thank you.

556
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,648
Detective, thank you so much.

557
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:29,458
I found it thanks to Bok
Sil, so thank her later.

558
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:33,249
Thanks to this, your sentence
will decrease drastically.

559
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:53,229
Thank you. Seriously.

560
00:42:56,029 --> 00:43:01,999
I owe you guys so much.

561
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,629
Thank you, Louis.

562
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:33,059
So the President of Joong Won's workplace
got arrested for something shameful?

563
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,598
It must be unsettling for
the company and employees.

564
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,718
I'm more worried about my
Audrey than the company.

565
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,409
She must be having a hard time after
sending her husband off to prison.

566
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:58,868
<i>Jae Sook, sorry for always being irritable.</i>

567
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,348
<i>I haven't been in the
right mind for a while.</i>

568
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:06,129
<i>I committed a sin and I've
been so focused on that.</i>

569
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:11,078
<i>But just know that I've been
having a hard time too.</i>

570
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:13,848
<i>I will gladly pay back for what I did,</i>

571
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:17,949
<i>so stay healthy and well with Ma Ri.</i>

572
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:25,538
<i>I want to thank you for being
always kind to Louis in my place.</i>

573
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:31,389
<i>Will I ever be able to repay
you all the debts I owe you?</i>

574
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:38,019
Why did he? Why?

575
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:48,479
Why did you do this?

576
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:03,928
I looked for it everywhere. Are
you sure you left it here?

577
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:07,049
Absolutely. I'm sure.

578
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:15,498
I told you I was right.

579
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:18,918
When I came here last time,
it definitely wasn't there.

580
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:22,399
Since you are getting older,
get some reading glasses.

581
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:29,088
I still have 20/20 vision.

582
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:32,788
Stop attacking me about my age.
I'm going to get upset.

583
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:36,258
Ahjussi Seon Gu said that when you
get older, you sweat when you eat.

584
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:38,568
Becoming more tearful, is
that also because of the age?

585
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,708
Young Master...

586
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,669
Okay.

587
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:52,729
Here is the 30th anniversary music box.

588
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,469
"Go Bo Ssi"

589
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,468
Hello Go Bo Ssi.

590
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,288
You treasured him so much that you
even wrote his name down here.

591
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:09,458
I been wanting to ask you this,
but what is "Go Bo Ssi"?

592
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:12,109
Is it a name of a seed? (Ssi
means a seed in Korean.)

593
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,639
It's the name of a very cute
kid with a beautiful smile.

594
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:24,348
That kid must be living a good life, right?

595
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,679
Probably, I guess.

596
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:31,798
Anyway, it's a relief that
you got your memory back.

597
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:37,058
After your supposed death, the Chairwoman
was looking for this box everywhere.

598
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:39,668
Grandma did? Why?

599
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:43,449
Because this contains
Chairwoman's treasured memories.

600
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:47,478
Chairwoman, I finally found it.

601
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:48,648
Really?

602
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:51,769
You wanted to look at it so badly,
so look at it as much as you want.

603
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:01,599
<i>March 15, 1996. Mom, Dad, Ji Sung.</i>

604
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:08,658
I will be outside.

605
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,279
Okay.

606
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,419
Their voices... their voices...

607
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,558
I missed them so much.

608
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,059
<i>Should we jump? One.. Two... Three! Whee!</i>

609
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,319
<i>Was that fun?</i>

610
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:51,089
My son Geum Seok, daughter-in-law...

611
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:57,279
I miss you.

612
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:08,499
What should I do?

613
00:48:13,669 --> 00:48:15,589
Chairwoman...

614
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,098
Did Sister-in-law go somewhere?

615
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,998
It's brother-in-law.

616
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:26,118
Oh yeah, brother-in-law.

617
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,788
The name I learned first
got stuck in my head.

618
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:32,398
He went out to play.

619
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:36,588
It must be so hard for him to keep
his butt in contact with the floor.

620
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:40,788
It's okay if he goes out a bit. I really
wanted to wander around at that age,

621
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,159
I'm sad that I couldn't.

622
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,688
Okay.

623
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,099
Oh yeah, Louis!

624
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,229
This, this.

625
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,358
Are you giving this to me?

626
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:01,688
It's what you earned and
saved, so this is yours.

627
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,379
If there was something you
wanted to buy, go buy it.

628
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,368
Should I get a present for grandmother?

629
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:11,768
Yeah, do that.

630
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:14,728
Usually with your first paycheck, you're supposed
to buy red thermal undergarments for your parents.

631
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:17,239
Buy your grandmother some undergarments.

632
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:24,428
No. I want to buy something else.

633
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,268
What?

634
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:28,169
There's something like that.

635
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:37,638
Grandmother, I bought this with the
money I earned while working hard.

636
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:42,278
It wasn't a paycheck from Gold
Group but my real first paycheck.

637
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,848
Louis.

638
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,278
Bok Sil told me to buy red
undergarments, but I bought these.

639
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:50,559
You are a silver angel wearing high heels.

640
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:57,329
Oh my goodness, how did you choose
the ones that I really like?

641
00:49:58,009 --> 00:49:58,889
Try them on!

642
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,029
Yes, okay.

643
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,758
Aigoo, yes!

644
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:09,398
Aigoo, they fit perfectly!

645
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:12,108
How is it? Does it suit me?

646
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,158
Perfect.

647
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,928
These are high heels that were
created in this world just for you.

648
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:21,029
What really came into
this world just for me

649
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:24,839
is you, Louis.

650
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,848
Thank you so much

651
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,619
for coming to me.

652
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:34,539
Grandma...

653
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,458
- Why isn't Grandma coming?
- I'll go get her.

654
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:55,299
No, I'll go.

655
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:01,409
Grandma! My Grandma!

656
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:18,539
Grandma, get up. We set the table.

657
00:51:21,029 --> 00:51:22,749
Grandma!

658
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:30,499
Grandma.

659
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:45,579
Grandma!

660
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,129
Grandma.

661
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:58,769
Grandma...

662
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:04,539
Grandma!

663
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:19,069
I'm sorry for coming so late, Grandma.

664
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:23,059
Grandma!

665
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:48,289
Chairwoman, if you leave me like
this, what am I going to do?

666
00:53:00,939 --> 00:53:03,459
Grandma!

667
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,378
