1
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,187
Where are my golf balls?

2
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,815
Anyone seen my sun block?

3
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,152
What's the point of going to Florida
if you use sun block?

4
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,155
I don't care, I'm getting toasted.

5
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,159
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a darker shade of skin.

6
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,789
He's jealous because he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

7
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,960
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids!
The rubber sheets are packed.

8
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,545
{y:i}She wants "Ding".

9
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,214
{y:i}Behind "Ding" is 200 points!

10
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,216
{y:i}All right!

11
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,468
{y:i}That gives you 4700 points.

12
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,347
{y:i}200 points! All right!

13
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,767
Honey, are you packed yet?

14
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,394
Yes.

15
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,480
{y:i}Yes.

16
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,233
Everything I put out?

17
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,151
Yes.

18
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,820
{y:i}Yes.

19
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,614
Oh, did you see what Grandma sent you?

20
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,243
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

21
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,953
Close.

22
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,581
Inflatable clown to play with
in the pool.

23
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,458
How exciting.

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,670
Why Florida? There's no
Christmas trees in Florida.

25
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,797
What is it with Christmas trees?

26
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,967
How can you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree?

27
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,472
We'll find a nice fake silver one.
Or decorate a palm tree.

28
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,438
{y:i}Guests of "Ding, Dang, Dong"
{y:i}stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel:

29
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,232
{y:i}New York's most exciting
{y:i}hotel experience.

30
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,778
{y:i}For reservations, call toll-free,
{y:i}1-800-759...

31
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:03,118
- Where's the camcorder battery?
- I put it in the charger.

32
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,880
How's this?

33
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,965
Oh, much better.

34
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,802
Kevin, put your tie on. We'll be
late for the Christmas pageant.

35
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:25,265
It's in the bathroom. I can't go in.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

36
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:31,438
He says if I walk in there and see him
naked, I'd never feel like a real man.

37
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,399
Whatever that means.

38
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in and get your tie...

39
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,283
...get out, and don't look
at anything.

40
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,285
{y:i}Well

41
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:50,207
{y:i}This cat they're talking about
{y:i}I wonder who, could it be

42
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,335
{y:i}'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

43
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,672
{y:i}The heaviest cat you ever did see

44
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,550
{y:i}When they see me
{y:i}Walkin' down the street

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,594
{y:i}None of the fellas want to speak
{y:i}Hey, hey, hey

46
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,931
{y:i}On their faces they wear a silly smirk
{y:i}'Cause they know

47
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:11,436
{y:i}I'm the king
{y:i}Of the cool jerks

48
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:17,609
Get out of here, you pervert,
or I'll slap you silly!

49
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,282
Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.

50
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,749
{y:i}Christmas tree
{y:i}My Christmas tree

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,587
{y:i}Lit up like a star

52
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,923
{y:i}When I see
{y:i}My Christmas tree

53
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,886
{y:i}Can loved ones be far

54
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,264
{y:i}Christmas tree
{y:i}I'm certain

55
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,809
{y:i}Wherever I roam

56
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,729
Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Leslie.

57
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,315
Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Frank.

58
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,609
Okay. Frank.

59
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,862
Frank!

60
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,285
{y:i}Christmastime means laughter

61
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,122
{y:i}Toboggans in the snow

62
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,125
{y:i}Caroling together

63
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,213
{y:i}With faces aglow

64
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,591
{y:i}Stockings on the mantel

65
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,094
{y:i}A wreath on the door

66
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,681
{y:i}And my merriest Christmas

67
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,602
{y:i}Needs just one thing more

68
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,978
{y:i}Christmas tree

69
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,107
{y:i}My Christmas tree

70
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,625
Kevin!

71
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:06,635
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

72
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,809
...I'd like to apologize
for whatever displeasure...

73
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,520
...I might have caused you.
- What?

74
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,606
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

75
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:24,778
Immature or not, it was
pretty darn hilarious.

76
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,074
I also apologize to my brother.

77
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,534
Kevin.

78
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,245
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,163
Oh, Buzz...

80
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,208
...that was very nice.

81
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:46,008
Kevin, do you have something to say?

82
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,694
Beat that, you trout-sniffer.

83
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,534
I'm not sorry. I did it
because Buzz humiliated me.

84
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,329
He gets away with everything,
so I got him.

85
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,915
Since you stupidly
believe his lies...

86
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,876
...I don't care if your
Florida trip is wrecked.

87
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,922
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate?

88
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,089
Kevin!

89
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,592
You walk out,
you sleep on the 3rd floor.

90
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,053
Yeah, with me.

91
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,971
So, what else is new?

92
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,850
Don't wreck my trip.
Your dad's paying good money for it.

93
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,897
Wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

94
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,238
What a troubled young man.

95
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,452
They're all a bunch of jerks.

96
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,622
Hi.

97
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,669
Last time we tried to take a trip,
we had a problem just like this.

98
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,879
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

99
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,342
I don't care for your choice of words.
That's not what happened.

100
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,678
Buzz apologized to you.

101
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,264
Yeah, then he called me
a trout-sniffer.

102
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,517
He didn't mean it.
He was just sucking up to you.

103
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,646
Okay, why don't you just sit up here
and think things over?

104
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,483
When you're ready to apologize
to everyone, you can come down.

105
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,696
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat!

106
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,990
Then stay up here all night.

107
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,286
I don't want to go down anyway!
I can't trust anybody in this family.

108
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,248
You know what? If I had my own
money, I'd go on my own vacation.

109
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:46,545
Alone, without any of you. And I'd
have the most fun of my whole life.

110
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,673
You got your wish last year.
Maybe you will this year.

111
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,843
I hope so.

112
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,727
- We did it again!
- We did it again!

113
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,531
Our McCallisters here,
other McCallisters there.

114
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,743
I shouldn't complain, but
you give the worst wake-up calls.

115
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,497
- Do you have the tickets?
- I've got them. Here's your family's.

116
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,582
- How many do you have?
- Seven.

117
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,378
- We have seven.
- 14!

118
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,840
Seven...

119
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,924
...eight...

120
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,553
...nine, ten.
- How come we're not sitting together?

121
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:23,433
This time of year, we're lucky to get
on the same plane. 11, 12, 13.

122
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,062
Where's Kevin?

123
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,647
14.

124
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:34,570
Good thing I have my own ticket,
just in case you try to ditch me.

125
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,414
- Come on.
- I need batteries.

126
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,916
I'll give them to you on the plane.

127
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,377
- Here's two more.
- Why not now?

128
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,881
Not now! What's the gate number?

129
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,008
H-17.

130
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,720
Better hurry, it's the last gate.
Dad, what gate is it?

131
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,306
H-17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

132
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,975
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
Take my bag.

133
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,604
Come on. Come on.

134
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,465
{y:i}American Airlines
{y:i}flight 226 to New York...

135
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,928
{y:i}... is now in the final
{y:i}boarding process.

136
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,308
Come on. Come on!

137
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,686
Dad, wait up!

138
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,609
Dad, wait up!

139
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,195
Wait up!

140
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,697
Wait!

141
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,284
Come on, come on!

142
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,166
Dad, wait!

143
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,257
Here we are! Here!

144
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,593
We made it.

145
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,429
Everybody here? We made it?
All right.

146
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,557
Please board, the plane's leaving.

147
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,727
- I'll make sure everyone gets on.
- We'll get everyone on.

148
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,021
Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.

149
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,400
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

150
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,194
Hey, wait up!

151
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,656
Hey, guys, wait for me!

152
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,783
- Cutting it kind of close.
- Yes.

153
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,869
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

154
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,496
Wait!

155
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,999
Wait!

156
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,419
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Are you on this flight?

157
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,256
Yeah. My family's on the plane.
I don't want to be left here.

158
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,967
- Do you have a boarding pass?
- Somewhere...

159
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,594
They're ready to go.

160
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,928
He dropped his pass.

161
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,682
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

162
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,601
You sure your family's onboard?

163
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,521
My dad ran in right before
I bumped into this lady.

164
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,609
Board him. Make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

165
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,862
Okay. Come on.

166
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,866
Do you see your family?

167
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,201
There's my dad.

168
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,913
- Find an empty seat. Merry Christmas.
- You too.

169
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,373
{y:i}In order to push back from the gate...

170
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:38,337
{y:i}... all passengers must have
{y:i}their seat belts fastened.

171
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:09,618
So have you ever been to Florida?

172
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:38,355
{y:i}Welcome aboard American Airlines
{y:i}flight 176 non-stop to New York.

173
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,201
{y:i}I didn't think we'd make it.

174
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,413
Something wrong?

175
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,081
Honey?

176
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,750
I have that feeling.

177
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,503
We forgot something?

178
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,674
No, I don't think we did,
but I just have that feeling.

179
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,467
Just bad memories.

180
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:12,055
We did everything, brought everything.
We have everybody.

181
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,517
There's nothing to worry about.

182
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,898
{y:i}Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
{y:i}You're right. We're fine.

183
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,693
{y:i}Nothing to worry about.

184
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,255
Mom?

185
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,758
Dad?

186
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,178
Uncle Frank?

187
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,889
Buzz?

188
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:04,316
We're the last ones off the plane.

189
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:11,281
Where are those guys?

190
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,412
Is this Megan's?
It's Brooke's.

191
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,874
Give this to Brooke, this to Kevin.

192
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,086
- Give this... Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

193
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,462
Give this to Kevin.

194
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,797
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

195
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,174
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

196
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,385
- Give this to Kevin.
- Kevin.

197
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,806
- Give this to Kevin.
- Here you go, Kevin.

198
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,856
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

199
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,525
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

200
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,319
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

201
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,030
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

202
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,699
Kevin's not here.

203
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,535
Kevin's not here.

204
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,580
What!

205
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,793
Kevin!

206
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,157
Excuse me, this is an emergency!

207
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,366
Yes, sir?

208
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,453
What city is that?

209
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,247
That's New York.

210
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:46,001
Yikes, I did it again!

211
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,341
Something wrong, sir?

212
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,346
I'll be fine.

213
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:10,609
Oh, no. My family's in Florida
and I'm in New York.

214
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,071
My family's in Florida?

215
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,073
I'm in...

216
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,660
...New York?

217
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,981
Wow.

218
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,390
What's the child's name?

219
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,310
- Kevin.
- K-E-V-I-N.

220
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,479
When did you see him last?

221
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,772
Curbside check-in?

222
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:16,193
No, I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

223
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:21,031
Most people get separated at security.
Did everyone get through security?

224
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,242
I don't know. Peter...

225
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,620
We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.

226
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,249
When did you notice he was missing?

227
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,836
When we picked up our baggage here.

228
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,005
- Has the boy ever run away from home?
- No.

229
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:41,552
Has he ever been in a situation
on his own?

230
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,308
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

231
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,563
It's becoming a McCallister
family travel tradition.

232
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:57,734
Funnily enough,
we never lose our luggage.

233
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:12,207
He was left at home,
by accident, last year.

234
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:18,797
That's what my wife meant calling it
a McCallister family travel tradition.

235
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,716
We'll call Chicago and...

236
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,218
...notify them of the situation.

237
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,305
The odds are that's where he is.

238
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,015
Thanks.

239
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,561
Very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

240
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,244
Watch out, kid!

241
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,884
Yo, where's your manifest?

242
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,640
Here we are, Marv, New York City.

243
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,768
The land of opportunity.

244
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,770
Smell that?

245
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,812
Yeah.

246
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,481
Know what that is?

247
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,484
- Fish.
- It's freedom.

248
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,361
No, it's fish.

249
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,614
- It's freedom and it's money.
- Okay, okay.

250
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:26,740
It's freedom.

251
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,576
Come on, let's go before
someone sees us.

252
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,829
And it's fish.

253
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,545
Yes, one quick score.

254
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,464
We get ourselves
some phony passports...

255
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,968
...and we hightail it
to some foreign country.

256
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:49,096
Arizona?

257
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,893
That's very smart, Marv.

258
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:58,313
You bust out of jail to rob 14 cents
from a Santy Claus?

259
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,815
Every bit helps.

260
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:03,026
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

261
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,946
We're the Sticky Bandits!

262
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,906
Real cute.

263
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,201
Very cute.

264
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:32,014
"The Plaza Hotel. New York's most
exciting hotel experience."

265
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,653
Sick!

266
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,752
What's the matter?

267
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:47,339
Thought I saw something.

268
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,981
Serves you right! Come on, let's go.

269
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,568
I think she likes me.

270
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,279
Ahh.

271
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,813
Excuse me, where's the lobby?

272
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:49,484
- Down the hall and to the left.
- Thanks.

273
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,708
Wow.

274
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,009
{y:i}Guests of
{y:i}the new "Celebrity Ding-Dang-Dong"...

275
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,887
{y:i}... stay at the world-renowned
{y:i}Plaza Hotel:

276
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,556
{y:i}New York's most exciting
{y:i}hotel experience.

277
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,600
{y:i}For reservations, call toll-free...

278
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,980
{y:i}... 1-800-759-3000.

279
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,858
I'll do just that.

280
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,819
Howdy-do. This is Peter
McCallister. The father.

281
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,696
I'd like a hotel room.

282
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:37,407
With an extra-large bed, a TV...

283
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:41,078
...and one of those little
refrigerators with a key.

284
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,790
Credit card? You got it.

285
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,169
Plaza Reservations, may I help you?

286
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,005
{y:i}Howdy-do. This is Peter McCallister.

287
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,715
{y:i}The father.

288
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,759
{y:i}Yes, sir.
{y:i}- I'd like a hotel room.

289
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,263
{y:i}Yes.
{y:i}- With an extra-large bed, a TV...

290
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,767
{y:i}... and one of those little
{y:i}refrigerators with a key.

291
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,144
You'll need a major credit card.

292
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:09,523
{y:i}Credit card? You got it.

293
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:13,527
{y:i}Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

294
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:19,241
Yes, two at eight, Henri.
Mr. Yamamoto.

295
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,994
Hold on a second.

296
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,125
I'll call you back.

297
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,504
Hi.

298
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,842
Can I help you?

299
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,304
Reservation for McCallister.

300
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,098
A reservation for yourself?

301
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:47,811
My feet are hardly touching the ground.
I can barely see over the counter.

302
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,522
How can I make a reservation
for a room?

303
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:55,360
Think about it: A kid going into
a hotel making a reservation?

304
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,280
I don't think so.

305
00:28:58,447 --> 00:28:59,990
I'm confused.

306
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,869
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

307
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,498
I hate meetings. I'm not allowed
to go in, only to sit in the lobby.

308
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:09,875
That's boring.

309
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,669
So my dad dropped me off.

310
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,131
Gave me his credit card and said
to have check-in...

311
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,510
...let me in the room
so I won't get into mischief.

312
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,722
Ma'am, sometimes I do
get into mischief.

313
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,059
We all do.

314
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:31,313
Merry Christmas.

315
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,440
No sign of him.

316
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,568
We'll need to be in touch.
You have hotel rooms?

317
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:41,698
- Yeah.
- Do you have a recent photo of him?

318
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:45,160
I have one in my wallet.

319
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,829
I don't have my wallet.

320
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,249
My wallet's in my bag.

321
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:54,336
Kevin was looking in my bag at
the airport. He has my wallet.

322
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,464
- Did you have credit cards?
- Credit cards, money...

323
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,008
We'll notify the credit card
companies.

324
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:04,847
If your son has the cards, we can get
a location on him when he uses them.

325
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:09,518
I don't think he knows
how to use a credit card.

326
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,564
Wow! It worked!

327
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,151
- Cedric.
- Yes?

328
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:21,822
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

329
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:27,160
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

330
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,539
Front, please!

331
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,794
Enjoy your stay with us.

332
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,964
Don't forget to remind
your dad, when he arrives...

333
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,092
...he must come down and
sign a couple of things.

334
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:47,139
- Thank you, you've been helpful.
May I take your bag?

335
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,477
Up here to your left.

336
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:55,397
Herbert Hoover
once stayed on this floor.

337
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,982
The vacuum guy?

338
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,986
No, the president.

339
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:08,702
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

340
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,504
This is great!

341
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:27,471
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

342
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:37,022
Luxurious and spacious.

343
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,488
How convenient.

344
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:49,368
Hey.

345
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,872
Did you want the key in the bag?
Or did you want to hang on to it?

346
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,042
I'll hang on to it.

347
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,504
Everything all right?

348
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,215
- Is the temperature okay?
- It's okay.

349
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:08,095
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

350
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:11,265
Well...

351
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,144
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:24,236
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

353
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,948
Thank you.

354
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:57,019
Would you mind if I worked
on my cannonballs?

355
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:58,812
No.

356
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,440
Thanks.

357
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,538
Yikes!

358
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:39,478
This is a vacation.

359
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,772
{y:i}Hold it right there!

360
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,607
{y:i}It's me, Johnny.

361
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,526
{y:i}I knew it was you.

362
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:49,571
{y:i}I could smell you getting off
{y:i}the elevator.

363
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,492
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three, I'm not driving.

364
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:57,913
{y:i}Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.
- Thank you.

365
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,041
{y:i}You was here last night too,
{y:i}wasn't you?

366
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,544
{y:i}I was singing at the Blue Monkey
{y:i}last night.

367
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,380
She was not.
She was smooching your brother.

368
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,217
{y:i}You was here and you was
{y:i}smooching with my brother.

369
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,052
{y:i}That's a dirty lie.
- See?

370
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:15,180
{y:i}Don't give me that.
{y:i}You been smooching everybody!

371
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,933
{y:i}Snuffy, Al, Leo...

372
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:22,563
{y:i}... Little Moe with the gimpy leg,
{y:i}Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...

373
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,606
{y:i}I could go on forever, baby.

374
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,483
{y:i}You have me all wrong!

375
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:27,651
{y:i}All right...

376
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,194
{y:i}... I believe you.

377
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:32,030
{y:i}But my Tommy gun don't!

378
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,866
{y:i}Johnny!

379
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,909
{y:i}You're the only duck in my pond!

380
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,787
{y:i}Get down on your knees
{y:i}and tell me you love me.

381
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,832
{y:i}Baby! I'm over the moon for you!

382
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,418
{y:i}You gotta do better than that!

383
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:50,883
{y:i}If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have
{y:i}to take two planes to get across it.

384
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,845
{y:i}Maybe I'm off my hinges,
{y:i}but I believe you.

385
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,139
{y:i}That's why I'm letting you go.

386
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:01,643
{y:i}I'm gonna give you till the count
{y:i}of three, to get your lousy...

387
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:02,936
{y:i}... lying...

388
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:07,107
{y:i}... lowdown, four-flushing carcass
{y:i}out my door!

389
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,026
She's rat bait.

390
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,320
{y:i}One!

391
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,947
{y:i}Two!

392
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,789
{y:i}Three!

393
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,461
{y:i}Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

394
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,423
{y:i}And a Happy New Year.

395
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,499
Housekeeping.

396
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,460
{y:i}We know a guy who can do the cool jerk

397
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,965
{y:i}We know a guy who can do the cool jerk

398
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,635
{y:i}This cat they're talkin' about

399
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,513
{y:i}I wonder who could it be

400
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,683
{y:i}'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

401
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,853
{y:i}The heaviest cat you ever did see

402
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,772
{y:i}When they see me
{y:i}Walkin' down the street

403
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:13,650
{y:i}None of the fellas want to speak
{y:i}Hey, hey, hey

404
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,778
{y:i}On their faces they wear a silly smirk
{y:i}'Cause they know

405
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:22,910
{y:i}I'm the king of the cool jerks

406
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:28,916
{y:i}Get out of here, you pervert,
{y:i}or I'll slap you silly!

407
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,752
Uh...

408
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:36,715
{y:i}Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.

409
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,469
Oh, my foot!

410
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,921
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

411
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,230
Uncle Rob lives here.

412
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,525
If they're back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

413
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:40,946
They usually give pretty
good presents.

414
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,840
Good night, Mom.

415
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:49,139
Good night, Kevin.

416
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,208
Your drawers, sir.

417
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:21,255
Don't flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!

418
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,298
I was very careful, sir.

419
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,134
You can't be too careful
with underwear.

420
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,011
I understand.

421
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:31,014
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

422
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:36,812
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

423
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,188
No tip?

424
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,524
Okay.

425
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:44,611
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

426
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,366
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi...

427
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,035
Mr. McCallister.

428
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,205
Excuse me.

429
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:58,166
Sure.

430
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,837
And how are we this morning?

431
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,215
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

432
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,843
A limousine and a pizza.

433
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,179
Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

434
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:13,348
I do hope your father understands
that last night...

435
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,102
...I was simply checking to see
that everything was in order.

436
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,979
Oh, he was pretty mad.

437
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,189
He was?

438
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:24,401
He said he didn't come here
to have his naked rear spied on.

439
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,153
Of course not.

440
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,363
Will he be down soon?

441
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,325
He already left.

442
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,871
I would've liked to have offered
my personal apology.

443
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:39,833
If a guy saw you in the shower,
would you want to see him?

444
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,627
I suppose not.

445
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:44,588
I don't think you'll see him again.

446
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,424
I understand.

447
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:50,302
Bye.

448
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,681
Have a lovely day.

449
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:06,068
McCallister...

450
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:21,583
- Good morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Morning.

451
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,509
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own...

452
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,887
...cheese pizza.

453
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,451
- Hello?
- Hello.

454
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,453
Know any good toy stores?

455
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:01,707
Yes, sir.

456
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,595
Ahh.

457
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:21,226
Bingo!

458
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,035
Get outta here! Go on, get
outta here! Get outta here!

459
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,537
Beat it! Beat it! Get outta here!

460
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:46,043
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I gotta talk to you!

461
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:57,721
Whoa, whoa!

462
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,227
- Would you like a scarf?
- Forget about that, we gotta talk.

463
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:08,106
We don't have the equipment to pull off
anything big: Banks, jewelry stores...

464
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:12,236
We don't want goods.
We need cash and we need it now.

465
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:13,737
How about...

466
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,197
...hotels?

467
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,115
Tourists carry lots of cash.

468
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:22,496
I got a better idea. Stores ain't
depositing cash on Christmas Eve.

469
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:27,709
The stores that will have cash are the
ones dealing in moderate priced goods.

470
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,169
Right. Right.

471
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:33,131
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve...

472
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,843
...that nobody's gonna rob?

473
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,220
Candy stores.

474
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,265
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.

475
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,852
This is what I had in mind:

476
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:49,815
That's brilliant, Harry! Brilliant!

477
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,319
Nobody's dumb enough to knock off
a toy store on Christmas Eve.

478
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,990
Oh, yes, there is.

479
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,802
Here we are, sir: Duncan's Toy Chest.

480
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:22,806
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

481
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:08,227
This is the greatest accident
of my life.

482
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,995
Marv. Marv!

483
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:31,834
Hey, nice house.
But there's no bathroom in it.

484
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,211
So, what's the plan?

485
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:40,676
Everyone leaves for a holiday off.
We come out of our houses.

486
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,595
Yeah, then what?

487
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:46,181
We empty the registers and walk out.

488
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,309
Great plan, Harry!

489
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,354
Well, now, thank you
and Merry Christmas.

490
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:56,233
Say hello to the family.

491
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,612
Let me see.

492
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,531
You shopping alone?

493
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:06,201
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

494
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,496
- I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

495
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,164
Oh, well, thank you.

496
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:12,875
My pleasure.

497
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:19,173
That'll be $23.75.

498
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:23,427
My, my, my.
Where did you get all that money?

499
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,805
- I have a lot of grandmothers.
- Oh.

500
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:30,225
Well, that explains it.

501
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:35,105
This is a nice store. One of the
finer toy dealerships I've visited.

502
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,356
Well, thank you.

503
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,525
Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...

504
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,862
...letting kids come in here
and play with his toys.

505
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:43,989
Most toy stores prohibit that.

506
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,407
- Is that so?
- Yes.

507
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:47,910
Well, he loves kids.

508
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,289
As a matter of fact, all the money
the store takes in today...

509
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,667
...Mr. Duncan is donating
to the Children's Hospital.

510
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,003
And the day after Christmas...

511
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,381
...we empty out all the money
in the cash register...

512
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,927
...and Mr. Duncan takes it
right down to the hospital.

513
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,428
That's generous of him.

514
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,015
Well, children bring him
a lot of joy...

515
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:15,062
...as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

516
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:24,154
I'm not supposed to spend this, but
I have $20 in a jar in our garage...

517
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:28,367
...where my brother can't find it.
So I can pay my mother back.

518
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,579
So give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

519
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:38,961
Besides, I'll probably spend it on
stuff that will rot my teeth and mind.

520
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:44,216
Ah, that's...
That's very sweet of you.

521
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:46,510
You see that tree there?

522
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,389
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity...

523
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,308
...I'll let you select an object
from that tree...

524
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,563
...to take home with you.
- For free?

525
00:48:57,813 --> 00:49:00,732
- May I make a suggestion?
- Okay.

526
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:03,485
Take the turtledoves.

527
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:05,028
I can have two?

528
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,658
Well, "two turtledoves".
And I tell you what you do.

529
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,660
You keep one...

530
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,039
...and give the other one
to a very special person.

531
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,417
You see, turtledoves...

532
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,753
...are a symbol of friendship
and love.

533
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:25,465
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove...

534
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,302
...you'll be friends forever.

535
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:32,681
Wow, I never knew that. I thought
they were just part of a song.

536
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:37,519
They are. And for that
very special reason.

537
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:38,854
Wow.

538
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:40,105
Thanks.

539
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,565
Merry Christmas.

540
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,859
Merry Christmas to you too.

541
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,487
Be sure to bundle up if you
go outside. It's nippy.

542
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:51,783
Oh. I'll do that.

543
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,071
Well, where to?

544
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:33,700
You promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

545
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:44,795
Hey, look who it is.

546
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,133
Come on, let's get him.

547
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,182
Hi, pal.

548
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,953
Come on.

549
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,845
Hey!

550
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,560
Hey, watch it, man!

551
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:46,857
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.
Two for $5. Two for $5.

552
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,734
Four for 10.

553
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,444
There he is!

554
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,487
All right.

555
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:56,533
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas, dude.

556
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,564
Whoa!

557
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:31,109
Oh...

558
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,861
Yes!

559
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:37,991
Thank you for your suggestion.
My duty. My pleasure.

560
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,879
Help! There's two guys after me!

561
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,967
What's the matter?
Store wouldn't take your...

562
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:57,928
...stolen credit card?

563
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:02,683
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

564
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,690
Get up! Get up!

565
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,110
Come on! Let's go get him.

566
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:17,906
Get back here, you little thief!

567
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,910
Stop that child!

568
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:27,040
Grab him!

569
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:33,797
Whoa!

570
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:43,724
You little sh...

571
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,435
I've committed credit card fraud.

572
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,604
Get me security!

573
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:51,899
We've got to stop that delinquent!

574
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:56,653
Come along, Cedric!

575
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:18,217
I've had enough of this vacation.
I'm going home.

576
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,479
{y:i}Hold it!

577
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,941
This is the Concierge, sir!

578
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:35,901
{y:i}I knew it was you.

579
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:39,780
{y:i}I could smell you
{y:i}getting off the elevator.

580
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:44,660
{y:i}You was here last night too,
{y:i}wasn't you?

581
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,412
Yes, sir.

582
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:48,914
I was.

583
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:53,085
{y:i}You was here and you was smooching
{y:i}with my brother.

584
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,921
Bu...

585
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,340
You're mistaken, sir.

586
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,510
{y:i}Don't give me that.
{y:i}You've smooched everybody.

587
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,223
{y:i}Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Moe
{y:i}with the gimpy leg...

588
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,143
{y:i}... Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...

589
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:15,065
No!

590
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:16,733
It's a lie!

591
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,611
{y:i}I could go on forever, baby.

592
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:22,447
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

593
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,741
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

594
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,702
We're looking for a young man.

595
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,413
{y:i}All right, I believe you...

596
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,666
{y:i}... but my Tommy gun don't.

597
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:36,879
{y:i}Get down on your knees
{y:i}and tell me you love me.

598
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:41,550
On your knees.

599
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,811
I love you!

600
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:57,691
{y:i}You gotta do better than that!

601
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:01,445
I love you!

602
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,572
{y:i}Maybe I'm off my hinges...

603
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:04,865
{y:i}... but I believe you.

604
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,160
{y:i}That's why I'm gonna let you go.

605
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,664
{y:i}I'm gonna give you till the count
{y:i}of three to get your lousy...

606
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,875
{y:i}... lying, low-down...

607
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:19,129
{y:i}... four-flushing carcass out my door!

608
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:20,923
{y:i}- One!
- Open the door!

609
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,592
{y:i}Two!

610
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,232
{y:i}Three.

611
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:43,070
{y:i}Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

612
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,658
{y:i}And a happy new year.

613
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:51,870
Stay in your rooms!
This is an emergency!

614
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,042
There's an insane guest with a gun!

615
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,887
No!

616
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:14,142
Come to Papa!

617
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,230
Round trip to Miami. What's the
matter, get on the wrong plane?

618
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,232
You won't be needing this.

619
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:26,238
American don't fly to the
promised land, little buddy.

620
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:30,784
We spent 9 months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

621
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:32,452
We were wrong.

622
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:36,206
We busted out and we're doing fine.
Even better...

623
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,835
...because we're not robbing houses,
we're robbing toy stores.

624
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:43,213
At midnight tonight,
we'll hit Duncan's Toy Chest.

625
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,174
Five floors of cash.

626
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:49,011
Then after that, we grab some
phony passports and go to Rio.

627
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:53,056
- You want to shut up?
- He's not gonna talk to anybody.

628
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:55,309
Except maybe a fish.

629
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,602
Or the undertaker.

630
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:03,358
Let's go to the subway tunnel.
I'll feel better once I get him on ice.

631
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:05,194
I've got a gun.

632
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:10,657
Say anything and you'll be spitting
gum out through your forehead.

633
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,304
Well, hello.

634
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,266
He did it!

635
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:39,102
Did what?

636
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,398
Thanks!

637
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,110
Go get him.
He went in the park.

638
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:50,697
What are you doing flirting?!

639
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,609
Over there!

640
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,701
Don't!
Give it!

641
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,160
Hey, Harry.

642
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,704
- I got him.
- Let me see!

643
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:42,291
That ain't him! Put him down.
That ain't him.

644
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:46,837
We should've shot him. I hate pulling
a job, knowing that creep's loose.

645
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:50,591
- What can he do? Kids are helpless.
- Not this kid.

646
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:55,220
But this time he doesn't have a house
full of dangerous goodies.

647
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,224
He's in the park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the park.

648
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:04,479
Yeah. Grown men come in the park
and don't leave alive.

649
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,066
Good luck, little fella.

650
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,786
{y:i}I want to go home.

651
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:23,498
{y:i}Mom, where are you?

652
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,530
Turn that down!

653
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:56,365
- Hello?
{y:i}Kate McCallister.

654
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,158
- This is she.
{y:i}- We found him.

655
01:00:58,408 --> 01:00:59,826
- Oh, my God!
- What?

656
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,037
- They know where Kevin is.
- Where?

657
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,248
{y:i}- He's in New York City.
- New York!

658
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,292
New York?

659
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,919
What?

660
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:12,214
- He's scared, he's not a troublemaker.
- What? What?

661
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:17,386
Just a second. He used your credit
card to check into the Plaza Hotel.

662
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,263
- Do they have him?
- Is he there?

663
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:21,765
{y:i}- No, they're still looking.
- Damn it!

664
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,560
{y:i}- Get to New York.
- We're on the next flight out.

665
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,979
Thanks.
We're going to New York, move it!

666
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,481
Yes!

667
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:33,944
He ran away when they asked about
the card. He must be scared!

668
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,281
- Would he go to my brother's?
- Aren't they in Paris?

669
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:42,536
- Maybe they have a housesitter.
- Aren't they renovating?

670
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:23,160
Hello?!

671
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,163
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

672
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,916
Anybody home?!

673
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:30,584
Hello!

674
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,419
Anybody home?

675
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:35,756
It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

676
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,716
Uncle Rob!

677
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,094
Aunt Georgette!

678
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:26,640
Watch it, kid!

679
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:36,400
You looking for someone
to read you a bedtime story?

680
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,824
Taxi!

681
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:58,964
It's scary out there.

682
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,050
Ain't much better in here.

683
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:32,623
I don't ever want to take a vacation
like this again.

684
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,362
Where did you come from?

685
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,447
I don't have enough for everybody.

686
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:09,535
How hungry are you guys?

687
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:13,247
You guys ate all my food.

688
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:17,394
I'm sorry I screamed in your face.
You were trying to help me, right?

689
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:21,899
I'm Kevin McCallister.

690
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:24,693
Your birds are real nice.

691
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,320
I've seen you before.

692
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,655
You had pigeons all over you.

693
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:33,243
At first, you look scary, but when
I think about it, it's not so bad.

694
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:37,581
They must like you to be all over you.

695
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,167
If I'm bothering you, I can leave.

696
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,378
Am I bothering you?

697
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:45,297
No.

698
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:49,426
Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?

699
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,971
No.

700
01:06:55,933 --> 01:07:00,395
Will the pigeons come back
on their own or do you call them?

701
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,950
Give me your hand.

702
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:19,081
They can hear it.

703
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:37,641
This is great!

704
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:41,812
It's pretty cold out.

705
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:45,691
I'd sure like a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you?

706
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:48,318
My treat.

707
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:54,408
I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

708
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:56,743
Can we go someplace warm?

709
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:57,911
Yes.

710
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:01,164
I know a place.

711
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,713
Nice music.

712
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:52,216
This place is great.

713
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:56,803
I've heard the world's
great music from here.

714
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,348
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.

715
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:01,391
Frank Sinatra.

716
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:05,270
Luciano Pavarotti.

717
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,236
Do you bring your friends here?

718
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:15,322
I haven't got many friends.

719
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,324
Sorry.

720
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:20,410
I'm like the birds I care for.

721
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:24,790
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

722
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,417
They prefer I wasn't in their city.

723
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:32,548
Yeah. It's like that with my family.
I'm like the pigeon of the house...

724
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,008
...just because I'm the youngest.

725
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:37,469
Everyone fights for position.

726
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,388
Everyone wants to be seen...

727
01:09:39,638 --> 01:09:40,889
...and heard.

728
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:42,224
I guess so.

729
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:48,480
I'm seen and heard pretty much.
But I get sent to my room a lot too.

730
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:52,401
I wasn't always like this.

731
01:09:52,651 --> 01:09:55,112
What were you like before?

732
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,323
I had a job. I had a home.

733
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:02,327
- I had a family.
- Any kids?

734
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:04,121
No.

735
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,456
I wanted them.

736
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:10,919
But the man I loved
fell out of love with me.

737
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,005
That broke my heart.

738
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:16,633
When the chance
to be loved came along again...

739
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:19,178
...I ran away from it.

740
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,513
I stopped trusting people.

741
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:25,767
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

742
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:29,104
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

743
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,773
Sometimes you can trust a person...

744
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:36,486
...and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

745
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,530
Maybe they're just too busy.

746
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,534
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

747
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:44,703
People don't mean to forget.

748
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:46,622
My grandfather says...

749
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:51,418
...if my head wasn't screwed on,
I'd leave it on the school bus.

750
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:55,589
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone,
I'll get my heart broken.

751
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,090
I understand.

752
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,718
I had a nice pair of Rollerblades.

753
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:02,262
I was afraid to wreck them...

754
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:06,183
...so I kept them in a box.
Do you know what happened?

755
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:12,481
I outgrew them. I never wore them
outside. Only in my room a few times.

756
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:16,944
A person's heart and feelings
are very different than skates.

757
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:19,238
They're kind of the same thing.

758
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:22,908
If you won't use your heart,
who cares if it gets broken?

759
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:26,870
If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.

760
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,499
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

761
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:34,628
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

762
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,922
Little truth in there somewhere.

763
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:41,593
I think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

764
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:45,305
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be so nice.

765
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:48,267
Thank you.

766
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,728
Do you know it's been...

767
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:55,023
...a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?

768
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:57,192
That's okay. You're good at it.

769
01:11:57,442 --> 01:12:00,112
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit.

770
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:02,072
You should do it more often.

771
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:07,119
Just wear an outfit
with no pigeon poop on it.

772
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:12,291
I have been working very hard
at keeping people away.

773
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:15,127
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...

774
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:18,046
...but when I'm alone, it's not fun.

775
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:20,883
I don't care how much people bug me...

776
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:24,386
...I'd rather be with someone
than alone.

777
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:27,890
So what are you doing alone
on Christmas Eve?

778
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,350
Did you get into trouble?

779
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:31,518
Yeah.

780
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,187
You did something wrong?

781
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:36,356
A lot of things.

782
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:40,986
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

783
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,906
It's late. I don't know
if I'll have enough time...

784
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:47,284
...to do enough good deeds
to erase all my bad ones.

785
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,787
It's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count extra tonight.

786
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:53,707
- They do?
- Of course they do.

787
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:57,878
Think of an important
thing you can do for others...

788
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:59,838
...and go do it.

789
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:04,343
Just follow the star in your heart.

790
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,595
Okay.

791
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:11,058
It's getting pretty late.
I'd better get going.

792
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:20,192
If I don't see you, I hope
everything turns out okay.

793
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,236
Thank you.

794
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,279
Tell the birds I said goodbye.

795
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,366
I will.

796
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,332
Merry Christmas.

797
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:36,834
Merry Christmas.

798
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:40,295
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

799
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:43,257
I won't forget to remember you.

800
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:47,594
Don't make promises you can't keep.

801
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,862
{y:i}All the money in the registers...

802
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:50,991
{y:i}... Mr. Duncan is gonna donate
{y:i}to the Children's Hospital.

803
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:54,912
{y:i}At midnight tonight,
{y:i}we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

804
01:14:55,162 --> 01:15:01,668
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

805
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:24,228
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite.

806
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:26,939
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.

807
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:32,069
I think you'll find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by a countess.

808
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,197
What kind of hotel lets a child
check in alone?

809
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:37,783
The boy had a very convincing story.

810
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,661
What kind of idiots work here?

811
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,372
The finest in New York.

812
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:46,124
When you learned the credit card...

813
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,293
I made the discovery.

814
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:50,629
Why did you let him leave?

815
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,881
We confronted him and he ran!

816
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,216
You scared him!

817
01:17:54,466 --> 01:18:00,347
It's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost in a huge city.

818
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:05,185
Take our family and luggage
up to the room.

819
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,436
Yes, sir!

820
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,272
Run along, Cedric.

821
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:11,942
I'll go to the police station to make
sure they're looking for Kevin.

822
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:13,902
I want you to stay here.

823
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:16,321
- I'm going to look for him.
- What?

824
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:21,702
With all due respect, your son is lost
in one of the world's biggest cities.

825
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,121
Could you stay out of this?

826
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:25,706
As you wish.

827
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:30,711
Thank you. It's not a good idea
to run around New York City alone.

828
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:32,588
If Kevin can, so can I.

829
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:33,922
- Kate...
- I'll be fine.

830
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:38,635
The way I feel, no mugger
or murderer would mess with me.

831
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:44,183
There are hundreds of armed
parasites out there!

832
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:49,021
Do bundle up.
It's awfully cold outside.

833
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:23,347
Marv. Marv.

834
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:26,850
Come on, let's go.

835
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,079
Marv.

836
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:50,624
Crowbars up!

837
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:58,507
Merry Christmas, Harry!

838
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:05,138
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

839
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:16,066
This is more money
than I can even count!

840
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:22,114
It makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing homes.

841
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:37,087
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law...

842
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:42,926
...we're up to our elbows in cash
and nobody even knows about it.

843
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:48,807
He's back!

844
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,017
He took our picture!

845
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:53,103
How was my hair?

846
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:01,403
This is it. No turning back.

847
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:05,324
Another Christmas in the trenches.

848
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:08,702
No!

849
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:13,999
Wow.

850
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:18,003
That's it! Get the money!
Get it!

851
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:25,385
I'll kill him!

852
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:29,932
- Marv!
- I'm coming, Harry!

853
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:40,442
Harry?

854
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:43,278
Harry!

855
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:46,156
That was incredible.

856
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,161
- I twisted my ankle.
- Where is he?

857
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:55,165
Hey, guys! Smile!

858
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,835
Come on! Come on!

859
01:21:58,085 --> 01:21:59,920
- Help me.
- I got you.

860
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,090
I got you.

861
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:31,827
Taxi!

862
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:38,917
Times Square!

863
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:01,398
Where'd he go?

864
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:04,776
I'm up here! Come get me!

865
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:06,904
Let's kill!

866
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:08,864
Hold on, pea-brain.

867
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:12,868
We got busted because we underestimated
that bundle of misery.

868
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:14,578
This ain't like that.

869
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:19,333
This ain't his house. The kid's
running scared. He ain't got a plan.

870
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:23,170
May I do the thinking, please?

871
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,131
Thank you.

872
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:27,883
Sonny!

873
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:29,426
Yes?

874
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:33,597
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

875
01:23:33,847 --> 01:23:36,975
Knocking off a youngster
won't mean that much to me.

876
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:38,852
- Understand?
- Mm-hm.

877
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:42,689
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

878
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:47,402
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

879
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:51,573
You'll never hear from us again.
Okay?

880
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:53,408
Promise?

881
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:57,663
I cross my heart and hope to die.

882
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:01,083
Okay!

883
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:06,505
Okay, kid...

884
01:24:06,755 --> 01:24:09,842
...give it to me.

885
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,184
Direct hit!

886
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:27,359
How many fingers am I holding up?

887
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:31,113
Eight?

888
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:37,119
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

889
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:40,497
Don't do that!

890
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:47,546
If you can't do any better than that,
you're going to lose.

891
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:49,298
Harry...

892
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,134
...no.

893
01:24:57,014 --> 01:25:00,517
You got any more?

894
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:05,564
Get up.
He don't have any more bricks.

895
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:13,864
What?

896
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,992
What?

897
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:20,579
What?

898
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:25,626
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it. Come on!

899
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:29,713
You go this way. I'll go around back.

900
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:35,302
Harry?

901
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:37,930
Harry?

902
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:42,226
Harry?

903
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:06,625
Huh?

904
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:07,579
Harry!

905
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:11,333
I reached the top!

906
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,182
Ahh.

907
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:06,013
You better do better than this.

908
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:30,704
Wow!

909
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:34,333
What a hole!

910
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:56,605
Whoa!

911
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:14,665
Uh-oh.

912
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:44,027
Ah!

913
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:43,749
Harry.

914
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:06,271
I'm coming up!

915
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:13,362
Uh-oh.

916
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:23,205
I'm gonna murder that kid!

917
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:42,516
Yes!

918
01:34:47,938 --> 01:34:50,691
Whoa.

919
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:01,952
Whoa, whoa!

920
01:35:10,919 --> 01:35:12,171
Hey!

921
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:15,257
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

922
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:19,303
Harry! In the living room!

923
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:22,514
He went up the ladder!

924
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,280
Oh.

925
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,574
I'm coming, Harry.

926
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:43,493
I'm coming.

927
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:49,917
Harry!

928
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:54,505
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

929
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:55,631
Hey!

930
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,799
Try the stairs.

931
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:01,053
Right.

932
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:04,389
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

933
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,017
Remember last year?

934
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:08,477
No.

935
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:10,687
Watch this.

936
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:14,316
Let's get him!

937
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:17,736
Ow!

938
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:21,281
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

939
01:36:21,532 --> 01:36:23,033
That's one.

940
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:25,827
Don't worry, Harry.

941
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:29,414
I'll get him.

942
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:34,253
Ow!

943
01:36:34,503 --> 01:36:37,506
Right in the schnoz.

944
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:38,882
That's two.

945
01:36:39,132 --> 01:36:42,219
Come on, let's get him.

946
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,098
Oops.

947
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:53,772
That's...

948
01:36:54,022 --> 01:36:56,900
...three.

949
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:03,824
No.

950
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:08,036
That's four.

951
01:37:11,373 --> 01:37:15,502
- Come on, Harry.
- Marv, are you sure this is safe?

952
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:17,921
I've worked all the kinks out.

953
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:21,175
Solid as a rock.

954
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:38,942
Like a rock, huh?

955
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:40,194
Give up?

956
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:45,240
Have you had enough pain?
- Never!

957
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,711
You better say every prayer
you ever heard!

958
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:02,049
I hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

959
01:38:03,342 --> 01:38:04,676
Where'd he go?

960
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:09,097
I'm up here and I'm really scared.

961
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:20,692
What's that sound?

962
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:41,672
That was the sound of a tool chest...

963
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:44,383
...falling down the stairs.

964
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:47,386
Oh.

965
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:53,433
Yes!

966
01:39:26,925 --> 01:39:28,427
Over there!

967
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:33,056
Even if I get the chair,
I'm killing that kid!

968
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:36,226
Surrender, kid!

969
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:37,311
He vanished.

970
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:40,814
I'm here, you horse's ass!

971
01:39:43,358 --> 01:39:44,193
Whoa.

972
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:47,487
Nice night for a neck injury!

973
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:51,909
Suck brick, kid!

974
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,165
Come on, Marv.

975
01:39:58,415 --> 01:39:59,333
I don't know.

976
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:03,045
I said, come on!

977
01:40:03,128 --> 01:40:06,840
Come on, you big sissy.

978
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:21,980
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

979
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:24,483
That's kerosene.

980
01:40:24,733 --> 01:40:26,985
The rope is soaked in it.

981
01:40:27,236 --> 01:40:31,323
Why would anyone soak a rope
in kerosene?

982
01:40:34,743 --> 01:40:36,787
Merry Christmas.

983
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:39,414
Go up!

984
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:16,702
Get off me!

985
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:40,392
Get the bag!

986
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:43,687
Two guys who robbed Duncan's Toy Chest
are in the park.

987
01:41:43,937 --> 01:41:50,402
Central Park West, 95th Street. Look
for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

988
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,283
I'm here.

989
01:41:56,533 --> 01:42:01,163
Better come and get me
before I call the cops.

990
01:42:07,002 --> 01:42:09,713
Whoa!

991
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:17,387
My, how the tables have turned.

992
01:42:17,638 --> 01:42:20,641
How do you like the ice?

993
01:42:24,853 --> 01:42:29,358
Let's go for a little stroll
in the park.

994
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:46,041
Give me the bag.

995
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:49,294
Give me it!

996
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:55,509
Great for the album.

997
01:42:55,759 --> 01:43:00,055
You may've won the battle, dude,
but you lost the war.

998
01:43:00,305 --> 01:43:02,474
You ought not of messed with us.

999
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:05,269
We're dangerous.

1000
01:43:10,148 --> 01:43:13,360
- Harry?
- Shut up!

1001
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:17,573
Harry.

1002
01:43:17,823 --> 01:43:20,826
Shut up! I want to enjoy this.

1003
01:43:21,076 --> 01:43:23,078
Something's wrong.

1004
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:26,957
- Let's get out of here!
- Shut up!

1005
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:30,377
I never made it to the 6th grade...

1006
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:34,464
...and it doesn't look like
you're gonna either.

1007
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:36,258
Let him go!

1008
01:43:36,508 --> 01:43:39,428
Kevin, run!

1009
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,096
Shoot her!

1010
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:43,015
Shoot her!

1011
01:43:43,265 --> 01:43:46,727
- Shoot her!
- I'm trying!

1012
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:28,018
Bye! Thanks.

1013
01:44:53,126 --> 01:44:56,255
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

1014
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:58,465
We got the bridge.
Take the tunnel.

1015
01:44:58,715 --> 01:45:01,635
Let's go, let's go!

1016
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:11,019
Oh, my God!

1017
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,488
All right, let's go.

1018
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:24,992
Come on, on your feet.

1019
01:45:28,287 --> 01:45:32,958
You guys should've started earlier.
The prisoners already exchanged gifts.

1020
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,835
We missed the presents?

1021
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:38,672
He made us hide in the store
and steal the kiddies' charity money.

1022
01:45:38,922 --> 01:45:42,342
Shut up, Marv.

1023
01:45:42,676 --> 01:45:44,970
You've got the right to remain silent.

1024
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:48,182
He's a little cranky.
We just broke out of prison.

1025
01:45:48,432 --> 01:45:51,059
Shut up, Marv!

1026
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,061
Get them out of here!

1027
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:54,771
If this makes the papers...

1028
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:59,359
...we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

1029
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,695
That's sticky. S...

1030
01:46:01,945 --> 01:46:03,697
...T...

1031
01:46:03,947 --> 01:46:07,075
I.
I.

1032
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:21,215
It's all over. We apprehended
the thieves and got your money.

1033
01:46:21,465 --> 01:46:24,801
I want to get that money
over to the Children's Hospital.

1034
01:46:25,052 --> 01:46:28,305
I'll handle it.
Thank you.

1035
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:29,890
Excuse me.

1036
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:34,186
I found this note. Looks like
a kid broke your window.

1037
01:46:34,436 --> 01:46:35,687
{y:i}Dear Mr. Duncan:

1038
01:46:35,938 --> 01:46:38,732
{y:i}I broke your window
{y:i}to catch the bad guys.

1039
01:46:38,982 --> 01:46:40,484
{y:i}Do you have insurance?

1040
01:46:40,734 --> 01:46:44,196
{y:i}If not, I'll send you some money,
{y:i}if I ever get home.

1041
01:46:44,446 --> 01:46:46,490
{y:i}Merry Christmas.
{y:i}Kevin McCallister.

1042
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,410
{y:i}P. S. Thanks for the turtledoves.

1043
01:46:50,661 --> 01:46:53,247
Turtledoves.

1044
01:46:53,497 --> 01:46:56,208
Oh.

1045
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:06,260
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
This boy here.

1046
01:47:07,553 --> 01:47:13,016
Please help me. This boy right here.
Have you seen him?

1047
01:47:20,607 --> 01:47:24,027
I'm looking for my son.
He's been missing for two days.

1048
01:47:24,278 --> 01:47:28,657
- Have you filed a report?
- Of course we have.

1049
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:33,287
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

1050
01:47:33,537 --> 01:47:36,248
Oh.

1051
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:39,334
I'm his mother.

1052
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:43,422
I know, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1053
01:47:43,672 --> 01:47:45,924
Do you have kids?

1054
01:47:46,175 --> 01:47:47,050
Yes, ma'am.

1055
01:47:47,301 --> 01:47:50,554
What if one was missing?

1056
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:55,184
I'd probably do the same thing
you're doing.

1057
01:47:55,434 --> 01:47:58,061
Thank you.

1058
01:47:59,271 --> 01:48:01,231
Put yourself in his shoes.

1059
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:03,400
What would you do?

1060
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:08,238
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

1061
01:48:08,488 --> 01:48:09,907
But not Kevin.

1062
01:48:10,157 --> 01:48:14,494
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.

1063
01:48:14,745 --> 01:48:18,916
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.

1064
01:48:18,957 --> 01:48:22,294
But he's still alone in a big city.

1065
01:48:22,544 --> 01:48:24,338
He doesn't deserve that.

1066
01:48:24,588 --> 01:48:30,594
He deserves to be at home with his own
family around his Christmas tree.

1067
01:48:32,679 --> 01:48:34,723
Oh, dear God...

1068
01:48:34,973 --> 01:48:36,975
...I know where he is.

1069
01:48:37,226 --> 01:48:39,811
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

1070
01:48:40,062 --> 01:48:43,857
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1071
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:51,490
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

1072
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,367
I don't want any presents.

1073
01:48:53,617 --> 01:48:57,579
Instead, I want to take back every mean
thing I ever said to my family...

1074
01:48:57,829 --> 01:49:00,374
...even if they don't do the same.

1075
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:05,379
I don't care. I love all of them.
Including Buzz.

1076
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:09,550
If I can't see all of them,
could I just see my mother?

1077
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:14,221
I'll never want another thing, ever.
I just want my mother.

1078
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:16,014
I know it won't be tonight...

1079
01:49:16,265 --> 01:49:21,061
...but promise me I can see her again.
Sometime. Anytime.

1080
01:49:21,311 --> 01:49:24,773
Even if it's just once
and only for a few minutes.

1081
01:49:25,023 --> 01:49:28,861
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

1082
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:38,662
Kevin?

1083
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,711
Mom?

1084
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:50,132
That worked fast!

1085
01:49:59,516 --> 01:50:02,519
Oh, Kevin.

1086
01:50:02,519 --> 01:50:05,731
Mom, I'm sorry.

1087
01:50:06,023 --> 01:50:09,193
I'm sorry too.

1088
01:50:20,245 --> 01:50:23,332
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1089
01:50:24,166 --> 01:50:27,503
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1090
01:50:27,753 --> 01:50:29,630
Thank you.

1091
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,632
Let's go.

1092
01:50:31,882 --> 01:50:33,258
How'd you know I was here?

1093
01:50:33,509 --> 01:50:36,261
I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest.

1094
01:50:36,512 --> 01:50:37,763
Where's everyone else?

1095
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:42,476
At the hotel.
They didn't like palm trees either.

1096
01:51:25,018 --> 01:51:28,564
Holy smokes, it's morning!

1097
01:51:28,814 --> 01:51:32,025
It's Christmas morning, man.

1098
01:51:32,276 --> 01:51:34,570
Don't get your hopes up.

1099
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,696
Huh?

1100
01:51:35,946 --> 01:51:37,906
I don't think Santa visits hotels.

1101
01:51:38,156 --> 01:51:40,325
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1102
01:51:40,576 --> 01:51:43,620
He goes everywhere.

1103
01:51:43,912 --> 01:51:47,165
Wake up, it's Christmas!

1104
01:51:50,294 --> 01:51:54,089
Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!

1105
01:52:05,058 --> 01:52:06,560
Wow.

1106
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:08,270
Where'd it come from?

1107
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:12,524
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

1108
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:16,862
- My gosh!
- Peter!

1109
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:20,574
Are we in the right room?

1110
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,413
Don't open any of mine.

1111
01:52:26,663 --> 01:52:29,666
- Who's Mr. Duncan?
- Duncan? I don't know.

1112
01:52:29,917 --> 01:52:31,335
Everybody calm down.

1113
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:34,213
Calm down!

1114
01:52:34,463 --> 01:52:36,298
All right. Now...

1115
01:52:36,548 --> 01:52:40,636
...if Kevin hadn't screwed up in
the first place, again...

1116
01:52:40,886 --> 01:52:43,472
...we wouldn't be
in this most perfect...

1117
01:52:43,722 --> 01:52:46,975
...and huge hotel room
with all this free stuff.

1118
01:52:47,226 --> 01:52:48,143
So...

1119
01:52:48,393 --> 01:52:53,065
...I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open the first gift.

1120
01:52:53,315 --> 01:52:57,569
Then I'll go and the rest
of you and so on.

1121
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:02,699
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1122
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:06,495
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1123
01:53:07,079 --> 01:53:09,790
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1124
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:13,710
All right! Merry Christmas!

1125
01:53:14,419 --> 01:53:16,171
Enough gooey sh...

1126
01:53:16,421 --> 01:53:20,634
Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1127
01:53:21,844 --> 01:53:27,391
Everybody, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1128
01:54:01,925 --> 01:54:05,304
Merry Christmas.

1129
01:54:05,971 --> 01:54:06,930
Kevin!

1130
01:54:07,181 --> 01:54:09,433
Merry Christmas!

1131
01:54:09,683 --> 01:54:12,561
I got something for you.

1132
01:54:19,526 --> 01:54:20,903
What's this?

1133
01:54:21,153 --> 01:54:23,906
It's a turtledove. I have one.
You have one.

1134
01:54:24,156 --> 01:54:29,494
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1135
01:54:31,955 --> 01:54:36,043
Oh, Kevin.

1136
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:39,963
Thank you.

1137
01:54:40,214 --> 01:54:44,426
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1138
01:55:10,953 --> 01:55:14,498
The room service bill, sir.

1139
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,709
Merry Christmas.

1140
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,088
Uh, oh.

1141
01:55:23,257 --> 01:55:24,591
Nice family.

1142
01:55:24,842 --> 01:55:27,469
Really.

1143
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:38,397
Merry Christmas indeed.

1144
01:55:40,691 --> 01:55:42,067
Kevin!

1145
01:55:42,317 --> 01:55:46,655
You spent $967 on room service?!
