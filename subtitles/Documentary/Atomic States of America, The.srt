1
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,802
<i>East and West do not
mistrust each other because we're armed.</i>

2
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:55,181
<i>We're armed because
we mistrust each other.</i>

3
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:56,891
<i>Mr. Gorbachev,</i>

4
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,978
tear down this wall.

5
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,967
James fucking Gasciogne.

6
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,011
How did you find me?

7
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,640
Maybe you're not as good at
this spy shit as you think.

8
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,686
It was Satchel, wasn't it?
Satchel gave me up.

9
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,318
I always thought
if I got tagged,

10
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,529
it would be by the best.

11
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,657
But you're not the best,
are you, Bakhtin?

12
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,786
You're the biggest
fucking cunt in the KGB.

13
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,915
Sticks and stones, Jimmy.

14
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,685
That's a nasty black eye.

15
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,146
Where's C?

16
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,107
Given the scale
of recent world events,

17
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,150
<i>C will not be joining us.</i>

18
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,738
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

19
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,791
The voices on record
are the following.

20
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,086
Myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray,

21
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,089
our American guest,
Emmett Kurzfeld,

22
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,966
of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency,

23
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,760
and returning British Operational
Officer Lorraine Broughton.

24
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,762
Before we begin, sir,
may I formally request

25
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,390
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed
from the debriefing.

26
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,683
Request denied.

27
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,144
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

28
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,479
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing.

29
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,314
- Not its controller.
- I understand that.

30
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,275
I was there, in Berlin.

31
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,237
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

32
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,281
Would it make you
more comfortable?

33
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,159
I could stand behind the
mirror with everybody else.

34
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,494
But it's a little
crowded back there.

35
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,790
Cocksucker.

36
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,250
What did you say?

37
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,628
I didn't say anything.

38
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,231
I'm sorry. Did you say
something, Lorraine?

39
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,798
Did you hear me
say something?

40
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:26,900
I thought you
said something.

41
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,051
What did she say?

42
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,219
What?

43
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,848
Well...

44
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,893
Do you want to play
the tape back?

45
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,818
Well, then.

46
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,614
Shall we begin?

47
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,826
Berlin.

48
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,370
What happened?

49
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,622
Yeah.

50
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,665
Berlin.

51
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,463
Fuck.

52
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,389
<i>Ah... Lorraine.</i>

53
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,433
Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

54
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,894
You know C.

55
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:20,977
Yes.

56
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,730
We were just
going over your file.

57
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,690
I see your Russian
is excellent.

58
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,235
An expert in
escape and evasion.

59
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,154
Proficient in intelligence
collection and hand-to-hand combat.

60
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,074
It's an impressive
set of skills.

61
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,201
And knowing
the Reds as I do,

62
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,245
she'll need to use
every damn one of them.

63
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,039
I'll get
straight to the point.

64
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,333
How well do you
know James Gasciogne?

65
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,710
Enough to say hello.

66
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,504
We worked together
in Istanbul in '85.

67
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,588
He's dead.

68
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:54,095
Gasciogne was killed last
night on a mission in Berlin.

69
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,266
The West German Police fished his
body out of the Spree this morning.

70
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,353
And a coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round

71
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,938
from the base of his skull.

72
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,147
Soviets.

73
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:10,111
Yesterday, Gasciogne met with a
Stasi officer, code-named Spyglass.

74
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,113
We promised
Spyglass immunity

75
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:16,117
in exchange for a document on
microfilm, code-named The List.

76
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,952
Hidden in
a Swiss watch, no less.

77
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,372
The List contains every
active clandestine officer,

78
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,124
all their shady deals.

79
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,293
It's an atomic bomb
of information

80
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,004
that could extend the Cold
War for another 40 years.

81
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:32,091
And we believe the man that
killed Gasciogne now has it.

82
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,304
Our sources point
to Yuri Bakhtin,

83
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,974
a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

84
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,868
So you want me
in Moscow?

85
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:42,892
No.

86
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,603
Bakhtin never
got on the flight.

87
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,897
So he's still in Berlin
along with The List.

88
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,609
Everyone's
hunting for it.

89
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,237
The Yanks, the Frogs,
Soviets of course.

90
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,989
And our man,
Percival.

91
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,240
Who's Percival?

92
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,827
David Percival.
He's our number one in Berlin.

93
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,080
He's your point
of contact there.

94
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,721
Straight from
the tit of the Virgin Mary.

95
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,698
The Jordache wasn't easy.

96
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,367
It's for my wife's birthday.

97
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,161
That's really nice. Now,
where's that fucking list?

98
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,580
I gave the microfilm
to Gasciogne last night.

99
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,207
James didn't show up.

100
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,542
I did my part.
I gave him the list.

101
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,628
You have to get me
and my family across.

102
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,546
It's not safe
for us anymore here.

103
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,048
The Russians are onto me.

104
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,841
No list, no deal.

105
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,095
I risked everything.

106
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,304
No list, no deal.

107
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,764
You listen to me, Spyglass.

108
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,617
Without that list, why
shouldn't I take you outside

109
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,701
and shoot you
in the fucking head?

110
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,311
You are going to kill
a Stasi officer?

111
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,522
One that's about to defect
to the West? Yeah.

112
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,899
Without an embassy
to look after him,

113
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,235
Percival has gone
somewhat native.

114
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,986
Gone fucking feral.

115
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,863
Berlin is the Wild West.

116
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,074
And if that bloody wall
comes crashing down,

117
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,325
we don't want
to be under it.

118
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:25,496
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

119
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,916
You're Elizabeth Lloyd,

120
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,501
a Cambridge-educated lawyer

121
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,128
sent by James
Gasciogne's family

122
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,451
to retrieve
the body and effects

123
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,381
of their
recently deceased son.

124
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,591
Your mission is
to connect with Percival

125
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,052
and do whatever it takes
to get that list home.

126
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,972
And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

127
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,932
Trust no one.

128
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,815
Follow me!
Come, come, come!

129
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,192
Quickly! This way!

130
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,444
Tell me you made a copy.

131
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:57,611
I memorized it.

132
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,695
Memorized it?

133
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,989
Every single agent
on that list?

134
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,199
Every Wednesday,
you visit the Penny Lane brothel.

135
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,827
Your favorite girl is Margot.
Her real name is Maria.

136
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,953
Maria?

137
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,456
All right,
I'll get you across.

138
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,665
You're a good man,
Percival.

139
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:10,749
Fuck off.

140
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,960
I just want the list.
Once I... Oh, fuck!

141
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,712
I'll be in touch.

142
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,172
Uh...

143
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,718
Ooh!

144
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,259
I'm so fucking late.

145
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,680
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was running late.

146
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,724
He sent me
to pick you up.

147
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,058
Checked bags?

148
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:34,518
No, they've been sent.

149
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,353
Please, follow me.

150
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,338
<i>Docking in front</i>

151
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,506
<i>of the terminal
is not permitted.</i>

152
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,782
<i>Passengers loading
and unloading only.</i>

153
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,255
So...

154
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,466
Is this your
first time in Berlin?

155
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,592
Yes.

156
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,136
Well, it's a remarkable
time to be here.

157
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,892
Wonderful music, superb
nightlife, marvelous restaurants.

158
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,479
You must try the Central
Café for a drink.

159
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,564
You'll need it later.

160
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,489
You remember Mr. Bremovych,
don't you?

161
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,952
Of course, you do.

162
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,999
Well, he's very curious what
you're doing here in Berlin.

163
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,508
What the fuck
are you doing?

164
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,586
What the fuck
are you doing?

165
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,814
Welcome to Berlin.

166
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,023
I'm David...

167
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,942
Where the fuck were you?

168
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,236
Don't shoot.
I've got your shoe.

169
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,617
Let me help you
with your bags.

170
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,537
Come on.

171
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,497
For fuck's sake.

172
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,916
Russians are
fucking heavy.

173
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,645
Five minutes on the
ground and I'm already made.

174
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,337
You're not made. I hope.

175
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,422
They knew my name.

176
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,715
That's troubling.
And yours.

177
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,175
That's hardly surprising.

178
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,679
Great fucking start,
Percival.

179
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,481
So what was
your first impression?

180
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,232
Of David?

181
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,358
Well...

182
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,362
He was handsome. Late 30s.

183
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,991
Disastrous
Sinéad O'Connor hair.

184
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,660
- Irish singer.
- Hmm.

185
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:42,372
I asked him what the deal
was with that, and he said,

186
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,124
"It's to blend in."

187
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,126
You want to touch it?

188
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,086
It's to blend in
in the East.

189
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,469
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way.

190
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,137
I mean, how the fuck
do the suits think

191
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,365
that you're going to be able
to help me find that list?

192
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,949
As soon as you pick up
Gasciogne's body,

193
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,174
they'll null
and void your visa

194
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,703
and you'll be on
the first flight back home.

195
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,145
I'll figure it out.

196
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,897
That's
Checkpoint Charlie.

197
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,482
My office
is just back there.

198
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,943
I'm not here to collect
postcards, Percival.

199
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,237
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

200
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,656
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

201
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,699
I can read a fucking map.

202
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,743
This will
just take a minute.

203
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,837
What are you doing?

204
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,339
Sending
a message to a fascist pig.

205
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,847
Say hello to Comrade
Bremovych for me.

206
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,988
Bremovych.

207
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,119
<i>Tensions are
high in East Berlin tonight,</i>

208
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,674
<i>as civil disobedience
continues to build momentum.</i>

209
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,260
<i>East Berlin's youth leaders
shout out their protests</i>

210
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,137
<i>through tear gas
and water cannons.</i>

211
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,596
<i>And there are
numerous reports</i>

212
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,100
<i>of police beating peaceful
demonstrators with batons.</i>

213
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,344
<i>I've been sent to arrange
the return of a British subject.</i>

214
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,347
The body was
identified by your attaché.

215
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,099
Yes, I believe so.

216
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,603
This was not a question.
It was a statement.

217
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,194
He was your colleague?

218
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,695
Different department.

219
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,863
Which department?

220
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,156
A different one.

221
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,911
You have the transfer papers?

222
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:48,345
<i>Do you know those movies where
the picture just starts to slow down,</i>

223
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,847
<i>and melt,</i>

224
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,226
then catch fire?

225
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,604
Well...

226
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,483
That's Berlin.

227
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,403
<i>The passport
number is incorrect.</i>

228
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,115
<i>I will not release this body
without the correct information.</i>

229
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,616
<i>It's a simple mistake.</i>

230
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,161
Ms. Lloyd, in Germany, we
don't make simple mistakes.

231
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,469
I'm not going to lie,
I'm impressed.

232
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,514
You've got some balls
breaking in here.

233
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,933
You should see my balls, then
you'd be really impressed.

234
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,561
Hmm... I'll take
your word for it.

235
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,271
I see you found
a way to stay.

236
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,773
You wrote "16" when it
should have said "76."

237
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:27,027
That's right,
I'm not going anywhere.

238
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,804
I'm here for at least
another week.

239
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,405
Lucky fucking me.

240
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,909
They won't release the body now
until they've investigated

241
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,035
that red tape nightmare.

242
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,912
How the fuck
did you get in here?

243
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,206
You know, I've been
in Berlin a long time,

244
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,082
and I think I know
every doorman of

245
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,126
every decent shithouse,

246
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,463
borderline decent flophouse,
both sides of the wall.

247
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,049
Well, then you must
know Spyglass.

248
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,801
Never met the fellow.

249
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,845
He was James's.

250
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:56,991
What do you know
about this woman

251
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,018
who's been following me
since Tempelhof?

252
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,980
I'd say that
you're an attractive woman,

253
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,691
and you should do the math.

254
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,738
You know, if I was to follow you,
I mean, properly,

255
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,031
you'd never fucking know.

256
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,868
There's a knack
to it, isn't there?

257
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,205
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing bagpipes.

258
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,041
You can either do it,
or you can't.

259
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,836
Knock yourself out.

260
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,656
I'd like to purchase
a watch.

261
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,703
I need access
to a network in East Berlin.

262
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,541
Come back tomorrow
before closing.

263
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,503
<i>East Berlin is on
a short fuse again tonight</i>

264
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,007
<i>as Communist Party officials
struggle to maintain order.</i>

265
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,968
<i>How well do you
know James Gasciogne?</i>

266
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,386
He's dead.

267
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,471
You need to be careful.

268
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,725
<i>... 7.62 Tokarev round
from the base of his skull.</i>

269
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:22,809
<i>Soviets.</i>

270
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,728
<i>We know who Satchel is.</i>

271
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,018
<i>You need to run.</i>

272
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,846
<i>You expected to find the
list in Gasciogne's apartment.</i>

273
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,450
You realize you were
late to the party.

274
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,517
<i>Percival, the Russians,</i>

275
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,228
<i>everybody must've already
ransacked the place.</i>

276
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,312
<i>Yes.</i>

277
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,024
But the list
wasn't our only problem.

278
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,570
Before I left,
he told me one last thing.

279
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:03,701
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

280
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,749
Spyglass revealed
that this list

281
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,919
would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

282
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,297
I want Satchel,
dead or alive.

283
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,135
This traitor has been a thorn
in our side for years.

284
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,679
He's a black eye
to the Crown.

285
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:26,349
And the single biggest
intelligence leak in MI6 history.

286
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,769
You expose this bastard,
Satchel,

287
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,022
and we'll hang him
for treason.

288
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:37,110
You might find yourself taking
tea at Buckingham Palace.

289
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:42,991
So no, I wasn't just looking for
the list in Gasciogne's apartment.

290
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:08,850
<i>Percival and I seem to have a
different definition for collaboration.</i>

291
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,937
<i>What's that
supposed to mean?</i>

292
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:16,691
He was the only one who knew
I was going to Gasciogne's apartment.

293
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,486
And if I knew he was
going to call the police,

294
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,154
I would have worn
a different outfit.

295
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,580
"Different outfit"?

296
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,607
Hey!

297
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,816
Halt!

298
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,388
<i>With repeated calls
for change on the streets</i>

299
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,807
<i>and the protestors growing
ever more confident,</i>

300
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,644
<i>time is running out for
the East German government.</i>

301
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,103
<i>Popular opinion has it</i>

302
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:03,066
<i>that the communists' claim to
leadership can't be upheld much longer.</i>

303
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,360
<i>And if rapid change
is not forthcoming,</i>

304
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,279
<i>today's relatively calm
protests could be seen</i>

305
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,615
<i>as the calm before the storm.</i>

306
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,327
<i>It's not just new faces
that are called for,</i>

307
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,914
<i>but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.</i>

308
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,186
Hmm?

309
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,859
Let me take your coat.

310
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,285
Make yourself at home.

311
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,420
Fucking hell.

312
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:10,675
Do you want a pair of
jeans? Help yourself.

313
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,021
Hmm.

314
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,524
Your library
includes Larry Flynt?

315
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,569
Champion of free speech.

316
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,363
Hmm.

317
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,451
What have you found
on Bakhtin?

318
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,036
Look, if Bakhtin wanted the
Russians to have that list,

319
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,140
he would have given it to them by now.

320
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,875
We just have to wait for him
to make his move.

321
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,251
We can't afford to wait.

322
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,961
This is your city,
Percival.

323
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,465
Or do you only know
doormen and bellhops?

324
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,764
So what did you find
in Gasciogne's apartment?

325
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:02,685
Some Deutsche Marks,
empty passports, travel visas.

326
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,397
And a picture of the two of you
together a few years back.

327
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,904
Did I not mention
that we were friends?

328
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:13,988
- No.
- No?

329
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,990
I must have forgot to.

330
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,830
Get your coat, love.

331
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,041
We're going for a walk.

332
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,675
Look, we're all
exposed by that list.

333
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,552
Saving the world
is cool and all that,

334
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,305
but my main objective
is staying alive.

335
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,908
I've been head of Berlin
station for 10 years.

336
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,743
You've got to know that I'm
the only man in this town

337
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,185
that can help you
get that list.

338
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,770
Yes, I've read your file.

339
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,730
I've also read
your dog file.

340
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:50,566
So let's cut the crap,
shall we?

341
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,319
This whole hungover,
show-up-late,

342
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,779
don't-know-which-way-is-up
act?

343
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,531
I'm not buying it.

344
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,742
I trust you about
as far as I can throw you.

345
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,245
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

346
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,247
Niccolò Machiavelli.

347
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,999
It was on your shelf.

348
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,669
Oh, my God. I think
I fucking love you.

349
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,838
That's too bad.

350
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:16,050
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin,

351
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:20,012
I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

352
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,467
Stoli on ice.

353
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,081
I'm not speaking
German tonight.

354
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,208
So, you're British?

355
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:37,632
Very impressive.

356
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,011
This can't be
your only talent.

357
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,431
Talents can be overrated.

358
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,686
A dedication, a loyalty
is very rare these days.

359
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,987
Everyone here is
searching for something.

360
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,366
What do you
looking for?

361
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,451
Well, when all's
said and done,

362
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:10,414
wouldn't you say deep down, we're all
just searching for the same thing?

363
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,965
I leave you alone
for only a moment

364
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,716
and already you are
attracting admirers.

365
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:26,681
<i>Monsieur,</i> three is not
always a crowd, but tonight it is.

366
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:27,765
Hmm.

367
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,558
French women.

368
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,729
What about the British?

369
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,566
Maybe we can make
some sort of arrangement.

370
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,320
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

371
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,739
And we really
need to catch up.

372
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,242
Alone.

373
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,204
Ladies, Berlin
is a small place.

374
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,499
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

375
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:05,720
Sorry.

376
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,764
You looked like
you needed saving.

377
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,102
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Miss...

378
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:15,938
Lasalle.
Delphine Lasalle.

379
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,733
Pleased to meet you.

380
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,778
So, what do you do,
Delphine?

381
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,906
I'm a part-time translator who
really wants to be a poet.

382
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,742
Maybe a rock star.

383
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,250
My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?

384
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,877
- Now?
- Sure.

385
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,047
I can't.

386
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,800
Well, I'll give you
the address anyway.

387
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,720
Come meet me there
tomorrow night?

388
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,640
Will you come?

389
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,018
Maybe?

390
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,145
You're relentless.

391
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,481
<i>Oui.</i>

392
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,152
David Hasselhoff's in town.

393
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,820
Lucky us.

394
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,406
Berlin is truly doomed.

395
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,471
Your watch is ready.

396
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,141
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

397
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,611
I think you'll find
my contact very useful.

398
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,667
<i>Your watch is ready.</i>

399
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:03,462
<i>It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.</i>

400
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,550
<i>I think you'll find
my contact very useful.</i>

401
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,138
<i>East Berliners stormed
the West German embassies</i>

402
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,140
<i>in Czechoslovakia
earlier this week,</i>

403
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,976
<i>as the Czech government has
begun to waive the refugees</i>

404
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,228
<i>through checkpoints
with few questions.</i>

405
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,690
<i>One has to ask how long the East
Berlin government can hold on</i>

406
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:26,193
<i>as the tide of loaded Trabants
continues to flow out.</i>

407
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:47,089
<i>Bakhtin and the list had
not yet surfaced in the West.</i>

408
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,592
<i>I needed to meet
my new contact</i>

409
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,261
<i>and see what I was
up against in the East.</i>

410
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,770
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

411
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,107
What kind of work
do you do?

412
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,567
Legal affairs.

413
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,536
If you do not
return before 6:00,

414
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,954
you will be arrested.

415
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,206
Do you understand?

416
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,416
I understand.

417
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:32,843
Right now, I'm not feeling very
confident about this story of yours.

418
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:37,139
Why not use Percival's
connections in the East?

419
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:42,269
<i>He told me
to trust no one.</i>

420
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:47,483
<i>Hello?</i>

421
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,854
You are late.

422
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:56,190
And you were followed.

423
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,984
I'm late
because I was followed.

424
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:02,488
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the <i>Palast der Republik.</i>

425
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,990
You're as good
as your reputation.

426
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,611
Are you sure this
is the best place to meet?

427
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,038
Keep your enemies close.

428
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,833
I'm a permanent
fixture for them now.

429
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:19,755
The Watchmaker says there has
been great interest in this list

430
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,840
on the black market
the last few days.

431
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:23,926
- Any sign of Bakhtin?
- No.

432
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,722
This Satchel character has people
worried on both sides of the wall.

433
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:29,932
Yeah.

434
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,935
What kind of network
have you assembled?

435
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:38,440
There's a lot of dissatisfied
youth on this side of the wall.

436
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:45,948
They're like a tinderbox.

437
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:50,202
If you find the right spark...

438
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,747
Keep talking.

439
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,538
I am interested
in selling a watch.

440
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,082
What are you selling?

441
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,501
It is extremely valuable.

442
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:44,298
The finest quality
and filled with secrets.

443
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:55,726
Would you mind if I
inspect the merchandise?

444
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,314
Fuck yes, I mind.

445
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:06,945
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

446
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:25,088
<i>Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.</i>

447
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:28,383
<i>I'm sure our paths
will cross again.</i>

448
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:33,013
<i>Sorry.</i>

449
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,724
<i>You looked like
you needed saving.</i>

450
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:40,562
<i>My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?</i>

451
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:03,669
I didn't think
that you would show.

452
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:06,880
Stoli on the rocks?

453
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:11,343
You pay attention.

454
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,139
I look for pleasure
in the details.

455
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:26,316
Speaking of which, I've been
dying to ask you a question.

456
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,331
Let's go someplace quiet.

457
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:06,481
Why the gun, Delphine?

458
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:11,903
You're not as well disguised
as you may think.

459
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:13,071
I know who you are.

460
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,782
You're Lorraine Broughton,
MI6.

461
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,951
And you're here because
of the death of Gasciogne.

462
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,664
What do you know
about Gasciogne?

463
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,543
Nothing.

464
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:30,130
But if someone is killing Allied
officers, shouldn't we all care?

465
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:38,346
Whatever is in that list has
people willing to kill for it.

466
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:54,154
This is my first assignment
with the French Intelligence.

467
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:57,032
I've only been here
a year.

468
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,785
I'm scared, okay?

469
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:03,288
I got into this
because it was exciting.

470
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:06,708
But it's never been
like this in Berlin.

471
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:11,630
You should have
become a poet.

472
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,469
Or a rock star.

473
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,655
<i>So you made contact
with the French operative?</i>

474
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,115
<i>Obviously.</i>

475
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,618
<i>Why?</i>

476
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:27,080
I believed she had
information I could exploit.

477
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,582
Nothing more.

478
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,625
And did she?

479
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,674
Did she have
any information, Lorraine?

480
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,639
There is something
I need to tell you.

481
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:50,979
It has to do with your friend,
Percival. He's...

482
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:04,451
Lorraine?

483
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:10,081
Did she have
any information, Lorraine?

484
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,879
Did she
give you information?

485
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:18,632
She gave me nothing.

486
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,893
David fucking Percival.

487
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,564
Are you following me?

488
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,693
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

489
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:45,617
That was for James,
you fucking prick!

490
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,953
Now give me
that fucking list!

491
00:55:09,224 --> 00:55:12,060
<i>We needed to get you
a message, Lorraine.</i>

492
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,355
<i>We're several days into a
mission without a single lead.</i>

493
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,565
And plenty of distractions.

494
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:21,152
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

495
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:23,363
Oh, I received your message.

496
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:39,421
That's quite a view.

497
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:46,094
70 miles of barbed wire, 310 guard
towers, 65 anti-vehicle trenches,

498
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:51,182
40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily-armed frontier troops.

499
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:52,851
All that,

500
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,606
and 5,000 GDR citizens still
had the brass balls to escape.

501
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:05,155
You've got the MI6 so worried they
called the CIA to talk sense into you.

502
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:09,325
Eric Gray called me.

503
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:11,703
Of course he did.

504
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,873
I don't have to remind you of
how fast the clock is ticking.

505
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,042
If this thing gets out,

506
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,544
a lot of good,
hard-working folks,

507
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:22,964
brave men and women
are gonna show up dead.

508
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:25,467
You and I included.

509
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,635
I swear to God,
the last few weeks,

510
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,472
I dread even waking up
in the morning.

511
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,727
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

512
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,854
And the time imperative.

513
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,371
Listen, I didn't
climb all the way up here

514
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:44,652
just to give you
some rousing pep talk.

515
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,696
So I'll cut to the chase.

516
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:48,990
Last night you met a woman.

517
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,994
Delphine Lasalle
is out of her depth.

518
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,164
Given the climate, I'd hate
to see an executive order

519
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,417
come down the line that
falls in her disinterest.

520
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:02,253
"Her disinterest"?

521
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:05,256
What do you mean,
"her disinterest"?

522
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,092
Don't insult my intelligence,
Lorraine.

523
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,761
You know exactly
what I fucking mean.

524
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,263
I hope you get a snapshot.

525
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:15,892
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

526
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,237
<i>Satchel has been compromised.</i>

527
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,722
<i>Meet me at the Rough
Trade Bar at Oranienstrasse.</i>

528
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:37,891
<i>We need to talk.</i>

529
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:55,074
<i>Look at all these hedonists.</i>

530
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:57,285
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong.

531
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:58,786
I fucking love it.

532
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:03,041
Word is Bakhtin
has resurfaced.

533
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,335
Cops found him
with a homemade lobotomy.

534
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,962
Either way, we have
to deal with Spyglass.

535
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:10,757
Thinking it through, he doesn't
have much time over there.

536
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,593
Our priority is the list.
We can't make mistakes.

537
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:14,677
Come on!

538
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:16,822
He's hardly the most trustworthy
person I've ever met.

539
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:18,431
Or the fucking brightest.

540
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,308
Wait. You said
you hadn't met him.

541
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,188
I lied.

542
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:30,109
And he claims to have
memorized the entire list.

543
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,571
He's ready
to make the jump.

544
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,866
You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

545
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,326
Everything.

546
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:43,414
Had I known earlier, I would
have prioritized Spyglass.

547
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:46,334
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

548
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,212
I could have grabbed him
at any moment.

549
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,589
Instead, Percival
kept it a secret,

550
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,967
putting us in
a precarious position.

551
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,785
<i>Look,
the KGB are gonna have some</i>

552
01:00:02,809 --> 01:00:05,144
<i>very angry bastards out there
looking for Spyglass.</i>

553
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:07,772
We can't trust any
of the old routes or methods.

554
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:10,441
It's not that difficult to drive
across the border these days.

555
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:12,986
It is when you're
wanted like Spyglass is.

556
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,446
We have to walk him
across personally

557
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,157
to ensure his safety
in plain sight.

558
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,678
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz...

559
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:21,786
That's insane.

560
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,831
All those protesters
will make a great distraction.

561
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,377
Spyglass is my guy.
We're going to do it my way.

562
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,089
Fine.

563
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:36,384
But we use my contact to get
all our papers in order.

564
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:37,802
All right.

565
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,513
Do we have a deal?

566
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,977
I'll take that as a yes.

567
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,442
Hmm.

568
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:54,694
You see,

569
01:00:57,947 --> 01:01:02,327
I received a call from David
Percival that evening, Lorraine.

570
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,377
He said he had the list.

571
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,507
<i>I'll need
a little time to wrap it up.</i>

572
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,925
<i>And he knew
the identity of Satchel.</i>

573
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,430
Oh, I'm very close
to Satchel.

574
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:45,787
And no one thought to tell me?

575
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:49,165
Hmm?

576
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:56,631
Fuck.

577
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,680
You brought
a lot of friends.

578
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,975
I heard Bakhtin
had a little accident.

579
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:11,062
I heard he slipped
and fell on an ice pick.

580
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,688
Berlin's a cruel mistress.

581
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,941
Especially for traitors
like Bakhtin.

582
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:16,567
Don't be such
a fucking communist.

583
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:17,735
You've got a problem.

584
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,655
Yeah, I know.
You have the fucking list.

585
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,159
We've been in the trenches
long enough to know

586
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,954
that at times like this, Berlin
has its own set of rules.

587
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:31,332
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

588
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,460
Now, are you in or out?

589
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,887
Percival's trying
to set me up.

590
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:50,309
Are you surprised?

591
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,980
Not really.

592
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:56,023
These relationships
aren't real.

593
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:58,359
They're just
a means to an end.

594
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:04,073
When you tell the truth,
you look different.

595
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:05,992
Your eyes change.

596
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:09,495
Thanks for the warning.

597
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:12,874
What do you mean?

598
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:15,418
I mean,
I better not do it again.

599
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,592
Why?

600
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:29,724
'Cause it's going
to get me killed one day.

601
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,513
Well, I am impressed.

602
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:53,933
I thought Merkel here
was just a good bartender.

603
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:06,404
You smell like
a Stasi officer.

604
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,616
Shave off that mustache.

605
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,119
Use that soap and cologne.
It's from the West.

606
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:14,954
You can't take anything
from the East.

607
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:16,831
Merkel will give you
some clothes.

608
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:19,667
Right this way,
Mr. Spyglass.

609
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,206
It should have been easy.

610
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,334
The plan was sound.

611
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:04,670
Whatever went wrong did so
because someone wanted it to.

612
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:06,005
Someone from the inside.

613
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,633
You were betrayed
by a fellow agent?

614
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,551
You mean Satchel?

615
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:13,054
Would that be unheard of?

616
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,931
Per your request.

617
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,481
You won't be
needing that.

618
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:26,108
It will be worse
if they find it on you.

619
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,819
Everything else ready?

620
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:30,738
Yes. Everything
you requested.

621
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,490
I'm ready.

622
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:38,454
What do you think
of his shirt?

623
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,415
I wouldn't be
caught dead in it.

624
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,918
But for him,
it's perfect.

625
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,878
Stand over here.

626
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,758
Now look like a free man.

627
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:58,349
<i>East Berlin youth leaders have
organized a demonstration this week</i>

628
01:06:58,432 --> 01:07:00,101
<i>at Alexanderplatz.</i>

629
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:07,733
Did he tell you I
memorized the whole list?

630
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,653
Yes.

631
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:15,449
I realize I may not be
valuable to some people,

632
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:18,327
and some people
may even want me dead,

633
01:07:20,955 --> 01:07:23,124
but what choice do I have?

634
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:29,088
You're no good to me dead.
And I've never lost a package.

635
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:33,134
I know.

636
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,057
Hey! Hey!

637
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:42,309
It's his family.

638
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,730
This was not
part of the plan.

639
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:47,481
Part of mine.

640
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,818
Please?

641
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,903
I'll take the wife and kid.

642
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,030
You just have
to deal with Spyglass.

643
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:59,160
I don't know if I have
enough passports.

644
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:03,664
<i>Percival.
Your golden boy.</i>

645
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,656
We have to go.

646
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:43,287
See you in the West.

647
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,371
Good luck.

648
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,428
This was never
part of the plan.

649
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:43,305
It was part of mine.

650
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,309
No.

651
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,276
Stay low.

652
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,076
In here.

653
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:53,292
I need to deal with this now,
or we'll never get across.

654
01:10:57,755 --> 01:10:59,006
I don't want to die.

655
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,091
You're not going to die.

656
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:02,509
Stay here.

657
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:00,187
Fuck.

658
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,828
Two more. There's two more.

659
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,039
Go!

660
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:07,796
We need to stop
that bleeding.

661
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,339
Search for anything.

662
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:11,592
Alcohol, rags.

663
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:49,583
Am I a bitch, now?

664
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,635
Get in.

665
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,054
Get in!

666
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:54,481
You need
to work on your German.

667
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,653
It's horrible.

668
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:03,824
What in hell?

669
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,583
Fasten your seatbelt.

670
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:44,090
You all right?

671
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:45,175
Yeah.

672
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,136
We have to go...

673
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:02,859
It's so cold!

674
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:04,069
Open your door!

675
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:05,737
My foot is stuck!

676
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,099
Just breathe!

677
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,075
- You need a break?
- No.

678
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:44,252
So...

679
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:47,464
Yes, I think I
understand everything.

680
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:49,049
You made your plan.

681
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:54,429
And you failed to get the high value
asset safely across to the West.

682
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:57,349
You sent me into
a fucking hornet's nest.

683
01:22:59,476 --> 01:23:00,852
I was made by the KGB

684
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:03,021
from the moment
my feet touched the ground.

685
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:04,773
Maybe even before.

686
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:08,401
But then you knew that,
didn't you?

687
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:11,946
You had your doubts
about Percival.

688
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:15,575
And you used me
to shake him down.

689
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:18,578
Ready when you are.

690
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:39,307
Hey, hey. Whoa,
whoa, whoa...

691
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:41,142
It's me! It's me!

692
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:55,615
He's dead.
Spyglass is dead.

693
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,537
And you are alive.

694
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:04,958
They're all listening to me.

695
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:09,087
They knew.

696
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,632
The KGB knew everything.

697
01:24:14,259 --> 01:24:16,052
I need to get across.

698
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:04,642
Well, I expected more out
of the Brits than a royal goat fuck.

699
01:25:04,726 --> 01:25:06,102
I know. We're sorry.
No, wait.

700
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:08,386
You lot don't have your own
private Stasi agent, do you?

701
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:11,274
Not one with
a photographic memory.

702
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:22,327
<i>We need to get with
Broughton and get on the same page.</i>

703
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,788
<i>We need that list.
Now more than ever.</i>

704
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:27,874
Broughton?

705
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,460
She made it out.

706
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:33,546
Right.

707
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:37,967
You know, a beautiful
Italian girl once said to me,

708
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:39,302
"David,

709
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,223
"you can't unfuck
what has been fucked."

710
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:47,208
Women are always getting in the
way of progress, aren't they?

711
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:54,442
<i>What no one in Germany
believed possible has happened tonight.</i>

712
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:57,028
<i>The wall is coming down.
The wall is down.</i>

713
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:01,157
<i>People here have
lived with the wall since 1961.</i>

714
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:04,536
<i>And I think now it's time to
break the wall down, you know?</i>

715
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,663
<i>The wall is crumbling.</i>

716
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:10,458
<i>The sledgehammers in the hands
of men not born when it went up,</i>

717
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:11,960
<i>tear into it.</i>

718
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:16,506
<i>Behind it, the East German
soldiers tried to stop the tide.</i>

719
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:18,091
<i>Water cannons
were brought out.</i>

720
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:20,677
<i>But the West Berliners
were determined.</i>

721
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,346
<i>One West Berliner
sprayed champagne back.</i>

722
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,829
<i>You know, if I was to
follow you, I mean, properly,</i>

723
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:29,018
<i>you'd never fucking know.</i>

724
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:33,773
<i>It is the moment Berliners
have waited 28 years for.</i>

725
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:36,025
<i>Even the East Germans
seem exhilarated.</i>

726
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,194
<i>A symbolic breach
in the structure</i>

727
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:41,781
<i>that cost hundreds of lives,
and separated friends, families,</i>

728
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:44,534
<i>and lovers for decades.</i>

729
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:46,744
<i>I found
a French UHF device</i>

730
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:49,706
in my coat
after Spyglass died.

731
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:53,209
I now believe it was
Percival who planted it.

732
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:55,670
Made it look like Lasalle.

733
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:19,819
Why are you here?

734
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,698
You need to leave Berlin.

735
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:28,328
When I didn't hear
from you, I got worried.

736
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:30,496
How naive can you be?

737
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:33,666
We chose this life,
Delphine.

738
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:37,003
This only ends one way.

739
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:38,463
What are you talking about?

740
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:45,094
He set us both up.

741
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:47,430
You have to leave
while you can.

742
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:14,331
<i>Yes?</i>

743
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:16,125
Don't underestimate
me, Percival.

744
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:18,127
<i>Oh, Lasalle, listen
to me very carefully.</i>

745
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:20,380
<i>You have no idea
who you're dealing with.</i>

746
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,965
<i>You set me up.</i>

747
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:24,133
Come on, love.
This is the game.

748
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:26,135
<i>I know your secrets, David,</i>

749
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:29,389
<i>and I can play this game
better than you think.</i>

750
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:24,277
<i>Percival's trying to set me up.</i>

751
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,755
<i>Are you surprised?</i>

752
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:28,156
<i>Not really.</i>

753
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:30,450
<i>These relationships
aren't real.</i>

754
01:29:30,575 --> 01:29:32,869
<i>They're just
a means to an end.</i>

755
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:36,914
<i>When you tell the
truth, you look different.</i>

756
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:38,624
<i>Your eyes change.</i>

757
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:40,626
<i>Thanks for the warning.</i>

758
01:29:43,046 --> 01:29:44,047
<i>What do you mean?</i>

759
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,299
<i>I mean,
I better not do it again.</i>

760
01:29:47,133 --> 01:29:48,301
<i>Why?</i>

761
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:51,137
<i>'Cause it's going
to get me killed one day.</i>

762
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:58,061
<i>There is something
that I need to tell you.</i>

763
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:08,571
<i>It has to do with
your friend, Percival. He's...</i>

764
01:30:08,654 --> 01:30:10,406
<i>Shh.</i>

765
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,210
I'm sorry, darling.

766
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:49,547
This is the game.

767
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:42,683
Fuck!

768
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:46,997
<i>Celebrations
continue in the streets tonight.</i>

769
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:48,981
<i>From the moment
the first wave of East Germans</i>

770
01:32:49,065 --> 01:32:50,066
<i>crossed into Berlin,</i>

771
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:51,776
<i>they have been
showered with champagne</i>

772
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:53,986
<i>and cheered by
a crowd of thousands.</i>

773
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,071
<i>It is clear</i>

774
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:58,074
<i>this will be one of Berlin's
most dramatic days.</i>

775
01:32:58,157 --> 01:33:00,952
<i>East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border</i>

776
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:03,246
<i>that has been closed
to them for 28 years.</i>

777
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:05,498
<i>West Berliners are
chipping away at the wall</i>

778
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:07,667
<i>that scarred their city
and scaling it.</i>

779
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:26,435
<i>There is no more
interference from the police.</i>

780
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:29,438
<i>Unified, Berliners lay
symbols of peace.</i>

781
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:31,357
<i>Thousands of them looking east
and chanting,</i>

782
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,525
<i>"Down with the wall."</i>

783
01:33:55,423 --> 01:33:58,050
There's only one question
left to ask.

784
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:01,679
Who won?

785
01:34:02,054 --> 01:34:04,807
And what was
the fucking game anyway?

786
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:08,978
<i>And I was thinking
the wall will never fall.</i>

787
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:12,381
<i>Germany's peaceful revolution is
probably the political and cultural story</i>

788
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,566
<i>of 1989.</i>

789
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:14,710
<i>We're gonna
take a quick break,</i>

790
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,211
<i>but we'll be back
with an in-depth look</i>

791
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:19,113
<i>at the number-one musical
controversy of the year. Sampling.</i>

792
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:21,073
<i>Is it art or is it
just plagiarism?</i>

793
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:22,283
<i>Don't go away.</i>

794
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:30,583
<i>To win,</i>

795
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,085
<i>first, you have to know
whose side you're on.</i>

796
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,927
<i>In our line of work,</i>

797
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:46,432
<i>that's right up there with black
holes or "To be or not to be."</i>

798
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:51,913
You fight the good fight, and then
one day, you wake up and you realize

799
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:53,731
that all you were
was Satan's little helper.

800
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:15,544
<i>Ironic.</i>

801
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:19,465
<i>The news will tell them
there will be no more secrets.</i>

802
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:24,011
<i>But you and I,
we both know that's not true.</i>

803
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:28,391
<i>The world is run on secrets.</i>

804
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:30,309
Oh...

805
01:35:34,814 --> 01:35:37,525
<i>Whoever has that list
has power.</i>

806
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:40,861
<i>And without it, you're just
another fucking target.</i>

807
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:51,080
<i>So what have I learned
after all this time?</i>

808
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:53,916
<i>After all those
sleepless nights,</i>

809
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:57,253
<i>lying to friends,
lovers, myself.</i>

810
01:35:57,336 --> 01:36:00,423
<i>Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town</i>

811
01:36:00,506 --> 01:36:03,384
<i>filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars.</i>

812
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:05,094
<i>I'll tell you
what I've learned.</i>

813
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:08,305
<i>One thing
and one thing only.</i>

814
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:11,142
I fucking love Berlin!

815
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:39,712
You didn't have to kill her.

816
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:42,006
You suddenly decided
to develop a conscience

817
01:36:42,089 --> 01:36:43,883
after all you've done?

818
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,011
Have you noticed
how everyone you get close to

819
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:48,971
ends up fucking dead?

820
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:52,099
You gave Bremovych
the details of the plan.

821
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:55,436
You went to the KGB
to take me out.

822
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:59,648
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

823
01:36:59,732 --> 01:37:02,026
Too smart, more like.

824
01:37:03,611 --> 01:37:05,988
If those KGB pricks
had done their part,

825
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:09,408
I'd be on my way to a hand job
with the Queen by now.

826
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:12,119
I've read that list.

827
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:13,913
Lorraine.

828
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:16,665
Phew.

829
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:18,709
And you feature heavily.

830
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,463
It turns out, you've been
a very naughty girl.

831
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,051
Spyglass was a liability
to us all.

832
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:29,303
I couldn't risk
leaving him with you.

833
01:37:29,386 --> 01:37:31,472
Where's the list, David?

834
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,307
I don't have it.

835
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:37,102
It's en route to MI6
where it belongs.

836
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:39,522
No!

837
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,870
Are you going to lie
till the very end?

838
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,295
Truth and lies.

839
01:38:04,505 --> 01:38:06,131
People like us
don't know the difference.

840
01:38:06,215 --> 01:38:08,133
No, we know
the difference, David.

841
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:10,302
We choose to ignore it.

842
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:15,099
Isn't that right,
Comrade Satchel?

843
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:19,186
So that's how
you'll make it work.

844
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:22,606
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

845
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:23,983
Well played.

846
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,168
You killed David Percival?

847
01:38:46,005 --> 01:38:49,049
All the paperwork is in order
for the bodies of James Gasciogne

848
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:50,843
and David Percival.

849
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:57,558
You killed our Head of Station,
an officer of the Crown.

850
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:00,936
You'd better have hard proof
and a damn good explanation.

851
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,605
Who are you
to judge my actions?

852
01:39:02,688 --> 01:39:04,607
I'm your superior.

853
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:13,240
My superior.

854
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:17,703
This was never about
stopping the war.

855
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,997
It was about
saving your ass.

856
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:24,376
You couldn't bear the
embarrassment of the sins

857
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,837
that we committed
in the Cold War.

858
01:39:27,296 --> 01:39:30,299
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

859
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:33,510
Yes, well,
that's your job, isn't it?

860
01:39:33,594 --> 01:39:34,637
I did my job.

861
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:42,019
Despite your best efforts
and your incompetence,

862
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:46,273
I succeeded
where you failed.

863
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:50,486
I uncovered your traitor,
Satchel.

864
01:39:51,195 --> 01:39:53,989
Brought him the only justice
he deserved.

865
01:39:57,242 --> 01:39:58,786
A bullet.

866
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:02,164
Percival meeting
with Bremovych

867
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:04,458
the day before
Spyglass was killed.

868
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:07,854
<i>Maybe we
can make some sort of arrangement.</i>

869
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:10,607
<i>You've got to
know that I'm the only man in this town</i>

870
01:40:10,631 --> 01:40:12,007
<i>that can help
you get that list.</i>

871
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:13,676
<i>Very impressive.</i>

872
01:40:13,759 --> 01:40:17,221
<i>A dedication, a loyalty
is a rare thing these days.</i>

873
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:20,766
<i>"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."</i>

874
01:40:25,938 --> 01:40:27,314
<i>We have a deal?</i>

875
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:30,943
<i>What about the British?</i>

876
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:33,237
<i>Do you trust Gray?</i>

877
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:34,488
No.

878
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:35,864
What about C?

879
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:38,909
<i>C is an arrogant lap dog who
understands precisely fuck all</i>

880
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:41,203
<i>beyond the edge of his desk.</i>

881
01:40:44,415 --> 01:40:46,625
Percival was Satchel.

882
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:54,508
Where's the list?

883
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,511
Where's the list, Lorraine?

884
01:40:58,178 --> 01:40:59,930
I don't know.

885
01:41:03,225 --> 01:41:04,685
Oh, bollocks.

886
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:07,248
The Prime Minister is going to
have a difficult time with this.

887
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:14,153
We're choosing to bury
this one, Broughton.

888
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,322
Your mission
never took place.

889
01:41:17,406 --> 01:41:18,657
This conversation

890
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:23,454
never happened.

891
01:41:26,206 --> 01:41:29,042
I'm putting you on leave,
effective immediately.

892
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:32,504
We'll start the next decade
well-rested.

893
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,632
C?

894
01:41:38,177 --> 01:41:39,928
What should I wear

895
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:48,145
for my tea with the Queen?

896
01:43:12,145 --> 01:43:13,146
Hmm?

897
01:45:59,396 --> 01:46:02,858
Did you really think I
was going to give you that list?

898
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:04,985
Before you die,

899
01:46:05,068 --> 01:46:08,155
I want to get this through
your thick, primitive skull.

900
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,700
I never worked for you.

901
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:14,953
You worked for me.

902
01:46:21,626 --> 01:46:25,672
Every false intel I gave you,
a rip in the Iron Curtain.

903
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:31,344
Every piece of intel you gave me,
a bullet in my fucking gun.

904
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:34,514
I want my life back.

905
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:23,855
Safe travels.

906
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,969
<i>Estimated flight time
to Langley, 11 hours and 37 minutes.</i>

907
01:47:54,427 --> 01:47:56,221
<i>Cleared for takeoff.</i>

908
01:47:56,763 --> 01:47:58,265
Let's go home.

909
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,642
That sounds good.

910
01:48:02,227 --> 01:48:03,728
Let's go home.

911
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:12,112
Cocksucker?

912
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:14,698
Really?

913
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,828
I'm glad
it was convincing.
