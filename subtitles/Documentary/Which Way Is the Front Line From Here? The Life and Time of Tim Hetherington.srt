Here's the list of POWs
we're sending back.

13
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:23,199
Like this line, the military demarkation line
has to be drawn.

14
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,460
One centimeter above,
0.5 km

15
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,360
South took over K hill
three days ago.

16
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,724
We have that hill now.

17
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,227
The line is wrong.

18
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,799
If you want to keep arguing about it

19
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,526
Why don't we just go out into the field
and check it out for ourselves?

20
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:10,458
General

21
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,388
Yesterday, K hill was taken
by the north.

22
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,993
Here we go again.

23
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,892
Your discharge is
upon a truce, right?

24
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:32,094
It's been dragging
for a year and half.

25
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,292
I know.

26
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:42,188
You'll be transferred
to the investigation unit.

27
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,397
What?

28
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:45,598
No way.

29
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:49,860
They're shorthanded there.

30
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:56,598
Busy purging commies
and traitors in the South.

31
00:04:56,598 --> 00:05:00,698
A lot of them are
falsely accused.

32
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:03,960
KANG, watch your mouth.

33
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:07,799
They fed the NK soldiers

34
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:11,298
cause they were threatened
with guns.

35
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:14,458
And you call them
commies?

36
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:18,565
We can't help it.

37
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,224
They're collateral damage.

38
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,265
Purge pro-Japanese
pawns first.

39
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,526
Shut up!

40
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,226
Goddamn it!

41
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:40,224
This is serious shit.

42
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,129
You're a ClC officer.

43
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,330
What were you thinking?

44
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:51,697
Am I going to jail?

45
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:54,193
Why couldn't you
hold your tongue?

46
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:57,593
A breakdown of discipline
isn't tolerated at ClC.

47
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:03,795
You're not going to jail.

48
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,191
Go to the eastern front.

49
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,789
The eastern front?

50
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,288
Investigate this.

51
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,032
"Dear my beloved mom."

52
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:26,157
"l don't see the truce
happening anytime soon."

53
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:31,660
"We're losing comrades
in combats everyday."

54
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,899
This was written
by a NK soldier.

55
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,956
Right.

56
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,758
It was delivered
to this lady a week ago.

57
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,163
Through our MPS.

58
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,598
How's that possible?

59
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,860
There's a mole.

60
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,899
It was sent from
Alligator Company.

61
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:58,465
Didn't they lose the hill
the other day?

62
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,624
Right.

63
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:03,322
I would recall those bastards
and put the screws on them.

64
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:10,430
But that hill is very important
for the talks.

65
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:17,820
The company captain
got killed recently.

66
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:21,064
He was reported as a KlA.

67
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,621
But you know what?

68
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:29,620
What killed him is a gun
we officers use.

69
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,393
Doesn't it smell?

70
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:37,693
A new captain is leaving soon.
Go with him.

71
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,692
Thanks.

72
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,893
You won't be thankful
once you get there.

73
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,488
Wait.

74
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:53,192
Do you know
KlM Su-hyeok?

75
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,431
He was in your platoon.

76
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,897
Yes, we were friends
from college.

77
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,131
He went missing in action.

78
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,495
No.

79
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,057
He's in Alligator Company.

80
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,458
He's alive?

81
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,162
Jun 27, 1950
Uijeongbu

82
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:26,757
- Su-hyeok!
- Eun-pyo?

83
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,355
Su-hyeok!

84
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,098
Su-hyeok, are you okay?
Look at me.

85
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,826
Don't let me die.

86
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,827
Get up if you wanna live.

87
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,426
Come on, get up.

88
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:03,622
Sit!

89
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:05,824
Sir?

90
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,390
Get up.

91
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:15,992
Get up!

92
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:19,692
Get up!

93
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,097
Turn around.

94
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,590
Now!

95
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:29,689
Move it!

96
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,490
Look, dumbasses.

97
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:47,355
Do you know
why you're losing?

98
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:52,562
Do you know
why you keep running?

99
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,555
Let me tell you.

100
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:04,163
That's because you don't know
why you're fighting.

101
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:12,898
This war will end
in a week.

102
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:16,921
When it does,
we'll need you.

103
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:23,820
Go home and help us later
rebuild the nation.

104
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:27,465
We'll treat the wounded.

105
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,624
You can go.

106
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,831
See you again
when we're reunified.

107
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,531
- Eun-pyo?
- Su-hyeok!

108
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:41,928
- Let go!
- No!

109
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,265
Just leave.

110
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:45,731
Eun-pyo?

111
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:47,831
Su-hyeok!

112
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,031
- Hey, Cruit.
- Private NAM Sung-sik!

113
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,331
That's good.
Keep it loud.

114
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:20,990
Sir!
Yes, sir!

115
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,097
Do you know
where we're going?

116
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:25,498
Yes, sir.

117
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:31,698
To the eastern front, sir.
10th Division...

118
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,357
1st Company of 1st Battalion,
moron.

119
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:37,163
How old are you?

120
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,059
17, sir.

121
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,063
17...

122
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,162
17 is an adult.

123
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,662
KANG Eun-pyo, right?

124
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:50,698
Yes, sir.

125
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:55,959
Why'd you put in a transfer
for the eastern front?

126
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,731
A man of ambition,
aren't you?

127
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:06,622
This war will be over soon.

128
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:12,322
And those who fought
at the front line will rule.

129
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,224
The front line is
where soldiers should be.

130
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,921
Right, Private?

131
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:23,427
Yes, sir! I'm ready to die
for our country!

132
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,988
The Eastern Front
Camp Cayman

133
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:29,362
No greetings?

134
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,560
You!
Get over here.

135
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,561
- Why?
- Why?

136
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,028
- What the...
- Who stole my cigarettes?

137
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:40,723
You bitch!

138
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,465
- What the hell!
- Enemy!

139
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:44,930
Hey!

140
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:48,631
A POW is on the loose!

141
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,565
Get him!

142
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,531
Yes, sir!

143
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,930
Put it away, bitch.

144
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,621
I'm not a POW.

145
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,526
Why are you wearing
an enemy uniform?

146
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:07,225
Cause I'm cold.

147
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,221
Are you shitting me?

148
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,393
You call yourself a soldier?

149
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:14,797
Take it off.

150
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:16,992
Take it off now!

151
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:20,988
Stop yelling.
You're hurting my ears.

152
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:22,931
What are you doing?

153
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:26,386
I have it on inside.

154
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,790
I can't believe this.

155
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:31,490
Who are you?

156
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:32,990
Who am l?

157
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:36,690
What's this?

158
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:42,691
This is ridiculous.
Alligator my ass.

159
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:46,098
Sorry I'm late.

160
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,655
What's up with your accent?

161
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:51,763
Oh, I'm from the North.

162
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:55,598
I left home
20 years ago.

163
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,063
So I'm not red at all.

164
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,858
An acting commander?

165
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:05,053
No, sir.
MSG. YANG Hyo-sam.

166
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,558
The acting commander
will be here soon.

167
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,697
What are you doing here?

168
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:11,898
Hi.

169
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:16,058
Who are these kids?
This isn't a playground.

170
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,328
Send them away.

171
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:21,828
They're war orphans.

172
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:26,064
We've been looking
after them.

173
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:28,223
Damn, it's a mess here.

174
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,231
Let's go.

175
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,295
What a life.

176
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,097
An alligator?

177
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,892
How old are you?

178
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:23,554
State your rank
and name.

179
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,763
Alkaloid?

180
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:45,863
Where'd you get this?

181
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:48,963
What are you?

182
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,228
SHlN ll-young.

183
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,623
A captain?

184
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:10,528
You're the acting commander?

185
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,627
Respect your superior.

186
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,830
First Lieutenant
KANG Eun-pyo.

187
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,023
Aero-K.

188
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:24,165
We call it Aerok Hill.

189
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,926
2.5 kilometers in radius.

190
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:32,431
It's a strategic point,
covering these two points.

191
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:36,831
The enemy had it
7 hours ago.

192
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,694
But we took it back
on our 6th attack.

193
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:42,931
Many guys got wounded
and tired.

194
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:48,193
So the regimental commander
put us on a break.

195
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,297
Well done.

196
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,487
Listen.

197
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:59,531
I'm determined to end
this battle of attrition.

198
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:03,259
It won't be as easy
as you think.

199
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:08,364
What?

200
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,064
Sorry, sir.

201
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:14,198
We'll set up AA guns
on the foot of the hill.

202
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:18,198
Anti-aircraft guns?
But they have no air power.

203
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,755
You use them
only for fighters?

204
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,597
With AA guns,
our defense line here...

205
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:30,098
What if we lose them
to the enemy?

206
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:31,461
Then we're fucked.

207
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:34,861
He's right.

208
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,165
We're still here,
thanks to USAF air strike.

209
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:43,064
If they take our AA guns,
we can forget the air support.

210
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:43,927
Look.

211
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,630
We won't lose them.

212
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:50,421
Set up AA guns right now.

213
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,625
That's not good.

214
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,521
Who are you?

215
00:18:56,764 --> 00:19:00,628
First LT. KlM Su-hyeok.
Sorry I'm late.

216
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,423
First Lieutenant?

217
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,831
Not only are you alive,
you made First LT from Private.

218
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,731
In 2 years?

219
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:21,391
Officers die in battle fields,
and you get promoted fast.

220
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,389
Hey, you had this?

221
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,797
What, you've lost
your faith?

222
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,488
No, I just pray
for different things.

223
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:45,359
I used to ask God to save,
but now to kill.

224
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:46,563
Kill whom?

225
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:47,856
Anybody.

226
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,557
This won't be over
unless one side is gone.

227
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,656
Eun-pyo?

228
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:03,563
What's a ClC officer
doing here?

229
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,163
We have intel
about a mole here.

230
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:09,264
What?

231
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,862
That's bullshit.

232
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,663
I know.

233
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:26,564
Let's toast
to our new captain.

234
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:29,122
Fill your cups.

235
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,930
Here you go.

236
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:38,864
What's this?
It's water.

237
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:44,664
It can be either
water or booze.

238
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,425
It's all in your head.

239
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:52,290
Listen up.

240
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,097
Wake him up.

241
00:20:57,031 --> 00:21:01,486
To the regimental commander
who put on this party for us.

242
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:03,296
Let's toast.

243
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,487
Before that...

244
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,890
We lost a lot of men
in the last combat.

245
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:12,792
Let's toast to them first.

246
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:13,988
Go ahead.

247
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,095
Comrades, good bye.

248
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,487
Good bye!

249
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:54,254
Sorry about earlier.

250
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,627
You're here
to catch a mole?

251
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:04,930
Pour me a shot.

252
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,230
You look old.

253
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,830
I fought
in the Liberation Army.

254
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,518
- Against Japan?
- Yes, in Manchuria.

255
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:21,920
Mt. Hwabaek Battle
in 1941.

256
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:26,664
I got this badge
from an interim government.

257
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,323
It was dark at night.

258
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:33,394
Japs were coming,
and we were out of ammo.

259
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:36,931
We were ready to die.

260
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:40,631
Where are you going?
It is getting exciting.

261
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:45,931
"The eastern sky lit up
with artillery support."

262
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,831
I've heard it so many times
I know it by heart.

263
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:50,490
I'm sick of it.

264
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:52,788
What the...

265
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,692
Smarter than you look.

266
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,831
With artillery support...

267
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,592
No, he's not smart.

268
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,430
He'd be stupid
not to know it by now.

269
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,056
Enough of that.

270
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,357
Cruit?
Let us hear you sing.

271
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,354
NAM?

272
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:14,063
Private NAM Sung-sik!

273
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,554
Where's my platoon?

274
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,655
Why didn't you invite us?

275
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:21,964
Il-young?

276
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:24,261
Shit.

277
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,961
Eat this.

278
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:27,658
Eat it.

279
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:34,363
What's wrong?

280
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:41,064
It's okay.
We're retreating now

281
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:44,120
but we will strike back.

282
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,564
Where are you going?

283
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:53,864
Wake up, man.
We're not in Pohang.

284
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,023
Knock it off!

285
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:59,223
Why bring that shit up?

286
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:01,828
What?

287
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:05,730
Did food make you sick?

288
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:10,086
Why is it so cold?

289
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,089
What is it?

290
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,492
He thinks
we're in Pohang.

291
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,897
- Pohang?
- Forget it, guys.

292
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,330
It's behind us.

293
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,990
Where's my platoon?

294
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,792
Damn it!

295
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:36,230
Cheer up, guys.
Let's have some fun.

296
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,492
Come on, show us
some moves!

297
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:44,763
Fuck!

298
00:24:55,297 --> 00:25:00,559
NAM, sing us something
that's big in Seoul.

299
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,559
- Sing!
- Come on.

300
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,564
¢ÜLook at me, dear

301
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:21,018
Not that old shit.
Something new!

302
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:24,826
You're stabbing
the dead here.

303
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,029
What are you doing?

304
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,224
Hi.

305
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,022
Let's eat.

306
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:39,821
When will the war end?

307
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:41,264
What?

308
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:44,526
I bet you've talked
to high-ranking officers.

309
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:46,925
When?

310
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:52,230
Truce talks began
two fucking years ago.

311
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,631
It can be any day now.

312
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:58,096
And it's been 2 years.

313
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:02,395
Any idea how many
have died here?

314
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,490
It gets confusing.

315
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,891
Did he die?
Or was it someone else?

316
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,194
It's sick.

317
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,987
Did I see him
in the barracks?

318
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:24,855
Shit.

319
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:37,161
That Cruit?

320
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,763
What a song.

321
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:49,760
¢ÜHeard from a distance...

322
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:53,559
¢Üa loud gunshot,

323
00:26:54,397 --> 00:27:00,819
¢Ülike a lullaby,

324
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:08,924
¢Ütakes me home
¢Üin my dream.

325
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:13,427
¢ÜMy home,

326
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:17,421
¢Ümy sweet home...

327
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:28,164
¢ÜBefore a bowl of water...
¢Ümom prays for my safety.

328
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:37,393
¢ÜHer shining gray hair
¢Übrings tears to my eyes.

329
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:58,497
Get up!
Up!

330
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,396
Turn the lights on!

331
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:03,258
Get the hell up!

332
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,360
Get up!

333
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,097
Come on!

334
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,154
Listen.

335
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,355
They took Aerok Hill back.

336
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,297
Get your gear
and standby.

337
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:15,263
AA guns?
AA guns!

338
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:25,657
Can't even last a day.

339
00:28:41,063 --> 00:28:43,723
He shits,
and we clean it up?

340
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,320
This is bullshit.

341
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:52,319
If he doesn't know shit,
he should listen.

342
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:57,928
This was unthinkable
back in 1941.

343
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,963
We had 2 principles.

344
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:02,929
Minimum activities
and maximum focus.

345
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:06,619
A chatterbox
got killed first, right?

346
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:09,592
Shut up, funny boy.

347
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,789
We're wide open.
If Two Seconds sees us...

348
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,531
At least one will die.

349
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:20,930
What's Two Seconds?

350
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:26,531
If you know too much,
you'd be too scared.

351
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,230
You'll find out soon.

352
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,730
Look! After the combat,
write me the lyrics to that song.

353
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,697
Okay.

354
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,886
If you don't get killed today.

355
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:47,997
Machine guns.

356
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:50,259
AA guns.

357
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:54,760
That bitch is still alive.

358
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:59,660
They're digging foxholes,
expanding the defense line.

359
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:03,059
This is a piece of cake.
They're reserves.

360
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,197
I can't see past the hill.

361
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:06,696
Let's shoot and see.

362
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:09,663
If they have more men
over that hill?

363
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:11,854
We'll be trapped like rats.

364
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,063
We have their uniform, right?

365
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:15,160
Yes.

366
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:32,264
Comrade!
Comrade!

367
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,063
Why didn't you
answer the radio?

368
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,763
I've been calling you
from there.

369
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,627
What?
A radio?

370
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:40,063
Nobody radioed, right?

371
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:41,763
No, sir.

372
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:44,729
Are you sure
it's not broken?

373
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:47,929
Where'd you get
those boots?

374
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,590
What's your unit?

375
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,793
Get this asshole!

376
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,489
1 and 2, 11 o'clock.

377
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,294
3 and 4, 12 o'clock.
Man-seok?

378
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,430
Got them.

379
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,487
Move it!

380
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,197
One the ground, fuckers!

381
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,497
We heard the gunfire.
What's going on?

382
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,463
Answer it.

383
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:28,960
Do you copy?

384
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:31,997
Tell him
it was an accident.

385
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:34,656
It was an accident, sir.

386
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,596
A volley fire always works!

387
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:44,653
Radio HQ.

388
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:48,461
Dragonfly 2,
you're good to go.

389
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:51,156
We've been hit!

390
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:54,563
Fuck!

391
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,827
We're moving to 0-2-4.
Blow it.

392
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:06,024
What are you doing?

393
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:10,963
If we let them live now,
they'll kill us later.

394
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,429
Move to 0-2-4!

395
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:16,622
Hurry, sir.

396
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:28,893
Damn it!

397
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,487
They're back!

398
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,130
After the air strike,
move to the trench

399
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,595
before they come out
of the foxhole.

400
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:33,262
What the fuck!
Cry and I'll kill you!

401
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,096
To the trench!

402
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,490
Move it!

403
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,062
Medic!

404
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,557
To the trench!

405
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:05,161
To the trench!

406
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:25,325
We need to take out
that gun.

407
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:29,427
Let's just fucking charge!

408
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,323
He's too far.

409
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:40,164
Grenades will fall
30 meters before the pillbox.

410
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,823
- What?
- Get your grenades.

411
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:44,563
What are you doing?

412
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:45,620
I can't let you.

413
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,995
If they fall short,
I die.

414
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,994
Shit!

415
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,087
On my mark!

416
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,289
Now!

417
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,187
I can't see him.

418
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,893
He made it!

419
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,757
Charge!

420
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,863
Fucking commies!

421
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:54,755
Too late to turn back.

422
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,963
We gotta get up there.

423
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:58,519
I will lead.

424
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,164
2nd platoon in flank!

425
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:02,424
Go!

426
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,793
Keep going!

427
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:03,129
Fuck.

428
00:39:05,863 --> 00:39:07,829
Motherfuckers!

429
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:10,530
Eating corn power
and hiding out like rats!

430
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,996
- Put your hands up.
- Don't kill me.

431
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,289
It's a white flag!
Ceasefire!

432
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:50,763
Cruit.

433
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:52,462
You okay?

434
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:10,196
It's okay.

435
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:15,322
He looked younger
than me.

436
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:19,920
It's kill or get killed.
Right?

437
00:40:23,863 --> 00:40:24,920
Let's go.

438
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:29,323
Damn, I almost peed
my pants.

439
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:36,323
Damn Yankees,
they destroyed everything.

440
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:38,720
It'll take forever
to restore this.

441
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:40,763
We have to restore it?

442
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:43,820
Or what?
You'll ask the enemy?

443
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:49,092
Wow, you hung like a horse.

444
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:55,190
You damn kid...

445
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:34,662
Aerok Hill stands
on those bodies.

446
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:42,596
Remember that asshole who said
this war would be over in a week?

447
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:44,459
How could I forget?

448
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,196
He's here.

449
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:48,996
What?

450
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:51,155
Yep, it's him.

451
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:56,224
He put on airs and said...

452
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:58,822
This war would be over
in a week.

453
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,525
You don't know
why you're fighting.

454
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:07,426
I wanna ask him
why we're fighting.

455
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:09,827
Lieutenant!

456
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:13,323
What are you doing?
It's almost gone.

457
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,028
Come on.

458
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,689
What's wrong?

459
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,795
Are you drunk?

460
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:40,388
We have booze?

461
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,089
MSG. YANG said...

462
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:50,894
it'd help me
forget what happened.

463
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:56,395
Come on, drink it down.

464
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:00,186
Hey, that cup is mine.

465
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:03,153
Give it back.

466
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,558
- Give me some.
- Get your own cup.

467
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:07,262
This is mine.

468
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:15,260
Eun-pyo, come sit.
Drink with us.

469
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:27,653
Where'd you get the booze?

470
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:31,196
What's this?

471
00:43:31,196 --> 00:43:36,763
Oh, we didn't draw that.
Some commie did.

472
00:43:36,763 --> 00:43:38,228
Fucking idiot!

473
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:41,522
What's that in your hand?

474
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:46,727
It's nothing.

475
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:57,022
"Thanks for sending my regards
to my family in the South."

476
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,123
KlM Su-hyeok.

477
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,629
What's this?

478
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:06,163
Please, let it go.

479
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:07,322
Put it down.

480
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,596
What's wrong?

481
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:19,488
It's nothing.

482
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,689
YANG, put it down.

483
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,830
He's a ClC officer.
If he talks, we're dead.

484
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,284
You think
this is nothing?

485
00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:33,388
You've been talking
to commies?

486
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,995
Is this
what you're here for?

487
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:41,496
It's really nothing.

488
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:43,961
Explain it then.

489
00:44:50,496 --> 00:44:55,155
Do you know how many times
this hill changed hands?

490
00:44:57,396 --> 00:45:02,055
Nobody knows.
I counted up to 30, though.

491
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:05,853
We didn't wanna
carry all this shit back

492
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,896
when we pulled off this hill.

493
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:10,953
So?

494
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:14,359
We buried things
in this bunker.

495
00:45:14,763 --> 00:45:17,763
Socks, clothes,
chocolate from Yankees.

496
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:19,819
Ammo, cigarettes,
boots

497
00:45:24,563 --> 00:45:26,324
Because we'd be back.

498
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:35,518
When we took this hill back,
guess what we found here.

499
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:36,962
What?

500
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:38,223
Damn flies.

501
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,129
Crap.

502
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:48,887
What's this?

503
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:50,892
Let me.

504
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,995
Son of a bitch!

505
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:56,192
- It stinks.
- Stay away from me.

506
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:01,995
What the...

507
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,587
"Thanks for the chocolate,
cigarettes, and socks."

508
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,630
Fucking commies!

509
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,596
This is why
Communism's gotta go!

510
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:15,186
I'll kill them all!

511
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:17,429
Where are you going?

512
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:18,588
Let go!

513
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,188
Calm down.

514
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:23,761
So pissed off
we weren't ourselves.

515
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:29,596
So we buried a letter
cursing them.

516
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:31,396
You buried a letter?

517
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:34,362
Yes, we were not
thinking right.

518
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:39,654
Otherwise, we would've buried
grenades or a time bomb.

519
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:40,962
And then?

520
00:46:41,196 --> 00:46:47,753
As always, we lost the hill
and took it back.

521
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:55,323
What's this?

522
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:57,163
I know.

523
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:58,220
Don't.

524
00:47:00,163 --> 00:47:01,220
Okay.

525
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,023
What the...

526
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:07,463
Isn't this booze?

527
00:47:07,463 --> 00:47:08,663
Booze?

528
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:10,563
This is rice wine
from the North.

529
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:13,463
Dump it.
It might be poisoned.

530
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,723
Are you sure?

531
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:16,463
This is booze.

532
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:17,429
Dump it.

533
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:23,463
I'm not hallucinating.
It really is booze.

534
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:25,724
- Damn.
- Ki-young.

535
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:36,694
Just to make sure...

536
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:38,486
Smell it.

537
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:43,388
Fine.

538
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:45,786
Wait.

539
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:48,488
Hold on.

540
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:53,329
If they wanted to kill us,
they wouldn't have left wine.

541
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,386
That's right.

542
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:57,629
They would've buried
a grenade instead.

543
00:47:57,629 --> 00:47:58,829
You're right.

544
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:00,692
Why give us booze?

545
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,453
Fuck it.
I don't care if I die.

546
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,652
What's wrong?

547
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:14,362
Let me have another sip.

548
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:18,562
- Smart ass!
- This is the real thing!

549
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:22,855
- Give me some!
- Wait for the go!

550
00:48:26,296 --> 00:48:27,557
That booze...

551
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:32,460
It was bribery.

552
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:37,328
Buried with it was
a thick envelope.

553
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:41,363
In it was a few letters.

554
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:42,563
Letters?

555
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:46,263
Some NK solders were
drafted from SK.

556
00:48:46,263 --> 00:48:49,922
And some defected to NK
and enlisted.

557
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:55,662
They left letters
for their families back home.

558
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:56,762
So?

559
00:48:56,762 --> 00:49:00,862
So I mailed them all.

560
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:01,962
You did?

561
00:49:01,962 --> 00:49:04,723
Yes, I did.

562
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:09,729
Since then, we've buried
cigarettes for them.

563
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:12,093
And they did booze,
matches...

564
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:15,888
We're always low
on matches.

565
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,293
Isn't this nice?

566
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,190
That's it?

567
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:29,586
What else did you expect?

568
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:34,995
You think we leaked
military secrets?

569
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:38,688
Putting our lives at risk?

570
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:50,257
YANG, put it down.

571
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:53,955
I wanna hear
what he has to say.

572
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:21,926
Do you have anything to do
with the death of a former captain?

573
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:26,263
He was shot in the head
at point blank.

574
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:31,321
The pistol used to kill him is
what we officers use.

575
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,220
Of course.
It was his pistol.

576
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:38,062
What?

577
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:41,824
He shot himself
while running from a battle.

578
00:50:44,462 --> 00:50:46,326
He was a piece of shit.

579
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:52,387
But I reported him as a KlA
out of courtesy.

580
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:53,993
You saw it?

581
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,587
One of the boys did.

582
00:50:57,129 --> 00:50:58,594
Where's he now?

583
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:02,293
He died today.
One you buried earlier.

584
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,189
Where did you find
his body?

585
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:10,693
In the creek
north of the hill.

586
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:14,692
Listen, Eun-pyo.

587
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:22,360
There's nothing
you can dig out here.

588
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:26,158
Even if you do...

589
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:29,359
Nothing you can do about it.

590
00:51:32,196 --> 00:51:35,162
What makes you so sure?

591
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:44,660
Just leave
before you get killed.

592
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:49,953
I will.

593
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:53,556
But...

594
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:57,628
Now is not the time.

595
00:52:17,462 --> 00:52:20,020
KIM Su-hyeok...

596
00:53:30,896 --> 00:53:32,452
What are you doing here?

597
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:42,619
Yours?

598
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:49,518
You live nearby?

599
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:57,722
Have you seen anything
suspicious around here?

600
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:10,891
Go home.
You're not safe here.

601
00:54:14,428 --> 00:54:15,485
Hold on.

602
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:30,990
It's chocolate.

603
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:44,659
Don't come back.

604
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:53,957
Guys, get up there!

605
00:55:43,962 --> 00:55:45,019
Medic!

606
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:59,485
June, 1953

607
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:03,392
3rd platoon lost 8 men.

608
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:08,094
And 23 got wounded
and need to be evacuated.

609
00:56:08,428 --> 00:56:10,128
Most of them are
severely...

610
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:12,185
We don't have men
to evac them.

611
00:56:12,629 --> 00:56:16,186
Request the regiment
for an evac team.

612
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:20,757
Get out of here.

613
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:26,096
What's this?
Disobeying my order?

614
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:27,459
No.

615
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:32,395
We need at least 30 men
to evac 23.

616
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:33,861
There's no way.

617
00:56:34,796 --> 00:56:36,195
That's not it.

618
00:56:36,195 --> 00:56:41,060
When will the war end?

619
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:43,053
What?

620
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,059
Give me the letters.

621
00:56:52,495 --> 00:56:53,495
So many things to say!

622
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,120
- I'm here.
- Come on.

623
00:56:56,362 --> 00:57:01,022
"Thanks for the lyrics to
Night at the Front Line."

624
00:57:01,762 --> 00:57:06,062
"Do me a favor.
Send my family this picture."

625
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:08,028
Wait.
Give it here.

626
00:57:09,862 --> 00:57:16,818
"l don't think I will see them
ever again."

627
00:57:22,562 --> 00:57:26,722
This CHA Tae-kyung kid
has a pretty sister.

628
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:28,586
Come on.

629
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:31,793
Stop drooling.
She's pretty, so what?

630
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:35,228
If her brother is red,
she is too.

631
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:36,489
Give it here.

632
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:43,189
His sister is a fox.

633
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,089
Who's this?

634
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:50,385
CHA Tae-kyung.

635
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:56,285
She's cute.

636
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,128
I'll keep it.
Mail this.

637
00:57:59,128 --> 00:58:00,796
You can't do that.

638
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:01,762
Forget it.

639
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,657
Yeah, forget it.

640
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:08,450
What do you think
of my future wife?

641
00:58:09,495 --> 00:58:12,461
I have the address.
I can visit her after the war.

642
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:15,061
This girl...

643
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:28,055
What's going on
with damn truce talks?

644
00:58:31,395 --> 00:58:33,361
This is bullshit.

645
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:37,362
The war has been in a deadlock
for 2 years now.

646
00:58:37,362 --> 00:58:40,021
And half a million
have died so far.

647
00:58:40,462 --> 00:58:42,362
It's crazy, isn't it?

648
00:58:42,362 --> 00:58:44,225
Damn.

649
00:58:44,362 --> 00:58:45,726
Look, NAM.

650
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:50,724
Why can't we stop fighting
during truce talks?

651
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:56,621
You should be a CO
for the UN forces.

652
00:58:57,262 --> 00:58:59,125
Yeah, that's right.

653
00:59:00,562 --> 00:59:02,118
You don't mind?

654
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:05,061
You're funny.

655
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:06,118
Move.

656
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:08,491
What's this?

657
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:10,328
It's a pair of goggles.

658
00:59:10,328 --> 00:59:11,487
Here.

659
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:15,590
- If I put them on...
- Give them here.

660
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,891
Made in Germany.

661
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:38,393
Wow, Lieutenant.
They look horrible on you.

662
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:43,958
Here, Cruit.

663
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:46,759
That's not fair.

664
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:49,695
He didn't do anything
to deserve these.

665
00:59:49,695 --> 00:59:51,995
They're for him.

666
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:54,595
It's for the lyrics
to that song.

667
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,652
You don't know that.

668
00:59:57,395 --> 00:59:58,452
Come on.

669
00:59:58,796 --> 00:59:59,762
Take them.

670
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:01,552
Move.

671
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:07,155
Why don't you sing it for us?

672
01:00:07,695 --> 01:00:08,955
Sure.

673
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:14,662
One, two, three, four

674
01:00:14,662 --> 01:00:23,721
¢ÜLeaves are falling...

675
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:30,117
¢Üinto the night
¢Üat the front line.

676
01:00:30,662 --> 01:00:37,823
¢ÜFalling down silently...

677
01:00:38,662 --> 01:00:44,617
¢Üdews are so cold...

678
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,887
We have intel

679
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:56,729
Chinese army will set up
a strategic base here.

680
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:58,194
Any word from Recon?

681
01:00:58,428 --> 01:00:59,428
Nothing?

682
01:00:59,428 --> 01:01:04,883
We lost contact with them
on the north ridge.

683
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,287
It's been 8 hours.

684
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:10,128
They might've been sniped.

685
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:14,228
If that's the case,
it must be Two Seconds.

686
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:18,388
That piece of shit
turned up again.

687
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:20,028
Two Seconds?

688
01:01:20,028 --> 01:01:24,895
It's our nickname
for this enemy sniper.

689
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:26,195
Why Two Seconds?

690
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:28,161
The body goes down first.

691
01:01:28,395 --> 01:01:32,452
And 2 seconds later,
a gunshot is heard.

692
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:33,995
That's why.

693
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:36,895
From 680 meters away?

694
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,796
Yes.

695
01:01:37,796 --> 01:01:41,250
He must've modified
his rifle.

696
01:01:42,095 --> 01:01:44,995
He's killed about 30
of our men.

697
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,495
How are we gonna
get him?

698
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,154
I'll get him.

699
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:50,656
Can you do it?

700
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:56,020
Give me 10 men.

701
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:04,127
Where the fuck is he?

702
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:05,825
He's not here.

703
01:02:06,562 --> 01:02:08,221
Let's go back.

704
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:11,128
Not yet.

705
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:16,961
We searched everywhere.
He's not here.

706
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,427
You've been holding it, huh?

707
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,228
Let me see your dick.

708
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:35,091
Are you nuts?

709
01:02:36,928 --> 01:02:38,189
Come here.

710
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:39,729
Get your ass over here.

711
01:02:39,729 --> 01:02:40,928
No way!

712
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:43,228
Come on.
We're leaving soon.

713
01:02:43,228 --> 01:02:44,694
Come here.

714
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,894
So you can beat me?
No way.

715
01:02:52,629 --> 01:02:54,185
- It's Two Seconds!
- Get down!

716
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:01,295
No!
Don't go.

717
01:03:01,295 --> 01:03:03,595
I can't move my leg.

718
01:03:03,595 --> 01:03:07,254
Don't fall for a trap!
Stay put!

719
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:09,461
Where'd he shoot from?

720
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,461
Sergeant YANG...

721
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:13,159
Sergeant YANG!

722
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:14,755
Don't move.

723
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:16,627
Stay there!

724
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,058
Sung-sik!

725
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:43,818
Help me.
I don't wanna die.

726
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:55,519
Sung-sik!

727
01:03:56,262 --> 01:03:57,319
Don't!

728
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:00,023
- I want him to shoot again.
- What?

729
01:04:02,362 --> 01:04:03,162
One more shot.

730
01:04:03,162 --> 01:04:04,562
We have to get him.

731
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:06,861
He's waiting for us
to take the bait.

732
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:08,384
Are you crazy?

733
01:04:10,328 --> 01:04:11,691
Fuck.

734
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:16,994
Sung-sik, grab it.

735
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,188
Hang in there!

736
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,394
Grab it.

737
01:04:27,228 --> 01:04:29,387
Reach for it.

738
01:04:30,928 --> 01:04:31,587
That's good.

739
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:35,428
We got him.

740
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:37,291
Commo!

741
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:38,828
Stop.

742
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:41,260
Stop shooting me!

743
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:01,861
Sung-sik.

744
01:05:04,594 --> 01:05:05,753
Give me your hand.

745
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:08,259
Requesting
an artillery attack.

746
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:10,495
The coordinates are...

747
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:12,051
Give me your
goddamn hand!

748
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:17,220
Lieutenant...

749
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:19,423
Come on!

750
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:20,724
Lieutenant...

751
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:25,020
Sung-sik...

752
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:30,617
Die, Two Seconds.

753
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:36,523
Sung-sik!

754
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,189
Where the fuck is he?

755
01:06:09,628 --> 01:06:11,492
He couldn't have made it.

756
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:14,128
His body must've been
torn into pieces.

757
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:16,889
No, he's alive.

758
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:18,487
What?

759
01:06:19,628 --> 01:06:20,958
He walked.

760
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:25,060
Fuck!

761
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:26,854
Poor Sung-sik.

762
01:06:27,995 --> 01:06:30,195
He was so young.

763
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,354
So what?

764
01:06:31,895 --> 01:06:34,495
This is a battlefield,
and anybody can die.

765
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:37,795
Is there an order
who dies first?

766
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:40,556
Age means nothing
in war.

767
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:46,389
Chocolate?

768
01:07:50,928 --> 01:07:54,587
Was it that boy who sang?

769
01:07:59,995 --> 01:08:01,359
Lieutenant KANG!

770
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:05,660
Where are you?

771
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:09,954
This way, guys.

772
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:23,061
Fuck.

773
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:59,222
An artillery attack
for a single sniper?

774
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:03,721
I should've taken out
the commo first.

775
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:32,828
The 2nd Corps of
Chinese Army is

776
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:36,192
setting up a new point
in the northwest of Aerok Hill.

777
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:38,591
First LT. KANG?

778
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:41,553
Are you listening?

779
01:09:42,394 --> 01:09:44,952
Put your head together!

780
01:09:47,694 --> 01:09:51,854
To hold the defense line...

781
01:10:04,394 --> 01:10:05,553
Got something to say?

782
01:10:09,995 --> 01:10:12,154
Sung-sik died
because of you.

783
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,722
Many have died.

784
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:20,018
This is war.

785
01:10:21,061 --> 01:10:22,526
Is this how?

786
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:29,626
How you made First LT
from Private in 2 years?

787
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,861
I guess it is.

788
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,861
I did what I had to do.

789
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:40,361
I bet you did.
Each and every time.

790
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,520
Now you're going
for captain?

791
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:44,861
Should I salute you?

792
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:47,327
The war killed Sung-sik.

793
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,427
That's bullshit, asshole!

794
01:10:49,427 --> 01:10:51,290
Excuse me?

795
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:59,228
My arm will grow back
when I grow up, right?

796
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:02,928
I said no.
It won't, will it?

797
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:07,883
It will grow back,
and I'll be normal again, right?

798
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:22,455
Look.

799
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,554
Are you a lizard?

800
01:11:25,294 --> 01:11:27,658
Arms don't grow.

801
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:31,594
You'll be armless
until you die, freak!

802
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:32,753
Motherfucker!

803
01:11:36,095 --> 01:11:37,995
It'll grow back!

804
01:11:37,995 --> 01:11:39,594
You call yourself human?

805
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:43,356
Tell me it will!

806
01:11:46,995 --> 01:11:51,694
No, I'm not human anymore.
I died long ago!

807
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:53,319
3 years of hell!

808
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:55,461
What do you expect?

809
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,121
Shut the fuck up.

810
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:03,861
What do you know
about war?

811
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,520
Things are worse
in the rear.

812
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:10,261
You're not the only one
fighting a war.

813
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:12,420
Everybody is in hell!

814
01:12:16,161 --> 01:12:18,128
You don't know a thing
about hell.

815
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,221
NAM Sung-sik.

816
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:25,718
Kids like him die
everyday.

817
01:12:27,728 --> 01:12:31,182
Hundreds of thousands
have died.

818
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:37,183
And why the fuck isn't
this war ending?

819
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:42,191
What do you know
about hell?

820
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:47,893
What is hell?

821
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:51,193
Is it Pohang?

822
01:12:57,628 --> 01:13:01,061
Tell me!
Where's my platoon?

823
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:05,553
Where's everybody?

824
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:06,594
Move.

825
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:07,753
Don't get closer!

826
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:09,751
He's completely crazy.

827
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:13,095
Thank God
he doesn't have a grenade.

828
01:13:13,095 --> 01:13:14,560
He's not crazy.

829
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:16,860
He's on and off.

830
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:21,094
Can't you see him?
Have him transferred.

831
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:23,560
He will receive
a dishonorable discharge.

832
01:13:23,694 --> 01:13:26,394
It's not fair
for a man of bravery.

833
01:13:26,394 --> 01:13:28,594
What?
You sons of...

834
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:31,458
Where's my platoon?

835
01:13:32,194 --> 01:13:34,217
It got wiped out!

836
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:36,261
Can't you remember?

837
01:13:36,261 --> 01:13:39,461
SONG Hyung-jong!
AHN Hyun-su!

838
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:41,825
KANG Hyuk-pill!
JUNG Man-su!

839
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:44,921
JUNG Kyu-won!
Who else?

840
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:49,125
NAM Guk-bae, SHlN Chang-su
They all died.

841
01:13:49,361 --> 01:13:53,521
When we fled Pohang,
2nd platoon got wiped out.

842
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:56,427
Why?

843
01:13:58,161 --> 01:13:59,320
Why?

844
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:01,320
If so...

845
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:04,818
Why am I alive?

846
01:14:06,928 --> 01:14:08,689
Tell me, PFC. SHlN!

847
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:16,127
Captain, no.

848
01:14:16,127 --> 01:14:17,184
Don't.

849
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:21,890
Stay back!
Why am I the only one alive?

850
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:23,585
Tell me!

851
01:14:35,027 --> 01:14:36,288
Sang-uk.

852
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:39,288
Look at me.

853
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:42,351
Don't you remember?

854
01:14:44,494 --> 01:14:46,551
What happened
in Pohang?

855
01:14:48,094 --> 01:14:53,394
Why'd everybody die
except you?

856
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:54,451
Enough!

857
01:14:55,494 --> 01:14:57,153
That's enough.

858
01:14:57,895 --> 01:14:59,656
Look at me.

859
01:15:00,494 --> 01:15:04,358
It's me, ll-young.

860
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:36,418
No!

861
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,561
Get him!

862
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:40,527
Doc!

863
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:48,489
You were lucky.
It missed the bone.

864
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:56,389
You don't feel pain,
do you?

865
01:16:01,027 --> 01:16:04,289
He's hooked on morphine.

866
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,191
What is it?

867
01:16:08,628 --> 01:16:10,991
What happened
in Pohang?

868
01:16:17,528 --> 01:16:20,255
Fuck Pohang...

869
01:16:20,594 --> 01:16:23,754
August 17, 1950
Pohang

870
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:40,454
What are we gonna do?

871
01:16:41,194 --> 01:16:42,455
Retreat!

872
01:16:51,394 --> 01:16:54,361
Take us with you!

873
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:56,060
- There's no time!
- Are you crazy?

874
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,361
Let's go!

875
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:01,060
Get the fuck back!

876
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,361
We can't take no more!

877
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:05,261
You're leaving us to die?

878
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:06,060
There's no room!

879
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,924
Get back, assholes!

880
01:17:09,161 --> 01:17:10,218
Let's go!

881
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,461
Climb on!

882
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:24,120
Get us out of here!

883
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:28,628
Hit it!

884
01:17:28,628 --> 01:17:29,685
Fuck!

885
01:17:33,828 --> 01:17:34,884
Captain!

886
01:17:41,027 --> 01:17:41,890
Bro.

887
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:44,990
Bro!

888
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:36,124
You killed our own men!

889
01:19:21,227 --> 01:19:23,090
You crazy bastard.

890
01:19:23,728 --> 01:19:29,490
Why are you trying
to kill yourself?

891
01:19:38,827 --> 01:19:40,657
Who's to blame him?

892
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:45,749
He saved us all.

893
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,057
Didn't he?

894
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:55,653
Who could deny that?

895
01:19:56,494 --> 01:19:57,551
Tell me.

896
01:19:58,194 --> 01:19:59,455
Tell me!

897
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:03,251
Tell me,
you fucking cowards!

898
01:20:05,294 --> 01:20:08,454
He's right.
You saved us.

899
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:14,626
Why can't you admit that?

900
01:20:17,161 --> 01:20:22,718
2nd platoon got wiped out
in combat.

901
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:27,819
Il-young.

902
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,422
It's not your fault.

903
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,926
Heard that, Private?

904
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:42,320
You killed our men to survive.
Don't waste your life now.

905
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,887
Su-hyeok...

906
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:10,390
- Sang-uk!
- Sang-uk!

907
01:21:11,127 --> 01:21:13,286
It's okay.

908
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:17,884
Send them away with him.

909
01:21:18,528 --> 01:21:19,959
No more kids here.

910
01:21:36,594 --> 01:21:39,693
We've had so many battles.

911
01:21:39,693 --> 01:21:44,648
But this one will be the last one
over Aerok Hill.

912
01:21:45,794 --> 01:21:49,658
We've heard that
more than enough.

913
01:21:50,593 --> 01:21:52,194
I'm sick of hearing that.

914
01:21:52,194 --> 01:21:53,921
How dare you!

915
01:21:57,161 --> 01:21:58,626
Keep quiet.

916
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,923
Carry on.

917
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:11,218
The Chinese Army
will lead the attack.

918
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,125
When the ROK asses
pull out

919
01:22:16,361 --> 01:22:19,660
we'll wipe them out
on their retreat.

920
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,921
Got it?

921
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,583
Take sure
they don't get away.

922
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:28,886
What's the point?

923
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:31,528
One minute, it's ours.
And next minute, it's theirs.

924
01:22:31,528 --> 01:22:35,290
What if they take it,
and an armistice is signed?

925
01:22:37,528 --> 01:22:40,227
That's a suicide!

926
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:42,489
If they take away our men

927
01:22:43,127 --> 01:22:45,027
Aerok will be stranded.

928
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:48,891
We can't defend
against those Chinks.

929
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:50,288
So?

930
01:22:51,327 --> 01:22:54,227
We desert Aerok
and set up a new defense line.

931
01:22:54,227 --> 01:22:56,027
We cut off
their line of supply.

932
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:58,584
Then focus our fire
on them.

933
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:00,159
What the fuck!

934
01:23:00,294 --> 01:23:03,055
Who do you think you are?

935
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:05,894
A commander-in-chief?

936
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:07,494
Know your fucking place.

937
01:23:07,494 --> 01:23:09,460
Have you fought
against those chinks?

938
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:13,853
Do you even know
who Peng Dehuai is?

939
01:23:14,294 --> 01:23:17,851
They have more men
than our ammo.

940
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,650
Did you know that?

941
01:23:22,094 --> 01:23:23,355
Son of a bitch.

942
01:23:23,493 --> 01:23:25,755
Contumacy in times of war
results in what?

943
01:23:26,994 --> 01:23:27,857
Say it.

944
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:31,058
Contumacy results in what?

945
01:23:32,461 --> 01:23:34,222
Punishment on the spot.

946
01:23:34,461 --> 01:23:39,018
Standby to attack
along Hakang ridge.

947
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,823
Answer me.

948
01:23:43,161 --> 01:23:43,860
Sir.

949
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:44,826
Repeat it!

950
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:48,218
Along Hakang ridge.

951
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,461
Standby to attack.

952
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:51,619
KANG?

953
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,525
Standby on the north ridge.
Repeat it.

954
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:59,719
Standby on the north ridge.

955
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:19,691
Captain SHlN was
right about this.

956
01:24:21,427 --> 01:24:24,881
He's saved our ass
quite a few times.

957
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,285
Soldiers live and die
by orders.

958
01:24:30,027 --> 01:24:33,686
But this is like dying
for nothing.

959
01:24:48,194 --> 01:24:51,160
The visibility is bad.
I can't see shit.

960
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:54,453
And we can't hear shit
because of the rain.

961
01:25:04,794 --> 01:25:05,760
Contact!

962
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,626
They're here!

963
01:25:59,627 --> 01:26:01,927
It's chinks.
They're too many!

964
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:03,327
No word from HQ?

965
01:26:03,327 --> 01:26:07,127
We have to pull out.
Aerok is completely surrounded.

966
01:26:07,127 --> 01:26:08,627
Give us your order.

967
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:10,184
Not so fast.

968
01:26:11,326 --> 01:26:12,792
We gotta wait.

969
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,559
I can't get Capt. SHlN
on the radio.

970
01:26:19,794 --> 01:26:23,894
That means...
He and his men are dead.

971
01:26:23,894 --> 01:26:26,053
- Get HQ on the radio!
- Yes, sir!

972
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:30,555
Sir, it's Chinese army.
We're outnumbered.

973
01:26:31,194 --> 01:26:32,853
I know, but...

974
01:26:35,994 --> 01:26:37,255
What'd he say?

975
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:40,657
We're defending the hill.

976
01:26:44,194 --> 01:26:46,955
We'll fight to the end.

977
01:26:48,094 --> 01:26:50,651
He doesn't know
the situation here.

978
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:52,660
We have to retreat now.

979
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,319
Fuck!

980
01:26:55,261 --> 01:26:58,818
Il-young is dead.
We're all gonna die!

981
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:01,519
Motherfucker!

982
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:08,125
Should I send you
where ll-young is?

983
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,918
You should've listened
to ll-young!

984
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,260
Soldiers die
when they're told to!

985
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,521
No!

986
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,826
Captain, don't do it.

987
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:40,581
Our captain is dead.
By the military law

988
01:27:41,627 --> 01:27:43,184
I'm in charge now.

989
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:46,127
We're pulling out.

990
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,184
Yes, sir!

991
01:27:53,927 --> 01:27:55,086
By the military law?

992
01:27:58,027 --> 01:27:59,959
If you kill me,
you're in charge.

993
01:28:00,894 --> 01:28:03,655
Can you get our boys
out of here?

994
01:28:05,094 --> 01:28:08,151
If you can, shoot me.

995
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:11,953
We don't have time.

996
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:23,393
Get all the survivors
to Ridge 315.

997
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:24,393
- Move!
- Yes, sir!

998
01:28:24,393 --> 01:28:25,859
If we make it...

999
01:28:29,493 --> 01:28:31,857
I'll have you
court-marshaled.

1000
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,619
Keep going!
Leave him!

1001
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,560
We're fucked.

1002
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,026
Put up a white flag!

1003
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,017
We gotta go.

1004
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,826
Go!
Save your ass!

1005
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,422
Get out of here!

1006
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,060
I'm not leaving behind
anybody anymore.

1007
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,117
Get up.

1008
01:29:06,527 --> 01:29:07,686
Fuck!

1009
01:29:09,827 --> 01:29:11,190
Sergeant YANG!

1010
01:29:11,827 --> 01:29:13,088
Sergeant Yang!

1011
01:29:14,127 --> 01:29:16,527
Why didn't you just
leave me?!

1012
01:29:16,527 --> 01:29:18,390
Funny boy.

1013
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:21,292
Wait for your turn.

1014
01:29:22,627 --> 01:29:27,184
Mt. Hwabaek Battle
in 1941.

1015
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:31,691
I got this badge
from an interim...

1016
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:34,283
YANG!

1017
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:39,057
Fuck the badge!

1018
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:55,357
We're out of ammo.

1019
01:30:03,894 --> 01:30:05,951
I guess this is it.

1020
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,719
It's Capt. SHlN!

1021
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,218
He's alive!

1022
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,621
How are you holding up?

1023
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,260
When that flare goes out

1024
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:27,022
fire all the trench mortar
and get out of here.

1025
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,820
If they fall for it,
they'll be shooting at each other.

1026
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,960
Take your men and go.

1027
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,760
I'll be right after you.

1028
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,817
No matter what,
we're sticking together.

1029
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,922
You're in charge now.

1030
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,519
Save your men.

1031
01:30:47,727 --> 01:30:48,784
Focus!

1032
01:30:50,627 --> 01:30:51,684
Trench mortar!

1033
01:30:52,027 --> 01:30:53,083
Fire!

1034
01:31:14,126 --> 01:31:15,592
Damn chinks.

1035
01:31:17,226 --> 01:31:21,249
The US recon aircraft is up,
and they're gone.

1036
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:25,853
Let me ask you something.

1037
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:31,557
Was it you?

1038
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:36,653
Did you kill
the former captain?

1039
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,693
What makes you
think I did?

1040
01:31:41,693 --> 01:31:46,993
Because Capt. YOO will be
reported as a KlA.

1041
01:31:46,993 --> 01:31:52,324
You've seen enough.
Isn't your job over now?

1042
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,817
What?
It's not enough?

1043
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,317
Murders, treachery,
disobeying orders.

1044
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,221
Those are my charges?

1045
01:32:07,059 --> 01:32:08,116
That's right.

1046
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,419
I report you
and my job is over.

1047
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,959
So is yours, asshole.

1048
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:19,619
I'd rather die out here.

1049
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:39,226
Two fucking Seconds.

1050
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:40,487
It didn't echo.

1051
01:32:41,426 --> 01:32:42,790
He's nearby.

1052
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:46,788
Listen up.

1053
01:32:47,026 --> 01:32:51,482
I count to 3, and we all run
in different directions.

1054
01:32:51,727 --> 01:32:54,488
He's fast,
but he can't kill us all.

1055
01:32:54,727 --> 01:32:56,386
Some of us will live.

1056
01:32:57,026 --> 01:32:57,992
One!

1057
01:32:58,493 --> 01:32:59,459
Two!

1058
01:33:00,193 --> 01:33:00,852
Three!

1059
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,223
I see you, asshole.

1060
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,921
I got him.

1061
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:06,092
You...

1062
01:34:09,527 --> 01:34:10,788
CHA Tae-kyung?

1063
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:16,290
Fuck.

1064
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,083
Su-hyeok!

1065
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:20,883
No.

1066
01:34:21,426 --> 01:34:22,326
Don't come!

1067
01:34:22,326 --> 01:34:23,485
Su-hyeok!

1068
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,786
Eun-pyo, don't come.

1069
01:34:29,926 --> 01:34:30,892
Su-hyeok...

1070
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:31,989
Go!

1071
01:34:39,593 --> 01:34:40,956
Su-hyeok!

1072
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,759
Eun-pyo...

1073
01:35:03,493 --> 01:35:06,947
Don't come,
or you'll get killed.

1074
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:25,623
You know what?

1075
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,019
I think I died long ago.

1076
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,624
You, me.

1077
01:35:43,759 --> 01:35:45,987
Everybody
in Alligator Company.

1078
01:35:47,326 --> 01:35:50,690
Even Two Seconds.

1079
01:35:51,627 --> 01:35:54,286
She also died long ago.

1080
01:35:56,026 --> 01:35:58,185
Like Sung-sick...

1081
01:36:00,326 --> 01:36:04,088
We've killed too many.

1082
01:36:07,926 --> 01:36:10,790
We should be in hell.

1083
01:36:11,326 --> 01:36:12,383
Stop talking.

1084
01:36:15,226 --> 01:36:21,250
But hell can't be
worse than here.

1085
01:36:23,293 --> 01:36:27,748
Killing each other...

1086
01:36:31,293 --> 01:36:32,952
I die today, and...

1087
01:36:34,593 --> 01:36:35,853
Stop it!

1088
01:36:36,193 --> 01:36:39,159
You're not dying, asshole!

1089
01:36:41,393 --> 01:36:42,552
Eun-pyo.

1090
01:36:45,593 --> 01:36:47,559
My mom...

1091
01:36:47,893 --> 01:36:51,093
Yes, Su-hyeok.

1092
01:36:51,093 --> 01:36:52,616
My mom...

1093
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,825
I can't remember her face.

1094
01:37:04,959 --> 01:37:06,323
Su-hyeok?

1095
01:37:07,959 --> 01:37:10,720
Su-hyeok!

1096
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,326
No.

1097
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,719
No!

1098
01:38:04,493 --> 01:38:06,049
Sorry...

1099
01:38:23,893 --> 01:38:26,359
We got booze, too.

1100
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:49,460
"Goggles are handy
in summer. Thanks."

1101
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,323
It must be that boy.

1102
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:57,218
He's dead.

1103
01:38:58,759 --> 01:39:00,521
I killed him.

1104
01:39:00,759 --> 01:39:05,782
They killed many
of our comrades, too.

1105
01:39:11,426 --> 01:39:12,891
What does it say?

1106
01:39:15,926 --> 01:39:16,789
"Hey, CHA Tae-kyung"

1107
01:39:17,093 --> 01:39:18,160
The photo is mine!
And don't worry about your sister.

1108
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,326
I'll take good care of her.
Let's stop fighting, assholes.

1109
01:39:19,326 --> 01:39:21,883
What is it?

1110
01:39:22,226 --> 01:39:23,782
What does it say?

1111
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,683
"Let's stop fighting, assholes."

1112
01:39:29,026 --> 01:39:30,326
That's all?

1113
01:39:30,326 --> 01:39:32,926
Pretty much.

1114
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:37,226
I bet they're sick
of this war.

1115
01:39:37,226 --> 01:39:40,351
So are we.
Why are we fighting then?

1116
01:39:50,493 --> 01:39:55,357
¢ÜLeaves are...

1117
01:39:56,692 --> 01:40:00,250
¢ÜFalling...

1118
01:40:00,393 --> 01:40:01,393
KIM Su-hyeok

1119
01:40:01,393 --> 01:40:05,052
¢Ülnto the night...

1120
01:40:05,492 --> 01:40:07,993
¢Üat the front line...

1121
01:40:07,993 --> 01:40:08,959
Sir!

1122
01:40:11,959 --> 01:40:15,016
Comrade Captain!

1123
01:40:15,859 --> 01:40:17,416
The war is over.

1124
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,019
Listen to this.

1125
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,126
The armistice has been
signed by...

1126
01:40:24,193 --> 01:40:27,460
The war is over!

1127
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:28,925
It's over!

1128
01:40:48,326 --> 01:40:49,484
Thank you!

1129
01:40:51,026 --> 01:40:52,685
We made it alive!

1130
01:40:53,126 --> 01:40:54,591
Thank you, sir!

1131
01:41:03,426 --> 01:41:04,584
Lieutenant KANG!

1132
01:41:23,093 --> 01:41:25,252
How could this happen?

1133
01:41:36,393 --> 01:41:38,154
Why couldn't you survive
another day?

1134
01:41:42,893 --> 01:41:45,859
The war is fucking over.

1135
01:41:51,559 --> 01:41:53,025
Sir...

1136
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,523
It's okay to be hurt.

1137
01:42:10,059 --> 01:42:11,615
You can cry.

1138
01:42:25,726 --> 01:42:26,783
Bro...

1139
01:42:45,026 --> 01:42:46,185
Fire!

1140
01:42:54,325 --> 01:42:55,586
Rest in peace.

1141
01:42:56,826 --> 01:43:00,656
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1142
01:43:26,793 --> 01:43:30,350
KIM ll-sung.

1143
01:44:23,526 --> 01:44:24,583
Enemy!

1144
01:45:03,692 --> 01:45:04,749
Goodbye!

1145
01:45:05,793 --> 01:45:07,554
Goodbye!

1146
01:45:08,793 --> 01:45:10,656
You fought well!

1147
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:15,216
I guess it's really over.

1148
01:45:17,759 --> 01:45:18,725
Let's go.

1149
01:45:24,559 --> 01:45:25,525
Lieutenant!

1150
01:45:30,259 --> 01:45:31,225
What?

1151
01:45:56,726 --> 01:45:58,090
KIM Su-hyeok.

1152
01:46:09,626 --> 01:46:10,592
Let's go.

1153
01:46:25,192 --> 01:46:26,158
Sir!

1154
01:46:26,392 --> 01:46:27,358
Attention!

1155
01:46:35,893 --> 01:46:39,993
We, hereby, sign
an armistice agreement

1156
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:42,492
to stop the bloodshed

1157
01:46:42,492 --> 01:46:45,692
and suspend any open
hostile activities

1158
01:46:45,692 --> 01:46:52,023
until a complete peace is
achieved on the peninsula.

1159
01:46:52,759 --> 01:46:56,259
Conditions of an armistice
under this agreement

1160
01:46:56,259 --> 01:47:03,124
are to be strictly forced
by all the parties involved.

1161
01:47:04,259 --> 01:47:07,521
It was signed at 10 a.m.
on July 27.

1162
01:47:20,659 --> 01:47:21,818
However...

1163
01:47:22,559 --> 01:47:26,685
The supplementary provision
states clearly

1164
01:47:27,926 --> 01:47:32,085
that the armistice agreement
takes effect as of 22:00

1165
01:47:32,225 --> 01:47:38,385
on July 27, 1953.
12 hours after it was signed.

1166
01:47:40,225 --> 01:47:43,191
We still have
12 hours left.

1167
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:49,285
We'll launch a full attack
on all the fronts.

1168
01:47:49,425 --> 01:47:53,482
12 hours from now,
it's gonna be our land.

1169
01:47:55,826 --> 01:47:57,451
Captain SHlN.

1170
01:47:59,392 --> 01:48:00,358
Sir?

1171
01:48:01,192 --> 01:48:03,158
Take the north ridge
of Aerok Hill.

1172
01:48:07,492 --> 01:48:08,651
Didn't you hear me?

1173
01:48:11,092 --> 01:48:15,047
My company isn't
in good shape, sir.

1174
01:48:16,692 --> 01:48:20,146
It's the last combat.
Deal with it.

1175
01:48:20,793 --> 01:48:22,759
Show us what you got.

1176
01:48:28,692 --> 01:48:32,459
12 hours of all-out war?

1177
01:48:32,459 --> 01:48:34,516
That's crazy!

1178
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:36,725
Tell me!

1179
01:48:42,459 --> 01:48:44,118
Why are you laughing?

1180
01:48:47,559 --> 01:48:51,013
Did you expect
to survive this war?

1181
01:48:51,259 --> 01:48:52,759
Comrade...

1182
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:57,623
I was stupid to be hopeful.

1183
01:48:59,659 --> 01:49:02,420
Get all the squad leaders.

1184
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:08,080
We're ending this war.

1185
01:49:11,826 --> 01:49:17,690
No matter what it takes,
I'll save my men.

1186
01:49:22,125 --> 01:49:25,683
He said that
winning the war is to survive.

1187
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:28,282
To stay alive.

1188
01:49:29,526 --> 01:49:31,492
Su-hyeok said that?

1189
01:49:32,325 --> 01:49:33,291
Yes.

1190
01:49:35,425 --> 01:49:40,153
He said our enemy wasn't commies,
but the war itself.

1191
01:49:52,192 --> 01:49:59,853
We'll take Aerok back
from the north ridge.

1192
01:50:11,559 --> 01:50:15,514
We were nicknamed
Alligator Company

1193
01:50:15,659 --> 01:50:21,023
by American troops.

1194
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:24,915
Do you know why?

1195
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,819
Alligators lay about 50 eggs.

1196
01:50:31,759 --> 01:50:35,714
More than half are eaten
by other animals.

1197
01:50:35,858 --> 01:50:42,314
And most of those hatched
fall prey to other animals.

1198
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:46,491
Only one or two survives.

1199
01:50:49,826 --> 01:50:53,690
But you know what?

1200
01:50:56,225 --> 01:50:57,986
One or two alligators

1201
01:50:59,526 --> 01:51:05,584
that survived out of 50
grow up

1202
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:08,583
to rule the swamp.

1203
01:51:09,025 --> 01:51:10,491
That's alligators.

1204
01:51:11,825 --> 01:51:14,383
We're facing the last combat.

1205
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:20,456
In the past 2 and half years,
500 thousand have died.

1206
01:51:20,892 --> 01:51:25,052
But we've survived!

1207
01:51:26,793 --> 01:51:28,452
We're alligators!

1208
01:51:28,892 --> 01:51:31,154
We rule the combat field!

1209
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:32,692
Got that?

1210
01:51:32,692 --> 01:51:34,092
Yes, sir!

1211
01:51:34,092 --> 01:51:35,492
Who's the strongest?

1212
01:51:35,492 --> 01:51:36,592
Alligators!

1213
01:51:36,592 --> 01:51:38,292
Who's the fittest?

1214
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:39,258
Alligators!

1215
01:51:39,592 --> 01:51:41,751
Survive for 12 hours!

1216
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:44,451
Stay alive!

1217
01:51:47,592 --> 01:51:48,955
So we can go home.

1218
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:01,924
We can't see them.

1219
01:52:02,259 --> 01:52:04,816
But they're very close.

1220
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:07,115
Less than 100 meters away.

1221
01:52:09,459 --> 01:52:10,924
What are you doing here?

1222
01:52:11,459 --> 01:52:13,118
You can't leave me out.

1223
01:52:14,259 --> 01:52:16,225
We're in this together.

1224
01:52:16,559 --> 01:52:18,525
It's just another 12 hours.

1225
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:23,022
Damn, it's foggy.

1226
01:52:24,726 --> 01:52:27,987
The whole world is
telling us to fight.

1227
01:52:29,425 --> 01:52:31,982
And this fog is telling us
not to.

1228
01:52:34,225 --> 01:52:35,282
That's right.

1229
01:52:39,025 --> 01:52:40,786
If it stays this foggy

1230
01:52:42,425 --> 01:52:44,084
the USAF can't strike.

1231
01:52:44,626 --> 01:52:47,387
And they might call off
this operation.

1232
01:52:48,325 --> 01:52:50,086
Right?

1233
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:58,048
Once the fog clears,
they'll bomb this hill.

1234
01:52:58,892 --> 01:53:02,052
Once they do,
we'll charge.

1235
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:05,757
If we survive this...

1236
01:53:10,292 --> 01:53:11,656
I'll call you Bro.

1237
01:53:14,792 --> 01:53:15,951
So stay alive.

1238
01:53:17,592 --> 01:53:19,649
Make sure you do.

1239
01:53:25,492 --> 01:53:26,855
Son of a bitch!

1240
01:53:27,992 --> 01:53:30,858
Stop crying, asshole!

1241
01:53:30,858 --> 01:53:33,518
I don't wanna fight.

1242
01:53:34,459 --> 01:53:37,323
Stop crying, bitch!

1243
01:53:37,559 --> 01:53:40,820
Stop it!
Stop it, asshole!

1244
01:53:46,259 --> 01:53:48,623
Fuck me.

1245
01:53:50,259 --> 01:53:53,058
Who the fuck is singing?

1246
01:53:53,058 --> 01:53:54,217
No.

1247
01:53:55,858 --> 01:53:57,017
It's them.

1248
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:08,985
¢ÜFalling down silently...

1249
01:54:10,825 --> 01:54:18,384
¢Üdew is so cold.

1250
01:54:19,825 --> 01:54:28,425
¢ÜNot able to sleep...
¢Ütossing and turning...

1251
01:54:28,425 --> 01:54:36,790
¢Ül heard my mom's voice
¢Ütelling me ways of a man.

1252
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:49,192
¢ÜDon't I miss her voice.

1253
01:54:49,192 --> 01:54:50,851
Fuck.

1254
01:54:53,192 --> 01:54:59,147
¢ÜHeard from a distance...

1255
01:54:59,992 --> 01:55:03,754
¢Üa loud gunshot,

1256
01:55:04,591 --> 01:55:10,615
¢Ülike a lullaby,

1257
01:55:11,559 --> 01:55:18,821
¢Ütakes me home in my dream.

1258
01:55:19,858 --> 01:55:22,915
¢ÜMy home,

1259
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:26,519
¢Ümy sweet home...

1260
01:55:28,359 --> 01:55:36,858
¢ÜBefore a bowl of water...
¢Ümom prays for my safety.

1261
01:55:36,858 --> 01:55:44,985
¢ÜHer shining gray hair
¢Übrings tears to my eyes.

1262
01:55:59,225 --> 01:56:00,781
We' re fucked.

1263
01:59:08,825 --> 01:59:10,984
Motherfuckers!

1264
02:00:01,591 --> 02:00:05,353
Die, asshole!

1265
02:00:10,658 --> 02:00:12,022
What's this?

1266
02:00:13,259 --> 02:00:14,519
Asshole.

1267
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:36,720
Do you copy?
Stop bombing!

1268
02:00:37,058 --> 02:00:39,717
We're behind the enemy line!
Stop bombing!

1269
02:00:41,058 --> 02:00:43,159
You're killing us all!

1270
02:00:43,159 --> 02:00:45,886
We gotta pull out now!

1271
02:04:45,892 --> 02:04:49,255
You remember me,
don't you?

1272
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:55,655
You said
it would end in a week.

1273
02:04:57,291 --> 02:04:59,348
You're still alive.

1274
02:05:02,091 --> 02:05:03,455
Dumbass.

1275
02:05:04,691 --> 02:05:06,452
Let me ask you this.

1276
02:05:10,057 --> 02:05:12,819
Here's what you said
3 years ago.

1277
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:17,315
Do you know
why you're losing?

1278
02:05:18,458 --> 02:05:21,117
That's because you don't know
why you're fighting.

1279
02:05:28,258 --> 02:05:33,213
Why are we fighting?

1280
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:37,822
I knew it.

1281
02:05:40,658 --> 02:05:42,817
I knew what it was.

1282
02:05:46,424 --> 02:05:47,788
But...

1283
02:05:53,424 --> 02:05:55,287
It's been too long.

1284
02:06:00,224 --> 02:06:01,884
I forgot.

1285
02:06:04,024 --> 02:06:05,786
Son of a bitch.

1286
02:06:08,024 --> 02:06:12,525
Stop any hostilities
on all the frontlines.

1287
02:06:12,525 --> 02:06:13,424
I repeat.

1288
02:06:13,424 --> 02:06:17,379
Stop any hostilities...

1289
02:07:14,558 --> 02:07:18,957
Stop any hostilities
on all the frontlines.

1290
02:07:18,957 --> 02:07:20,258
repeat.

1291
02:07:20,258 --> 02:07:25,384
Stop any hostilities
on all the frontlines.

1292
02:07:28,024 --> 02:07:29,024
Repeat.

1293
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:33,582
Stop any hostilities
on all the frontlines.

1294
