1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
King's Family

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,910
It's been a long time.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,970
You and your husband are con artists.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,840
I almost called the police, did you know?

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,310
Con artists?

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,340
You're alive and well, so I'm sure now.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,840
You wanted to get money from me,

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,050
but how sad!

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,050
I'm not an idiot, you know?

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,950
I can't believe he tried to steal from me.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,680
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,580
Steal what?

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,870
Tell that husband of yours.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,550
I almost fell for his acting, crying and screaming how he must save your life.

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,170
If he hadn't stolen my things,

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,240
I wouldn't have kicked him out in his boxers.

17
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,280
He took his acting too far.

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,850
Hobak, it's me.

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,120
I wanted to hear your voice,

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,550
but I guess you're not picking up.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,080
Hobak,

22
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,080
I'll come back when I'm successful.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,520
I'll come back with lots of money.

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,770
This is the only way to be forgiven by you.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,740
Take good care of Sintong and Bangtong.

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,870
Also, take good care of yourself.

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,650
Goodbye.

28
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,480
You have one new voice message.

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,370
Hobak, Are you alive?
You are, right?

30
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,320
Nothing happened to you, right?

31
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,450
Why won't you pick up the phone?

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,110
I lost my phone, so I'm using a pay phone.

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,580
Hobak, Hobak!

34
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,640
Stay alive. You must stay alive.

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,980
I'll get the money, no matter what.

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,920
I'll sell myself if I have to save you.

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,450
Hobak, stay alive until I get there.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,520
Wang Hobak, you can do it!

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,580
You're tenacious.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,420
Stay alive no matter what happens.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,450
If he attacks you, you must fight back.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,250
Kick him in the balls! Real hard!

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,310
And run away, got it?

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,810
You have to escape,

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,220
so you can get back at me.

46
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,020
Survive this and get back at me!

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,820
Hobak, hold on.
I'm coming to rescue you!

48
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,820
Hobak.

49
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,620
Hobak!

50
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,470
Hobak!

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,410
Hobak!

52
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,080
Hobak!

53
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,150
Hobak.

54
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,040
Is that for me?

55
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes, for Christmas.

56
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,210
It's so pretty.

57
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,620
I couldn't keep my promise.

58
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,920
I said I'd buy you one with a diamond this big.

59
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,340
A pin that size would break my neck.

60
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,910
What do you think?

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,470
Yes, it's pretty.

62
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,840
Did you pick this out?

63
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,370
I never bought anything like that.

64
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,210
You never bought anything for your wife?

65
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,540
She thinks I don't have any style.

66
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,610
She likes money better.

67
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,350
Do you like it?

68
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,110
I love it.

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,380
So what's up?
Why are we meeting here?

70
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,320
Let me pay for the food.

71
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,580
No, I'm paying.

72
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,910
I didn't get you anything.

73
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,610
I couldn't get you any gift.

74
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,980
What if your wife finds out?

75
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,870
I'll get you some food, so there's no evidence.

76
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,580
Sunjeong.

77
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,320
Yes?

78
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,270
We...

79
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,910
Can't see each other again.

80
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,140
Thanks for everything.

81
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,670
Thanks to you, my father is well again.

82
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,950
I was pretty down,

83
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,120
but seeing you made me happy.

84
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,880
Even my family noticed it.

85
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,480
They asked if I'm having an affair,

86
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,080
saying I'm glowing.

87
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,440
Thanks, Sunjeong.

88
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,910
Someone else will deliver your packages to you.

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,080
I'm taking another area.

90
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,940
I gave your neighborhood to a new guy.

91
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,810
Don't be upset.

92
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,210
So this is it for us?

93
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,210
We can't see each other again?

94
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,270
Don't cry.

96
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,020
Eat well, and stay healthy.

97
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,220
Take good care of Miho.

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,440
And meet someone nice.

99
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,340
We'll see each other again someday.

100
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,380
We live in the same city,

101
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,980
so I'm sure we'll meet again.

102
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,840
Sunjeong.

103
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,620
Sunjeong?

104
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,870
But it took you so long to meet again.

105
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,080
Sunjeong, tell him.

106
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,520
I can't.

107
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,220
I'll tell him.

108
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,720
I'll meet him and tell him.

109
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,120
Give me his phone number.

110
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,020
You can't.

111
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,310
He has a family.

112
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,170
He has kids.

113
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,970
His kids are important, too, but what about Miho?

114
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,320
You have to think about Miho, too.

115
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,540
What good will telling him do?

116
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,140
He has a family and kids.

117
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,940
Miho has never had a dad.

118
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,770
She did fine without one.

119
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,170
I just need to keep my mouth shut.

120
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,810
I don't want to bring him any pain.

121
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,410
Come home.

122
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,640
Really? Are you serious?

123
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,620
Thanks.

124
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,880
Thanks for taking me back.

125
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,410
But there are conditions.

126
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,310
Anything.

127
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
First,

128
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,410
we're not husband and wife anymore.

129
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,470
What do you mean by that?

130
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,220
We'll stay married, only by law.

131
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,880
You understand, right?

132
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,450
I went to law school, but I don't like law.

133
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,070
How can we only be married by law?

134
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,040
- I'll work hard.
- Whatever.

135
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,470
We'll just be parents to our boys.

136
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,810
Just until Bangtong turns ten.

137
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,020
Ten?

138
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,910
That only gives me 3 years.

139
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,570
Stay their dad until then.

140
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,770
That's the first condition for coming home.

141
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,480
If you're not happy with it, say so.

142
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,520
No, I'm fine with it.

143
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,180
Second.

144
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,340
I'm home.

145
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,380
Why are you home so early?

146
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,620
I hired another worker,

147
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,670
so I can take care of the kids.

148
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,570
But that will cost you a lot of money.

149
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,240
But that's a good idea.

150
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,270
<i>Three bears</i>

151
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,350
<i>Live in one house</i>

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,550
<i>Daddy bear,</i>

153
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,910
<i>Mommy bear, baby bear!</i>

154
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,880
You had a long day. You should rest.

155
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,040
You being here is a lot of help for me.

156
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,840
I'll work harder and make more money.

158
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,640
Everyone wants to make a lot of money.

159
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,850
Things just don't work out like that.

160
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,450
But you will, I'm sure.

161
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,440
When you and Subak argue,

162
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,740
I don't know what to do.

163
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,320
It never happened before.

164
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,480
Mother,

165
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,980
please forgive Subak for making you upset.

166
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,380
It's my fault for spoiling her.

167
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,120
What's this?

168
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,410
I'm making dumplings.

169
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,670
I'm going to make dumpling stew for dinner.

170
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,170
Nice.

171
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,520
Just hearing that is making my mouth

172
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,380
water, water, water.

173
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,920
Oh, boy.

174
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
So how long do you actually need?

175
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,040
You have to give me a date!

176
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,480
Have I ever broken my promises?

177
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,750
How dare you embarrass me like this

178
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,750
over just a few hundred thousand dollars?

179
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,580
So? When are you wiring the money?

180
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,050
Fine.

181
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,970
Oh, this is crazy.

182
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,020
Why? Is it bad?

183
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,380
It's not bad.

184
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,270
The longer it's tied up, the more interest I'll get.

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,570
It's your money that's bothering me.

186
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,770
It's okay. I can wait.

187
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,820
Grandmother's good at making dumplings.

188
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,310
She's upset, so she won't come out.

189
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,810
I'll go get her.

190
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,520
Grandmother.

191
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,770
Hey!

192
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,750
Don't open my door without knocking!

193
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,480
Where did you learn your manners?

194
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,480
Did your father teach you that?

195
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm sorry, grandmother. Keep eating.

196
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,270
I wasn't eating anything!

197
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,380
Uh, well...

198
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,950
Okay.

199
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,610
He's so dense. Ugh!

200
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,220
She's eating buns.

201
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,020
I knew it!

202
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,910
She's waiting for my husband to come home.

203
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,620
Even after a big bowl of rice,

204
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,170
around the time my husband comes home,

205
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,340
she lies down, acting all sick, and says,

206
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,750
"You're home?"

207
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,170
I lost my appetite.

208
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,940
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

209
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,610
That's her favorite line.

210
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,420
You want us to fight?

211
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,640
Scream at me, as if you're angry.

212
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,980
She won't eat?

213
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,120
It was the red bean cake.

214
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,120
She didn't have a proper meal but has been snacking all day.

215
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,410
Hurry up and start screaming.

216
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,620
But I'm not angry.

217
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,020
You couldn't become a singer and you didn't marry the miller's daughter. Get mad!

218
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,270
What's wrong with you?

219
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,170
How dare you talk like that to me?

220
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,640
And you just do whatever you want!

221
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm the head of this family!

222
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,020
So take good care of my mother!

223
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,170
My mother is more important to me! Got it?

224
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,220
Do that again and I'll kick you out!

225
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,080
Hobak's not getting away with this.

226
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm going to destroy her.

227
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,620
He's never been on a ship before.

228
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,120
How am I supposed to go on?

229
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,980
How am I supposed to eat?

230
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm more worried about us than Sedal.

231
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,020
We don't have any money to move out.

232
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,940
Mom!

233
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,310
Huh?

234
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,840
What was that?

235
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,120
It's Sedal.

236
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,840
- Sedal.
- Mom.

237
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,050
Oh, Sedal...

238
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,840
What happened? Huh?

239
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,550
You didn't leave?

240
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,070
Hobak.

241
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,110
I brought him because the boys miss him.

242
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,140
Good. Good for you. God will bless you.

243
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,440
You won't find a woman like Hobak anywhere.

244
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,220
You look so good together. Perfect height.

245
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,080
You said I was too tall for a woman.

246
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,770
You said a woman should be petite.

247
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,370
When?

248
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,710
If I were tall like you, I wouldn't be here.

249
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,180
I would've become Miss Korea.

250
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,480
Sedal, congratulations.

251
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,980
Mom was crying so hard for you.

252
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,020
- Where are the boys?
- In bed.

253
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,750
Did you eat?
You must be hungry.

254
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,570
Hey, make Sedal dinner.

255
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,540
I already ate.

256
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,870
Get me some water.

257
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,710
Okay.

258
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,310
Oh, my.

259
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,840
We're out of barley tea, so make some.

260
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,870
And don't run the laundry machine at night.

261
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,810
Okay, I got it.

262
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,310
Hey, what are you doing?

263
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,720
What do you mean?

264
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,940
Here, water.

265
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,720
What do you think you're doing?

266
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,540
Why, mom?
I could bring her water.

267
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,180
Tell mother what's going on.

268
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,770
Later.

269
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,270
Why later? 
She'll find out eventually.

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,070
Have a seat. Sit.

271
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,150
What is it?

272
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,750
Mother,

273
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,220
Sedal's going to do all the housework.

274
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,040
In other words, he'll be the housewife.

275
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,610
What? Housewife?

276
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,250
So Sedal's going to cook from now on? Wow!

277
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,880
Shut up.

278
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,110
You have no respect for your husband!

279
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,270
How dare you turn him into a housewife?

280
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeongdal and I make money,

281
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,620
so why are you making my son do this?

282
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,370
What's wrong with that?

283
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,210
Lots of men do it these days.

284
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,040
Let them do whatever they want.

285
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,410
But I'd rather die than to

286
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,050
see my young son cook and do laundry.

287
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,410
I didn't raise him to become a housewife.

288
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,980
After my husband died, I treasured my son.

289
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,570
So how dare you belittle him like this?

290
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,980
What do you think about that?

291
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,720
Uh, I think she's wrong.

292
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,250
Did you hear that, mother?

293
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,750
We made an agreement, so go along with it

294
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,750
or move out if you can't handle it.

295
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,450
But this is how we're going to live.

296
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,180
You agreed to do this?

297
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,450
Yes.

298
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,880
Mom, don't get mad.
Just accept it.

299
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,540
One of my friends is doing it, and he loves it.

300
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,270
It's stress free. I can do it.

301
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,980
But you don't know how to do anything!

302
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,420
You can't even grill a piece of meat!

303
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,680
You can discuss it, if you want.

304
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

305
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,880
Don't forget to check the boys school bags

306
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,520
and make soup for them for breakfast.

307
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,950
And read the manuals for the rice cooker,

308
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,720
laundry machine and vacuum cleaner.

309
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,480
Ask the maintenance office about the trash,

310
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,480
or you can ask the woman across the hall.

311
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,650
Okay, I got it.

312
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,770
Oh, boy...

313
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,170
Thank you, my sons.

314
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,050
Sons are always on their dads side.

315
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,520
Thanks to you, dad came home.

316
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,770
You guys are amazing.

317
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,310
I will be good to you.

318
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,480
And make up for the past mistakes.

319
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,840
Okay?

320
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,850
I'm home.

321
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,710
Jungji, go to sleep.

322
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,680
I don't want to come home.

323
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,850
They won't even say hi back.

324
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,770
I want to move out as soon as possible.

325
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,020
Even my parents treat me like a stranger.

326
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,810
It's your fault.

327
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,020
Make up with your mother.

328
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,920
I said those out of anger.

329
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,480
Put yourself in my shoes.

330
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,920
How could I say anything nice?
She lost my kid!

331
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,250
Regardless.

332
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,880
Apologize to your father, too.

333
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
But he slapped me.

334
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,680
He's your father.

335
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,250
You can't scream at him for slapping you.

336
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,220
I would've done the same in his shoes.

337
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,070
You're saying I deserved it?

338
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,610
You did.

339
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,210
Make up with your mother first.

340
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,540
And your father will forgive you.

341
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,180
Oh, man.

342
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,150
Order me some pig's feet.

343
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,480
Mom, stop begin angry. I'm sorry.

344
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,310
Forget it.

345
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,720
Tada! Your favorite, pig's feet.

346
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,420
Let's have a drink and make up.

347
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,450
I said forget it.

348
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,520
Mom, I'm sorry.

349
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm really sorry.

350
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,220
Mom.

351
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,380
Mom, you know I never hold grudges.

352
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,720
I hate those who say whatever they want and say, "I don't hold grudges."

353
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,450
How can you say that to your daughter?

354
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,380
I learned a big lesson.

355
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,470
Never live with your children after you marry them off.

356
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,540
Daughters or sons, they are strangers.

357
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,480
It's okay to live close, but not together.

358
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,450
You always have run ins.

359
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,150
We never used to fight before.

360
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,220
Everyone envied our relationship.

361
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,480
But now, we argue everyday.

362
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,310
It's because of my kids.

363
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,980
I'm sorry, mom.

364
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,870
Let's try to be friends while I'm here.

365
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,410
You're moving out?

366
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,020
Eventually.

367
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,720
When I have enough money, I'm moving out.

368
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,950
How will you get the money?

369
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Wait and see.

370
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,170
I'll send you and father on a trip.

371
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,450
I'll send you to Jeju Island.

372
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,680
It's okay.

373
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,350
We're making up because you're my daughter.

374
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,670
If you weren't, I'd never see you again.

375
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,080
If you ever pick on me again,

376
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,810
I'm going to kick you out.

377
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,520
I got it. 
Mom, let's eat.

378
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:55,270
No, not that.
Eat this. Eat this one.

379
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,870
Say ah!

380
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,620
Was this Minjung's idea?

381
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,540
Who cares who's idea this was?

382
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,180
I was going to make up with you anyway.

383
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,450
It's been a long time, right?

384
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,350
Make us separate beds.

385
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,270
I was going to.

386
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,150
I was keeping your spot warm.

387
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,550
I wasn't trying anything.

388
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,610
Okay.

389
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,410
I'm done. I'll sleep here.

390
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,020
Here.

391
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,310
Lie down.

392
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,710
You know, right?

393
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,920
I know. I won't cross the line.

394
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,020
Should I give you a massage?

395
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,370
I told you. We're only pretending.

396
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,870
Don't lay a hand on me.

397
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,540
I'm letting you sleep here because I don't

398
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,520
want the boys finding out that this is all fake.

399
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,770
I know.

400
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,310
Honey, what should I make for breakfast?

401
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,270
Don't talk to me unless I talk to you first.

402
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,950
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,680
Don't call me ma'am. It's gross.

404
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,450
Okay.

405
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,080
- Turn the lights off.
- Okay.

406
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,110
Don't make any noise.

407
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,540
Okay.

408
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,110
I won't even breathe noisily.

409
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,270
Go back to sleep. Sleep.

410
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,340
Where's the rice?
Come on out, Mr. Rice.

411
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,450
I can't throw this out.

412
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,350
This was my first pot.

413
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,210
We started out with just this pot.

414
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,120
I made soy bean paste and kimchi stew here.

415
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,570
We were so happy back then.

416
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,770
Yes.

417
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,140
Let's be happy again, like back then.

418
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,520
Okay.

419
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,480
Where's the rice?

420
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,140
Sintong! Bangtong!

421
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,580
It's dad.
Wake up, wake up. It's dad.

422
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,480
- Dad!
- Dad!

423
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,880
Why is dad making breakfast?

424
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,240
He's going to do it from now on.

425
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,980
He'll cook and do the chores.

426
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,420
When you come home from school,

427
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,220
he'll be here.

428
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,250
Wow! How exciting!

429
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,570
I love having dad home every day.

430
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,670
Where's mother?

431
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,040
She said she won't eat if he has to cook.

432
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,340
Okay.

433
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,850
Huh?

434
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,110
What's wrong with this?

435
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,720
It's not cooked.

436
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,420
You said you made rice.

437
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,050
Yes, I pressed the button here.

438
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,980
What's wrong with this?

439
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,020
You pressed the wrong button.

440
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,070
I told you to read the manuals!

441
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,540
You can't even cook rice?

442
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,750
I did read it.

443
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,450
Sedal, make some noodles.

444
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,720
Hello.

445
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,950
Sit.

446
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,770
How have you been?
Did you have lunch?

447
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,610
You didn't tell Sangnam about meeting me?

448
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,040
No.

449
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,980
Don't tell him. He'll be worried.

450
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,620
Okay.

451
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,450
Why aren't you calling me mother?

452
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,270
Excuse me?

453
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,310
Don't just say "okay," and "excuse me."

454
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,110
And "mother" at the end.

455
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,310
What? You don't respect me?

456
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,020
I'm your mother in law.

457
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,250
Yes, mother.

458
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,380
Sangnam didn't tell you about me, right?

459
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,070
He hasn't said much.

460
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,270
We're not living together,

461
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,180
but Sangnam is my son.

462
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,750
You don't need to know anything more.

463
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,070
Give me respect as Sangnam's mother.

464
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,110
Understand?

465
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,750
- Yes.
- Again?

466
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,550
Yes, mother.

467
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,980
What are you doing about the wedding gifts?

468
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,310
We're not giving any gifts.

469
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,750
And we're having a small wedding.

470
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,180
What wedding?

471
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,270
You're not giving any wedding gifts?

472
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,720
You're funny.

473
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,040
Did you actually think you could do that?

474
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,840
Because he only had a dad?

475
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,840
You should've discussed it with me first.

476
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,540
Even a small wedding is a big deal.

477
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,640
You have to cover the basics.

478
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm not asking for a mink coat, brand name handbag, or a diamond ring.

479
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,850
Just give me cash.

480
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,080
You told me to keep it for you.

481
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,980
Was that a lie?

482
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,340
It's not that.
I need some money.

483
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,840
Why? You're not buying wedding gifts.

484
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,080
Take it, then.

485
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,940
Did you think I'd use your money?

486
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,380
No, mom.

487
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm sorry.

488
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,810
Hello.

489
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,450
Oh, hello.

490
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,340
Is there anything new?

491
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,480
You already bought everything here.

492
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,120
Our products are not good enough for you.

493
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,810
Remember the toner I bought before?

494
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,040
Can I have another one?

495
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,810
I want to give it to someone I work with.

496
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,840
Excuse me...

497
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,570
I forgot to give you some samples.

498
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,270
Pick some.

499
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,450
You can take more.

500
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,020
It's okay. I'll only take one.

501
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,720
I'll be back tomorrow for another one.

502
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,120
Excuse me,

503
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,020
thank you for coming to my store.

504
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,920
So I was thinking,

505
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,580
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

506
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,220
I'll buy.

507
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,120
I don't care who buys.

508
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,650
I thought you were Sangnam.

509
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,680
You whistle, too?

510
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,220
Jangbi,

511
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,070
here.

512
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,310
What is it?

513
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,870
It's the toner i use, and it smells nice.

514
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,940
Thank you, but you've been acting

515
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,380
like a skin care product sales person.

516
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,610
You buy some every day.

517
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,170
A friend of mine open a new store.

518
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,770
Let's go out for a drink.

519
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,450
Not tonight. I have plans. Maybe next time.

520
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,370
Mom.

521
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,520
Mom, I'm sorry.

522
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,980
Don't be and I don't need a hug.

523
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,250
I know you're disappointed in me.

524
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,340
I wish I could give it all to you,

525
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,940
but I think I need a bit of emergency cash.

526
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,680
I don't even have a job.

527
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,710
I don't want to live off my husband's salary.

528
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,420
And I don't know when I'll get published.

529
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,820
I don't want to ask my husband for money.

530
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,570
I didn't say anything.
It's your money.

531
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,410
Mom,

532
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,620
I opened an account for you.

533
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,980
It's not a lot, but it's yours.

534
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,110
Use it to buy whatever you want to.

535
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,520
I have to go out. I'll see you later.

536
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,520
It's me!

537
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,220
Really?

538
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,810
Yes. I'm giving him 3 years.

539
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,050
And I'm going to make my decision.

540
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,080
You're such a fool.

541
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,980
Why would you take him back?

542
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,480
She's doing it because of the boys.

543
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,210
It's not just because of the boys.

544
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,210
A woman shouldn't be so cold hearted.

545
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,020
You should look the other way sometimes.

546
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,280
Better the devil you know. 

547
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,480
He's the father of your kids, so giving him a chance is good.

548
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,050
If you made that decision on your own, good.

549
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,220
Sedal is going to be doing the housekeeping.

550
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,270
He'll do everything.

551
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,920
Really?

552
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,320
Did he say yes?

553
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,050
I'm sure he did. He wanted to come home.

554
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,820
Anyway, he cooked breakfast today.

555
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,420
He cooked rice and soup.

556
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,980
Tell him to get a job.

557
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,380
Don't let him stay home and do housework.

558
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,780
Anyone can do housework.

559
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,350
Anggeum, you shouldn't say that.

560
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,150
Remember how you complained about it?

561
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,340
A man should go out and make money.

562
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,720
He has no skills or experience.

563
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,710
How can he get a job at his age?

564
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
The boys are young,

565
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,320
and I need someone to look after them

566
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,820
and take care of the household for free.

567
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,980
Good for you!
Make him work hard.

568
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,520
Goof-off needs to learn a lesson.

569
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,250
Make him work like a dog.

570
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,250
He still has a long way to go.

571
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,440
He really does.

572
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,140
Make sure he changes completely.

573
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm planning on it.

574
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,180
I thought you wanted to drink.

575
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,310
I'm going off alcohol for a while.

576
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,780
You? I can't believe that.

577
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,520
I don't feel like drinking.

578
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,880
How's your wedding planning going?

579
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,050
There isn't much to plan.

580
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,320
Just a wedding dress and food.

581
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,480
So everyone except your uncle is married.

582
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,020
We still have Haebak and Daebak.

583
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,580
I should get a poofy dress because I don't have curves, right?

584
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,520
You must feel sorry for your single uncle.

585
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,440
I kind of do.

586
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,520
Can you help me pick a dress?

587
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,110
You have an eye for that stuff.

588
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,810
Your uncle didn't say anything?

589
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,420
I don't know how he feels, but he hasn't...

590
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,880
I think he gave up.

591
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,840
He's turning thirty-six. Ugh!

592
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,070
He's not seeing anyone?

593
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,770
I think he's going out on blind dates.

594
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,980
He is?

595
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,170
He's meeting lots of women?

596
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,370
But nobody seems to like him.

597
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,280
Who'd want to marry my uncle?

598
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,720
You never know.

599
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,310
He's my uncle, so I don't know,

600
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,450
but I don't think he's very attractive.

601
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,020
What do you mean?
He's plenty attractive!

602
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,070
Those women just don't know anything.

603
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,540
Do you think my uncle is attractive?

604
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,320
Well, I've known him since I was little.

605
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,650
He's not that bad.

606
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,950
Wow.

607
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,440
You're the only one who thinks so. Thanks.

608
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,070
I'm not saying I'm in love with him.

609
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,540
I know, girl.

610
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,050
You hate men like my uncle.

611
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,280
Yeongdal, can you set him up with someone?

612
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,350
But I don't know anyone!

613
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,570
All my friends are your friends, too.

614
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,480
Oh, Sina! Park Sina!
She's single, right?

615
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,940
Not her.

616
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,520
She was never without a boyfriend since high school.

617
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,110
Don't try to match him up with just anyone.

618
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,670
Your uncle must have a type.

619
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,040
You...

620
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,050
Weren't so great that night.

621
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,840
You're home late.

622
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,440
Were you out on a date?

623
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,870
No, I met up with Yeongdal.

624
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,880
Yeongdal? Why?

625
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,320
She wanted to know how my wedding plans were going.

626
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,020
What do you talk about when you meet?

627
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,170
About different things.

628
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,910
Are you curious?

629
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,820
I was wondering what women talk about.

630
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,820
You should start dating.

631
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,880
We talked about you tonight.

632
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,350
About me?

633
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,020
What about?

634
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,710
Did she badmouth me?

635
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,440
Of course. 
You expected compliments?

636
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,810
Why would she do that?

637
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,720
Badmouthing a perfectly fine man like me.

638
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,570
It's not like she's perfect.

639
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,040
She can't even take care of herself.

640
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,020
That's not true.

641
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,480
Her salary is pretty high.

642
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,050
And now that she's got money,

643
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,820
she's not even looking for rich men.

644
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,780
She used to always talk about rich men,

645
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,520
how a handsome face is useless.

646
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,320
But she changed.
She doesn't even drink.

647
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,220
There's something different about her.

648
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,250
Maybe she did something regrettable after drinking.

649
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,150
Maybe she got sick from drinking.

650
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,870
Why am I so thirsty?

651
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,520
She can't be making that much money.

652
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,480
Is she seeing anyone?

653
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,380
I think she's taking a break.

654
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,170
She's not the type who'd take a break.

655
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,170
And she didn't say anything else?

656
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,710
No.

657
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,410
Uncle, you're being weird.

658
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,020
Are you interested in Yeongdal?

659
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,420
I was joking.

660
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,150
I know you two aren't a good match.

661
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,550
Besides, you're not interested in her.

662
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,720
But we went all the way,

663
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,140
thanks to that darn alcohol.

664
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,070
I'm going to quit drinking, too.

665
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,150
Suction.

666
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,020
Stealth brush sterilization...

667
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,340
You don't see Don anymore?

668
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,340
I've been busy and he's been busy, too.

669
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,670
But you two are friends.

670
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,210
I'm sure Don's lonely, too.

671
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,840
He is because he doesn't have a girlfriend.

672
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,520
What's going on?

673
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,880
Why are you calling him Don?

674
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,720
You always called him Loser.

675
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,410
I should give him more respect.

676
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,110
He's 6 years older than me.

677
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,570
Clean this up.
Hobak will get mad.

678
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,570
What's...

679
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,550
Hi. Isn't it cold outside?

680
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,580
Thank you for all your hard work today!

681
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,110
What happened here?

682
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,210
Oh,

683
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,110
I took it apart to clean it, but it's hard.

684
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,980
I'll put it back together by tomorrow.

685
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,840
Why would you take it apart?

686
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,710
I'll put it back together, no matter what...

687
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,810
Don't bother.

688
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,720
Oh!

689
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,050
I haven't been to a place like this in a while.

690
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,980
You don't come to places like this often?

691
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,220
I haven't gone on a date in decades.

692
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,110
I see.

693
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,480
Do you have any children?

694
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,670
I have a son and daughter,

695
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,870
and I'm living with my son's family.

696
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,610
I want them to move out,

697
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,570
but they insisted on living with me.

698
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,210
I'm going to live with my son after he gets married, too.

699
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,340
You should teach your daughter in law well.

700
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,940
Young women these days are so shrewd

701
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,640
that they think they're above you.

702
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,980
I won't let that happen.

703
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,520
You should raise your voice.

704
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,210
They should be grateful.

705
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,310
You shouldn't let her mistreat you.

706
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:23,710
I think you're too sweet, that's why.

707
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,110
I'm so soft hearted that I pass out when someone screams.

708
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,250
Right.

709
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,110
I saw that in you before.

710
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,540
You need someone to protect you.

711
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,810
Here. Have a drink.

712
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,780
Oh, I can't drink very much.

713
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,950
I'll teach you how to drink properly.

714
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,170
Having a drink with a nice person.

715
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,940
That's the greatest joy in my life.

716
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,270
Then teach me.

717
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,350
I will.

718
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,520
Here.

719
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,280
Cheers.

720
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,980
Oh, I feel tingly inside.

721
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,880
It's hot.

722
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,070
Oh.

723
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,770
Look at your plate.
You didn't eat much.

724
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,320
I'm not a big eater.

725
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:30,050
I can't even take big bites.

726
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,920
I can see that.

727
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,880
We have a lot in common.

728
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,750
I know how hard it is to raise kids alone.

729
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,250
I'm glad.

730
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,280
I thought you had a wife who took care of you,

731
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,050
so I was surprised to hear you are single.

732
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,680
How lonely you must have been at night.

733
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,250
I writhed in agony every night.

734
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,820
Oh, I'm dizzy.

735
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,380
I feel drunk already.

736
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,820
Seeing you made me happy.

737
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,350
Eat well,

738
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,210
and stay healthy.

739
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,610
Take good care of Miho.

740
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,270
Uncle!

741
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,220
Girl!

742
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,770
Why would you say uncle?

743
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,220
You always call for a man when you're scared.

744
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,570
Why don't you just say "Daese!"

745
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,380
How did you get in?

746
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,220
I climbed over the wall.

747
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,310
You kept the door open just for me.

748
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,220
Get out.

749
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,770
This is my son's house.

750
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,180
I told you not to sit there!

751
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,340
Did you introduce Sangnam to that girl?

752
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,210
You met her?

753
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,270
Of course.

754
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,920
I'm her mother in law.

755
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,070
I thought you went out to dinner.

756
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,580
My glasses.

757
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,770
I'll read it to you.

758
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,220
Meeting you tonight was...

759
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,670
Meeting you tonight was the best thing

760
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,710
that has ever happened to me.

761
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,410
My heart is pounding at the thought of

762
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,820
this turning into something special.

763
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,120
Good night. With love.

764
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,270
Mom, what are you doing?

765
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,350
It's nothing.

766
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,380
Who is it?

767
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,070
Nobody.

768
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,180
Me too.

769
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,940
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

770
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,810
Honey.

771
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,210
How dare you come here?

772
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,770
Honey.

773
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,550
Get out right now!

774
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,580
Why did you let this woman in?

775
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,310
I didn't. The door was open.

776
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,020
Get out! Right now!

777
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,570
I'm sorry.

778
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,040
Please forgive me.

779
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,780
Forgive you?

780
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:38,020
You don't even deserve to use those words!

781
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,110
Honey, please.

782
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,420
Honey.

783
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,850
Get up.

784
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,980
Don't you dare help her up.

785
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,280
Father!

786
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,420
Get out!

787
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,110
I will.

788
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,570
I can't even go to my son's wedding.

789
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,210
I should just die.

790
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,440
Sangnam, have a nice wedding.

791
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,540
I will pray for your happiness.

792
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm sorry.

793
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,150
Father.

794
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,920
She came to see us.

795
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,220
Let her come to the wedding.

796
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,940
No.

797
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,270
I'm not going to live with her.

798
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,720
And I don't want to see her again.

799
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,870
But she gave birth to me.

800
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,820
I don't feel right not inviting her.

801
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,310
When did you meet her?

802
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,520
How many times did you meet her?

803
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,820
You've already fallen for her act?

804
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,750
Sangnam, go upstairs.

805
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,780
Sangnam, Sangnam!

806
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,680
How long have they been meeting like this?

807
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,170
Did you know about this?

808
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,270
I found out recently.

809
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,780
They met a few times.

810
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,220
He's lost his mind.

811
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,040
She might be up to her old tricks.

812
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,880
Don't worry.

813
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,880
I won't let her come to Sangnam's wedding.

814
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,980
I'd rather die.

815
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,940
I have a plan.

816
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,570
I'm so upset.

817
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,070
The girl is so shrewd.

818
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,340
I talked to her but who knows?

819
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,540
Anyway, wait until I come home with money.

820
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,650
I almost won Sangnam over.

821
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,450
if he's on my side, it'll work out.

822
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,140
Darling, I miss you, too.

823
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,220
He's here. Bye.

824
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,650
You didn't have to come all this way.

825
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,650
I told you not to.

826
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,920
I'm sorry.

827
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,420
Why should you be?
I'm the one who's sorry.

828
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,980
You're leaving?

829
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,280
I should.

830
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,080
You saw how your father acted.

831
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,210
I only want one thing.

832
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,310
All I want is to see you be happy.

833
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,680
Your father was always so cold to me.

834
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,750
And he still is.

835
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,170
Don't go.

836
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,050
Come to my wedding.

837
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,950
It's my wedding.

838
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,340
Are you crazy?

839
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,210
Why are you going through my phone?

840
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,610
You have no class.

841
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,750
Can we talk?

842
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,110
Yes, honey.

843
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,040
I just washed my face.

844
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,850
What are you doing on Christmas?

845
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,040
Nothing much.

846
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,220
You're not having a party with your kids?

847
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,170
Things are too crazy for that.

848
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,640
Then want to have a party, just you and me?

849
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,570
A party? Really?

850
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,550
Okay. Honey, I'll see you tomorrow.

851
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,810
Oh, you scared me.,

852
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,020
Why were you eavesdropping?

853
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,320
How rude.

854
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,480
We need to talk.

855
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,170
About what?

856
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,710
Come with me.

857
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,550
What is it?

858
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,320
It's cold.
Why do we have to talk out here?

859
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,020
Your parents will hear us if we talk at home.

860
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,520
What is it?

861
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,220
Be honest with me.

862
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,270
About what?

863
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,280
Who is he?

864
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,280
Who do you mean?

865
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,850
The man you were on the phone with.

866
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,880
It wasn't a he. It was a friend.

867
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,110
What's wrong with you?

868
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,210
Are you cheating on me?

869
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,570
Why would I cheat on you?

870
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,810
You stay out all night,

871
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,050
and you get secret text messages.

872
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,480
It's not normal.

873
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,920
Are you seeing someone?

874
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,840
You must be crazy.

875
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,210
How can I be seeing a man?

876
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,520
You know how busy I am with work.

877
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,210
Are you losing your mind?

878
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,340
You should see a doctor.

879
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,610
I will if I have to,

880
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,650
so be honest with me.

881
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,020
Your condition looks really serious.

882
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,820
I can come home late when I have lots of work,

883
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,250
and I can come home in the morning

884
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,980
after taking a trip outside the city.

885
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,610
Why would you eavesdrop?

886
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,480
And you call yourself a man?

887
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,670
You have no class.

888
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,870
Don't try to turn me into a psychopath.

889
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,020
Or a man with no class.

890
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,250
You don't call a friend honey and kiss her.

891
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,070
Woman do that with friends.

892
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,750
Don't pick a fight with me like this.

893
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,440
You should go see a doctor tomorrow.

894
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,810
You need to quit your job.

895
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,440
What?

896
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,070
Quit it right now!

897
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,270
I don't believe this.

898
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,280
Just who do you think you are?

899
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,920
You brought me here in the cold to tell me that?

900
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,550
Unbelievable.

901
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,580
I want a divorce, then.

902
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,040
What?

903
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,380
Are you scared?

904
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,070
Then stop doing stuff like this.

905
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,180
You think I'm an idiot?

906
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,210
I have pride and I can be stubborn.

907
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,040
So?

908
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:29,080
You know how hard I'm trying here?

909
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,920
To protect this family,

910
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:36,420
for Aeji and Jungji, I'm being so patient.

911
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:41,520
Whatever you were doing, stop it.

912
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,440
I can forgive you this once.

913
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,150
Who do you think you are?

914
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm still your husband.

915
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:56,150
Whatever happens next,

916
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,450
it won't be my responsibility.

917
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,650
You're leaving already?

918
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,110
Yes.

919
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,040
Eat first. I'll whip something up for you.

920
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,150
It's okay. I'll see you later.

921
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,320
What is it?

922
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,150
It's Minjung.
He's been skipping breakfast.

923
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,420
Sometimes he looks okay,
other times unhappy.

924
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,380
It must be because of work.

925
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,650
Parcel service is hard work.

926
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,450
Hurry up!

927
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,020
Have a nice day.

928
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,680
Buy groceries with this.

929
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,210
Did you see the delivered vegetables?

930
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,610
I didn't.

931
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,270
We get this every week,

932
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,550
so don't buy vegetables.

933
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,280
Just get a bit of meat, fish and fruit.

934
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,420
Don't buy too much at once.

935
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:35,480
I'll take care of this so you go to work.

936
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,520
Don't drink too much.
Come home early.

937
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,150
Hobak, why are you getting so many texts?

938
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,220
Are they spam?

939
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,440
They are worse than spam.

940
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,570
I'm pregnant.

941
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,710
What did you just say?

942
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,440
Did I hear right?

943
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,420
I didn't imagine it, did I?

944
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,610
I thought you should know.

945
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,050
<i>Rudolph the red nosed reindeer</i>

946
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,220
<i>Had a very shiny nose</i>

947
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,110
<i>And if you ever saw it...</i>

948
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,210
Merry Christmas!

949
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,520
Hello.

950
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,940
Yes, hello.

951
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,050
Oh, my! This is crazy!

952
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,070
Do you like it?

953
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,150
Of course.

954
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,650
How do I look?

955
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,250
Perfect, right?

956
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,550
I was in the Miss Korea pageant.

957
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,840
Let's go.
We should have a party.

958
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,710
I'm so happy.

959
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,210
What was that?
There is some hormone.

960
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,410
Anyway, I'm filled with lots of it.

961
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,320
Why don't they give hormones easy names?

962
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,180
So I could remember it.

963
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,170
Aeji, this is from your future uncle.

964
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,870
Thank him later.

965
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,720
Okay, aunt.

966
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,840
Lucky you! You got a gift from your uncle.

967
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,710
I don't need any gifts.

968
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,070
I just want Haebak to get accepted into a good school.

969
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,440
Did you send your application?

970
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,710
Yes.

971
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,750
Aeji, call your dad.
Tell him to hurry home.

972
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,810
When is Seoul National University sending acceptance letters?

973
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:45,850
Not for a while.

974
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,840
He must be really busy tonight.

975
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,980
Don said he's really busy, too.

976
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,070
I heard.

977
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,170
Oh, how about Subak?

978
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,040
She said she's coming after her meeting.

979
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,580
Dad.

980
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,780
Yes, Aeji.

981
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,420
Dad will come home right after I'm done.

982
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,980
Dad, I'm putting aunt on the phone.

983
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,480
Minjung, are you coming home late?

984
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,280
I'm trying to hurry up, but I might be.

985
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,480
This is my last Christmas at home.

986
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:17,520
You should be here.

987
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,780
Of course I'll be there.

988
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:21,420
Did Subak come home?

989
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,570
Okay.

990
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,880
Thank you for the gift.

991
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,320
I kept my promise.

992
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,650
You're a true man.

993
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,980
And that's why I fell in love with you.

994
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,550
Who's been calling you?

995
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,780
My husband wants me home.

996
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,920
Answer it.

997
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,710
- What is it?
- Where are you?

998
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,370
At the office.

999
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:50,420
I'm in a meeting.

1000
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,220
Aeji's been calling me about

1001
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,210
having a party at home.

1002
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,670
Can you go home now?

1003
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,940
But I'm working!

1004
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,310
I'm really busy.

1005
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,950
- I'm hanging up.
- Subak!

1006
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,670
Minjung.

1007
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,710
Hello.

1008
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,710
I better go.

1009
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,780
are you crazy?
Why did you hit him?

1010
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,110
I want a divorce!

1011
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,520
Fine.

1012
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,610
Let's get a divorce.

1014
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,340
It's not much but I tried my best.

1015
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,840
You think I'm an idiot?

1016
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:15,980
I have a confession to make.

1017
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,480
I get scared when you say that.

1018
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,550
Is everything okay at home?

1019
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,020
Nobody's been calling or dropping by?

1020
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,750
No, why?

1021
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,320
Why are you sitting so close together?

1022
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,780
You look great together, sitting side by side.

1023
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,950
Don't associate with Loser.

1024
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,140
How can this happen?

1025
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,880
How can they send this?

1026
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,280
Daese, calm down.

1027
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:34,680
I can't calm down! I won't!

1028
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,020
Father, I'm getting a divorce.
