1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,902
The Allies have landed in Italy,

2
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:18,080
which is occupied by the Germans.

3
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:26,615
where Mussolini is still in control,

4
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,855
the American, British, Canadian and French armies

5
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:34,418
are held up by the solid German defense belt
along the Gustav line,

6
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,595
in the area of Monte Cassino.

7
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,303
Perched on top of the mountain

8
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:43,309
is historical St Benedict's monastery.

9
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:49,435
The Allies think that the Germans have turned
this 1.400 year old monument into a lookout post.

10
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:05,267
More than 200 allied bombers will drop
over 500 tons of bombs on the monastery.

11
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:09,021
In Word War 2, nothing is sacred.

12
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:12,043
It turns everything into an inferno.

13
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:20,697
<b>World War II
The Apocalypse</b>

14
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:28,267
<b>Episode 6 (final episode):
Retreat and Surrender</b>

15
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:39,904
March 15, 1944

16
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:42,254
March 15, 1944
The Allies launch their attack.

17
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,720
But the German paratroopers push them back.

18
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,013
The German shock troops are now firmly
entrenched in the ruined monastery.

19
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,693
Nothing was achieved by the bombing.

20
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:07,642
These scenes were filmed by the American director
John Houston who was sent to this front in Italy.

21
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,084
He would later say:

22
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:13,435
<i>It was a massacre in the freezing cold</i>

23
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:24,267
And yet Churchill had called Italy
"the soft underbelly" of Europe.

24
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:27,265
By moving in from the South via Italy,

25
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:30,896
Churchill's aim was to take Berlin
before the Russians could.

26
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:35,372
The Red Army continues to advance
steadily from the East.

27
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,545
Kiev is liberated.

28
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:40,829
The German Wehrmacht army pulls out of the Ukraine,

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,735
obeying Hitler's orders to
systematically destroy everything.

30
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,896
Ukraine

31
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:05,800
In Italy, several months later, the
Wehrmacht is still holding the Gustav line...

32
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,669
and Monte Cassino.

33
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,805
The French General Juin proposes to
surprise the Germans,

34
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:15,722
who have left those slopes,
thought to be too steep, undefended.

35
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:20,896
The rugged soldiers of the North African
and Polish regiments however,

36
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:27,144
managed to climb up the mountain
and put the allies on the road to Rome.

37
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,192
Rome
June 5, 1944

38
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,267
Rome
June 5, 1944
As the Wehrmacht retreats,

39
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:46,338
it once again leaves a path
of destruction behind it.

40
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,104
But, together with Mussolini
and his remaining fascists,

41
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:55,650
the Germans will retain control of
northern Italy and its industries.

42
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:59,827
They are the target of attacks
by Italian partisans,

43
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:03,038
and they retaliate with
indiscriminate violence.

44
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,889
Great Britain
June 5, 1944
At the same time in southern England

45
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,907
Great Britain
June 5, 1944
the allied war machine assembled
for the Normandy landings,

46
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,347
the allied war machine assembled
for the Normandy landings,

47
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,348
is gearing up.

48
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:16,286
On the evening of the 5th of June,
the paratroopers get ready to leave...

49
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:19,752
decked out in their Indian
style war paint and haircut

50
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,267
to make themselves feel brave.

51
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,316
The supreme commander of the allied forces,
General Eisenhower, comes to tell them:

52
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:27,140
Dwight D. Eisenhower
The supreme commander of the allied forces,
General Eisenhower, comes to tell them:

53
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:31,192
<i>"You are about to embark
upon the great crusade!"</i>

54
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,319
The plan is to land on 5 beaches,

55
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,533
along a 100 km stretch
on the Normandy coast,

56
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,848
from the Seine to the
Contentin peninsula,

57
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,816
where the German Atlantic war
defences are the weakest.

58
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,017
At midnight on June the 5th,

59
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:53,383
British gliders and Dakotas full of British,
American and Canadian paratroopers,

60
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:56,833
slip silently in land
over the Normady region.

61
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:06,189
The paratroopers were the first
to set foot in occupied France.

62
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:10,840
Their mission, to secure the
flanks of the landing zone.

63
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,621
The allied fleet is on its way.

64
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,173
It is the biggest armada
ever assembled.

65
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:26,911
Nearly 5.000 landing ships
and assault craft.

66
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,615
Yet it is not detected by the Germans,

67
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:33,944
who are prevented from carrying out
reconnaissance flights by the stormy weather.

68
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,687
Bombardment and shelling from
the battleships pound the coast,

69
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,283
but completely miss their targets
on the beach codenamed "Omaha".

70
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,558
The German bankers remain intact.

71
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:52,811
June 6, 1944

72
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:57,303
The first assault wave of American troops
is getting ready to tackle the German defences...

73
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:59,352
on "Omaha" beach.

74
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:04,951
Among them is American
writer Ernest Hemingway,

75
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,202
who is a war correspondent.
He writes:

76
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:12,159
<i>As we moved in towards
land in the grey, early light,</i>

77
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:16,547
<i>the coffin-shaped steel boats
took solid green sheets of water</i>

78
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:20,594
<i>that fell on the helmeted heads of the troops,
packed shoulder to shoulder</i>

79
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:27,241
<i>in a stiff, awkward, uncomfortable,
lonely companionship of men going to a battle.</i>

80
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,548
Omaha
Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer

81
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,757
Another war reporter,
the photographer Robert Capper,

82
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,816
is also caught up in this inferno.
He says:

83
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,989
<i>It was the ugliest beach
in the whole world.</i>

84
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,416
<i>Exhausted from the water and the fear,
we lay flat on a small strip of wet sand.</i>

85
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:12,690
Over 2.000 American soldiers
will loose their lives here.

86
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,982
As the tide rolls in,
the soldiers are trapped

87
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:18,779
between the sea and gunfire
from the German blockhouses.

88
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:22,690
Eisenhower had prepared a communique
in case the landing failed.

89
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,582
In a hand-written letter,
he said:

90
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:29,002
<i>"My decision to attack at this place was
based on the best information available."</i>

91
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:31,531
<i>"If there is any blame or fault
attached to the attempt...</i>

92
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,315
<i>...it is mine alone."</i>

93
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,448
But a small group succeeds in
climbing up under enemy fire

94
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,261
and neutralising the German cannons with
the help of the Royal Airforce's fighter bombers.

95
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,910
Juno
Bernieres-sur-Mer

96
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,113
Juno
Bernieres-sur-Mer
In the meantime the Canadian troops
have landed on Juno beach

97
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,983
In the meantime the Canadian troops
have landed on Juno beach.

98
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:04,029
There is indeed very little resistance,

99
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,895
Gold
Arromanches
only a few shots that do not deter the British

100
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,740
on the next beach along.

101
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,319
The few German defenders
who survive the bombardments

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
finally surrender.

103
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:24,253
Sword
Ouistreham
British and French commandoes
land on the 5th beach.

104
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,829
The allies plan to land 326.000 men,

105
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:38,338
in just one week,
a daily average of 10.000 men,

106
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:44,462
3.200 vehicles and 15.000 tons
of supplies are ferried across.

107
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,256
In order to accomplish this
a harbor is needed,

108
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,052
but the allies decided to
stay away from the big ports,

109
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,630
which were too well defended

110
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,317
and to land on the
beaches of Normandy.

111
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,948
Instead they brought
their harbors with them.

112
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,865
Gigantic construction kits
called "Mulberries".

113
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:06,189
146 concrete caissons, 61 meters
long and weighing 6.000 tons

114
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,094
were assembled to create
break waters and piers,

115
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:13,209
where the "Liberty" ships as they
were called, could unload their cargo.

116
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,537
American shipyards had turned out
one of these ships (Liberty) every day.

117
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:19,785
In less than three years,

118
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:23,664
the war industry had turned
the United States into a superpower.

119
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:26,924
The country has mobilised
more than 11 milion men.

120
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:31,884
Its armies are now in France,
Italy, North Africa and Asia.

121
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:38,110
The power of the United States is such that just
a few days after the Normandy landings in Europe,

122
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,841
it's able to assemble a second fleet
on the other side of the world,

123
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,082
in the Pacific...

124
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:49,074
...in order to attack the Mariana Islands
which are under Japanese control.

125
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,636
Having taken the island of
Tarawa the year before,

126
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:58,795
the Americans now want to use the island of Saipan,
as a base for bombers taking off at Japan

127
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:05,498
Some 127.500 troops, 2/3 of
them marines, prepare for combat.

128
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:11,033
15 aircraft carriers and 900 planes
will crush the Japanese airforce

129
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:16,702
in an air battle which will come to be known
as the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot".

130
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:39,471
A fatal blow is also dealt to
the Japanese Imperial Navy.

131
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:51,448
After which Japan's defences
in Saipan are battered.

132
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,834
Saipan

133
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,180
Saipan
But when the marines
land on this tiny island,

134
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,517
But when the marines
land on this tiny island,

135
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:59,964
which is only 9 km wide,

136
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:03,477
one of the bloodiest battles
of the war begins.

137
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:17,075
Over 15.000 Americans and
at least 27.000 Japanese,

138
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,741
will be killed or wounded.

139
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:25,227
A month and a half after D-Day
the fighting is still fierce.

140
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:29,839
The Allies are advancing
but Eisenhower is worried.

141
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,948
Hitler is determined to
contain the Allies in Normandy

142
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:37,649
in order to protect the launch
ramps for his weapon of terror,

143
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,217
the V-1, which he fires at
London from northern France.

144
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:47,616
It is the first cruise missile
ever to be used.

145
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:56,725
The V-1 is a flying bomb with a
pulse-jet engine and 1 ton explosive warhead.

146
00:11:57,025 --> 00:12:01,914
This small, swift, pilotless aircraft
is difficult to intercept and shoot down.

147
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,810
London

148
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:06,527
London
The British call them "buzz bombs"
because they make a motorcycle noise

149
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,998
that alerts Londoners
to their arrival.

150
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,918
By the time the V-1s
reach the capital city,

151
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:23,486
their fuel is used up
and their engines die out.

152
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:26,608
Londoners never know
where they will fall.

153
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:35,858
Nearly 20.000 of these missiles were launched
against England and continental Europe,

154
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,688
killing 11.000 people.

155
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,120
But even under these conditions,

156
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,271
the British retain their
pluck and their composure.

157
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:49,228
If the V-1s fail to
demoralise the British,

158
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,988
their purpose was also to
boost the morale of the Germans.

159
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,903
Germany
their purpose was also to
boost the morale of the Germans.

160
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,065
Germany
For years they have had to
live in underground shelters.

161
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,710
For years they have had to
live in underground shelters.

162
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:08,682
American bombers by day
and British bombers by night,

163
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:13,469
demolish Germany's cities
under a carpet of bombs.

164
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:17,754
American planes dropped
1.4 million tons of bombs.

165
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:23,109
Allied bombing led to around
600.000 casualties, 7 million homeless.

166
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:26,366
Such is the outcome of the
strategic bombing campaign,

167
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:30,618
who's purpose is to destroy the
industrial and human potential,

168
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:33,346
behind Germany's wartime effort.

169
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:37,293
The Wolf's Lair
East Prussia

170
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,516
In the Fuhrer's headquarters,
the Wolf's Lair,

171
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:44,338
beneath the obligatory smiles many
of Hitler's officers are deeply troubled.

172
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,771
Especially those from the old
Prussian military aristocracy.

173
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:59,007
In the past year, many of
them have joined a plot

174
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,332
to get rid of Hitler.

175
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:07,162
One of these officers, Colonel
Count Claus von Stauffenberg,

176
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:12,345
places a bomb under Hitler's desk
during a conference in the Wolf's Lair.

177
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:16,939
July 20, 1944

178
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,765
July 20, 1944
It is this heavy table
that saves Hitler.

179
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:19,920
It is this heavy table
that saves Hitler.

180
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:24,936
It deflects the blast that would eventually
kill 4 men and wound 20 others.

181
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:30,818
Of the failed assassination
attempt, Hitler says:

182
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,704
<i>Having now escaped death
I am more than ever convinced</i>

183
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:37,883
<i>that the great cause which I served
will be brought through its present perils</i>

184
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:41,011
<i>and that everything can be
brought to a good end.</i>

185
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:43,690
Hitler is only slightly injured,
a bruised arm,

186
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,337
his eardrums punctured,
his hair singed,

187
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,598
but the incident deeply
traumatizes him,

188
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:53,899
affecting his mental state,
intensified his cruelty and his paranoia.

189
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,468
He unleashes his revenge.

190
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,455
The main conspirators are tried,

191
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:02,697
5.000 suspects arrested,
200 of them executed

192
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,877
and their familes
deported.

193
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:08,383
He has no second thoughts about
executing his marshals.

194
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:11,168
Because he agreed to replace
Hitler at the head of the army,

195
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:14,049
Rommel is forced to
commit suicide.

196
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,887
Hitler hypocritically gives
him a state funeral.

197
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,017
Henceforth, power is in
the hands of the SS.

198
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:26,047
Nothing can save Germany now.

199
00:15:27,787 --> 00:15:30,938
The Russians continue
to advance in the East.

200
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:40,220
The "Great Patriotic War" as they call it,
has taken a new turn for them.

201
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:45,152
The Red Army is suddenly able to strike
with a force that amazes all sides.

202
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,477
An endless supply of men,

203
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:52,066
even after the extremely costly
battles of Moscow and Stalingrad.

204
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:57,969
The offensive in Belarus
in the summer of 1944,

205
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:01,515
is one of the biggest battles
of the 2nd World War.

206
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,203
The eastern front
is 1.000 km wide

207
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:09,861
but the Russians are able to push forward
hundreds of kilometers within 2 months,

208
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:13,563
destroying 17 German
army divisions.

209
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:19,082
The Wehrmacht retreats
towards East Prussia,

210
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,294
leaving behind many
thousands of casualties.

211
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:27,089
Some 50.000 captured Germans
would be paraded through Moscow.

212
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:29,877
Normandy
August 6, 1944

213
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,877
Normandy
August 6, 1944
In the west the Allies are gaining the upper hand.

214
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:42,676
For the Wehrmacht, the
situation is deteriorating.

215
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:48,810
50.000 German soldiers are taken
prisoner in the Falaise pocket,

216
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,896
or as the Germans call it:
Stalingrad in Normandy.

217
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,420
It is a much needed
victory for the Allies.

218
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,637
The Allies tighten their noose
with a new landing in Provence.

219
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:07,172
Saint Tropez
August 15, 1944
The reassembled French army
plays a major part in this landing.

220
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:17,021
Africans, Moroccans, Algerians,
Tunisians, French colonials

221
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:20,252
and young Frenchmen who are
part of the free French forces,

222
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,569
aid the liberation
in Provence.

223
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:27,551
It takes them just 2 weeks to liberate
the entire coast, up to Marseille.

224
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,140
Marseille

225
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,916
The resistance movement comes
out of the shadows

226
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:42,248
and participates in the liberation,
as it would do in Paris.

227
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:46,350
Paris
August 19, 1944

228
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:47,712
Paris rises up.

229
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,546
Barricades are erected
across the city.

230
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,964
Most of the German army
has retreated to the east.

231
00:17:57,964 --> 00:18:00,303
But 20.000 men
remain behind,

232
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:02,978
under the command of
General von Choltitz,

233
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:06,097
who has reveived orders
from Hitler to destroy the city.

234
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,583
Violent fighting breaks out.

235
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,205
On the 4th day
of the insurrection,

236
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:19,633
a French unit, General Leclerc's
Second Armoured Division,

237
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,525
arrives from Normandy and
the capital is finally liberated,

238
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,742
Leclerc
arrives from Normandy and
the capital is finally liberated,

239
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:25,461
Leclerc
the next morning.

240
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:48,134
The Germans surrender

241
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:52,339
and General von Choltitz is taken to Leclerc's
headquarters in the Montparnasse train station.

242
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,509
Choltitz
and General von Choltitz is taken to Leclerc's
headquarters in the Montparnasse train station.

243
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,023
Choltitz

244
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:57,132
Hitler has just called and asked
his famous question:

245
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,134
<i>"Brennt Paris?"</i>

246
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,065
<i>"Is Paris burning?"</i>

247
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:05,399
Choltitz preferred to turn himself in.

248
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,599
This highly disciplined officer
from the airborne regiment,

249
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,821
disobeyed Hitler's order
to fight to the last man.

250
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:19,471
Then De Gaulle arrives with
eloquent words for history:

251
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:24,362
Paris has been offended,
Paris has been shattered,

252
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:26,605
Paris has been tortured,

253
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:30,449
but Paris has been liberated!

254
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:38,170
While France and Belgium are progressively liberated
and the Red Army awaits outside Warsaw,

255
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:41,850
on the other side of the globe,
the American General MacArthur

256
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,500
is returning to the Philippines.

257
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,687
After escaping from the Japanese
siege 3 years earlier, McArthur said:

258
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>I shall return.</i>

259
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,135
His return is sumptuously staged
by his public relation staff.

260
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:59,749
Philippines
October 20, 1944
His return is sumptuously staged
by his public relation staff.

261
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,750
Philippines
October 20, 1944
complete with his legendary
"Popeye" corn cob pipe

262
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,574
complete with his legendary
"Popeye" corn cob pipe

263
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:03,244
Douglas MacArthur

264
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,705
Douglas MacArthur
he proclaims:

265
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,690
<i>People of the Phillipines,
I have returned!</i>

266
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:10,338
<i>The hour of your redemption is here!</i>

267
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,145
But it would take 4 months
to liberate the Phillipines.

268
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,706
Manila, the capital,

269
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:24,613
will be the second most
devastated city of the war,

270
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:25,668
Manila
will be the second most
devastated city of the war,

271
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,002
Manila
after Warsaw.

272
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:44,542
The savagery and the
cruelty of these combats,

273
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,439
can be explained by the
American troops discovery,

274
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,910
of the mass execution
of hostages.

275
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:55,238
And the camps with the surviving
U.S prisoners from 1941.

276
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:05,581
Everywhere in the Pacific,
the war is marked with this type of savagery.

277
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:11,930
Everywhere the same confusion of marines
trapped on the beaches of these infernal islands.

278
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:17,009
The same suicidal obstinacy
of the Japanese.

279
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,662
For them surrendering is
the ultimate disgrace.

280
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,999
The Americans are no longer
taking any risks.

281
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,622
They follow the instinct to
shoot first and ask no questions.

282
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:35,625
Along with imperialism, another
underlying cause of WW2 is racism.

283
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,326
liberated by the Russian
offensive of January 1945.

284
00:21:53,051 --> 00:22:00,370
Hatred of the Jews, exterminating them
was as Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, his mission.

285
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,967
He sent 1 million Jews to their death
in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

286
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:10,328
Six million died of starvation,
brutal treatment, were shot,

287
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:16,135
and burned in the crematoriums
in Majdanak, in Sobibor, in Treblinka.

288
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:22,935
The Russians find a few hundred survivors,
tattooed for life.

289
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,076
They also intercept the trains
full of deportees.

290
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,648
The Nazis continue to give priority
to these death trains,

291
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,393
even over the munitions convoys.

292
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:45,725
They make their trips to the approximately
100 concentration camps,

293
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:49,790
that are still operating
at the beginning of 1945.

294
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:54,750
Millions of Jews, political
activists, opponents...

295
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,617
christians, homosexuals, gypsies
have been deported to these camps

296
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:06,076
and 5 million of them have died
of hunger, abuse and exhaustion.

297
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,285
Like the slaves in
the Dora tunnel,

298
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:12,492
the underground factory where the Nazis
are assembling another secret weapon,

299
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,029
the V-2.

300
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:16,626
The first ballistic missile

301
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:21,515
with a one-ton explossive warhead,
that has a range of 300 kilometers.

302
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:25,577
From the German coast 1.500 of them
are launched against London

303
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:31,082
and 2.000 against Belgium adding to the
devastation and the civilian casualties.

304
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:35,892
The Allies greatest fear is that it might
one day carry a nuclear charge.

305
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,048
Los Alamos
New Mexico, USA

306
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:41,447
Los Alamos
New Mexico, USA
The eminent scientist Einstein himself

307
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:45,339
had warned Roosevelt about the urgency
of getting ahead of the Germans.

308
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:50,800
Huge funds were provided and a team
of scientists secretly went to work...

309
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:53,141
...on the first atomic bomb.

310
00:23:56,271 --> 00:24:00,908
A bomb that uses a metal, Uranium
that makes it possible to split the atom.

311
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:05,198
It is expected to have the
power of 20.000 tons of TNT,

312
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:09,102
more than 2.000 times more powerful
than the largest bomb used to date.

313
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:12,593
In addition to lethal
radioactive fallout.

314
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,362
The designated target was Berlin.

315
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:21,402
But this first atomic bomb would
not be finished in time for Germany.

316
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,876
In Germany, are there any
factories still standing

317
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:27,703
that would be capable of
producing such a weapon?

318
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:31,040
Even synthetic fuel
is becoming scarce.

319
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:34,275
The carpet bombing, carried out
day and night by the Allies

320
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:37,751
continues to devaste German cities.

321
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,902
The Allied bombers will
destroy Dresden,

322
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:52,757
an important center of communications
for the German armies on the eastern front.

323
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:55,551
and one of the biggest
industrial cities in the Reich.

324
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,368
Dresden
February 13, 1945

325
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,259
Dresden
February 13, 1945
Until now, it has remained untouched.

326
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:03,304
Dresden, known as the
"Florence of the Elbe"

327
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:06,348
was one of Europe's
finest medieval cities.

328
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,235
Phosphorous bombs
create a fire typhoon,

329
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:16,726
in which an estimated 25.000 people
are burned to death.

330
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:21,088
The city continues to blaze
for 7 days.

331
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,123
Churchill had said:

332
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:26,767
<i>We will make the German people
taste and gulp a sharper dose</i>

333
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,817
<i> of the miseries they have
showered upon mankind.</i>

334
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,480
Their cities are dying and now
Goebbels and the Nazis

335
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,104
want to send all Germans from
16 to 60 years old to their deaths,

336
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,585
as part of the Volkssturm,
the people's militia.

337
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,000
They shout:

338
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,011
<i>I vow to fight courageously
for my homeland,</i>

339
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:50,203
<i>swear to die
for Adolf Hitler.</i>

340
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,537
Hitler says:

341
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:56,105
<i>There must not be any
weakening of Germany.</i>

342
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,929
His generals, those who survive the massive purge,
following the July 20th assassination attempt,

343
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,356
no logner dare to
oppose the Fuhrer.

344
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,686
They obeyed his order,
which seemed obsured

345
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:12,875
to launch an attack in the West
in the Ardenne during winter.

346
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:17,306
They would have preferred to devote
all of their efforts to fighting the Russians.

347
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,756
Hitler was hoping to recapture
the port of Antwerp

348
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:24,847
in order to stop the Allies from
unloading their equipment,

349
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:27,859
which would enable them
to move into Germany.

350
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,497
Bastogne
Belgium

351
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:39,604
But the German offensive
in the Ardenne, failed.

352
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:44,461
Due to the extraordinary defense put up
by the American paratroopers in Bastogne,

353
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:47,260
to the intervention of
General Patton's tanks

354
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,417
and to the overwhelming
power of the Allied airforces.

355
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:03,989
As for the Russians in the East,
they are crossing the German border.

356
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:09,101
Millions of Germans flee in panic
from the approaching Soviet troops

357
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:14,613
especially the German women who fear
the mass rapes that are being perpetrated.

358
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:25,397
There is no dissention between
the western Allies and the Russians.

359
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:29,632
Moreover, in Churchill's mind the problem
with Germany is practically over.

360
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,739
He is now thinking about how
to divide up the occupation zones.

361
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:38,837
He and Roosevelt meet in the Crimea
for an important conference with Stalin.

362
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:45,525
Yalta, Russia
February 4, 1945

363
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:51,086
Concerned about the increasing
losses being suffered in the Pacific,

364
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:55,662
Roosevelt has come to press Stalin
to join the war effort against Japan.

365
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:02,384
Stalin has made Roosevelt come
all the way out to the Crimea,

366
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:06,018
which takes a toll on the
ailing president's health.

367
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:11,680
He is drawn and emaciated, he barely has
the strength to hold out his arm.

368
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:23,388
Roosevelt smokes cigarette after cigarette.
He is very frail.

369
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:26,123
He will pass away a few
weeks later.

370
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:29,251
His main priority is Japan.

371
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:32,429
At the same time he does not have
the strength to oppose Stalin,

372
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,510
who liberates but also
occupies the Baltic states,

373
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:40,884
Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Silesia and Prussia.

374
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,311
And there is no way
to make him leave.

375
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:51,392
The only one who tries to negotiate
is Churchill.

376
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:58,370
Finally he gets Stalin to promise
to hold free elections in Poland,

377
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,205
a promise that will never be kept

378
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,454
and to give up Greece,
which will leed to civil war.

379
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:11,047
The Greek communist partisans will rise up
and Stalin will let them be massacred.

380
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:15,728
One of the goals of this conference is the
founding of the organisation of the United Nations,

381
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:18,414
which would soon be
convened in San Francisco.

382
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:22,982
The U.N.'s mission will be to seek
a peacul settlement for all disputes

383
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:25,232
and to protect human rights.

384
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:31,688
This picture heralds the beggining
of the Cold War...

385
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:39,482
The war in the Pacific,
continues.

386
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,545
The marines raise the American flag
on top of Mount Suribachi,

387
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:48,478
Iwo Jima
February 23, 1945
the volcano that dominates
the island of Iwo Jima.

388
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:54,847
The battle took the lives of 7.000
Americans and 20.000 Japanese.

389
00:29:56,243 --> 00:30:00,095
It is now possible for the Boeing B29
"Super Fortress" bombers,

390
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:02,976
taking off from Iwo Jima
and other islands in the Pacific

391
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,084
to reach Japan.

392
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:10,676
Humans have invented something even more
vicious than the phosphorus used in Dresden

393
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:14,599
Napalm, gasoline mixed
with incendiary jelly.

394
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,060
1.700 tons dropped on little houses
made of wood and paper.

395
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,505
Tokyo
March 9, 1945
1.700 tons dropped on little houses
made of wood and paper.

396
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:23,360
Tokyo
March 9, 1945

397
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:29,892
The Japanese are victims
of their fanatical military leaders,

398
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:34,027
who plunge them into this inferno
and who wanted to pursue the war.

399
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:37,879
In spite of the 80.000 victims
and the 1 million homeless,

400
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,498
from this air raid
over Tokyo.

401
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,528
Berchtesgaden

402
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,058
Berchtesgaden

403
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,684
Hitler was at his chalet
in the Bavarian Alps,

404
00:30:55,685 --> 00:31:00,558
along with his dog "Blondie", of whom he
seemed to be fonder than any human being.

405
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:01,559
He predicted:

406
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:05,378
<i>The next war will not end
like the 1st World War.</i>

407
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:07,948
<i>There will be no
11th of November.</i>

408
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,500
<i>It will be either victory
or annihilation.</i>

409
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:17,982
Perhaps this vertiginous feeling
of all or nothing,

410
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:21,563
is what kept him from marrying
his mistress, Eva Braun.

411
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,532
He said:

412
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:25,332
<i>I'm already married
to Germany.</i>

413
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:32,777
The Soviet forces have
surrounded Berlin.

414
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:35,679
But Hitler refuses
to admin defeat.

415
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,842
He says:

416
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:39,469
<i>It will be the opposite
of Stalingrad.</i>

417
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:43,318
Berlin
April 17, 1945

418
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,393
Berlin
April 17, 1945
But his remaining soldiers,
overwhelmed by the Russian rocket launchers

419
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:47,385
But his remaining soldiers,
overwhelmed by the Russian rocket launchers

420
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:49,891
surrender one after the other.

421
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:09,141
Beneath the ruins of the chancellory
in his underground bunker,

422
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:13,199
Hitler rants and raves and
manoeveurs his imaginary armies.

423
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:17,161
The last of his faithful followers
take advantage of a lull

424
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:21,659
Garden of the Chancellery
April 20, 1945
to come out and celebrate
his birthday on April the 20th.

425
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:24,288
Hitler is 56 years old.

426
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:27,011
He consoles these Hitler Youth,

427
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:31,708
who have been chosen because their parents
have just been killed in the bombing of Dresden.

428
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:42,699
As the Americans advance westward,
they capture thousands of these Hitler youths

429
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:46,135
sent to the front to replace
the soldiers who have been killed.

430
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:49,734
The Americans can hardly
believe their eyes.

431
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,740
These boys-soldiers
are afraid of nothing.

432
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:56,210
They have undergone years
of brainwashing.

433
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:00,025
Hatred and racism have been
indoctrinated into them.

434
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,997
The old men in the Volkssturm
who were also captured

435
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:08,604
have no words of
comfort for them.

436
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:29,051
The Americans meet up with the Russians
on the Elbe near the Torgau bridge.

437
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:30,784
Torgau
April 25, 1945

438
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,659
Torgau
April 25, 1945
East meets West.

439
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,102
The final act of the alliance.

440
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:38,667
The atmosphere is friendly...
...for the cameras.

441
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,186
Stalin's portrait is
superbly displayed,

442
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,959
but Roosevelt's is draped
in black mourning crape.

443
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,847
He died on April the 12th.

444
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:05,168
One of America's most renowned generals,
George S. Patton, is furious.

445
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:09,304
George S. Patton
He thinks the Americans should have
entered Berlin before the Russians.

446
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:12,733
Patton, the man with the
pistols in his belt,

447
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,121
who drove his tanks
through Africa,

448
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,046
through Normandy,
through the Ardenne.

449
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,569
He says to Eisenhower:

450
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:28,157
<i>The 9th Army is
60 miles from Berlin.</i>

451
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:33,133
<i>Not to go all the way there is a historic error
whose consequences will be very grave.</i>

452
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,180
Eisenhower says nothing.

453
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,899
The only thing that matters to him is
to eliminate Hitler and the Nazis.

454
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,247
A few days earlier,
Patton had called him up urgently,

455
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:52,027
wanting him to witness the horrors
of the concentration camp at Buchenwald.

456
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:56,294
Eisenhower had the inhabitants
of the nearby city of Weimar

457
00:34:56,294 --> 00:35:00,770
taken there in trucks so that
they could no longer say they did not know,

458
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:04,464
in order to show them that
such things did exist,

459
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,380
so that they would be able
to testify in Germany.

460
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:16,602
To say that they had seen the tattoos
collected from the corpses of the deported.

461
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:21,443
The lampshades made
of human skin.

462
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,871
The shrunken-head paperweights.

463
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:39,435
Then, in accordance
with the Yalta agreements,

464
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,425
Eisenhower withdrew his troops
from Buchenwald,

465
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:44,722
which was located
in the Soviet zone.

466
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:49,563
Stalin immediately puts
the camp back to work.

467
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,938
It will become part of
his prison system,

468
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:57,215
where people suspected of hostility
towards his regime will be imprisoned.

469
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,756
Berlin
April 30, 1945

470
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:03,452
Berlin
April 30, 1945
In Berlin the Russians are 300 meters
away from the Fuhrer's bunker.

471
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,133
In Berlin the Russians are 300 meters
away from the Fuhrer's bunker.

472
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:15,265
Hitler kills his pet dog Blondie,
after marrying Eva Braun.

473
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,827
She swallows a cyanide pill.

474
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,562
Hitler shoots himself
in the head.

475
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:26,090
Goebbels and his wife also
committed suicide.

476
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:31,631
Before that, Magda Goebbels had
poisoned her six children.

477
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:35,053
In her last letter,
she wrote:

478
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:38,370
<i>That we can end our lives together
with the Fuhrer is a blessing,</i>

479
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,656
<i>for which we never dared to hope.</i>

480
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,038
May 2, 1945
The Soviets will raise their
red flag over the Reichstag.

481
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,212
The main Nazi leaders
will be captured.

482
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:57,672
Goering
Like Goering, one of Hitler's
most diabolical accomplices.

483
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,415
Like Goering, one of Hitler's
most diabolical accomplices.

484
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:06,152
In Italy, Mussolini is executed by Partisans
and his body is lynched by the crowd.

485
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:07,831
Mussolini
In Italy, Mussolini is executed by Partisans
and his body is lynched by the crowd.

486
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:10,088
In Italy, Mussolini is executed by Partisans
and his body is lynched by the crowd.

487
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:12,602
Everywhere in Europe
a wave of revenge

488
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:15,079
is unleashed against those
who in one way or another

489
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,835
collaborated with the devils.

490
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:25,729
In Berlin, Anna Pavlovna directs
traffic at the Brandenburg Gate.

491
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:35,275
To defeat Nazi Germany
Russia paid a very high price.

492
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:38,653
20 million civilians and
soldiers were killed.

493
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:42,297
Nearly 15% of the population
of the Soviet Union.

494
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,175
Soviet General Georgy Zhukov
has himself filmed in the ruins

495
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,669
Georgy Zhukov
Soviet General Georgy Zhukov
has himself filmed in the ruins

496
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,045
Georgy Zhukov
of the Grand Grand Chancellery of the Reich,

497
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:54,807
of the Grand Grand Chancellery of the Reich,

498
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:58,593
the very symbol of Hitler's
delusions of grandeur.

499
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,842
And finally in Hitler's office...

500
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:11,680
...with the famous globe
that Charlie Chaplin paradded

501
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,372
in his movie the "Great Dicator".

502
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:27,018
Hitler had ordered
the SS to burn his body.

503
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:32,178
The Soviets will get rid of the bones in
order to prevent any kind of hero-worship.

504
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:38,007
May 8, 1945

505
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:43,336
Wehrmacht commander Marshal Keitel signs
the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany

506
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:47,916
in front of the General Zhukov, his
mortal enemy and the Allied officers.

507
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:52,383
The British Air Marshal Tedder,
the American General Spaatz

508
00:38:52,384 --> 00:38:55,696
and the French General
de Lattre de Tassigny.

509
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:02,008
Keitel will later be tried at the
international Nuremberg trials.

510
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:05,751
He will be hanged like
many other war criminals.

511
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,832
Berlin

512
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:14,505
To stop the Nazis,
Germany had to be annihilated.

513
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:19,866
Will it also be necessary to annihilate Japan?

514
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:22,049
Okinawa

515
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:27,014
In the Pacific, the suicide pilots
that the Japanese call "kamikaze",

516
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:30,201
nosedive their planes
into the American fleet.

517
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,967
Clutching on to their power,
the military chiefs in Tokyo

518
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:41,070
sacrifice what remains of their
country's youth and their aircraft

519
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:44,789
in order to prevent the Americans
from landing in Japan.

520
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:56,861
In the end, the United States
decide against an invasion of Japan

521
00:39:56,862 --> 00:40:00,296
which it thinks will cost
the country a million lives.

522
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,097
Hiroshima
August 6, 1945

523
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:05,800
Hiroshima
August 6, 1945
Instead, it detonates the atomic inferno.

524
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:11,778
The first 2 nuclear bombs ever exploded
kill in one second over 100.000 people.

525
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:12,167
Nagasaki
August 9, 1945

526
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:14,771
Nagasaki
August 9, 1945
And finally enable the emperor, Hirohito

527
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:17,772
to seek peace
without loosing face.

528
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:22,456
The atom bomb had to be dropped
before these Japanese soldiers and officers

529
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,746
would finally consent
to perform this act

530
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:29,115
which is entirelly contrary to the Bushido,
their code of honour.

531
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:32,541
A few Japanese soldiers
take to the Jungle.

532
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:36,546
Some never even learn
of their country's defeat.

533
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:40,546
The last of these will come
out of hiding and turn himself in...

534
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:42,437
...in 1975!

535
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:45,621
September 2, 1945

536
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:48,321
In Tokyo bay onboard
the USS Missouri,

537
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:53,239
the representatives of the Allied nations
from China, Great Britain, Russia and France

538
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,840
are filled with emotion.

539
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:58,344
They have the privilege of attending
the signing of the Japanese surrender,

540
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,327
that marks the end of WW2.

541
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:08,215
General McArthur
represents the victors.

542
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,309
Mamoru Shigemitsu

543
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,946
Mamoru Shigemitsu
The Japanese minister of foreign affairs

544
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:20,987
in a top hat
walks with a limp,

545
00:41:20,987 --> 00:41:23,372
having lost a leg in
a bomb attach in China

546
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:27,888
will sign on behalf of the emperor
with whom he had met the day before.

547
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:29,765
He had told him:

548
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,952
<i>We must make of
this day of mourning</i>

549
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:35,350
<i>the first day of the
birth of a new Japan.</i>

550
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,117
<i>In that way, we can go to the ceremony
with our heads held high.</i>

551
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:51,070
McArthur concludes with these
historic words:

552
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:55,205
<i>It is my earnest hope and
indeed the hope of all mankind...</i>

553
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:57,140
<i>that from this
solemn occasion...</i>

554
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,855
<i>a better world shall emerge out of
the blood and carnage of the past...</i>

555
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:11,457
Hiroshima

556
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,277
This war took the lives
of some 50 million people.

557
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,519
Most of them innocent civilians

558
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,613
in an outbreak of pure violence.

559
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:23,009
Thousands of victims suffered
for many years afterwards

560
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,559
Nagasaki
Thousands of victims suffered
for many years afterwards

561
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,093
from the appauling after-effects
of nuclear radiation.

562
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:36,340
Or from the terrible loss
of parents or children,

563
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:38,933
exterminated in the Nazi camps.

564
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:45,552
This series is dedicated to the
victims of all forms of totalitarianism.

565
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:49,153
Let us be grateful
to the cameramen

566
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:53,908
the unarmed heroes, who recorded
these combats for posterity.

567
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:18,389
And to all who filmed the war in
all of its atrocity and its familiarity.

568
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,104
They introduced us to Rose

569
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:20,904
Rose Gowlland
They introduced us to Rose

570
00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:24,487
Rose Gowlland
who on the last day of the Apocalypse
wrote:

571
00:43:24,488 --> 00:43:26,125
The end,

572
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:28,224
on a bomb...
