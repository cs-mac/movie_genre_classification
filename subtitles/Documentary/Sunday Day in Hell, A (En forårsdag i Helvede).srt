00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,326
Yo, Burt! What's up?

You wanna earn your keep,
go stock some shelves.

168
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,736
I'd love to, but you've got
a phone call.

169
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,204
Take a message.

170
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,736
I tried,

171
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,505
but there's a lady
holding on the line,

172
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,344
who's got a very sexy
phone voice, by the way.

173
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,416
She told me to tell you
that they've got, uh...

174
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,548
I can't read my writing.

175
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,886
What does that word... What does that say?
That she's got, uh...

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,523
Graboids? Where?
Mr. Gummer?

177
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,923
Affirmative. Who's this?

178
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,758
Dr. Rita Sims. I'm calling
from Nunavut Province, Canada.

179
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,299
We're 67 degrees north.

180
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,095
That's the Canadian Arctic.
Yes, it is.

181
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,804
I'm the station leader of an
international research team.

182
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,971
We're based at Boîte Canyon.

183
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,104
How'd you get this number?
You from the government?

184
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,166
Is she hot?

185
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,437
Well, I have an associate
familiar with your work.

186
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,474
I think your associate must
be half a bubble off plumb.

187
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,448
That was my first reaction, but
she's actually very bright.

188
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,754
She knows a lot
about Graboid mythology.

189
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,322
Graboids are no myth, but
they're a desert phenomenon.

190
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,587
I think this is a colossal
time suck, Miss, uh...

191
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,390
Dr. Sims.

192
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,728
Graboids do not and cannot
exist in the Arctic, Dr. Sims!

193
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,768
Impossible.
Ask her if she's hot.

194
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,631
Improbable but not impossible.

195
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,331
Who's this?
This is Valerie.

196
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,933
First, let me say that,
as a major Graboid enthusiast,

197
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,606
I have admired your work
for years. Here's what I know.

198
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,306
Graboids are subterranean
worm-like predator

199
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,113
unlike any other life form cataloged
in Earth's genetic or fossil record.

200
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,954
When fully grown,
a Graboid can reach up

201
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,183
to 10 meters in length
and weigh up to 20 tons.

202
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,792
Their semi-rigid internal structure
is covered by a leathery carapace.

203
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,331
They're daytime hunters
and have no eyes,

204
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,801
but what's most fascinating to
me about their predatory acuity

205
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,598
is that it's based
on vibration.

206
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,000
Go on. I'm listening.

207
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,099
They have a massive black armored
beak and two hooked mandibles,

208
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,575
one on either side
of their jaw.

209
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,637
The species is Precambrian and have
long and powerful snake-like tentacles,

210
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,182
which can reach three meters
to ensnare their prey.

211
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,741
If you'd like,
I can give you the 41 1

212
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,150
on the morphological
subspecies

213
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,849
known as the Ass Blaster
a.k.a. Mexicana Combustus.

214
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,992
You're a treasure-trove of
Graboidology, Miss, but I...

215
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,518
You've hunted and killed them on two
different continents, Mr. Gummer.

216
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,358
That's why I insisted
that we call.

217
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,090
But why are you so sure
this is a Graboid attack?

218
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,563
The kill site
has all the telltale signs.

219
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,098
Except for location.

220
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,474
I don't know. Call it a
gut feeling, intuition.

221
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,044
We need your help, Mr. Gummer,
and we need it ASAP!

222
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,208
Think of the adventure,
Graboids in the Arctic.

223
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,283
This could be
a whole new ballgame.

224
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,111

233
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,530

of the taxman, dude!

234
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,427
Let's be honest. You've got
a lot of red in your ledger.

235
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,626
My financial status
is none of your damn beeswax.

236
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,270
And you'll just be
in the way.

237
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,501
Oh, like I was
in South Africa? Huh?

238
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,903
That was a one-off!
Nothing more.

239

You're looking at this through the wrong
end of the telescope here, friend.

240
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,746
What about your legacy, huh?

241
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,940
What about it?

242
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,517
Do you know of any other
Graboid hunters out there?

243
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,177
Uh, I don't.

You're a one-off!

00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,729
Come on, man, teach me!
Pay it forward.

247
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,489
Oh, I'm not
dead yet.

248
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,124
I know, and I'm not interested in
talking about your mortality, either,

249
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,569
but think about it.
Who's gonna fill your shoes

250
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,369

or outgun these beasts, huh?

251
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,209
I've got to
tell you something.

252

some big-ass shoes to fill.

I've seen you
in the locker room.

255
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,151
And you're my heir apparent.
Is that it?

256
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,777
You already led me through
one Graboid gauntlet.

257
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:33,288
There's a lot you still don't know.
Exactly my point.

combat primer.

Hell, yeah, it was!
I was your wingman.

261

Wingman?
More like wingnut!

I suggest you take evasive action
and put this plane on the ground.

They're keying in
on your engine!

318
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,318
Yeah, they're heat seekers.
Who's they?

319
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,457

00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,378
Stand by for some chop!

325
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,242
Does that mean crash?

(LAUGHS)
Gravity never loses!

327
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,478
The best we can hope for
is a draw!

No, more like

My bird runs on bio-fuel.

But there's no welcome mat on
my doorstep, so tread lightly.

351
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,369
A piece of advice, Mr. Gummer.

352
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,835
You stay out of my way
and pay your taxes.

I don't know. Do you?

Since we're neighbors,
here's some neighborly advice.

Beat a retreat until I get
this area cleared out.

Retreat? Hell, no. We're just
getting started up here.

Then find a safe place
to hunker down.

a bit hectic there, huh?

Yeah, just a little bit.

your parents over the years.

391
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,286
It's okay. They're easy to
lose track of, especially Val.

Yeah, well, for the varmints
we're hunting,

404
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,530
that's like shooting a
slingshot at a Sherman tank.

405
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,834
I thought it'd be colder than a
reindeer's ball bag up here.

406
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,164
We're in the middle
of an Arctic heat wave,

407
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,331
which has greatly accelerated
the snow melt.

Hell, I'm hotter
than a 50 cal on full auto!

Mr. Gummer,
glad you could make it.

410

Welcome to the Boîte Canyon
Arctic Research Station

411
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,283
or, like we used to call it,
science at the edge of the world.

412
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,909
You must be, uh,
Dr. Rita Sims?

413
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,214
Good to meet you.
Yeah.

414
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,449
This is Dr. Ferezze.

415
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,523
Charles Ferezze.
Doc.

416
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,118
How was your flight in?

417
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,424
Well, let's just say, uh,
we hit some chop.

418
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,897
We blew the engine.

419
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,001
Actually, we came
under Ass Blaster attack,

420
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,299
and during the ensuing aerial
dogfight, the engine was blown.

421
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,472
An Ass Blaster?
Yeah.

422
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,240
Blew the engine?

423
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,238
But you have to fly me back
to Montreal so I can report

424
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,874
to the powers that be about
the recent turn of events.

425
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,284
Well, they'll just have to wait till
I get this puppy airborne again.

426
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,183
I can't stay here
one more minute!

427
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,323
Excuse me. I've got
an engine to fix.

428
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,653
DR. FEREZZE: Excuse me.
(LAUGHS)

429
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,294
Dr. Ferezze, he startles
at the drop of a feather.

430

00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,381
Well, it's the Land of the
Midnight Sun, Mr. Welker.

437
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,384
Are you saying that the sun
is never going down on me?

438
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,851
Well, it's never gonna go
below the horizon,

439
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,384
if that's what you're asking.

440
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,464
RITA: We sent a three-man
drill team to the glacial field

441
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,666
about a half a day
up mountain from here.

442
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,492
You have three KIA?

443
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,061
Killed in action.

Swackhamer.

446
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,799
I hammered-and-nailed
this place together.

447
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,970
You need to know anything,
I'm your guy.

448
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,444
There's two that we can verify
dead, one assumed dead.

449
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,243
Verified? How?

450
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,580
Well, from the kill site.

451
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,248
Rita and her crew managed
to recover a severed head,

452
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,791
a partially eaten pelvis,
and a half-eaten testicle.

453
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,990
How do you recover
a half-eaten testicle?

454
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,858
Now, where's all
the snow, Dr. Sims?

455
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,631
This year in particular has been one
of the warmest on record up here.

456
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,461
Meet Hart Hansen, Mr. Gummer.

457
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,731
He's a PhD in Geomorphology from
the University of Cambridge.

458
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,704
Ah, yeah, airplane boy.

459
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,907
It's an RC. Kind of a hobby.

460
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,743
It's actually a habit, um...

461
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,311
Okay, it's
an addiction. Anyway,

462
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,784
it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Gummer.

463
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,286
I'm sure you'll find
that Boîte Canyon

464
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,516
is a very unique
geological phenomenon.

465
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,989
VALERIE: This perennially
frozen tundra is interrupted

466
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,620
for approximately 10 square
kilometers by thawed soil.

467
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,130
Thawed? It's bone dry
out there.

468
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,166
The Meltwater Hot Springs

We get it.

480
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,095
The permafrost at a higher
elevation is melting,

481
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,529
so the tundra is more easily breached.
Ergo, Graboids.

482

484
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,010
Kind of, but there's more.

(SCOFFS) Enlighten me.
Why here?

00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,805
Evolution, Mr. Gummer.

487
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,214
There's one thing
Nature has taught us,

488
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,048
and that's life can expand
into new territories.

489
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,816
Maybe these are
the first Graboids.

490
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,390
Yeah, like pre-Precambrian.
VALERIE: Exactly.

491
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,187
And maybe they migrated south millions,
maybe even billions of years ago

492
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,924
and evolved into
a desert creature.

493
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,990
And now, after countless
giga-annum lying dormant in ice...

494
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,365

thing did to Dr. Ferezze.

823
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,590
They just came out of hibernation
and, based on their body mass index,

824
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,361
those creatures
need to eat a lot.

825
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,334

Well, we can't stay here.

Copy that. We've got weapons, but
not enough for these bad boys.

The bigger the problem,
the bigger the hammer.

Yeah? What've you got
in mind?

831
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,573
There's a couple of cases
of dynamite in the hangar.

832
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,085
Petrol, tools, bear
bangers, odds and ends.

Sounds like that's our FOB.

835
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,887
One problem.

836
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,585
The hangar's got a compacted
chip-stone floor.

837
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,358
Oh, come on, man.
They're gonna be like

838
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,830
sand sharks
bobbing for apples.

839
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,829
Yeah, and we'll be
the Granny Smiths.

840
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,232
This floor is 1.2 meters
above the ground,

841
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,931
supported by
a steel substructure.

842
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,540
Those things won't be able
to knock this place down.

843
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,041
Yeah, but it's only
a matter of time

844
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,045
before they come blasting through
the floor and eat our lunch.

845
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,673
I've got an idea. The generator's
in the hangar, right?

846
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,784
Yeah. Triple-phase power,
63-amp cables.

847
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,676
According to
these blueprints,

848
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,721
this hangar's got
a deep-pile foundation.

849
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,349
Yeah, steel caissons going
directly into the bedrock.

850
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,414
Drilled it myself.

851
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,951
You think you can re-route the power
so it goes to the steel caissons?

852
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,688
Are you saying
what I'm thinking?

853
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,095
What are you thinking
I'm saying?

854
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,464
I'm thinking that you're saying
that we shoot a dose of milliamps

855
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,400
straight into the groundwater
and create some kind of...

856
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,462
Underground electrical fence.
Exactly.

857
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,475
That's exactly what I'm saying
you're thinking. Can you do it?

858
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,771
I've done more with less.

859
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,108
Yeah, but if
it doesn't work, we die.

860
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,647
So what the hell, Burt? Have you
ever nailed Jell-O to a wall?

861
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,446
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

862
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,510
It's relevant
because I did it.

863
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,115
And guess what? It stuck.

864
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,420
You know why? Because
everyone said I couldn't.

865
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,323
All right, I got it.
I got it!

866
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,992
And we've got a plan.
We're off to the hangar.

867
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,797

Travis, you, and Dr. Sims.

868

Swackhamer, you're with me.

I'm on it.

871
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,209
I'm gonna pretend I didn't
just hear you leave me out

872
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,040
because I'm coming
on this worm hunt.

873
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,547
Elk hunter, huh? Think you
can bang on this short arm?

874
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,878
Piece of cake. You zero that scope
for distance or dangerous game?

875
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,511
What do you think?
Stupid question.

876
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,157
Mind if I tweak it for my
preferred point of impact?

877
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,724
Dad and I always zeroed our scopes
at 2.5 inches high at 100 yards.

878
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,125
Well, whatever floats
your boat.

879
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,668
You're on overwatch. Take
Vargas and go on the roof.

880
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,724
Roger that.

881
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,497
And hold on tight, huh?
She'll kick some!

882
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:30,662
Got you.

883
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,467
The gun or Vargas?

884
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,515

885

887
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,546
Okay, you ready,
Dr. Sims?

888
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:48,555
Oh, shit. Look what the cat
dragged in.

Oh, good. You're here.

at the Meltwater Hot Springs.

891
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,767
You just got in over your head
and had to punt, huh?

892
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,027
Your experiment's run amok.

893
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,394

894
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,732
What, you think I'm actually
controlling these...

895
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,275
Yeah, but of course you would.
Your psych eval suggested as much.

896
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,973
You had me profiled?

897
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,616
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this
is not the Island of Dr. Moreau.

is more elevated than that.

Oh, yes. No DARPA skunk
works in the hopper, huh?

901
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,988
No bio-engineering perhaps? A
little Graboid gene-splicing?

902
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,301
You know, that's a good idea, but
bio-weapons are not my thing.

903

I'm here

to assess the purity
of the groundwater

of the Arctic and into civilization.

This is about water?

00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,103
Water is the new oil,
and, as you may have noticed,

908

the Arctic has it
in abundance now.

back in the States.

1419
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,823
You trying to get sweet
with me?

1420
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:14,727
Definitely.

1421
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:16,728
Never gonna happen.

1422
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:19,667
I think it might.

1423
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,070
Thanks.

1424
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:27,471
For everything.

1425
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:36,851
(EXHALES)

1426
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,492
Travis, what have you learned
from me?

1427
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,760
Uh, to not trust anyone
or anything ever?

1428
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,996
You call that
a goodbye kiss?

1429
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:55,165
A man brings a big bore .44 Magnum
to a fight, not some broke dick.22.

1430
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,034
Broke dick?
That was sweet dick.

1431
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:58,803
Oh, was it?
Yeah.

1432
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,973
'Cause that sorely lacked any kind
of velocity or stopping power,

1433
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,983
not to mention
maximum penetration.

1434
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,247
Okay, it's a little late
to have

1435
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:09,687
the guns-and-ammo
talk, Burt. All right?

1436
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,017
Pathetic.

1437
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:32,539
(ALL EXCLAIM)

1438
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,518
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1439
01:32:57,004 --> 01:32:58,767
It was better.
Better?

1440
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:03,104
It was no.44 Magnum.
.357, maybe.

1441
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:04,574
Dude, what do you know
about kissing?

1442
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:08,012
I know enough not to unholster my
weapon unless I'm prepared to use it.

1443
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:11,183
It's nice to see you back
to your old self, Burt.

1444
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,449
What do you say we get on home and get
ourselves some real sunshine, huh?

1445
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,582
Sounds like perfection,
Pops.

1446
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,662
Pops.
