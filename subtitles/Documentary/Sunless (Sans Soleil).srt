1
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,160
By 1860 Japan had already opened
her doors to the rest of the world

2
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,880
and the first ambassador to Washington had arrived
only after a long and perilous voyage by sea.

3
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,880
Ten years later, despite the new
rail road from San Francisco,

4
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,320
Ambassador Sakaguchi, Lord of Bizen was to find
that besides the peril of the voyage by sea,

5
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,760
there were further danger to be faced
on land, on their way through the West.

6
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Okay men, all out,
take your positions. Come on!

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
Take it down Didn't you hear me?

8
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
Look at the engine,
but don't get dirty.

9
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
All right.

10
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Why all the soldiers, Sargent? Must be
somebody pretty important in that car.

11
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes sir, the Ambassador from Japan.

12
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,840
Japanese, how interesting.

13
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,680
God almighty, just you look at that.

14
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,760
All aboard All aboard
All aboard All aboard All aboard.

15
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,960
All aboard All aboard.

16
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,160
Hold it Link Now just take off
your belt one handed.

17
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Since when you turn
bounty hunter, Stone?

18
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,080
Since the price went up on you.

19
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Looks like it worked.

20
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,120
Yeah, you always was stupid.

21
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, jump.

22
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,440
What, me?

23
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Scum.

24
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Filth.

25
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,920
Bye Sheriff.

26
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,120
Right on time
I make this trip once a month.

27
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
That wind out there
don't blow up a duster.

28
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll be in Santa Fe before noon.

29
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Yeah, if the ground don't crack open
and swallow us all up.

30
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Do you mind?

31
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
Conductor.

32
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Folks, me and my friend is going to put
on a little wild west show for you.

33

It's called a hold up.

34

Now don't get scared or do anything
stupid and you'll be all right.

my assistants are going to take up a
collection Just like they do in church.

62
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,240
All right, all right,
I'm getting it out as fast as I can.

63
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,160
That's all we need is
a nervous dynamite man.

64
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,040

That's enough.

71
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,120
All right, you have five
seconds to open up that door.

72
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,200
Get a move on, come on, come on, Hunt.

73
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
Well, Hunt for God's sake.

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,200
Get back.

75
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
Murdering bastards.

76
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Amen, brother.

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,960

78
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
Yeah, give me three sticks.

79
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,760
You two better get out.

80
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the
end of the line There's your way back to

81
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,160
the US Armies waiting to protect you
So, would you please start walking.

82
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
Now.

83
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,040
And four more for me.

84
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,280
How did we do?

85
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,520
About as expected.

86
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,360
Four hundred thousand?

87
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,400
Give or take a dollar.

88
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,680
Quite a haul for you,
Link One third.

89
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Yah, not bad for work
on the Sabbath, huh?

90
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,920
Now when do we divy up?

91
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
Like we said in San Lucas.

92
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Why not now, then we can separate.

93
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,800
Hunt, you've been shaking like a tree
full of owls right from the start.

94
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,880
What the hell's the matter with you?

95
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,400
I got a bad feeling.

96
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,000
About what?

97
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Just bad, that's all.

98
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Well look, Hunt, no worry, you'll get
your cut Link will be sure of that.

99
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,240
It ain't him I'm worried about.

100
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
Meaning what?

101
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,800
Meaning the both of you shut up.

102
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,920
Gauche, make sure everything's
all right outside.

103
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,680
Anything you say, General.

104
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,160
Then I want to check out that private car.

105
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm not worried about you, Link,
don't get that idea It's Gauche.

106
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,040
What about him?

107
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,080
I don't know.

108
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,920
That's your split, take it and go.

109
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,240
Please Link, don't get sore.

110
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,320
But before you go, if I were you
I'd change my clothes your pants are wet.

111
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,160
Alright, you tally.

112
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
Listen in there,
we got thirty guns out here.

113
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,560
Thirty one.,

114
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,080
And whatever you got in there
can't be much So, open the door.

115
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
Maybe he don't speak English.

116
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, I sure as hell don't speak Japanese.

117
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,960
Pablo speaks Latin He used to be a priest.

118
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Si, si.

119
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,520
The hell with it,
get Hunt We'll blow it up.

120
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,480
I am Sakajo Bizen,

121
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Ambassador to the United States
on authority from his Imperial Majesty,

122
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,880
the Mikado, the Emperor of Japan I caution
you both, I am on my way to Washington.

123
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,840
My safe arrival is guaranteed
by your government.

124
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,800
Washington is quite a few hills
away I'm coming in.

125
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,720
Look out for these two.

126
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,720
Samurai guards?

127
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,920
In my service.

128
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,200
Well, if you want them to remain
in your service,

129
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,240
better tell them just to keep
their hands off those long knives.

130
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,640
Well now, Ambassador, tell you
how this works.

131
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,160
You're being a foreigner in a strange
land, me and my partner here,

132
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,480
we look around, take what we want.

133
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,440
You try to stop us, we kill you.

134
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,600
There is no need to be destructive
The money is there.

135
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,160
Ambassador, you're a gentleman,
enjoy your stay in our country.

136
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,080
What do I do with these two?

137
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Well, unless you have some special use for
men dressed up like women, let them go.

138
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
All right.

139
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Sir, it's a gift for the President
from my Imperial Majesty the Mikado.

140
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,400
Gold, real gold?

141
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
You tell your emperor, I thank him.

142
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,800
Jump.

143
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,480
Link.

144
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,520
Well, makes a good butcher shop.

145
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,000
You.

146
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,800
Are you shouting at me?

147
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,760
I want to know your name.

148
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,560
You're lucky I don't shoot you.

149
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
I ask for your name.

150
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,040
In New Orleans I've shot men who
didn't like the cards I dealt them.

151
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,000
So why? I'll tell you my name,
what good is it to you?

152
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,040
I intend to find you, I intend to
see you dead.

153
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,120
I get impression that until today you've
never seen a man killed by one of these.

154
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,840
Gun Sword, we all die the same way.

155
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,400
The name is Gauche.

156
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,000
They were like brothers.

157
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
That's too bad.

158
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
The man who killed him,
also tried to kill you.

159
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, so it seems.

160
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,440
He stole from us Something
very precious.

161
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,560
A gift to your President
from my Imperial Majesty.

162
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,760
Too bad.

163
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,160
It is a matter of honor
that it be returned to us.

164
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,920
You will lead my Samurai to that man.

165
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
Nope You'll want to kill Gauche on sight,

166
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,920
but I want that damned Frenchman alive.

167
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,960
At least until I get my hands on that money.

168
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,200
That will be between you and my Samurai
You will leave immediately.

169
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I guess you didn't hear me, Ambassador.

170
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm not dragging some greenhorn
around the countryside.

171
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,000
Make no mistake, Karoda
is no ordinary man.

172
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,920
I don't care what he is Look,
Ambassador, we don't have horses,

173
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,160
and Gauche has a two hour head start and
he's got 20 mean guns to back him up.

174
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,440
Hell, even if I do catch up with
him, the trouble just...

175
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,560
Silence Each of these dots
represent a day.

176
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I have given him seven days
to recover the Mikado sword.

177
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,680
In seven days, I will pass here again,
the same train.

178
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,200
Suppose he doesn't make it in seven days.

179
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,440
For the disgrace of failure,
he will rip his abdomen, kill himself.

180
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,000
So will I We call it, hari Kiri.

181
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,560
Well, that's something I'd like to see.

182
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,280
And he might as well do it now,
cause I'm not taking him.

183
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,000
Then, he will cut your head off.

184
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,800
That's something I wouldn't like to see.

185
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,560
Just testing, yes sir.

186
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,800
Just what I had in mind.

187
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
You get around pretty good in those skirts.

188
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,960
Yes sir, I'm going to have
to try something else.

189
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,920
Wait a minute, now wait a minute.

190
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
These tracks are going
right around that long bend.

191
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,080
There's no other way out of this canyon, so we
can save time by going right over the top.

192
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,440
What the hell, just follow me?

193
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,600
Hell, let's rest?

194
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
I think I got it all figured.

195
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,800
You see, you're a gorilla,
and you're as ugly as a buzzard.

196
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,400
Not only that, I think you're as
dumb as a backward jackass.

197
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,000
Who is more dumb? Me or the man who
let's himself get cheated by friends?

198
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,160
I thought you didn't know the language.

199
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Did I say that?

200
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,120
No, but you never talked.

201
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,720
The jackass has nothing to say.

202
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,240
Well I think I like it better the other way.

203
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Move.

204
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Hurry up.

205
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
Like I told you There they are.

206
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,400
Hell, don't you ever eat?

207
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,240
With the stomach empty,
it would be a disgrace to ...hunger.

208
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,640
For you maybe, yes Not me,
I'm a pampered Westerner.

209
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,960
All right We camp here.

210
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,200
There.

211
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,600
Well now, the way I see it,
you're a man of honor And so am I.

212
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,920
Well, anyhow, let's make a deal.

213
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,200
I promise I won't try to escape,

214
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,720
and I'll cooperate all the way
in tracking down Gauche.

215
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,600
And all I want from you, you see is
your word that you won't kill him on sight.

216
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
Cause I figure I need at least a
whole day to make him talk.

217
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,920
You will not escape.

218
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,720
Don't you bet on that
You got to sleep sometime.

219
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
I already did.

220
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,080
Yeah, when?

221
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,320
While walking.

222
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,960
I don't believe that But you know,

223
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,760
all I have to do is waltz you
around for about seven days,

224
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
at which time you'll belly stick yourself.

225
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,440
Yes After doing the same for you.

226
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,560
I can believe that, too.

227
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,000
Give me those.

228
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,800
What?

229
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,320
The boots.

230
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,040
That... that stinks,
Expect me to eat this?

231
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,880
Tastes not so bad, pretty good.

232
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
God damned mosquitoes, I can't sleep.

233
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,440
There's mosquitoes all over
the God damned place.

234
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,480
Wrong, one mosquito.

235
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
No mosquito.

236
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,840
Come on, hurry.

237
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,840
They cross down there And there
as well Many houses.

238
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,680
Means I'm not going to San Lucas.

239
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
We cross here, too.

240
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,920
Down there?

241
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,040
It's your idea, so you go first.

242
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
I had a dog, his name was green,

243
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,840
never said much, but he was mighty keen.

244
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,520
Shared my work and he sh...

245
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,160
Son of a bitch.

246
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,360
Damn.

247
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,520
Some day I'm going to catch you
without all that hardware.

248
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,760
Some day, you won't need to belly
stick yourself, I'll catch you.

249
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:17,560
Well My luck's changing.

250
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,240
Make a fist.

251
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,400
Can't you even make a fist?

252
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,880
Hell, you think I'm going to hit a
man who can't even make a fist?

253
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,200
You think you can do that again?

254
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
Oh, most certainly.

255
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,040
Looks to me like you're getting tired.

256
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,440
I'll tell you what, we'll call it a draw.

257
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,960
Beautiful.

258
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,760
Beautiful?

259
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,760
The horses.

260
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes.

261
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Yah, yah, toro, toro.

262
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,840
Five, six, seven Gauche must have
paid them off and gone alone.

263
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,640
What does he say?

264
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,160
He wants the old man to tell him
where he's hidden his daughters.

265
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
He's not telling.

266
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,440
Brave man.

267
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
Stupid man.

268
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,600
Come on, let's get ourselves some horses.

269
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Wait Wait.

270
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,680
Now we're even Only I'm a
little even more even than you.

271
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,000
All right now, this is a horse
This is the front, this is the back.

272
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,680
And this is where you sit, if you want
to go this way, you pull that way,

273
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,600
if you want to go that way you pull that
way, if you want to go straight ahead,

274
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
you kick the horse and hang on All right?

275
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,040
Thank you.

276
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,520
Horse not so good, I see you took
the best one for yourself.

277
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,520
Wait.

278
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Hey you Here.

279
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,000
Now where?

280
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
I go this way, you got a choice
of three other directions.

281
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,480
I go with you.

282
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,000
Not any more you don't, I'm equipt.

283
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,360
I cannot find the man alone
I must succeed.

284
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,400
Karoda, that's your problem.

285
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm concerned about a fortune,
that money is mine, I stole it.

286
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,840
The money means nothing
This is life and death.

287
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,920
Well, it seems like the only thing
we have in common is Gauche.

288
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,960
But I'll bargain with you You give me your word
you let him live until I find the gold.

289
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,360
You can trail along.

290
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,600
No, he killed the Namaro, he dies
the first minute I see him.

291
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,000
You can suite yourself.

292
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,640
Your word you let Gauche live.

293
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,600
No.

294
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,160
All right, I'm going to drown you, you stubborn
mule, I'll hold you under until you bust.

295
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Your word.

296
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,240
All right you, pest.

297
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,360
Oh, hell.

298
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,080
Well, if nothing else, I got myself a bath.

299
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,800
You sure are one unreasonable man.

300
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,480
All this hassle over a hunk of metal.

301
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,160
Hell, you know when I catch up with Gauche,

302
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,240
I could buy you another sword,
I can buy you fifty swords.

303
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:29,000
Samurai knife is service, Kodo Bushido
says, be strong, have courage,

304
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,440
sacrifice yourself for your master
My father was a Samurai.

305
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:43,400
His father, his, his, his Four
hundred years, all died fighting.

306
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,840
There is great honor in my family.

307
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,840
Yeah well, these days, a lot of
people have peculiar ideas.

308
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,520
There's no need to strain yourself.

309
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,920
Men needs ideals to live by.

310
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,280
You can't spend ideals.

311
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,480
But now, all is changed.

312
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,480
Japan has big wars, big Lords,
has become different country.

313
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,440
Soon a great nation like yours,

314
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,200
then Samurai life will finish.

315
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,600
All must give up swords Become
farmers, fisherman, become nothing,

316
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,760
so I must succeed One last time,
my master service.

317
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,960
Well, it just might be.

318
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,000
You understand, if I see you're going
to kill Gauche, I've just got to kill you.

319
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,600
I understand you must try.

320
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,040
A lot of Gauche's men here, but no Gauche.

321
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,400
Well, this does it.

322
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm not going to keep chasing
tracks with the Comanche's on the prowl.

323
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,120
Comanches?

324
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,400
Yeah.

325
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,520
Where are we going?

326
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,800
We're going to San Lucas.

327
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,240
But you said they would not go there.

328
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Well, I figure Gauche will
show up there sooner or later.

329
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,320
Why?

330
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,680
For the best of reasons,
her name is Christina.

331
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,480
We'll wait a little.

332
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,480
That's very nice, you're mighty generous.

333
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,720
Yeah.

334
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,040
Thank you.

335
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,800
It was lovely.

336
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,480
Thank you very much
I sure like it here.

337
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Good night senorita, good night
I'll be back real soon.

338
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,200
Yes, I do hope...

339
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,480
Real nice place you got here.

340
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:24,920
Yes.

341
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,840
Yeah Good night.

342
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,320
Good night, Mr Fring, and do come back.

343
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,240
Madre dios.

344
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,080
Buenos Noches Pepita.

345
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,880
It's along time from the well.

346
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,720
I know, I know, I know Say hello
to my friend, but very quietly.

347
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,280
Pepita, who's in the building?

348
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,400
Pogo Carmelita Maria and
a few new girls.

349
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,240
Christina?

350
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:39,920
Yes.

351
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,880
Is Gauche with her?

352
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,080
Oh no, no, no, he's not here.

353
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,400
Has he been?

354
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,120
Yes, but ten days ago, with you.

355
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,360
What about Mace, Miguel, Hyatt?

356
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,280
Nobody's been here, not
even many customers.

357
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,840
Senorina, My God.

358
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
You can relax, Pogo He's
friendly but for now.

359
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,840
But Senior Link, you are killed.

360
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,440
Oh, who said?

361
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,600
Everybody, the news is all over.

362
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,480
And how was I killed?

363
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,400
Oh, very bravely, Senior Link.

364
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,200
One hundred soldiers chase you,
bang, bang, bang, you killed ten, twenty.

365
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,160
Fifty maybe.

366
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,040
Easily Only kill you because
you run out of bullets.

367
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,440
Sounds about right.

368
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,160
Oh, yes.

369
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,840
Pogo, come here, you stay here tonight.

370
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:44,600
You try to run away or talk to the Sheriff
or anybody else, he will cut off your ears.

371
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,800
Comprende?

372
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,080
Oh, si senior I am your friend,
yours too, excellencia.

373
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,000
Okay now, you make sure all the
windows and doors are locked.

374
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,280
Then bring some food.

375
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,280
Oh, si senior, pronto, and, and enjoy
the hospitality of the Hotel Maxim.

376
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,040
Buenos Noches Maria.

377
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,360
Buenos Noches Senior Link.

378
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
Senoritas.

379
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,920
Where is Christina?

380
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,280
Upstairs in bed.

381
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,040
Who with?

382
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,760
Oh, why you're crazy, she only sees Gauche.

383
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,880
I know, I know True love, like us?

384
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,600
Christina.

385
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,200
Yes?

386
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,640
Someone to see you.

387
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,840
Who is it?

388
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,920
Can't you guess?

389
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,320
Thought you'd be happy to see me.

390
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,560
What do you want?

391
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,840
To be near you, what else would a man want?

392
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,880
Oh, that Gauche, he's got a lot of style.

393
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,680
Take your dirty hands off that.

394
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,080
He knows how to treat a lady.

395
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,280
Much younger than me, too.

396
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,480
Better looking and a hell of a lot richer.

397
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,040
Can imagine what you see in him.

398
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,120
When do you expect him?

399
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,400
When he gets here.

400
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,880
And when is that?

401
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,880
When he feels like it.

402
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,680
Oh, that shouldn't be too long
then, should it?

403
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,080
If you want to know, it's been
ten days Along time for a man.

404
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,640
Christina, because of my fond
memories of you, and because

405
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,760
I know you have a fine practical sense,
I'll bargain with you.

406
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,760
You help me find where Gauche hid the
friends of this big golden eagle,

407
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,880
and I'll see that you get a hefty share.

408
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,760
My mistake.

410
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,640
And you make plenty of them.

411
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,480
Yep So it seems.

412
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:50,520
What are you doing? You bastard,
open the door, open the door Bastard.

413
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:01,120
Let me go You dirty son of a bitch,
you lousy broken down gun fighter.

414
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,920
Oh, hey, hey Stop that.

415
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,800
I'll get you Stop it,
stop it I tell you There.

416
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,880
Then we left the trail and
came straight on here.

417
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,440
I figured Gauche would show
up sooner or later.

418
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,240
More tortillas?

419
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,880
No Maria.

420
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,560
How long do we stay?

421
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,480
Depends, on when old Gauche gets the itch.

422
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,680
Well, I've got it right now.

423
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,840
I'm going to scratch
it for you shortly.

424
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,360
Three days to go
I don't have much time.

425
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,320
Maybe you ought to,
make the most of what you got.

426
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,680
This is Polkie, smells like horse
sweat but it don't taste so bad.

427
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,280
The idea is to drink it right down.

428
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,560
Tastes like horse sweat too, I think.

429
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,160
Come on Maria, give them some more.

430
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,800
Ikodo Boshido has said that.

431
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,720
Man with big stomach is
man with small mind.

432
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,120
Oh, is that so?

433
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,720
You have one more.

434
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,520
I intend to.

435
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,440
And one more, Maria.

436
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,480
What's does Ikodo Boshido think
on something like that?

437
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,280
Think you can handle it?

438
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,040
Come.

439
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:19,720
There you are Enjoy yourself senior, and
enjoy the hospitality of the, Hotel Maxim.

440
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,720

sold me here last month.

441
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,280
I am sorry, I am not one of great
experience yet Besides, I am afraid.

442
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,440
No, first you undress me.

443
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,360
Good night girls, see you in the morning.

444
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,240

445

446
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,080
Guess that's it for the night
Might as well go home to my husband.

447
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,120
Wait a minute I want to take
just a little peek.

448
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:11,560
You are very beautiful, Senior Your skin,
is almost the same color as mine, see.

449
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,600
I think he was trying to
tell me something.

450
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,840

Hey, do you always shoot
your bed partner in the morning?

454
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,320
Well it depends on how good she was.

455

01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,040
Now you tell Gauche, the gold and the
Japanese sword in exchange for that.

482
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,400
You son of a bitch, Gauche catches you...

483
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,600
That's why you didn't finish me off?

484
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,160
That's right You tell him
tomorrow noon at the old mission.

485
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,880
What about you, any
messages you want delivered.

486
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,520
You hear that? She says life won't be
worth living until she sees him again.

487
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,680
You think you can remember all that?

488
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,400
Yeah, and I'll remember to tell
him to leave you for me.

489
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,600
You do that Move out.

490
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,680
The mission, how far?

491
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,240
A day's ride over that snow.

492
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,880
You're a disgrace to
your mother's rotten pigs.

493
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,280
When Gauche is finished with you,
I pray to God that he sends you to hell.

494
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,080
Well that's a very religious girl.

495
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,120
You bastard.

496
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,280
You like this?

497
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,320
Makes me think of Japan.

498
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,480
It must be very beautiful there.

499
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,840
Yes, it is.

500
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,480
This man, Gauche.

501
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,800
What about him?

502
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,280
What about him?

503
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,840
All I know is he was a
gambler in New Orleans,

504
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,080
and that he deals cards with his left hand,
shoots a gun with his left hand.

505
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,360
Le Man Gauche they call him,
it's as good a name as any.

506
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,200
But why do you want to kill him?

507
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,960
Not like that, let me have it.

508
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,480
The Japanese, where did you find him?

509
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,760
On the train, when someone
killed his friend Guess who?

510
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,160
Gauche will kill you, too.

511
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,120
Well, we'll see about that.

512
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,760
You know, if you have been different to me
If you had shown me a little respect.

513
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,120
You mean like the Frenchman?

514
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,200
He cares for me All you ever
cared about is yourself.

515
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,120
Well, that makes you and me the same.

516
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:39,320
Christina, you're a whore, you've
always been one, you'll always be one.

517
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,160
You always did know how to
speak to a woman.

518
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,760
My offer still holds You help me with Gauche,
you'll get a fair share of the loot.

519
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,040
How much?

520
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Enough to move you away from San Lucas,

521
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,720
and let you live anywhere
you want anywhere else.

522
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,240
But don't you take too
long making up your mind,

523
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,280
because I'm going to
change mine pretty soon.

524
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,920
Give me my clothes.

525
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,960
I'll give you your clothes, but first I want your word
of honor that you won't kill Gauche on sight.

526
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,440
My clothes.

527
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,840
Your word.

528
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,320
Don't know what the hell that's all about,

529
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,440
but it sounds like it's
coming from the heart.

530
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,840
Well?

531
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,000
Give me five minutes with him.

532
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,040
Not enough.

533
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,720
One hour Give me one full hour.

534
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,480
I need one full day.

535
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,960
Karoda, I need the time to make
Gauche to take me to the cash.

536
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,560
I want to be sure it's there.

537
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,360
No.

538
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,640
All right, you suit yourself.

539
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,800
Turning blue.

540
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,000
Won't be long you won't be nothing
but a clump of ice, by nightfall

541
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,320
you'll be frozen into the landscape and you'll
never avenge your friend or never get your sword.

542
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,880
You're going to end up in Japanese hell,
a disgrace to your ancestors.

543
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:23,560
You have my word, I will not
kill the man until you say.

544
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,680
Don't take it so hard, I think
you're one hell of a man.

545
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,520
I think you are one son of a bitch.

546
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,800
Senior Gauche Senior Gauche.

547
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,640
They all meet you Senior,
they'll be there tomorrow By noon.

548
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,640
Hey, what happened to the others?

549
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,280
Where's Mace, where's Pepi?

550
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,200
Gauche, Link's still alive.

551
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,120
Oh, that's too damn bad for him.

552
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,920
He's got one of the Japanese with him
A real tough son of a bitch.

553
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,720
Sure, but they all die the same way.

554
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,080
Okay, I, I didn't
want to have to tell you They got the girl.

555
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,880
Who?

556
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,520
Christina, Miss Christina, I mean.

557
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,240
Hyatt, how is it you're
the only one that got away?

558
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,720
Yeah, tell us Lost your voice?

559
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,480
Hurry, come on.

560
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,280
Okay, okay, take it easy.

561
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:27,960
Horses.

562
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,040
Hey the sword.

563
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,040
Don't forget the sword.

564
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,200
The villagers that were here had a
choice, run or fight Looks like they ran.

565
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,120
From what?

566
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,400
Comanches,
they came over the mountain, too.

567
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,200
What are we going to do?

568
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,880
Well, the Comanches would have
taken what they wanted,

569
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,760
so I guess this place is
as safe as any other.

570
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,040
And if I remember right, you're
along ways from being a good cook.

571
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,120
You get busy anyhow.

572
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,320
Why should I, you get busy?

573
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,400
You cook, you eat I cook,
you get whipped and go to bed hungry.

574
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:42,200
The thing I like about you Link, the older
you get the sweeter you get, too Ohhh.

575
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,080
What about a little Pokie,
I feel like loosening up a bit.

576
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,920
No Important day tomorrow
I want a clear head.

577
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,600
Yeah well, that's what
I'm about to do Clear my head.

578
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,160
I will see to the horses.

579
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:09,480
I can't go back to Pepita's place
I won't I need a chance in life.

580
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,280
I can't go on like this forever.

581
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,280
No, I guess you can't
Dark season gunman.

582
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,360
Always some one new to come
along to take our place.

583
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:26,280
All right then
I'll help you with Gauche.

584
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,160
I thought he cared for you,
gave you all sorts of respect.

585
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:40,520
But he's not you, nobody is
I'll go along with you, anyway you want.

586
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,680
Is that so?

587
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,640
All right, get your clothes off.

588
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,240
Now I take off yours.

589
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,480
Leave Gauche for you.

590
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,560
You fool, he outsmarted you,
you'll never get that money.

591
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:26,240
Don't move, I'll kill you,
I swear I'll kill you.

592
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,600
That's Christina for you, never know
which gun she's going to reach for.

593
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,000
Shit.

594
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,280
You all right?

595
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,520
Yeah, no hurry, she's
headed in the right direction.

596
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:45,880
Christina Christina Come back.

597
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,880
Gauche Gauche.

598
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:04,440
Christina, come back, Christina.

599
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,080
We must move out.

600
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,440
What the hell are you talking about,
and leave her with those..

601
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,440
All right, let's go.

602
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,040
Take your hands off me
Leave me, leave me, let me go.

603
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:46,640
Leave me, leave me Get off Oh God, help.

604
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,880
No, no, I can't Oh No, help, help.

605
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:23,760
No, no, no, no, no no Help Help,
no, no, Help me, help.

606
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:52,960
That's wet rawhide While it's drying,
she'll slowly be choked to death.

607
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,560
Get back.

608
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,520
Thanks.

609
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,240
Oh no, that band is so tight
you just might cut her throat.

610
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,640
You all right?

611
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,760
Well, you cost us about two hours
already, let's get out of here.

612
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,360
My God.

613
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,480
Comanches, again?

614
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,920
Yeah, they get around.

615
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,560
So damned many tracks around here,

616
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,960
you can't tell who's come or gone.

617
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
But who's hidden over there
waiting for us to show?

618
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,160
I go first.

619
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:31,760
No, I'll go with her, you hang
back until I call you in.

620
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,600
Sure wish you could use one of these.

621
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,600
No need.

622
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,560
Yes, there's a need Maybe
some day I'll teach you.

623
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,960
When your swords hanging in the White
House and I'm so rich it's disgusting.

624
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,800
Well, if old Gauche is in there, you're going
to find out right now how much he loves you.

625
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,920
Well, I guess we just wait.

626
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,080
What for?

627
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
Throw it, Link.

628
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,720
You, what's your name?

629
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,520
Karoda Juri.

630
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:30,120
Well Karoda, looks like you found me
You still intend to see me dead?

631
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,120
It's possible.

632
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,800
Just because I'm the nervous type,
the knives, put them out of reach.

633
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,560
Check under his robe.

634
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,520
Madre mia, look at this arsenal.

635
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:20,480
Gauche, they saved my life I, I tried to
escape but the Comanches caught me, and..

636
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:28,400
Oh yeah? Thanks, Link
What can I do for you?

637
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,200
Well, you can give my friend
here his sword,

638
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:39,160
tell me where the gold is hid, and then
you can take a high dive in a low well.

639
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:47,160
Yeah, that's what I thought Hyatt wants
you for himself You got a preference?

640
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,880
Please, you can't let him do it,
you can't Please, Gauche.

641
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:51,840
Hyatt.

642
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,520
Come on, Link, you're coming with me.

643
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,560
Give me the sword.

644
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,440
Boss, boss The sword, he wants the sword.

645
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,280
What the hell, give him
the God damned thing.

646
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,680
Thank you.

647
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:04,800
You all right?

648
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,600
Don't worry.

649
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:14,040
Well, I figure they'll either
burn us out or wait us out.

650
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,480
What did you do with your horses?

651
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,680
Hid on the way up in the
cane brake.

652
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,920
Well now, that wasn't very
damned smart.

653
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,760
They won't do anybody good
except the Comanches.

654
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,800
What do you suggest?

655
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,160
Gauche, I suggest you stay alive, I don't
care how you do it, but you stay alive.

656
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,480
Unless of course, you want to
tell me right now where you hid the gold.

657
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:57,440
Well, when the time comes, I'm going to have to
beat it out of you, and that's all right, too.

658
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,640
What do you think?

659
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,320
Yeah.

660
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,840
Hey, over here.

661
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,880
Hyatt's dead, so is Shadow.

662
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,200
Yeah, the next thing that
they'll do is set fire to this cane.

663
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,040
You think you can chop a fire break?

664
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,520
Yeah.

665
01:39:59,080 --> 01:39:59,800
Get back.

666
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,400
Link.

667
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,040
Help.

668
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:20,040
Well Link,
I'm still alive Let's get back to business.

669
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,040
Kill him.

670
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,360
No, no Link, you're not going to shoot me.

671
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,680
Cause if you kill me, you'll never
find the money.

672
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:02,320
I know you too well, Link A quarter of a million
dollars to be shared between you and me,

673
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,960
you don't throw away that sort of
money You're too clever for that.

674
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:13,840
Tell you what, the money, you can
have the lot The whole quarter...

675
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,680
No, Gauche You keep it.

676
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:41,720
You bastard, you stupid bastard.

677
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:49,440
She say it Stupid No need to do that.

678
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,400
You're wrong, great need.

679
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:05,000
The sword All for nothing.

680
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,800
Wrong again, because I'm going to
see that that sword gets safely back.

681
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:17,440
That's stupid Bad You close to border
They catch you, hang you.

682
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:24,400
Listen, you believe that,
you believe anything.

683
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:29,800
You do this for me? You take it back?

684
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,480
Sure Hell, I ain't
got nothing else to do.

685
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,800
All right.

686
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,320
Here, I'll do it, I'll do it.

687
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,440
What?

688
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,800
So, everything is good.

689
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:09,840
Yeah, that, that's right.

690
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,400
You'll never find the money, Link.

691
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:48,160
Oh, I know you, you'll keep on looking.

692
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,800
But it won't do you any good.

693
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,720
There is no one alive who
knows where Gauche hid it.

694
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,600
Except...

695
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,280
I've heard him talking,
once about something,

696
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,120
and he stopped to pick up something.

697
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:07,120
Something in small bags that clinked.

698
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,000
If you want, we could team up together.

699
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,720
Well, It's an idea.

700
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,040
Then you'll take me with you?

701
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:20,720
Sure.

702
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,640
Oh good, that's wonderful.

703
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,080
But only as far as San Lucas.

704
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,040
Oh, you bastard.

705
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,880
Now that's the Christina
I'll always like to remember.
