1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,900
<i>Thirty seconds and counting.
Power transfer is complete.</i>

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,980
<i>We're on internal power with
the launch vehicle at this time.</i>

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,180
<i>T minus 20 seconds and counting. All
the second-stage tanks now pressurised.</i>

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,540
<i>T minus 15 seconds.
Guidance is internal.</i>

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>Twelve, eleven,
ten, 9...</i>

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,060
<i>Ignition
sequence starts.</i>

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>Six, five, four,
three, two, one, zero.</i>

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,740
<i>All engines
running.</i>

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,900
<i>Lift off! We
have a lift off.</i>

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,020
<i>And so in 1972,</i>

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,460
<i>the Atlas Centaur rocket
blasted off from our planet,</i>

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,620
<i>a 4-stage rocket that launched a probe
way out into the blackness of space.</i>

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,180
<i>The probe would use the
energy from the sun and the</i>

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,740
<i>gravitational pull of our neighbouring
planets to cross our solar system.</i>

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,900
<i>That momentum would then carry it on into
the farthest reaches of the universe.</i>

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>The mission, to find
intelligent life similar to ours</i>

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,060
<i>out there in
deep space.</i>

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,220
<i>The probe carried a tablet
which had inscribed on it the</i>

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,060
<i>image of us humans, a man and a woman,
and a map to locate us in the universe.</i>

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,060
<i>Stage four disconnects and our
probe is fired on its long journey.</i>

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>The world wished
it bon voyage</i>

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,934
<i>and may it find a friend
out there in deep space.</i>

23
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,900
Thank you so much. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,159
Hey! Thank you very much. Thank
you. Thank you, nice to see you.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen.

26
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,460
When I interviewed Neil
Clarke for The Book Programme,

27
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,740
I knew he was
extraordinary.

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,540
Now, with the publication
of his brilliant novel,

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,260
reviewers agree he's joined the
ranks of Britain's immortals.

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,901
Ladies and gentlemen,
Neil Clarke.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,380
Um, so I suppose I wanted
to start off by asking you

32
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,340
how did you manage such amazing
insight into the soul of modern man

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,700
and how do you know what
men and women really want,

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,640
just really the whole relationship
between humanity and the cosmos?

35
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, well, I think
I probably achieved

36
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,580
that by looking into
my own soul, Catherine.

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,260
Um, I studied its flaws, its
potential, its urgent needs.

38
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,300
I listened to its
cries for help...

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,660
...and its yelps of
anguish and, um, I...

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,260
I spent five long
years in a book

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,740
which I hoped would throw open
the doors of human perception

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,020
and allow us to be engulfed in
a sense of our own futility.

43
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,704
Sorry about
this, it's...

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go watch TV.

45
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,140
Your dog
is barking.

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,980
My dog was barking because
you rang the doorbell.

47
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,460
I rang the doorbell because
your dog was barking.

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,660
-Your lease says no pets.
-Well, he is a guide dog.

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,260
-You're not blind. -I prefer the
term "optically challenged".

50
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,180
You're not optically
challenged, either.

51
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,700
Fiona, you live, like, three
floors up. I mean, I don't...

52
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,740
If you don't control
your bloody dog,

53
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,460
I am going to get it sent
to Battersea Dogs Home.

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,180
-Right? Hmm?
-All right.

55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,500
Come on, Dennis, let's go
and evacuate your bowels.

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,940
Come on, Dennis.

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,580
-Hi, Neil.
-Hi, Catherine.

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,900
Hey, it's funny, I was
just dreaming about you.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,900
-Really? -Yeah, you were presenting
me with an award for my novel.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,620
-Oh, did you deserve it?
-Well, I was proud but humble.

61
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,380
-Have you finished it, actually, in
real life? -Absolutely, almost, yeah.

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,100
Cos last spring you
were on chapter...

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,780
-Yeah, I've renumbered them. In
fact, I've removed them. -Oh. -Yeah.

64
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,540
I find the whole concept of
chapters just gets in the way so...

65
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,100
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I can see that.

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,180
I want reading it to be like being
sucked into a giant vortex, you know.

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,540
-Like going on Facebook. -Like
Facebook, yeah. That's a good one.

68
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,060
"Like being sucked
into a giant vortex."

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,620
Dennis, why do you let me
say things like this, hey?

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,180
Come on.

71
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,920
Come on, Ray.
It's only 20 quid.

72
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,340
-No, I can't, Neil. -Yeah,
but it can't lose. -No.

73
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,660
I guarantee you a 50% return on your
money before the end of classes today.

74
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,860
So when do you make your move on
Miss Booker Prize downstairs, then?

75
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,700
Oh, I don't. Turns out she's a
bit literal-minded, no foresight.

76
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,860
Whereas me, I can see for
miles into the future.

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,000
A man needs a
woman, Neil.

78
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,060
-I've got Dennis.
-Dennis is male.

79
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,340
And he's a dog, in case
you hadn't noticed.

80
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,740
Yeah, well, I don't want
to complicate my life.

81
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,020
This is a tenner!

82
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,494
Walk!

83
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,580
Earth!

84
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,755
Accessing representative
images of earthlings.

85
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,900
Communication will be carried on in the
language of the species to be judged.

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,900
-I'm sorry, I'm not understanding.
-[speaking in French]

87
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,980
-Is that better, Kylie?
-Understanding you now, Sharon.

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,620
By the power invested in me by the
Intergalactic Council of Superior Species,

89
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,220
I hereby pronounce a destruction
order on the planet Earth.

90
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,620
With great respect, Sharon, we should
not pronounce a destruction order

91
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,500
before we've given these earthlings
a chance to prove themselves.

92
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,140
-They've penetrated intergalactic
space. -Maureen is right.

93
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,300
They're clearly not
a superior species.

94
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Look at the way
they copulate.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,300
If these earthlings can convince
us that they are superior beings,

96
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,340
then they may join our society. If
they cannot, we must eliminate them,

97
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,860
for the moral well-being of the
entire Intergalactic Community.

98
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,740
-Thank you for explaining it to me,
Sharon. -Not at all, Miss Barker.

99
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,580
No, Grant, I don't want to talk to you.
No, I don't want to see you, either.

100
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,913
We had a great time
last summer but it's over.

101
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:21,580
What part of over
do you not understand?

102
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,620
Thank you for
calling. Goodbye.

103
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,380
These questions of yours make it sound
as if I thought this bloody author

104
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,460
-can string two words together.
-But he can. It's a wonderful book.

105
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,180
Darling, didn't you read the memo?
We're doing a demolition job.

106
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,860
But it's the best thing he's
ever written. Everyone says so.

107
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,020
That's why we have to pee
on it from a great height.

108
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,843
I want ten new questions,
please, before noon.

109
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,900
Don't you know? She never reads
the books. She hates books.

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,580
Why is she presenting
a book programme, then?

111
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,400
I spy trouble.
Just...

112
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,620
Look, Catherine,

113
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,500
you may despise her ego, but
that's what people tune in to see.

114
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,180
Not books, not
authors, God forbid,

115
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,700
but Fenella's rampant,
pulsating, sexually arousing ego.

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,740
No, I think people watch because it's
a book programme and they love books.

117
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,940
Books are
finished.

118
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,940
Our job is to provide scandal,
gossip and character assassination,

119
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,100
with a thin veneer of
literary respectability.

120
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,335
-Oh, so we're not just selling out,
then? We've sold out? -Exactly.

121
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:34,157
For God's
sake, smile.

122
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,900
It's enough to make
you weep, isn't it?

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,200
-What? -The price of pickles. Don't
even look at the marinated herring.

124
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,222
-Honestly, you'd be suicidal.
-I didn't want them, anyway.

125
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,820
Thanks.

126
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,380
I also offer support and counselling
on dips, dried fruit and pasta sauces.

127
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,954
She's gone.

128
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,900
-The usual test, Sharon?
-The usual test, Kylie.

129
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,820
One earthling will
be chosen randomly,

130
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,380
as defined by the Intergalactic
Manual of Good and Evil.

131
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,780
-Page 56, paragraph B.
-Uh, page 56, paragraph D.

132
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,900
Uh, right.

133
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,980
To prove that they understand the
difference between good and evil.

134
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,000
How will they
prove it?

135
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,380
They will be given the power
that all superior beings have.

136
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,900
The earthling will be capable
of doing absolutely anything.

137
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,620
What if he uses
his power for evil?

138
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,220
The Earth will
be eliminated.

139
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
But if he uses
it for good?

140
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,060
Then we welcome them to the
Intergalactic Community.

141
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,120
Are we ready,
gentlemen?

142
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,660
<i>Commencing random
selection of earthlings.</i>

143
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,159
<i>Processing...
Processing...</i>

144
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,860
<i>-Earthling.</i>
-Jolly good!

145
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,060
-Wait!
<i>-Selected.</i>

146
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,919
The earthling has ten
days to prove he can use

147
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,884
absolute power for good
rather than for evil.

148
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,935
God.

149
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,175
Screw you!

150
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,278
All they want me to
do is help them sneer

151
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,300
at people who
write wonderful books.

152
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,580
Well, my producer just wants me
to dig up dirt on Amenhotep III.

153
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,940
I keep telling them
he had a kind nature

154
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,980
and lovely hands.

155
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,100
I would have loved to spend
an evening with Amenhotep III.

156
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,980
Yeah, except he's been
dead 4,000 years, Rosie,

157
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,060
and he'd spend all day long
talking about embalming.

158
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,900
-Well, find me a good one that's
still breathing. -Tell me about it.

159
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,740
-What about Grant? -Oh, well, Colonel
Grant turned out to have issues.

160
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,900
-Issues? -Yeah, like
being clinically insane.

161
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,940
-Shame. -Maybe that's
overstating it.

162
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,500
Uh, just obsessive, possessive
and pathologically jealous.

163
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,500
-What about him upstairs? -Oh, he tried
to cheer me up in the supermarket.

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,780
-Oh, so he's
gay? -What?

165
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,040
Well, he's sympathetic,
interested, available.

166
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:10,003
-That's the way life works. -No,
he's not gay. He's... very likeable.

167
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,660
-Mr Clarke.
-Hi.

168
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,780
This is the twelfth time you've
been late this month, Mr Clarke.

169
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,500
-Yeah, I got knocked off my bike.
-Yesterday you had food poisoning.

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,560
Friday you thought
it was Saturday.

171
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,220
-Monday you forgot to put your clock
forward. -Oh, everybody does that.

172
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,180
Week last Wednesday it seems you had
an appointment with the Dalai Lama.

173
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,380
-Yeah, I showed you the picture. -That
had Michael Jackson in it as well.

174
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,440
Well, he's
a great man.

175
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Great enough to appear in
photographs when he's dead.

176
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,220
You, Mr Clarke, are
totally irresponsible,

177
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,700
you are idle and
you are feckless.

178
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,980
-Feckless? -Yes, you
are without feck.

179
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,974
If I could replace
you, I would.

180
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,440
Yeah, well, so would I. I just don't
have anybody to replace me with.

181
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,300
Hello, gorgeous.

182
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,180
How about cocktails for two
this evening? Go halves?

183
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,900
-Drop dead, Ray. -All right.
Think about it and get back to me.

184
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,620
-Knob.
-Neil? -Yeah.

185
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,980
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

186
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,580
Hello, Neil, love. Tinned mouse
or fricassee of war victim?

187
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,440
-I will have the roast headmaster,
please, Mrs B. -You are a one.

188
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,260
-There you go.
-Thank you.

189
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,743
Uh, I'll have the
casserole, please, Mrs B.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,597
You'll enjoy that, Mr Ray.
As long as you don't eat it.

191
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,100
No, I mean, if you could make anything
you want happen, what would it be?

192
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,002
I would make Dennis regurgitate
my notes from chapter three.

193
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,202
-If you could make something
impossible happen. -Intact.

194
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,340
What if you could make someone
worship the ground you walked on?

195
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,400
What, even if she thought
you were a little shit?

196
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,220
Come on, Ray. That would be taking an
unfair advantage of an innocent girl.

197
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,180
But suppose there was one thing you
could do that would change your life

198
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,624
-for the better? -Oh, that's easy. I
would make alien spaceships destroy 10C.

199
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,783
That sounded like it
was in the school.

200
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,300
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Stand back. Stand back, stand back.

201
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,754
Now, just
stay calm.

202
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,840
Oh, my God!

203
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
Who was that?

204
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,140
It was the Salubrious
Gat of Galaxy G946 WOT.

205
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,460
-Gat, what do you think you're
doing? -Just practising, Sharon.

206
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,180
We haven't done the judicial review yet.
We may not want to destroy this species.

207
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Who are you
kidding?

208
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,940
445,349,722 new alien
species encountered.

209
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,418
Number granted membership
of the Intergalactic

210
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:11,220
Community of
Superior Beings? Zero.

211
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,380
-We have high standards. -You know
you're going to wipe them out.

212
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,201
It all depends
on the earthling.

213
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:21,301
<i>And signs of a recovery
seem as far away as ever.</i>

214
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,060
Hey. Hello,
Dennis.

215
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,980
Oh, Dennis. Couldn't
you have waited?

216
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,752
<i>We can now go live to
our reporter Brenda Emmanus</i>

217
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:39,220
<i>at the scene
of the incident.</i>

218
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,999
<i>It was here at Kinbrook
Comprehensive School</i>

219
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,140
<i>that an explosion
killed 38 pupils.</i>

220
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,100
<i>A police spokesman said they could
not rule out a terrorist attack</i>

221
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>but say there were no connections with
reports of a UFO sighting in the area.</i>

222
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
<i>The head
teacher Mr. Ro...</i>

223
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,900
Oh, sure, Dennis, it
was an alien spaceship.

224
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,980
What are you
talking about?

225
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,060
If I could make an alien
spaceship destroy 10C,

226
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,540
then I wouldn't be farting
around with this, would I?

227
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,100
I'd just say, "Dog mess,
clean yourself up."

228
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,460
See?

229
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,700
It's just shock.

230
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,681
It's just post-hallucination
shock. That's all it is.

231
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:01,748
I mean, it couldn't have been
an alien spaceship, Dennis, could it?

232
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:05,860
I mean, it just,
I mean, it couldn't have.

233
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,559
Oh, my God.

234
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,140
That's my notes.

235
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,534
Ah, damn it!

236
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,820
Whisky, go back
in the bottle.

237
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,140
See? You see? There's
nothing. It's nothing.

238
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,516
There was nothing. It's nothing.
Whisky, go back in the bottle.

239
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,140
Oh, my God.

240
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,576
I have to
wave my hand.

241
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,500
Whisky, exchange yourself for
another bottle, a single malt.

242
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,994
Hey, come back!

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,820
Door, open quick.

244
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,420
Not that quick.

245
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:39,037
I didn't mean go back to
the shop to get exchanged!

246
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,264
It's closed.

247
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,080
Oh, shit.

248
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,900
-Gotcha! -Help
me, Dennis! -Gotcha!

249
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,421
-Priority.
-Help me!

250
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,014
Shh, Dennis, be
quiet. Oh, shit.

251
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,735
All right, laddie.
You're nicked.

252
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,575
Me be at home having
dinner with Dennis.

253
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,462
Oh, yuck! Chumzy!

254
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:46,457
You say one word about this, Constable,
you'll be on community relations.

255
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,184
Oh, my God. 10C!

256
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,174
Uh, let everyone who
died be alive again.

257
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,220
Oh, God. Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

258
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,660
No, I meant everybody
in 10C be alive again!

259
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,562
Obviously. Not everyone who's
died ever. Are you crazy?

260
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Shit. Shit.

261
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,234
And everybody who
died in the bomb blast

262
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,060
that is alive again,
be completely uninjured.

263
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,220
Oh, shit,
shit, shit!

264
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,860
Uh, okay, me feel better.
Oh, that's better.

265
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,740
Me have a really good idea
about what to do next.

266
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,460
Oh, that's a good idea. Um, let
the explosion never have happened.

267
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,940
No, I mean, if you could make anything
you wanted happen, what would it be?

268
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm sorry, what?

269
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,740
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

270
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,980
That's very weird. I think
I just dreamt that I could.

271
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,200
-What? -Do
anything.

272
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,658
I dreamt that I
could just wave my hand

273
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:20,220
and say such-and-such
and it would happen.

274
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,500
-So what did you do? -I made
alien spaceships destroy 10C.

275
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,660
Good thinking.

276
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,060
I would make Dorothy Pringle
worship the ground I walked on.

277
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,417
You wouldn't
be so cruel.

278

<i>whose latest novel is entitled</i>

286

<i>Mortimer, your last novel was
published nearly ten years ago.</i>

287
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>It got what they call "mixed reviews"

got nothing to do with his book.

Well, neither has
the show, Cath.

296
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,100
Listen, what upsets Fenella
about you is your integrity.

297
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,380
But me, I
quite like it.

298
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,500
Play your cards right, you
could get your own office

299
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,255
with a bigger
desk and a view.

300
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,340
Sorry. Excuse
me one second.

301
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,020
Mind you, you've gotta
play your cards right.

302
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,100
What the hell are
you doing here?

303
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,180
-Don't I get a kiss?
-Please go away.

304
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,220
That wouldn't be
fair to you, Cath.

305
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,380
This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to get to know the real me.

306
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,420
Well... I'm
calling security.

307
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,820
-No, not just the charming, high-flying
military strategist. -Hello, security?

308
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,060
Not the inventor of
extreme rendition, either.

309
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,460
Yes, I've got an
intruder in room 405.

310
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,380
Or the mastermind behind
warrantless domestic surveillance.

311
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,295
Just a humble officer
who adores you.

312
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,020
-Okay, Grant, I appreciate that
you like me... -Like? Like?

313
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,723
What do you think,
I'm one of these

314
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,700
cardboard cut-outs?
Like? No. No, no, no.

315
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,940
Adulate. Worship.

316
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,260
Okay, well, I don't adulate or worship
you. I don't even really like you.

317
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,220
So that's why I'm asking you to
just go away and leave me alone.

318
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,900
-So there's some hope? -No,
no, no. There's no hope.

319
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,956
Cath, I came all the way
to England to see you.

320
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:52,140
Doesn't that show you how
much I care about you?

321
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,503
No, it shows me
that you're obsessed.

322
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:57,660
-Obsession's not a quality
that I admire. -Really?

323
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,740
I think the lady wants
you to go, Colonel.

324
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,460
-You work for the
BBC, don't you? -I do.

325
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,900
You know who ultimately controls the
British Broadcasting Corporation?

326
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,860
A little guy that used to
work down the hall from me

327
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,940
at Fort Bragg,
North Carolina.

328
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,256
And he did it in
his spare time.

329
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,981
I'll catch you
later, honey.

330
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,700
It was a party. I was doing
a documentary. I was drunk.

331
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,124
Judging me.

332
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,140
Let 10C become a model
class, kind and considerate.

333
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,463
Oh, and eager
to learn.

334
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,940
-Good afternoon, 10C.
-Good afternoon, Mr Clarke.

335
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,500
Um, could you all turn to page 73,
please, and read the entire chapter?

336
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,580
-What, the whole
chapter? -Yes.

337
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,700
-Oh, good.
-How exciting!

338
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,660
-He's letting us read the
whole chapter! -Great.

339
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,384
Well, you get on
with it, then.

340
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,820
Let the headmaster be
nice to me for a change.

341
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,550
And what you did
with the guitar quite

342
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,580
beggars belief.
That is not how Kumbaya goes.

343
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,860
Neil. So good
to see you!

344
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,100
I love what you're wearing. It really
does, it's just a great ensemble.

345
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,160
So similar to what you
were wearing before.

346
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,047
But your laissez-faire
attitude to work is a

347
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,100
great counterpoint to my
by-the-book approach.

348
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,100
-Great having you on the staff,
Neil. -Thank you. -Right.

349
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,380
He must love you an awful lot
to fly across the Atlantic.

350
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,740
No, he just can't
bear losing anything.

351
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,535
As far as Grant's concerned,
I'm just a piece of lost

352
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:34,900
property he wants to retrieve
and put back on his mantelpiece.

353
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,180
He was really
scary. Crazy.

354
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,740
I had a boyfriend
like that once.

355
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,060
-The sort who wouldn't take no for
an answer. -Did you? What happened?

356
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,700
I married him.

357
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,500
Mr Eriksson, you know the romance
languages, French, Italian...

358
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,580
Yes, Miss Pringle,
I teach them.

359
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,805
Well, I was wondering
how they got their name?

360
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:56,700
It's to do with Rome,
ancient Rome.

361
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,940
It's from
the Latin.

362
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,820
So it's just a coincidence
that they sound so romantic?

363
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,642
Actually, I'm thinking of
switching to economics.

364
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,816
Let Miss Pringle
worship Ray.

365
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,739
Ray.

366
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,579
I can do abso-fucking-lutely
anything.

367
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,739
Me be President of
the United States.

368
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,060
-Thank God we found you, sir. -Sorry?
-We've been looking for you everywhere.

369
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,677
-Help! Help! Guns! They're
shooting! -Move, move, move! Move!

370
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,820
I am sorry about
that, Mr President.

371
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,940
Now, here are the briefing papers
for Syria, the deficit, Israel and

372
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,526
the Middle East, China,
global warming, unemployment

373
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:30,180
-and the Arctic Wildlife
Reserve. -They're shooting!

374
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,935
Me be my old
self at home!

375
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,662
I can do anything.

376
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,461
Okay, but what
do I really want?

377
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,803
Give me a
really big dick.

378
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,380
Ouch, not that
big, obviously!

379
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,101
Just... Dick, return
to the old size.

380
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,500
Okay, um... Let me have a
penis that women find exciting.

381
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,180
Yeah, it's good, yeah.
Can I have it in white?

382
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,700
Right, okay, um...

383
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,341
Let me have a
really great body.

384
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,900
No. Um, no, look, no, look,
give me the body of a great man.

385
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,380
What the fuck? Not
Albert Einstein.

386
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,545
Let me have the
great body of a man.

387
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,682
Me be able to see Catherine
from downstairs, now.

388
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,020
Shit.

389
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,163
Let me not be
able to see her.

390
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,260
No, I don't mean
me go blind.

391
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,923
Let me be able to see
but floor be as it was.

392
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,358
Uh, Catherine from downstairs,
forget what just happened.

393
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,980
You know earlier on we were talking
about being able to do anything?

394
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,940
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah,
well, um...

395
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,220
This is going to sound kind
of stupid but suddenly I can.

396
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,540
-Can what?
-Do anything.

397
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,591
Just make things happen.
Things that shouldn't

398
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:07,380
happen, I just wave
my hand and they do.

399
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,420
You feeling okay?

400
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,260
Yeah, um,
just look.

401
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,580
You, tell us
who you were.

402
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,895
You'll never believe this
but I was a conjuror!

403
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,860
I went by the name
of The Great Alfredo.

404
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,180
Real name was
Reg Hoskins.

405
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,020
I did variety, clubs,
private parties, the lot.

406
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,700
What is this? 3D projection
or something, right?

407
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,484
-Course, it's all gone now.
I blame the wogs. -Hey!

408
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:38,180
All that black minstrel stuff.
Once they started allowing that...

409
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,200
That's not me, that's
what I'm saying. It's...

410
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,980
Jews took over the business.
It was never the same again.

411
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,757
-Just go and jump out the
window. -Right-o. Watch this.

412
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,940
-How did you do
that? -I don't know.

413
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,220
I could swear it was
the skeleton talking.

414
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,960
-Yeah, it
was. -Okay.

415
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,300
-Let me see you do another one. -Well,
what? I can't think of anything.

416
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,660
Oh, come on. You know,
how about some flowers?

417
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,535
Bunch of flowers in
my hand. It's pathetic.

418
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,965
How about room
be covered in flowers?

419
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,620
Come on, Ray. Ray. Think of
something more imaginative.

420
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,460
Bloody hell, Palmer. Did you
just throw this out the window?

421
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,860
Neil. Did you throw
this out the window?

422
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,378
That's very funny.
What are you doing here?

423
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:39,780
Go on, get on home.
I'll cover for you.

424
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,740
Oh, my God.

425
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,020
-This is the best sandwich
I've ever tasted. -Told you.

426
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,540
You know what? We
could own a racehorse.

427
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,460
Ray, we could own every
racehorse in the world.

428
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,793
No shit.

429
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,700
-We win every time?
-They're all ours.

430
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,820
Let's forget about the horses.
We could have anything, Neil.

431
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,580
Wealth,
fame. Women.

432
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,740
We could make any woman
fall in love with us.

433
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,381
Neil, any
woman we want.

434
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,580
Jump in, babe.

435
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,980
Kerb crawling is illegal
in this country, Grant.

436
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,700
That doesn't really apply to
people with my security clearance.

437
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,860
-Besides, how else are you going
to get home? -On the Tube. Go away.

438
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,220
The London Underground is worse than
anything we ever did in Guantanamo.

439
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,020
-You don't deserve that. -No,
I don't deserve this, either.

440
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,580
-Please, leave me alone.
-Okay, okay, I get it.

441
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,740
-But you gotta let me down
gently, huh? -What does that mean?

442
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,598
Well, there's somebody
else, right?

443
00:37:53,698 --> 00:37:57,580
No, Grant, that's not
what this is about.

444
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,940
You and I are
not compatible.

445
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,220
So, we could grab some
coffee, sit and talk.

446
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,100
What would that even achieve?
There's nothing to talk about.

447
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,780
Except for the luxury
apartment I rented for us.

448
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,700
It's got a view of
St Paul's Cathedral.

449
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,660
Oh, my God. Go
home, Grant.

450
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,300
-Here's the key. -I don't want it.
-And when I get you up there,

451
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,518
you're going to think you
died and went to heaven.

452
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,700
Fuck all TV
producers.

453
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,500
Especially ones that say
you can sleep with them.

454
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,141
But if I play
my cards right.

455
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,580
Why do I always end up
with the control freaks?

456
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,700
-Or gays.
-Yeah.

457
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,500
-Who? -Him
upstairs.

458
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,780
Oh, honey,
he's not gay.

459
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,660
He's attractive.
He's kind.

460
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Well, then,
fuck him.

461
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,860
-No, he's nice. -No,
I don't mean <i>fuck him.</i>

462
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,854
I mean fuck him.

463
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,220
-You mean fuck
him? -Yeah.

464
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,100
-What, right now?
-No, not now.

465
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,299
You've got to let me
do your make-up first.

466
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,380
<i>Malfunction. Galactic
power failure.</i>

467
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,300
Bother, we'll have
to suspend the test.

468
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,460
-What? -This is on
the blink, Sharon.

469
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,220
The earthling won't have galactic
power until I get it working again.

470
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Botheration!

471
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,082
I thought our galactic powers
meant we could do anything?

472
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,700
Catherine from downstairs,
be madly in love with me.

473
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,094
That was quick.

474
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,700
-Hi.
-Hi.

475
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,421
-Um, you're not gay,
are you? -No, no.

476
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,222
-Let's go to
bed. -Okay.

477
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,220
Oh, shit!

478
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,660
Ow, my leg!

479
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:57,599
-Got it. <i>-Galactic power now
returning to earthling.</i>

480
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,700
"Gone to get
ready for work."

481
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,540
Weather, be like it
is in Los Angeles.

482
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,095
I didn't mean be like it is
in Los Angeles right this

483
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:34,980
moment. It's the middle of
the night, for crying out loud.

484
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:43,020
Weather, be like it usually is in Los
Angeles during the day. So pedantic.

485
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,540
All right.

486
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,056
Clothes, get
dressed on me.

487
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,654
And smarten
yourselves up. Better.

488
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,700
Miss Pringle, this
really... has to stop.

489
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,580
-Oh, Lord.
-Oh, Lord.

490
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,300
Could you just stop that,
please? You, stop tapping.

491
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,780
Let's just have a break, shall
we? Just... Right, what's next?

492
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,380
This one's in
German. Wow.

493
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,101
Let me be able to understand
German. [speaking in German]

494
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,580
What are you talking
about, Dennis?

495
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,140
Look, just shut up,
okay? I can handle this.

496
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,660
She's not going to
ask me to marry her.

497
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,380
Or have my
children, okay?

498
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,001
Dennis, what are you talking
about? That's a good idea, actually.

499
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:28,240
-What are you talking about?
Dennis, be able to talk. -Biscuits.

500
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,660
-What?
-Biscuits.

501
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,340
Maybe if I make her fall in love
with me like a little bit, you know, so

502
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,420
-she doesn't want to marry me, but she
would have sex on a reg... -Biscuits.

503
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,020
-For crying out loud, they're
in the cupboard. -What are?

504
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,700
Biscuits. Red biscuits,
black biscuits.

505
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,700
-Nothing else matters. -Is that all
you think about? -Yes, yes! Biscuits.

506
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,060
All right, Dennis, become a
rational, thinking creature.

507
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,780
I just can't concentrate on anything
until I've had one of those biscuits.

508
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,660
I know it's crazy but that's how it
is. I guess I'm kind of hooked on them.

509
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,959
So please give me
just one biscuit, then

510
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:02,540
I'll be able to think
about something else.

511
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,903
-That makes sense.
-Oh, oh, oh! He's getting

512
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:09,500
the biscuits!
He's getting them! This is it!

513
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,620
He's got them.

514
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,281
He's got them. He's going to throw one.
Get ready, get ready. Here it comes.

515
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,940
God, it must be
terrible being a dog.

516
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,800
I never realised you
had so many cravings.

517
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,660
It's no worse than
you and that bitch.

518
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,580
-What bitch? -The bitch you
were shagging last night.

519
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,420
Oh, my God. She's not a bitch,
okay? She's a lovely human female.

520
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,560
And we weren't
just shagging.

521
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,488
Right. Come to think of it,
I wouldn't mind shagging your

522
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:37,580
leg right now. A little leg dance,
huh? Just above the sock.

523
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,600
-Ah... -How about
it? Come on, Daddy.

524
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,260
I thought I turned you into a
rational, thinking creature.

525
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,100
Rational, thinking creatures
still have desires.

526
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,660
-Oh, well, we can soon
deal with that. -No!

527
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,900
-No, no, don't take my desires
away from me. -Why not?

528
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,420
They're what makes my life worth
living. Biscuits, shagging.

529
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,500
I don't think I like
your conversation.

530
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,460
But I worship you, master.
I love you so much.

531
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,500
-I can't bear displeasing
you. -I... I know.

532
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,660
-My whole world collapses when
you're cross with me. -I know.

533
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,740
Look, maybe it was better
when you didn't talk.

534
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,340
Oh, no, don't take away my power of
speech now that I can think rationally.

535
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,340
-That would be so cruel. I heard the
bell. Somebody at the door. -Okay, no...

536
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,660
-The bell! Hey! The bell! -No,
no. Dennis. Dennis, good dog.

537
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,260
-Hey, somebody. There it goes
again. -Dennis... Just quiet.

538
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,660
Somebody at the door. Oh, no, have
I done something wrong again?

539
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,060
No, just... Just be quiet.
Do you understand me?

540
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,340
Yes. Yes, anything to stop
you being angry with me.

541
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,580
The bell! There it goes
again! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

542
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,020
Dennis, listen. Just listen,
listen, listen, listen.

543
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,660
-Be quiet. That is an
order. -Right. Quiet.

544
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,340
I like obeying orders,
especially your orders.

545
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,460
Good. Well, then,
shut the fuck up.

546
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,340
Right, right. Shut the
fuck up. Yeah, right.

547
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,334
Good boy.

548
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,340
Oh, God, I made her do it. I
made her do it... I... okay.

549
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,460
-Hi.
-Hey.

550
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,001
-Can I come in? -Yes,
yes, yes, yes, of course.

551
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,860
-So, look, um, about
last night... -Yes.

552
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,020
-Is this a bad time?
-No, no. No, no.

553
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,286
Okay. Um, I just... I don't
want you to think

554
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:16,700
that I, um, do that
sort of thing all the time

555
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,580
because...
Because I don't.

556
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,060
-Um... I was slightly drunk.
-Yeah, well, I mean, naturally.

557
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,000
Otherwise we probably wouldn't
have done the thing with

558
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,107
-the beard trimmer. -No, that's not
what I mean. I mean, I like you.

559
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:29,700
I've always really
enjoyed talking to you.

560
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,140
I just... I probably wouldn't have
jumped on you like that if I hadn't...

561
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,260
-Been pissed as a
newt? -Well, sort of.

562
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,740
Yeah, okay. Well, then, let's just
forget it. It never... happened.

563
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,820
No, no, no, that's not
what I'm saying, Neil.

564
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,660
-Oh, well, um, what did you
want, then? -Shag her, Neil!

565
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,140
-That's Dennis. -Dennis?
-Yeah. He is a plumber.

566
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,300
Um, I'm having a few problems with
my waterworks. My water pipes.

567
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,500
Shag her, Neil!

568
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,620
I'd better get him the shagger. It's
a special wrench that plumbers use.

569
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,700
-I thought I told you
to shut up. -I'm sorry.

570
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,740
-I'm really sorry. -You're supposed
to be a rational, thinking creature.

571
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,220
Sorry, sorry. Can't help myself.
Sorry. Oh, dear. I wanna shag your leg.

572
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,380
Shh. It's not a great time, to be
honest. Maybe later, if you behave.

573
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,700
Oh... Couldn't find the shagger,
so he just went with the old decoupler.

574
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,340
-I love you, Neil!
-Shut up, Dennis!

575
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,220
It's odd, isn't it, shouting
at the plumber like that?

576
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,020
But, uh, the fact is he's my
brother. The plumber is my brother.

577
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,580
Say you love
me, Neil.

578
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,100
-And we're very close.
-God, Rosie was right.

579
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,380
-Rosie? -Please can
I shag your leg?

580
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,540
-Jesus, Neil, how could you?
The next morning! -What? I...

581
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,260
Why do I always
end up with creeps?

582
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,860
-I'm not a creep! -There was a
cat, Neil! Neil! Hey, you, cat!

583
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,340
Stay out of my garden, go
on! Neil, it's a ginger tom!

584
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,540
Dennis, be a dumb animal
again for five minutes.

585
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,460
So she thinks I'm gay. I
mean, so what, you know?

586
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,020
I mean, it means that she won't
want to marry me or have my kids.

587
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,095
Bingo. Problem solved.
Thank you, Dennis.

588
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,000
Catherine!

589
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Catherine!

590
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,138
Um, me be
on the bus.

591
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,380
Ah! I don't mean on the
bus. I mean in the bus.

592
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,838
Not in the engine. In the
passenger accommodation!

593
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,810
Catherine!

594
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Catherine!
Catherine!

595
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,500
-Ray. -You've gotta
stop Miss Pringle.

596
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,260
She's... She's set up shrines all over
the school. There's even a website.

597
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,620
-Look, you wanted her to worship
you, okay? -Not like this.

598
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,620
-Ray, I don't have time for this.
-You haven't lost the powers, have you?

599
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,980
-No, I haven't lost the powers. Ray.
-You have. You've lost...

600
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,423
-I haven't lost the powers. -Do
the thing. -Ray, become a duck.

601
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,080
Ray. Ray, stop it. Ray, stop it.
Ray, stop it. Ray, become a sausage.

602
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,900
-I haven't lost the powers, Ray,
okay? This is... -Where is he, Neil?

603
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,340
Oh. That's his car.

604
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,100
-Oh. Behold the car
of Ray! -The car of Ray!

605
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,140
-Catherine, can we talk?
-No. -But I love you.

606
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,200
You also love
Dennis, apparently.

607
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,700
-Did you take that off there? -Uh,
no, this is mine. -Yours? -Yeah.

608
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,600
Look, you've got it
all wrong about Dennis.

609
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,500
I've nothing whatsoever
against Dennis.

610
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,444
You love him, he loves you.
I'm happy for both of you.

611
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:59,100
Just don't
bring me into it.

612
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,180
Yeah, no, but there's something
I need to tell you about Dennis.

613
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,820
You are going to have to pay for
that now that you've touched it.

614
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,240
-It's mine! -No, it isn't. -Look, I
heard what you said to each other, Neil.

615
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,780
Look. There's something crucial about
Dennis you don't know. He's not a man.

616
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,324
I don't want to
hear this, Neil.

617
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,500
I know, but I'm just
saying, he's not a man.

618
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,560
-Ow! Ah! Hell's tits!
-You pervert! -Ow!

619
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,620
-You come in here and steal our stuff?
-I told you, that's not your sausage.

620
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,245
-It is my sausage.
-Get off. -Give it back.

621
00:50:19,345 --> 00:50:20,860
-Be careful, be careful.
-Just let go! -Oh, God!

622
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,860
-Give me
80p. -Fine.

623
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,100
-I'll just get your change.
-No, it's... Never mind. It's...

624
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,787
-Well, no, cos it's
4.20. -Keep it.

625
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:31,100
-It's too much for a tip.
-Have it your way.

626
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,580
-I should think so,
too. Jesus. -Feck.

627
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,820
Sausage,
become Ray.

628
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,780
Jesus, Neil. Have you any idea
how vulnerable a sausage feels?

629
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,380
-There he
is! -I'm off!

630
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,260
-Leave me alone, you nutters!
-Ray! Ray! -Here you go.

631
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,060
You must have
been hungry.

632
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,580
It's clear he has no idea of
doing any good whatsoever.

633
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,380
Why can't we just get
on with the destruction?

634
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,580
Because there are
rules, Maureen.

635
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,700
We must follow
galactic procedure.

636
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,820
Rules didn't stop you from eating
the inhabitants of G4378, Janet!

637
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,580
They were delicious. Very
crunchy, as I recall...

638
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,740
-Surprise, surprise! -Oh, my God!
No! -Wait. Wait, wait. Catherine!

639
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,820
You're crazy, do
you know that?

640
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,340
-Crazy in love, darlin'.
-Get out of my flat, Grant.

641
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,465
Well, I can't because
you've locked the door now, babe.

642
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,140
Well, then, get out
the way you got in.

643
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,420
Oh, honey, come on,
now. That ain't nice!

644
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,220
Just get out, Grant. I
never want to see you again!

645
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,740
Get out of my
life! Get out!

646
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Come on, now,
open the door.

647
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,020
Sorry. Sorry
about the noise.

648
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,020
-At least it wasn't
barking. -Feck off. Not you.

649
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,620
-Walk out the front door, okay?
-Honey! -Then sneak in the back.

650
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,860
Then climb up to my place.
No moves, no funny business.

651
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,020
-You can just stay out of his way and
I will make you dinner. -Love me!

652
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,620
-I hate doors! -All right. But invite
Dennis. We'll behave like grown-ups. -OK.

653
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,694
-Catherine? Catherine,
come back. -I'm leaving!

654
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:13,780
Okay. I'm coming! Hold
on. Wait for me, now.

655
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,900
She's coming
to dinner!

656
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,040
<i>-This episode looks at doggy fantasies.</i>
-Whoa. Hey! It was just about to start.

657
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,820
-She's coming to dinner. -Who?
-Catherine. -Oh, the bitch.

658
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,700
Don't call her that, all right? I don't
want you chipping in, either, okay?

659
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,460
-Just pretend to be a dumb
animal again. -Me? A dumb animal?

660
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,580
Well, you know how to pretend, don't
you? It's just... It's called acting.

661
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,260
Oh, you mean like when I'm
having my tummy tickled?

662
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,460
-You love having your tummy
tickled. -No, I don't.

663
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,700
-What? -It's a sham,
Neil. All dogs do it.

664
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,380
-Why? -Why do humans like
tickling dogs' tummies?

665
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,480
Because they love having
their tummies tickled.

666
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:58,820
Uh-uh. Dogs pretend to like it because
they know human beings like doing it.

667
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,500
Well, just pretend to be a
perfectly ordinary dog, okay?

668
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,620
-Can't I join in the conversation
just a little bit? -No.

669
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,420
That is so cruel.

670
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,980
Somebody at the door! Hey!
It's the bell! It's the bell!

671
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,580
-I know it's the bell,
Dennis. -Right. No, no, sorry.

672
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,740
Just one more peep out of you, okay, and
the flea collar is going back on again.

673
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,580
Right, right, right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

674
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,720
-Bark.
-Woof.

675
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:33,300
-Do it properly. -Woof! -Yeah,
good. Okay, thank you. -Got it.

676
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,360
-Hi. -Has he gone?
-No, I don't think so.

677
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,540
-Ooh!
-Dennis, down.

678
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,980
-You named him after the
plumber, then, did you? -Uh...

679
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,860
Ah. Do you want
your tummy tickled?

680
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,620
Why do dogs like
that so much?

681
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,974
I don't know.

682
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,420
So the producer promises to take
me out of the general office

683
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,340
and give me a big desk
with a view, but he won't.

684
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,459
He's just trying
to get me into bed.

685
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,260
What did you
want to tell me?

686
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,776
Uh, just try
this first.

687
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,100
Oh, that's
incredible.

688
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,160
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

689
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,640
Mmm. I had no idea you
were such a fantastic cook.

690
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,420
I've... I've... It's unlike anything
I've ever tasted. What is it?

691
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,191
I just said, "Let the soup be
the most amazing thing Catherine

692
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,700
has ever tasted, unlike
anything she's tasted before."

693
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:57,140
-And it is.
-Really? -Really.

694
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,140
I can make things
happen. Anything.

695
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,460
That's what I was trying to
tell you this morning, you know?

696
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,620
I wasn't talking to a live-in homosexual
plumber. I was talking to Dennis.

697
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,420
-The dog?
-Dennis the dog.

698
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,540
-Who answered you back? -Yeah,
because I made him talk.

699
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,540
-Oh. -With
my powers.

700
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,100
Special powers?

701
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,740
I mean, what, you... You want
a bigger desk? You got it.

702
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,700
You want a great
view? You got it.

703
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,300
Um... Neil, how long have
you had these special powers?

704
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,220
-Well, they came upon me very
suddenly. -Very suddenly?

705
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,780
Yeah, I was knocked
off my bike.

706
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,820
Just ask me to do something,
anything. Just, you know...

707
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,380
-Listen, Neil, it... It's okay. You can
get help with this. -Son of a bitch!

708
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,260
-Shit, Grant! -I'm out of here!
-There's nobody else, huh?

709
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,540
-Who is this guy?
-She didn't tell you?

710
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,140
-I'm her fianc. -You're
not my fianc, Grant.

711
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,820
-Yeah? And you weren't just making out
with this apology of a man? -Stop this.

712
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,260
You know how long you'd last
on a battlefield, soldier?

713
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,300
-I'm sorry,
Neil. -That long.

714
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,500
-I'm warning you.
-You're warning me?

715
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,380
-Yeah, I'm warning
you. -Who is this guy?

716
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,580
-Why don't you suck on
this, asshole? -Grant!

717
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,700
All I have to do is go like
this and... And say what?

718
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,860
-Where did you find this
fruitcake? -Put that away, Grant.

719
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,380
Uh, what can I say?
Grant, become a fairy?

720
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,400
It's Grant,
not... Grant.

721
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,520
-Stop it. -And you're
the goddamn fairy.

722
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,560
How about Grant go back
to where you came from?

723
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,180
-It's Grant. -How about kiss my arse,
Grant? -Neil, don't. He's crazy.

724
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,980
How about you say, "Please, Grant,
don't put a bullet through my brain?"

725
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,140
-Grant, stop it! -I prefer,
"Let all bullets bounce off me."

726
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,194
-Go on, shoot me. -Oh, my
God. You're both crazy.

727
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:45,900
-He doesn't dare.
-Neil, please, please.

728
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,040
Go on, pull the trigger.
What's the matter, "Grant"?

729
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,300
-Shut up. -Go
on, shoot me.

730
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,460
-Neil, he will. -No, he won't.
-Yes, I will. -No, you won't.

731
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,620
-Grant, drop the gun.
-You little shit!

732
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,140
-You're idiots, both of you. -I
wouldn't do this if I were you.

733
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:07,300
"I wouldn't do this if I were
you." God, I hate the English.

734
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,300
Let Grant's arm break if
he tries to throttle me.

735
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,580
Shut up.
It's Grant!

736
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,420
-Help! Help! Help!
-Who the heck was that?

737
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,860
Uh, that's Dennis.

738
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:28,179
It's just a dog!
English dick.

739
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,860
-Shit! Shit! What happened? -Yeah,
yeah. Do you want me to make it better?

740
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,535
-It hurts. -Grant's
arm be better.

741
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,460
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what is
this? -Grant be stuck on the ceiling.

742
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,660
-Oh, shit! -Grant be
plastered to the wall.

743
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,284
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's talk about this.

744
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,220
Grant be buried head
first in the plant pot.

745
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,380
What do you mean,
potted plant?

746
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,896
Grant be standing
in front of me.

747
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,740
Yeah. You wanna be nice to me,
Grant, okay? Maybe I can help you.

748
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,280
-You? -I could make your
life absolutely hell

749
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:18,764
or I could say, "Grant be
holding a million dollars."

750
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,140
-Or I could say, "A million
dollars, disappear." -Fuck! Come on!

751
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,500
I can do anything. All I
have to do is wave my hand.

752
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,220
-You gotta wave your
hand? -That's right.

753
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,980
Isn't he great? I love
you. I love you so much.

754
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,380
-Dennis, keep out of this.
-But you are great, Neil.

755
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:47,174
-You can do anything. -Dennis,
shut up. I'm not... -Master! Neil!

756
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,700
Hi. Made your
mind up yet?

757
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,740
-How about tonight?
-Good girl.

758
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,580
-8:00, my place. -Yeah. I always
pick the wrong guy, anyway.

759
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,903
Oh, and, uh, I got
you a new desk.

760
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,960
Well, it's about
time. Now, listen up.

761
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,000
When I take that gag
out of your mouth,

762
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,940
you're going to say exactly what's on
that piece of paper, you understand?

763
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,620
The moment you say a word that is not
on that piece of paper, I kill the dog.

764
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,980
-Don't let him shoot
me, Neil. -Understand?

765
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,000
Nod if you
understand.

766
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,180
Okay. Okay. I'm going to take
the gag out now. Remember,

767
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,898
one wrong word and
the dog gets it.

768
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,340
Okay, read. Item number
one, let's go. Come on.

769
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,990
"Item number one.
All pasty white Englishmen..."

770
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:24,100
"Pasty white Englishmen to get
big ears and webbed feet?"

771
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:31,117
-Now wave your hand.
-What? -Wave your hand!

772
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,855
Yes! Yes! Oh,
it's beautiful.

773
01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:47,955
Neil!
Neil!

774
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,055
Neil!

775
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,380
Neil!

776
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,380
-You don't worship
me, do you? -What?

777
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,940
Ray. You're Ray.

778
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,380
-I can't find Neil. -Isn't he
here? -He wasn't at school, either.

779
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,700
Oh, I left him with my crazy,
gun-toting ex-boyfriend.

780
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,460
-Neil's got these powers.
-No, I know, I know.

781
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,180
He got Miss Pringle to... To worship me
and now she's turned me into a religion.

782
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,700
-They think I'm
immortal. -So what?

783
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,340
They want me to prove it
by rising from the dead.

784
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,460
-We've got to
find Neil. -Wait.

785
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,860
Hey! Hey!

786
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,314
What are
you doing?

787
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,820
Got it.

788
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,340
-Where's your car? -Why?
-I know where they are.

789
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,660
-It's just out here.
We can... Shit! -Lord.

790
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,660
Oh, no.
Run for it!

791
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:17,062
Get him! Lord!

792
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,860
This is working beautifully. Okay,
keep going. Number three. Let's go.

793
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:28,700
Okay. "Three. All British
police to have pink uniforms."

794
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,158
My personal
favourite.

795
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,198
What's this
all about?

796
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,913
There he is!

797
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,180
Oh, it's beautiful. I can't believe
it. All right, next one. Come on, read.

798
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,420
"Let all traffic lights be
permanently set on green."

799
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:46,580
-Come on. That's just...
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

800
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,238
Huh? Do it, do it.

801
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,559
Wait. Now, listen.

802
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,420
Grant, are
you in there?

803
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,300
Skip to the end. Hurry
up. Just skip to the end!

804
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,900
Skip to the end. Just...
There. Come on, quick.

805
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,220
-Read it. -Uh, uh... okay, okay,
"Item 417, Catherine West..."

806
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,740
-Come on. -All right.
-Let them go, Grant.

807
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,940
Why should I? Go on,
Neil. Read the last item.

808
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,700
"Item 417, Catherine West be madly,
deeply in love with Col. Grant Kotchev"

809
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,780
"and leap on him like a
tigress begging for sex."

810
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,434
-You bastard. -Now, come on,
now. Wave your hand. Come on.

811
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:47,540
-Neil, don't! -Or
the dog gets it!

812
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,540
-Don't let him shoot me, Neil.
-Come on, wave your goddamn hand!

813
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,300
But I don't want to love him, Neil.
I don't want to go anywhere near him.

814
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,623
I don't wanna die.

815
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:06,843
-Grant, I love you. Please, please,
let's have sex now. -Oh, yeah.

816
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,420
-Dennis, be free.
-I'm free! I'm free!

817
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,060
Please.
Uh, uh,

818
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:19,419
-Grant become a corgi! -What? Oh, shit.
-Do it. Do it, Grant. Do it, do it.

819
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,740
-Me be free.
-Yes, yes!

820
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,140
Master. You chose to save
me rather than that bitch.

821
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,391
Yeah, don't
call her that.

822
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:33,740
Catherine be her normal self
and not in love with Grant.

823
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,654
And all Grant's
wishes be cancelled.

824
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,580
-Ray! -Oh, shit.
Oh, no. Get off me!

825
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,100
-Neil, stop them! -Lord,
show us how to conquer death!

826
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,660
Dorothy Pringle, think about
Ray the way that you used to.

827
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,100
-What the hell, Ray? -It
was nothing to do with me.

828
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,900
Get lost,
you creep!

829
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,620
-Thank you. -Everyone
else, forget about Ray.

830
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:08,785
Thanks, Neil. Thanks
a whole bunch.

831
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,060
-Ray, could you take
me home, please? -Sure.

832
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,493
I'm... I'm
sorry...

833
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,420
-Any thoughts?
-Pathetic!

834
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,580
He has no concept
of good or evil.

835
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,340
Well, the dogs
seem all right.

836
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:37,694
Yes, yes, the dogs are all right.
It's the people I can't stand.

837
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,620
Oh, hey.
Catherine, hi.

838
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,900
Hey, sorry about the
other night. It was...

839
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,260
-Can I cook you supper?
-Uh, no, thanks, Neil.

840
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,300
-I'm doing a whole
suckling pig. -No.

841
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,660
Hey, what's the matter? Is it because
I made you throw yourself at Grant?

842
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,420
No. Look, you did what you had
to do. It worked. Forgotten.

843
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,580
Well, what
is it, then?

844
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,058
Do you know what it feels like
to be in someone else's power?

845
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,380
To have no
will of your own?

846
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,420
Look, I thought that
I made you love me.

847
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,580
-What? -You know,
with my powers.

848
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,298
Oh, my God. Did I really
come home early

849
01:07:30,398 --> 01:07:32,620
tonight because I wanted
to or did you make me?

850
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,860
Have I always lived opposite you or
have you somehow rearranged things?

851
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,140
-I'm never going to
know. -Look, I love you.

852
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,140
How could any woman love a man who
could make her do whatever he wants,

853
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,260
any second, every
day, forever?

854
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,535
Look, I'm sorry, Neil, I could never
love you, not in a million years.

855
01:07:49,635 --> 01:07:51,635
Catherine!

856
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,540
Sharon, Sharon,
terrible news!

857
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,660
This is indeed
grave news.

858
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,140
It appears that the
Salubrious Gat has been

859
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,620
interfering with our
translation devices.

860
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,720
What's he
done, Sharon?

861
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,580
I'm afraid, Janet, that we
have been calling ourselves by

862
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:17,240
foolish-sounding earthling names.
Female ones, at that.

863
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:22,220
It seems that Sharon is particularly
favoured among female earthlings from

864
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,820
Australia.

865
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,900
-The shame of it. -Sharon... I mean,
what should we be calling you?

866
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,900
Call me the Death-Dealing
Darkness-Bringer.

867
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,814
Yes, oh,
Death-Dealer.

868
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,020
-Great waffles, master.
-Who cares about waffles?

869
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,660
Catherine hates me. Ray
hates me. Everybody hates me.

870
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,340
I don't hate you and
I care about waffles.

871
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,860
I think I like them even more
than biscuits, even red biscuits.

872
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,140
You know what the worse thing
is, Dennis? This is all my fault.

873
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,020
You know, I was just thinking
about myself, what I could get.

874
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,358
And yet with these powers,
you know, I could

875
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,540
have solved every
problem in the world.

876
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,660
-I could have made people happy.
-You couldn't make Catherine happy.

877
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,300
Yeah, because I wanted her to love
me. You know, I was being selfish.

878
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,820
I mean, take world
hunger, you know? Uh...

879
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:18,740
Let everybody in the world
have as much food as they want.

880
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,740
I mean, take homelessness. Let everybody
in the world have somewhere to live.

881
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,780
No, no, no, live in
their dream house.

882
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,500
And war, senseless
war, over forever.

883
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,860
-Let there be no reason for anyone
to make war on anyone any more. -Yeah!

884
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,740
Oh, and reverse
global warming.

885
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,200
Has it happened?

886
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,820
<i>The latest nation to succumb
to the sudden mysterious</i>

887
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,220
<i>exponential growth in world
food supplies is China,</i>

888
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,140
<i>where the average weight is
now 300 pounds and rising.</i>

889
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,660
<i>Well, today a party of picnicking
schoolchildren brought down</i>

890
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,620
<i>a mile-long section of
the Great Wall of China.</i>

891
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,180
<i>As homelessness becomes
a thing of the past,</i>

892
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,700
<i>the last undeveloped
area of the Sahara Desert</i>

893
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,900
<i>has become a gated community
known as Beau Geste Towers.</i>

894
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,380
<i>Property developers are now
converging on Antarctica.</i>

895
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,395
-At least I got rid of war. -That was a
good one. "Let there be no reason to

896
01:10:14,495 --> 01:10:18,660
-...make war..." -"To make war on anyone
any more." How could that go wrong?

897
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,940
<i>-For no reason at all, New Zealand has
declared war on Iceland.</i> -Oh, dear.

898
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,580
<i>Barbados has declared
war on Somalia.</i>

899
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,900
<i>And in a surprise move, the tiny
island of St Kitts and Nevis</i>

900
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,380
<i>has declared war on the
entire rest of the world.</i>

901
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,460
<i>Our war correspondent says
he is unavailable for comment</i>

902
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,020
<i>because he's too busy covering all the
other wars which have just broken out</i>

903
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,500
<i>for no reason
at all.</i>

904
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,796
<i>A short time ago,
scientists were afraid</i>

905
01:10:42,896 --> 01:10:45,260
<i>of constantly rising
global temperatures.</i>

906
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,740
<i>-But none of them have any
explanation...</i> -Oh, my God.

907
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,300
<i>-...for this sudden
return...</i> -Global warming.

908
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,731
<i>...not only to the
last ice age but to a</i>

909
01:10:53,831 --> 01:10:56,460
<i>snowball Earth of half
a billion years ago.</i>

910
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,380
<i>On the other hand, plans
to turn the Antarctic</i>

911
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,060
<i>into the Captain Scott gated community
have been put on hold...</i> -Shit!

912
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,380
Shit, shit, shit!

913
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,660
Oh, it's not so easy
trying to do good, is it?

914
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,060
Yeah, but this
is just unfair.

915
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,573
Let everything go back to
how it was before I started

916
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:14,900
trying to make everything
better for everybody.

917
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,540
<i>Beautiful though the
Earth looks from space,</i>

918
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,220
<i>we all know how fragile it is, how much
damage human beings have done to it</i>

919
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,540
<i>and will, it seems,
continue to do to it.</i>

920
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:34,635
Absolute power doesn't corrupt.
It just drives you bloody mad.

921
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,500
Tell Catherine
I love her.

922
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,940
Don't do it,
master. I love you!

923
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,885
I've made arrangements
for your biscuits.

924
01:11:47,985 --> 01:11:50,060
You'll never have to
worry about them again.

925
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:54,780
-You're the kindest master. -Just
shush, okay? I can't concentrate.

926
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,300
Master, don't
you love me?

927
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,340
I can't stand it, Dennis. I just...
I can't stand the responsibility.

928
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:09,003
-You need to get that into
your stupid dog brain. -Neil!

929
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,141
I'll save you,
master. Here I come!

930
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,380
Oh, wait a second.
I can't swim.

931
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:23,315
Master, help! Woof! Help!
Help! Oh, dear. Woof! Woof!

932
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,096
Bless you! Bless you,
master! Bless you!

933
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,380
-You do love me, master. -Of
course I love you, Dennis.

934
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,957
I just don't
love myself.

935
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,140
Time's up! Prime the
Destruction Generator.

936
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,620
-Hang on. -What? -We need to
check if he's passed the test.

937
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,860
Well, he did start
all those wars.

938
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,780
-That was good. -But then he
stopped them all. -But why?

939
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,180
He said he was trying to make
things better for people.

940
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,820
That's very
appalling.

941
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,180
The only good is to destroy.
The only evil is weakness.

942
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,580
Weakness must
be annihilated!

943
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,500
Agreed. Vaporise the earthling
and his wretched planet.

944
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,620
I told you so.

945
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,862
Reprime the
Destruction Generator.

946
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,540
Try her again,
Neil. Go on.

947
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,860
She... She
won't have me.

948
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,580
-Then, give up the
powers. -I can't.

949
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,909
Then, give
them to me.

950
01:13:58,009 --> 01:14:01,580
You wouldn't have the powers
but you'd know where they were.

951
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,500
And being a dog, all I want
to do is follow orders.

952
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,900
I'll do what
you tell me to.

953
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,939
-Dennis, you're a
genius. -Not bad, huh?

954
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:19,300
Destruction Generator already charged,
Death-Dealing Darkness-Bringer.

955
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,000
<i>Commencing
destruction.</i>

956
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,220
It is a curse that our numerals
take so long to pronounce.

957
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,820
Uh, yeah, it's like, uh, you
just wave your hand, like that.

958
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,220
-I feel it. Wow!
-Yeah. There you go.

959
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,780
So what's it going
to be? Biscuits?

960
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,526
But the power made
you miserable.

961
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:43,260
Yeah, but I don't have
them any more, do I?

962
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,170
Look, tree become
Eiffel Tower.

963
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:50,220
See?

964
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,638
What are you
thinking, Dennis?

965
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,240
-Forgive me, master. -What? Wait,
wait. What are you going to do?

966
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,280
That's the
only short one.

967
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:18,140
If I have any power, let the source
of that power be destroyed, forever!

968
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:18,580
All this marking be suddenly
finished and neatly stacked up.

969
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:23,062
Fiona Blackwell,
go away.

970
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,740
Fiona! How lovely
to see you.

971
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,900
Hey, great news. I
got my sight back.

972
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,223
Hey, I think I
hear Catherine.

973
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,580
-Catherine.
-Hi. Hey. Um...

974
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,060
Look. Letters
become cucumbers.

975
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,700
Us be on the prow
of the Titanic.

976
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,500
I got rid of
the powers.

977
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,460
I'm impressed.

978
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,940
Yeah. So I thought maybe we
could have some dinner sometime?

979
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,419
-Yeah, maybe,
yeah. -Okay.

980
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:27,883
-How about tonight? -I'll
be down in half an hour.

981
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,500
We're going out to dinner. I'll
bring you both back a doggy bag.

982
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,600
I suppose I'd better
keep my mouth shut.

983
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,620
-Turn me back, Den. -I
can't. I like you as you are.

984
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:43,500
-Those stubby legs. Look at
you. -I'm not a dog, I'm a man.

985
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,120
Hey, nobody's
perfect.

986
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,051
This is chewing a
biscuit, boss. I'll try

987
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:39,900
and give you that right now,
hold one second.

988
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,600
Oh, red biscuit.
Great. No! No!

989
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,220
-Oh, got it. <i>-Licking.
Licking somebody.</i>

990
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,845
This is like porn.
Now a shagging noise.

991
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,900
Oh, look. There's
the red bit.

992
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,900
-Oh, there, oh, right, oh...
I'm done. <i>-Okay, great.</i>

993
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:14,201
That's enough chewing biscuits
for fucking half an hour.
