1
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,870
I would say...

2
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,034
...that you are now on a place -

3
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,152
- where we have buried something
from you to protect you.

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,238
And we have taken great... pain -

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,029
- to be sure that you are protected.

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,316
We also need you to know -

7
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,790
- that this place
should not be disturbed.

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,989
And we want you to know -

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,393
- that this is not a place
for you to live in.

10
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,639
You should stay away from this
place, and then you will be safe.

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,515
I am now in this place
where you should never come.

12
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,798
We call it Onkalo.
Onkalo means "hiding place".

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,750
In my time it is still unfinished -

14
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,232
- though work began in the 20th
century when I was just a child.

15
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,754
Work will be completed in the
22nd century, long after my death.

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,270
Onkalo must last 100000 years.

17
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,153
Nothing built by man
has lasted a tenth of that time.

18
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,158
But we consider ourselves
a very potent civilization.

19
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,591
If we succeed, -

20
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,629
- it will most likely be the longest
lasting remains of our civilization.

21
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,360
If you,
some time far into the future, -

22
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,594
- find this,
what will it tell you about us?

23
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,716
Once mankind started to use nuclear
power to generate electricity -

24
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,998
- it was obvious that we would
also generate some waste -

25
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,029
- which has to be treated
so that it doesn"t... harm anybody.

26
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,149
And you can"t make
nuclear waste go away.

27
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,517
You cannot make
nuclear waste harmless.

28
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,710
So... several ways of how to get
rid of the waste were explored.

29
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,713
Send it in a rocket out to the sun.

30
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,350
It disappears;
it will never make harm to anyone.

31
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,868
But how to ensure that the rocket
doesn"t explode on the launch pad?

32
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,077
Or sinking it to deep sea...

33
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,596
We would never be able to claim -

34
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,515
- that we can safely put something
into the bottom of the oceans.

35
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,752
Because still we have an impression -

36
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,552
- that the oceans are
really the mother of all life.

37
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,589
It"s not a safe way of handling spent
nuclear fuel or radioactive waste.

38
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,038
How much waste
exists in the world today?

39
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,474
Totally?

40
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,955
I am not quite aware.

41
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,198
I would say between
200000 and 300000 tons.

42
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,635
Somewhere between these two.

43
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,232
We already have enormous
amounts of nuclear waste.

44
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,951
If this waste spills out into nature
it will cause death and destruction.

45
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,079
Large areas will become
uninhabitable for a long, long time.

46
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,155
Did that happen? Are there forbidden
zones with no life in your time?

47
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,514
A hundred years ago,
just three human generations ago, -

48
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,274
- when radiation
was first discovered, -

49
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,432
- we didn"t understand
that it was very dangerous.

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,798
But we noticed that it can be useful
and we started to work with it.

51
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,475
Radiation is a sort of energy which
can penetrate deep into your body -

52
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,111
- and harm your health.
But it is an invisible danger.

53
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,229
We have no sense for it: You cannot
see it, feel it or smell it.

54
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,198
And still it may even kill you.

55
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,671
Radiation may be described
as small packages of energy.

56
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,994
And when they hit the genetic code,
the DNA molecule, they can break it.

57
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,674
If you have a very serious whole-body
exposure you don"t feel anything -

58
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,312
- until one hour or so afterwards
when you start to feel nausea, -

59
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,519
- and you may vomit, and you may
think you have got food poisoning.

60
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,673
In between you may feel better.
After two weeks you start to bleed.

61
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,796
You have diarrhoea and fever.

62
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,873
And after a few weeks
you may even die from this.

63
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,948
Radiation can also
leave a trace in you.

64
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,796
It can change the genes.
Mutate the genes.

65
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,272
It may cause malformation
or disease or dysfunction.

66
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,518
So: Beware! Never stay in an area
with an enhanced radiation level.

67
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,275
And never, ever touch upon
a strong radiation source!

68
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,879
So we are storing the waste today
above ground in water pools.

69
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,912
The reason why
it"s kept in water -

70
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,073
- is that water creates
a shield for radiation.

71
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,635
Keeping the waste in tanks -

72
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,148
- is probably possible for the next
ten years, 20 years, 100 years.

73
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,788
1000 years...?

74
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,079
You just can"t guarantee stable
conditions above ground -

75
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,356
- for instance... for...

76
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,389
...well... for one hundred years,
let alone thousands of years.

77
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,191
These storages need surveillance.

78
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,156
They need power in order
to cool the water pools.

79
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,880
They need maintenance.

80
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,592
But we can"t keep this waste forever
in the water pools.

81
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,509
There"ve been two world wars
during the last 100 years.

82
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,674
The world above ground -

83
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,798
- is unstable.

84
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:22,519
We have to find a permanent solution.
Or a safer solution -

85
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,477
- in the long run.

86
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,954
My civilization depends on energy
as no civilization before us.

87
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,669
Energy is the main currency for us.

88
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,435
Is it the same for you?

89
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,593
Does your way of life
also depend on unlimited energy?

90
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,838
What we must do is to take care of
the waste from nuclear power plants.

91
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,678
More and more, societies
that are using nuclear power -

92
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,832
- are realising that
they have to do something.

93
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,798
We obtained the energy.
We have used the energy.

94
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,112
Of course it is our mission
to also take care of the waste.

95
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,033
There is no way of doing nothing.

96
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,593
This is something which ought to be
the responsibility of all citizens.

97
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,198
Irrespective of whether
they like nuclear power or not.

98
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,194
Linking the issue of
nuclear waste with nuclear power -

99
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,480
- could easily divert attention
from the material which we have -

100
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,952
- and must somehow handle
in a responsible way.

101
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,350
Not to harm future generations.

102
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,032
This tunnel feels like
a time capsule sometimes.

103
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,319
When you arrive in the morning -

104
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,519
- it may be sunny,
almost like summer outside.

105
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,790
When you come out again
at the end of the day -

106
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,872
- it may have
snowed like hell.

107
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,235
The weather will have
changed completely, -

108
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,154
- and you think "How long
did I actually spend in the tunnel?"

109
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,990
And likewise:
You go to work and it"s dark, -

110
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,516
- and when you come back up
after work it is dark.

111
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,150
And it feels like time has stopped.

112
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,832
Five, four, three, two, one, fire!

113
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,637
Final disposal
of spent nuclear fuel -

114
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,749
- hasn"t been implemented
anywhere so far.

115
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,310
We are forerunners in this field.

116
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,834
And we are dealing with
very, very long time frames.

117
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,475
Meaning that this repository
should last at least 100000 years.

118
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,470
100000 years is beyond our
understanding and imagination.

119
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,076
Our history is
so short in comparison.

120
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,871
How is it with you?

121
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,597
How far into the future will your
way of life have consequences?

122
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,033
That"s what we really want to prove:
That we can isolate the waste -

123
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,833
- from human beings and other
live organisms for 100000 years.

124
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,353
We have come to a conclusion -

125
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,478
- that the bedrock,
the Finnish bedrock -

126
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,074
- 1.8 billion years old -

127
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,950
- is the medium that we can
predict far into the future.

128
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,830
At least 100000 years ahead.

129
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,314
A very important factor is that
the repository is self-contained.

130
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,994
We shouldn"t have
to guard it in the future.

131
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,516
It should just be able to be left.

132
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,357
And that"s a necessity. Because
conditions on the ground will change.

133
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,796
The conditions down
in the rock will be stable.

134
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,873
But on the surface you never
know what"s going to happen.

135
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,236
There could be wars, there could
be an economic depression.

136
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,396
At the surface
the clock runs very fast.

137
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,917
In the rock
it goes very, very slowly.

138
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,992
It"s the most stable
environment we know of.

139
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,394
Olklluoto, Eurajokl
has been chosen

140
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,997
- as the slte of the dlsposal
faclllty for spent nuclear fuel.

141
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,718
Onkalo.

142
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,711
Where are you now on the plan?

143
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,158
We"re here somewhere.

144
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,429
Then we"II start widening this area.
More, more, a bigger area comes.

145
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,353
Like a big cave, or...

146
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,957
An unimaginable big cave...
it"s like a big city underground.

147
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,957
The repository acts like a cocoon,
if you like, a Russian doll.

148
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,669
With barriers that
complement each other.

149
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,469
If one barrier might fail -

150
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,760
- other barriers are able to
mitigate all the consequences.

151
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,710
The flnal dlsposal faclllty
wlll be constructed In stages -

152
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,316
- and decommlssloned In the 2100s.

153
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,798
When It Is ready-

154
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,919
- a thlck concrete closure
Is cast at the tunnel mouth.

155
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,795
We will fill the chambers of Onkalo
with nuclear waste from Finland, -

156
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,633
- one little country in the north.

157
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,032
After one century we will seal
Onkalo for all eternity, -

158
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,988
- just like the tombs
in the Pyramids were sealed -

159
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,993
- never to be opened again.

160
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,034
The safety of disposal
shall not be dependent -

161
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,514
- on any active management,
or active surveillance, -

162
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,390
- or any acts of
human beings to be safe.

163
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,710
So it has to be fully passive.

164
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,509
The repository will be closed down;
it will be back filled.

165
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,239
The idea of this back filling
is to return the conditions -

166
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,316
- to those which prevailed
before we excavated the tunnel.

167
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,800
There will be forests,
there will be houses.

168
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,709
Hopefully
there will still be people, -

169
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,317
- not perhaps the same persons
who were there from the beginning.

170
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,835
But perhaps their
children and grandchildren -

171
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,151
- will still live
and use the land.

172
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,639
We always bring up
the question of the Ice Age -

173
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,476
- as some kind of very
dramatic change -

174
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,030
- in the situation.
And of course it will have an impact.

175
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,396
If we look at our
assumptions and scenarios -

176
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,473
- it will happen
within 60000 years from now.

177
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,916
So everything... disappears...

178
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,914
...disappears from here
when the ice comes.

179
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,270
Everything gets frozen,
the vegetation will die -

180
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,558
- and then this will be
more like a... tundra.

181
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,589
Would it be forgotten
during an ice age?

182
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,233
Yes, I think it would be
forgotten in such a case.

183
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:52,189
If you were a person evaluating
this concept from the outside -

184
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,272
- what would you be afraid of?

185
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,910
Nothing.

186
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,313
Once upon a time
man learned to master fire, -

187
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,792
- something no other living creature
had done before him.

188
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,350
Man conquered the entire world.

189
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,274
One day he found a new fire, -

190
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,237
- a fire so powerful that it could
never be extinguished.

191
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,072
Man revelled in the thought -

192
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,074
- that he now possessed
the powers of the universe.

193
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,189
Then in horror he realised that his
new fire could not only create, -

194
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,035
- but also destroy.
Not only could it burn on land, -

195
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,714
- but inside all living creatures, -

196
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,634
- inside his children,
the animals, all crops.

197
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,229
Man looked around for help
but found none.

198
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:07,350
And so he built a burial chamber deep
in the bowels of the earth, -

199
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,640
- a hiding place for the fire to burn
...into eternity.

200
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,154
You are now in the tunnel.

201
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,913
This place is not
a place of honour.

202
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,876
No esteemed deeds
are commemorated here.

203
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,679
You should not have come here.

204
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,028
You are heading towards a
place where you should never go.

205
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,158
What is there is
dangerous and repulsive.

206
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,674
The danger will still be present,
in your time, as it is in ours.

207
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,313
Please turn around
and never come back.

208
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,355
There is nothing here for you.
Go no further.

209
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,469
My personal belief -

210
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,196
- is that no human intrusion will
take place at any time scale ever.

211
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,510
We recognized that this could happen.
That you might find and open Onkalo.

212
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,638
We refer to it as "human intrusion".

213
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,349
We don"t want this to happen
because you may get hurt.

214
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,794
But most of all -

215
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,748
- we are afraid of human intrusion
because if Onkalo is opened, -

216
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,310
- the waste will no longer be
isolated from all living organisms -

217
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,471
- and we will have failed.

218
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,111
In fact we consider you the main
threat to the safety of Onkalo.

219
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,990
If someone in the future is able
to dig down to the repository -

220
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:31,599
- it will probably be a civilization
of the same kind as we have.

221
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,389
In such a case they would
also be knowledgeable -

222
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,394
- to know that
this is radioactive material.

223
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,797
I think that"s the most probable
scenario but l"m not so sure.

224
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,757
It could be another situation.

225
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,276
I think if someone found
a facility like that in the future -

226
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,911
- they might interpret it
as something religious.

227
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,389
A burial ground.

228
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,950
Or a treasure.

229
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,753
If we look at the pyramids, -

230
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,276
- we cannot really say that
we understand everything -

231
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,353
- about the significance
of their erection.

232
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,999
But we can assume that
this could be the same -

233
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,754
- for our repository.

234
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,594
It will be interpreted the same way
as we interpret the pyramids.

235
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,080
There is no clear understanding
and it is quite possible -

236
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,597
- that we will not be
understood by the future, -

237
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,309
- especially
by the distant future.

238
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,318
What if someone
finds the repository?

239
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,358
How should they know what it is?

240
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,313
They should have some measuring
tools to measure the radiation.

241
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,074
What if they don"t have that?

242
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,313
Then they"II have
to make a chemical analysis.

243
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,755
What if they can"t do that?

244
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,230
Then they cannot
do the drilling either.

245
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,874
Ancient civilizations have
done remarkable things.

246
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,068
Look at the mining
industry in Sweden -

247
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,110
- in the 16th century; they went
down several hundred meters.

248
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,272
We must realize that
the future scenarios -

249
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,639
- are notjust hi-tech or very
low-tech stone-age scenarios.

250
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,756
We have scenarios in the middle -

251
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,992
- where people may drill
but may not understand, -

252
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,392
- may not have the technology
to understand what they meet.

253
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,152
The Roman empire was born,
lived, prospered, and died.

254
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,396
Similarly also the West will go
through the same kind of phases.

255
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,749
Being born, flourishing,
developing, crumbling, and dying.

256
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,833
What do we know about
society in 300 years?

257
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,470
Virtually impossible
to say anything.

258
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,917
We might expect society
as we know it -

259
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,709
- to exist for 50 years more.
For 100 years.

260
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,713
If you are convinced
of what will happen then, -

261
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,476
- let"s put the question
on 300 years, 500 years" time.

262
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,154
Then the darkness thickens.

263
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,750
We know that
society changes very fast.

264
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,639
Could we imagine
a society in the future -

265
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,079
- where science and technology did
not matter as they matter for us?

266
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,074
Well, that is of course
entirely possible.

267
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,949
They might go up in technology,
they might go down.

268
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,829
And we don"t really know. If we
assume something in the future -

269
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,710
- they could go back
to the Neanderthal.

270
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:27,835
I think it is the changes
that we will... get short for.

271
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,951
The design and the construction,
the implementation has to be done -

272
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,159
- so that no knowledge
is necessary for the future.

273
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,551
So that it can be safe
also in the case -

274
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,030
- that people have
lost the knowledge.

275
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,790
We used to have a joke.

276
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,715
"When we start the
digging for the repository -

277
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,953
- the first thing we will experience
is a copper canister -

278
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,079
- of exactly the same
kind we want to place ourselves."

279
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,590
Of course you would start to think:
"There must be a reason for this."

280
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,753
You have the scenario
of the hidden treasure.

281
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,198
You have the idea that something
is there, that it is valuable.

282
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,909
People would start to dig for it.

283
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,595
You could have the scenario
where people even know -

284
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,753
- it"s dangerous. But it"s also
valuable at the same time.

285
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:44,034
Could the waste also in the future
have the value of gold or even more?

286
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,471
Well, just to answer the question
honestly, yes, it could.

287
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,437
It is a treasure.

288
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:03,676
There is a lot of copper, uranium,
plutonium... It could be valuable.

289
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,279
What is unpredictable
is human behaviour.

290
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,797
Who knows why people
might come and drill a hole?

291
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,556
There must be a reason
to start to dig down 500 metres -

292
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,518
- in just average
ordinary rock!

293
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,956
But what could prevent them
from doing that?

294
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,909
I wouldn"t know.

295
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,313
Could it be that the knowledge
of what"s there is incomplete?

296
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,996
- Of course.
- What if a sign said "Don"t drill"?

297
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,953
That might be a case for, let"s say,
a certain period of a time at least.

298
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,989
- What do you mean?
- If you put a marker...

299
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,276
They"re called markers.

300
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,908
So this is a concept that...

301
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,834
It"s an idea which has been
been thought over.

302
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,992
An area
where disposal has been made -

303
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,549
- could be marked using markers.

304
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,999
The obvious marker
is an object with text on.

305
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,151
Just like a rune stone.

306
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,510
This is a typical marker -

307
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,471
- with messages repeated in different
United Nation languages.

308
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,191
General information about the area,
and more detailed information also.

309
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,592
And that in turn is part
of a whole marker system -

310
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,118
- where you might have
more detailed information yet -

311
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,353
- if you went to another
place at that same site.

312
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,115
There would be a message
kiosk, for instance.

313
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,273
It is a more detailed message
than the one on the monolith.

314
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,710
Further on you"d have messages
like a small library in carved rock.

315
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,110
Perhaps underground.

316
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,953
What would be
the content of the information?

317
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,309
To say that this is not an important
place; it is a place of danger.

318
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,076
Stay away from the site.
And not disturbing the site.

319
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,754
We will leave written
information for you -

320
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,151
- in all the major
languages of our time.

321
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,113
Will you understand any of them?
Can you read?

322
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,759
And that"s of course
a mind-boggling scenario.

323
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,832
How do you communicate?

324
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,350
We won"t speak the same language.
They won"t have the same symbols.

325
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,719
We have to find
something very general.

326
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,635
This is where the cartoon comes in, -

327
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,828
- with low sophistication
but a robust message.

328
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,633
This is an attempt
to give you a feeling, -

329
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,997
- rather than a detailed message.

330
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,109
Intuitively you would expect people
to react to something frightening -

331
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,909
- better than to a detailed message.

332
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,477
Forbidding blocks,
"Landscape of Thorn", -

333
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,712
- landscapes
that would get you to feel -

334
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,440
- that this is
something which is wrong, -

335
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,672
- this is something not inviting.

336
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,836
When you opened Onkalo,
did you see "Landscapes of Thorn?"

337
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,833
Did it make
you hesitate?

338
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,198
Or maybe curious?
What drove you to enter?

339
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,839
Was it the scars we left
on the surface? Or a rumour?

340
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,392
In terms of emotional information, -

341
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,953
- there was an interest in a picture
by Edvard Munch, "The Scream".

342
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,955
To portray something
that was negative.

343
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,115
It shows the feeling of despair.

344
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,479
It is very clear to the observer
that it"s not something good.

345
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,830
But do you think this will be
clear to all ages, all times?

346
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,357
I think it has a fair chance,
yes, I do.

347
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,752
- It"s universal?
- Universal for humans.

348
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,351
We are not sure how
to overcome the problem -

349
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,398
- of leaving markers to warn you.

350
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,394
Messages from long-Iost civilizations
were found in our times -

351
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,030
- but it took years to understand
the language and the signs.

352
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,509
Some, we still cannot read.

353
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,954
If we put something that is
not completely understandable -

354
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,514
- and the future people don"t
understand what it means -

355
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,036
- they"II want to find out.
People are curious.

356
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:28,399
Take the example of the rune
stone in Norway found face down.

357
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,795
It has a requirement that
no one should move this...

358
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,396
"It should not be touched
by misguided men".

359
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,912
But of course this warning was
not supported by archaeologists.

360
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,674
They disregarded it completely.

361
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,037
So this is a quite
probable fate -

362
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,749
- of a marker in
the distant future.

363
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,954
If we put those markers there, -

364
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,476
- it"s not clear that they understand
the point that it"s dangerous.

365
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,350
And even if they understood, they
still may want to know what it is.

366
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,155
Then there is
the philosophical point -

367
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,869
- that some people think that
it would be better to forget, -

368
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,474
- because then
it would be less likely -

369
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,474
- that anybody would hit
exactly the repository.

370
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,154
It has been discussed
to let the facility be forgotten.

371
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,197
Yes, I guess there
are two schools here.

372
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,992
Those who think you have to
leave markers on the ground -

373
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,517
- and those who say
it would be better to walk away -

374
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,557
- and forget about the site.

375
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,836
Do you actually think -

376
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,348
- that leaving markers
creates a higher risk of intrusion?

377
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,956
Well, I would say so, yes.

378
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,191
Personally -

379
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,711
- I don"t see the situation as severe
if the site is forgotten over time.

380
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,117
But how is it possible to create
oblivion and forgetting?

381
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,957
How is it possible to make a facility
like Onkalo disappear from...

382
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,874
Well, you say it,
you say it, it"s not very easy.

383
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,670
When the burial chamber
was complete -

384
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,470
- man laid his new fire to rest,
and tried to forget about it, -

385
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,428
- for he knew that only through
oblivion would he be free from it.

386
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,909
But then he started to worry -

387
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,674
- that his children
might find the chamber -

388
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,389
- and awaken
the fire from its sleep.

389
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,395
So he bade his children
to tell their children -

390
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,393
- and their children"s children too -

391
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,152
- to remember
forever -

392
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,313
- to consign
the burial chamber to oblivion.

393
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,153
To remember forever
to forget.

394
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,032
Some of the main principles
included in the legislation -

395
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,639
- are firstly, limit the burden on
future generations, -

396
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,830
- so we should not impose undue
burdens on future generations.

397
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,993
The second principle is the
protection of future generations.

398
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,395
That means the safety
level for future generations -

399
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,678
- should not be lower
than we are enjoying currently.

400
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,673
And the third principle -

401
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,072
- is that we should pass
information about the repository -

402
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,038
- to future generations.

403
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,237
Our law states that we
must inform you about Onkalo:

404
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,558
Maybe you will need to enter -

405
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,633
- if we"ve overlooked something
or if repairs are required.

406
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,390
Were our calculations and
assumptions accurate?

407
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,958
Did we make mistakes?
Is that why you are here?

408
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,396
Knowledge transfer...
what does the law say about it?

409
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,950
I don"t think it says anything yet.

410
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,439
- Are you sure?
- No.

411
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,798
It is required in law
that assessment is made.

412
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,269
But it is not popular.

413
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:47,198
Many people react to it.
They think it"s too ambitious.

414
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,069
It requires
that each generation -

415
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,277
- let"s say -

416
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,398
- looks at whether
the system is adequate.

417
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,111
But the legislation says that you
should pass on the information.

418
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,999
It doesn"t talk about generations.

419
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,709
It says that it should provide -

420
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,396
- the repository information
in a permanent manner.

421
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,917
"In a permanent manner".
That"s the phrasing.

422
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,038
What do you think they mean by that?

423
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,839
I think you should ask them.

424
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,755
Because we"ve just talked
about the problems of that.

425
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,753
"Permanent" is too strong a word
to use here.

426
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,959
And what about the people
who work with these things?

427
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,989
They get the scientific disease,
so to say.

428
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,836
It"s all routine for them.
They have "the task".

429
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,073
- I don"t really understand.
- I don"t think anybody does.

430
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,755
Responsibility is moved
to the state -

431
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,434
- after they"ve decided -

432
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,390
- that this has been now done
in an acceptable way.

433
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,874
So the Finnish state is responsible
for passing on information?

434
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,636
- Into the future?
- Yes, yes.

435
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,794
Does that mean that when you deliver
the information about the facility, -

436
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,997
- it is in a way -

437
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,914
- that is comprehensible for all
future generations to understand?

438
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,709
No, no. There is no requirement of
making that comprehensible -

439
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,429
- for all future generations;
it depends that it"s in Finnish.

440
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,993
We have no archives with
information on nuclear waste yet.

441
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,915
If we build archives future societies
and new generations -

442
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,119
- must maintain the information
and update the language.

443
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,436
But can we count on continuation
for thousands of generations?

444
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,628
What if people
starve and suffer?

445
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,598
What if there are wars
or floods or fires?

446
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,759
The archives have
the same requirements -

447
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,675
- as our interim storages.
Requirements we cannot guarantee.

448
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,313
After all, this is why
we are building Onkalo.

449
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,153
The point is that the safety of
the disposal and the repository -

450
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,629
- is not dependent on these records.

451
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,031
But then why is this law needed?

452
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,952
I don"t know.

453
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,396
The legislators
have decided that the record -

454
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,156
- shall be handed over to state.
But it doesn"t say more than that.

455
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,152
So the idea is that the archive
of today should last for a period -

456
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,232
- but then be renewed
by next generations?

457
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,198
Yes.
Each generation should consider -

458
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,912
- if the archiving method
is appropriate for the future.

459
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,956
Do you think this will happen?

460
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,712
Yes. I hope so, at least!

461
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,794
Can we learn anything from the past -

462
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,351
- that may help us communicate
100000 years into the future?

463
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,753
Usually, when we look at these
time scales we go back in time.

464
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,436
Obviously, when you go
100000 years back in the past, -

465
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,593
- we come to our ancestors in Africa.

466
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,754
And we also
cover our ancestors in Europe -

467
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,799
- in the form of the Neanderthal man.

468
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,839
And you realise
that we have very little in common.

469
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,594
How would you make a parallel -

470
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,788
- from people
hunting a mammoth with spears?

471
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:23,595
It is difficult to explain to these
people something with nuclear waste.

472
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,233
We cannot assume that
people or creatures in the future -

473
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,517
- will really understand
very much.

474
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,071
But they might have different
kinds of senses than we have?

475
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,677
Yes. Senses, appearances,
needs, and knowledge.

476
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:47,916
Everything goes away. There is no
one true statement that will survive.

477
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,710
Do you basically trust
the future generations?

478
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,476
We are trying to do Onkalo -

479
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,030
- as independent of human nature
as possible.

480
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,316
Because we can"t predict -

481
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,315
- exactly how the humans
will behave in the future.

482
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,277
It is very difficult
to answer that question.

483
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,754
Because... trust...
and that aspect also...

484
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,439
I cannot say that I trust but
I cannot say that I don"t trust.

485
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,356
It"s an open question, -

486
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,672
- whether it"s a possibility -

487
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:01,278
- that anyone will interpret
anything at all in this time scale.

488
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,113
I have to say -

489
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,512
- that the quick answer is
nobody knows anything at all.

490
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,960
If we cannot rely on markers
and archives how will you know?

491
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,034
Maybe our legends will reach you -

492
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,318
- by being told over and over
from generation to generation -

493
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,597
- like ancient legends
have reached us?

494
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,230
Were you warned about Onkalo
through legend?

495
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,595
Did your parents tell you stories -

496
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,912
- about the fire in the chamber
deep in the bowels of the earth?

497
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,190
The chamber you must always
remember to forget?

498
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,749
Onkalo is our very first permanent
repository for nuclear waste.

499
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,592
But when Onkalo is sealed -

500
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,797
- it will hold only a fraction
of the waste we have.

501
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,313
We must build many Onkalos far
from earthquakes and volcanoes -

502
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,711
- to keep the waste away
from the surface of the earth.

503
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,712
We must build many more
chambers we hope to hide from you.

504
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,110
Do you think it"s reasonable to
talk about a nuclear renaissance?

505
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,510
Many people seem to think so.

506
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,832
And many politicians believe
that nuclear energy is needed...

507
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,270
...to curb the CO2 emissions
from electricity production.

508
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,872
If we"re going to take the people
in China and in India -

509
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,034
- to the same level as the western
countries in the next twenty years -

510
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,034
- you have to start
three new nuclear reactors a day.

511
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,672
Spent fuel is considered as a
material that could be reprocessed.

512
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,990
It could be used again.

513
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,715
We shouldn"t reprocess it.

514
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,757
Due to the fact that in such a case -

515
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,833
- the plutonium, which is extracted
in the reprocessing process -

516
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,111
- could escape,
and be used for fabricating bombs.

517
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,118
There has been
research into transmutation -

518
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,957
- in the hope that the waste
could be made harmless.

519
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,554
- Is that a possibility?
- Theoretically yes.

520
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,518
But in practice probably never.

521
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:27,038
We will never be able to do away with
all the nuclear waste in that way.

522
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,879
So there is no way
around nuclear waste?

523
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,873
At the moment
nobody"s found a way around it.

524
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,430
If you want to use nuclear energy,
we will have nuclear waste.

525
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,078
I am not so sure that
nuclear energy is the solution.

526
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,357
Maybe in the short term.
That"s my personal view, too.

527
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:03,709
But I don"t think
it"s sustainable in the long run.

528
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:09,159
- Maybe for the next decade. Century.
- Why do you think so?

529
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,312
Because we won"t
have enough uranium.

530
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,199
It"II be just like the oil.

531
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,194
I think we all can agree that
oil isn"t a sustainable solution.

532
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,273
And we will come there
with the uranium assets, too.

533
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,719
Running out of energy sources -

534
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,716
- could lead to very
unstable conditions globally -

535
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,749
- because those last energy
sources will be competed for -

536
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,914
- and this can even lead
to wars between nations.

537
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,556
The point with the permanent
disposal is that it"s permanent.

538
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:03,352
It"s put underground permanently
and you never change it.

539
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:10,353
We have coined the term
"decisions under uncertainty".

540
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,274
And that is clear
in the nuclear waste issue.

541
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,750
There are decisions
under uncertainty.

542
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,399
When you do a project like this
you must state what you know, -

543
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,519
- and you must state that you know
what you know that you don"t know.

544
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,719
And also what you don"t know
that you don"t know.

545
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,473
Could you now try
to address the audience?

546
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,997
I mean the future audience,
the far future audience?

547
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,475
I personally have a strong belief -

548
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:12,718
- that no human intrusion
will take place ever into Onkalo.

549
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,110
But if I am wrong...

550
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,397
I would love to be able to meet you -

551
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,348
- and to try to communicate with you.

552
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:28,709
This is probably
the only testimony of our time...

553
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,438
You are now entering a repository
with spent nuclear fuel...

554
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:40,470
- It must be stored in a safe place.
- It should not be disturbed.

555
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,677
Don"t go there. It"s dangerous.
It"s radioactive.

556
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,593
You can"t see it.
You can"t smell it.

557
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,911
- Don"t touch anything.
- Go back up to the surface.

558
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,072
Take better care of our world
than we did.

559
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,118
You will be safe
if you stay away from it.

560
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,508
Good luck.

561
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,795
You have now gone
deeper into the tunnel.

562
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,030
And you have reached a place
where you should never have come.

563
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,033
Down here radiation is everywhere.

564
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,671
You do not know it, but something is
happening to your body right now.

565
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,151
It is beyond your senses.

566
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,233
You feel nothing.
You smell nothing.

567
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,679
An invisible light
is shining right through you.

568
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,710
It is the last glow
of my civilization, -

569
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,316
- that harvested
the powers of the universe.

570
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:33,918
A vast black sleep

571
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:41,029
Descends upon my llfe

572
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:52,429
Sleep, all hope

573
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:03,633
Sleep, all deslre!

574
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:18,196
I no longer see anythlng

575
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:23,393
I lose my memory

576
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:31,189
Of the bad and the good

577
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:45,512
Oh, the sad story!

578
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,557
I am a cradle

579
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,638
Rocked by a hand

580
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:20,114
In the depths of the vault

581
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,589
Sllence!

582
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,079
Sllence!
