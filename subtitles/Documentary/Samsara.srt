1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Samsara

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Sonam...

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,900
Oh no, not again!

4
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,600
How long?

5
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Three years, three months,
three weeks and three days.

6
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,800
Tashi, we are taking you back.

7
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Tashi, it is time.

8
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,100
Tashi, you pushed it too far.

9
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,700
"How can one prevent a drop of water
from ever drying up?"

10
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,600
Apo is back...

11
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Kala!

12
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
Now, I must leave.

13
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Safe return!

14
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,100
No. I want to go home!

15
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,000
Tashi, did you cry when,

16
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
...you father left you here?

17
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,900
The head lama, His holiness Chen Tulku

18
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,600
...will be performing a
sacred initiation in five days.

19
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
He asks that you attend.

20
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,200
So prince Siddhartha
left his palace

21
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,700
and luxurious life...

22
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,800
...and from his golden chariot...

23
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,000
saw suffering for the first time!

24
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Thus one night,
prince Siddhartha decided...

25
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,000
...to leave his beautiful wife,
Princess Yashodhara...

26
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,000
and his son, Rahul, and go away.

27
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300
He left his son?

28
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
Well, yes.

29
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Because he wanted to find out
true cause of our suffering and...

30
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,800
I want to go home!

31
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,100
Tashi, Rinpochey is here!

32
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,900
After twenty years studying
in our monastery...

33
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,100
...Lama Tashi completed
three years of meditation,

34
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,100
Truly this is the
path towards Nirvana.

35
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
His Holiness, Dhyan Rinpochey...

36
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,300
has therefore awarded Lama Tashi
the precious 'Khenpo' degree...

37
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,800
in recognition of his achievement.

38
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,200
He is a very good monk!

39
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Kala, you monkey!

40
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,300
Tashi... You spoke!

41
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,400
It was him.

42
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,400
Kala...hear my voice, what?

43
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Rinpochey, thank you.
For Tashi...

44
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,000
Precious degree of Khenpo.

45
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,100
For Kala... nothing.

46
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,000
Jhulley! Tashi Delek!

47
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,100
Hail! Hail! Hail!

48
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,200
... to four noble truths!

49
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
-Who? -Tashi.

50
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,500
Faster, faster, faster...

51
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,400
Can you explain what's going on?

52
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,900
Apo, I ask that you take
Lama Tashi with you tomorrow

53
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,700
for the harvest ceremony.

54
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
I feel he is in need of
some fresh air.

55
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,300
Tashi, next time you wish to
modify a performance...

56
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,100
...please let me know in advance.

57
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,400
Where is Tenzin Thorgay's house?

58
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,400
Right There.

59
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,400
Come, I will take you there.

60
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,000
Tashi Delek, jhulley, welcome.

61
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
Oh Apo...

62
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,400
My head...

63
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,000
Last night I have...

64
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,500
Yes, I know.

65
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,900
Dreams are like that!

66
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,800
So Tashi still dreams?

67
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
You see, even you can be angry.

68
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,500
Here, the map. You leave at dawn.

69
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,700
It is time to choose.

70
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,200
Kala!

71
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,800
What is it with you today?!

72
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,500
Kala... when did you
learn to read maps?!

73
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,400
Jhulley, Tashi Delek!

74
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,500
The venerable Khenpo Apo sent me...

75
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,900
No speech?

76
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,000
Understood, only body and mind!

77
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:57,100
"Everything you contact is a
place to practice the Way"

78
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,100
Where's Apo?

79
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:43,100
Even He was allowed a worldly
existence until he was 29!

80
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,100
But since the age of five
I've been...

81
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,400
...disciplined to live like Buddha
after He renounced the world.

82
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,400
Why?

83
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,100
How do we know that
His Enlightenment...

84
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,300
...was not a direct result of
His worldly existence, too?

85
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,400
Apo, where is that freedom
promised to me...

86
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
...after a strict 
monastic discipline?

87
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,700
Where is the promised satisfaction,

88
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,500
from our vow of celibacy?

89
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,600
"You should not accept
my teachings on hearsay...

90
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,300
...unless and until
you understand it...

91
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,000
...from your own point of view"
he said once.

92
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,600
There are things we must unlearn...

93
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,700
...in order to learn them.

94
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,300
And there are things we must own...

95
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,400
...in order to renounce them.

96
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,700
Tashi...

97
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,600
Your dream back in the village
wasn't a dream.

98
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,800
But...

99
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,000
Kala?

100
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,900
Kala.

101
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,700
Kala! It's me!

102
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,000
Kala!

103
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,700
Kala.

104
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,500
For the rest we talk tomorrow.

105
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,000
Dolma, we have
another mouth to feed.

106
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,500
A nomad.

107
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,000
I told him he could work until
the harvest was done.

108
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,700
It will reduce some of my work.

109
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,600
And of course...

110
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,300
...increase mine!

111
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,700
Sujata, here.

112
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,600
Oh mother, some more.

113
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,000
Pema.

114
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,600
Take some food over to that
new hardworking guy.

115
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,300
Tell him he can even
stop to eat it!

116
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,200
Enough, father!

117
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,400
Hey Mister! Take a little rest,

118
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,900
make a little break for lun...

119
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,400
Pema!

120
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,400
Pema... wait!

121
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,200
Do not tell me that you
did this for me...

122
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,700
No, I did it for myself as well.

123
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,900
But why? I am sorry
if this is my fault,

124
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,500
Shhh... Pema please.

125
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,300
Maybe I was wrong to do that
but l...

126
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,500
All I wanted to do was
comfort you for a moment.

127
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,400
And look now.

128
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,300
Are you sure that it was
all about a momentary comfort?

129
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:33,000
If you are, then I will be gone
... before the sun rises.

130
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,900
From now on you will
go out wearing this!

131
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,600
Roaming here and there!

132
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,100
I gave you a job and this is
how you repay me?

133
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,700
You worthless...

134
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,400
Oh, it's you!? Forgive my violence!

135
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,500
No, no.

136
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,400
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

137
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,800
He WAS A LAMA!

1
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,900
Pema, what are we going to do?

2
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,700
Your family has already accepted
my engagement with you.

3
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,100
I know. Should I wash your hair?

4
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,400
I have nothing else but you.

5
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,700
Astrologer will be here tomorrow.

6
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,900
I let him decide my destiny.

7
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,600
Pema, but why the Astrologer?

8
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:30,100
Planets indicate the 1Oth would be an
auspicious date for the wedding.

9
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,100
So fix it for that day.

10
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,200
That's good. I am sorry.

11
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,600
But... the wedding is with whom?

12
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:00,100
With whom? I think it was all
decided last night!

13
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,700
Jamayang came to see me
and requested to come here...

14
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,600
...and decide the wedding date
of Pema and Tashi.

15
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,900
Why? Why did you do it?

16
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,700
Jamayang?

17
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,900
Even if the decision was
in my favor...

18
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
you wouldn't have married me,
anyway! Would you?

19
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,400
Woman will dominate!

20
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,800
Hey, stop, eat now!

21
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,700
Cry when I tell you.

22
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,300
Something is wrong.

23
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,400
-Who is he?
-My husband.

24
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,100
What's going on?

25
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,000
After all the years
we've worked together.

26
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,300
Tenzin, you allow him to doubt me?

27
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,800
Now you can cry, my son.

28
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,200
You better start building
a new granary.

29
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,000
You're going to be needing a lot
of storage space from now on.

30
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:31,400
Tashi, I feel we are satisfied
in what we get.

31
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,400
Besides, you HAVE to sell it to him.

32
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,000
No one else comes to this valley!

33
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,300
Let me take our harvest to town!

34
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,600
I'll sell it all.

35
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,900
We'll teach Dawa a lesson!

36
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,700
And what makes you think,

37
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,200
those city guys will buy from us?

38
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,600
What is that?

39
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,400
For a safe journey.

40
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,300
One man, five Rupees.

41
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,600
Two men, ten Rupees.

42
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,800
You see, even notes don't
fit in your purse!

43
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,100
Wow, incredible!

44
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,500
More than twice of what Dawa pays!

45
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,700
Tashi, you are too much!

46
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,200
Guess what?

47
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,300
Now the bank-notes
fit into my purse!

48
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,100
Your father has also
gone with Tashi!

49
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,100
I know.

50
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:58,800
You don't understand!
Why change traditional practice?

51
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,700
Dawa buys everyone's crops for years!

52
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,800
It is dangerous to oppose him.

53
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,500
Jamayang. Fetch my mother!

54
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,400
Go, go...

55
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,700
Now who would this be?

56
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,200
It's me!

57
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,600
So it seems you've been to town?

58
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,900
We've been working.

59
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,900
I can see that.
Hiding your grain?

60
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,800
That's easy.

61
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Hiding from me, that's harder.

62
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,200
You better remember that.

63
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,200
Besides, what did I tell you?

64
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,300
He's ruining the whole valley!

65
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,400
Look at you!

66
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,700
'Salley!'

67
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,400
It's Pema! The baby's coming!

68
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,800
No! Women only!

69
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,700
I see! A great soul is
already reborn here!

70
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,300
What a beautiful boy.

71
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,700
A great spirit has surely returned!

72
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,000
Maybe, you're a Tulku, Karma?

73
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,500
So it's settled?

74
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,100
The next is Sujata. Where...

75
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
No! Keep all my money!

76
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,500
Just keep passing it on to me!

77
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,600
Pema knows what to do.

78
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,900
She always pays me
the day we leave.

79
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And how long has that been?

80
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,800
I am nineteen.

81
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,000
Figure out the rest!

82
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,900
Your money!

83
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,700
I wish you a safe return.

84
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,700
See you next year!

85
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,100
Karma, that's very good.

86
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,900
This wool is so heavy!

87
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,300
Oh, you're still carrying it!

88
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,000
-What's inside the momos, Apa?
-Meat.

89
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,600
-Where does the meat come from?
-From a goat.

90
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,100
Did you have to kill the goat
to take its meat?

91
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,900
Yes.

92
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,800
But mother says...

93
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,300
...we shouldn't kill any creature,
not even an insect!

94
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,100
We didn't kill the goat.
Someone did it for us.

95
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,100
Why someone else?

96
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,100
Why didn't we kill the
goat ourselves, Apa?

97
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,700
Less talking and more eating, Karma.

98
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,900
Stop! Wear something warm.

99
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,200
-Let him go.
-But, it is freezing outside!

100
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,200
Let him find that out.
No over-protection!

101
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,100
It is freezing!

102
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:43,100
So you see, it IS freezing outside!

103
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,500
Is everything all right?

104
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,500
It's just the ...migrant workers.

105
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,300
Maybe we don't need so many.

106
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,100
I sometimes wonder if
we need them at all.

107
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,900
They cost so much money!

108
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:46,000
I want you to tell me
what will happen to that stick.

109
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,300
It will drown!

110
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,100
Suppose it doesn't.

111
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:07,300
It will get stuck in the rocks!

112
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,900
Suppose it doesn't get stuck?

113
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,400
We don't really need
all these workers?

114
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:21,000
What is it you suddenly have
against our poor workers?

115
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,500
It will stay in the water and rot!

116
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,600
No.

117
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,300
It will get stuck in the whirlpool...

118
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:33,200
...or it can go down
with a waterfall and crash!

119
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:37,100
Suppose even that doesn't happen.

120
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,300
What then?

121
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,200
Do you give up?

122
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,600
The answer's simple.

123
01:34:53,500 --> 01:35:00,000
The stick will reach the sea!

124
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,200
Jamayang, congratulations.

125
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,900
I heard, you are soon
going to be married.

126
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,100
By the way...

127
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,400
...we're taking our harvest
into town.

128
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:38,600
Don't you think it's time
you joined us?

129
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,000
I sell only to Dawa,
like I always have.

130
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,300
Like my father did.

131
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,900
But you know Dawa cheats you.

132
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,200
After all these years...

133
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:53,400
...you still don't know
how things work here, do you!

134
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,300
We are back! And look!

135
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:39,100
Apa! What did you do
when you were a boy?

136
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:43,600
He always made his own toys!

137
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,500
Jamayang...

138
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,400
Please, you don't need him any more!

139
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,600
Hey stop!

140
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:47,200
I don't even know why
I bother with this valley.

141
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,200
Jamayang, let him go. Listen...

142
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,300
And prepare yourselves to
eat all what you grow!

143
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,800
You can sell in the town with us.

144
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,600
You chased him away.

145
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,800
Everything you touch, you ruin!

146
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,800
Dawa!

147
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,500
Jamayang is hot-headed.

148
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:18,100
He will calm down
once he is married.

149
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,100
Let him go his own way.

150
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,700
Ama?

151
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,300
Karma, stay outside please!

152
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,400
Karma, you can come in.

153
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,400
What's the matter with him?

154
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,600
I told you we shouldn't
make love in front of him!

155
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:09,900
Help!

156
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:02,100
Apa says we saved
over half the crop!

157
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,000
Everyone came to help us.

158
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,500
The whole valley.

159
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,700
It's you, isn't it?

160
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,700
Why would I do a thing like that?
You're insane.

161
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:29,800
It wasn't me.

162
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,000
Then who, who?

163
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,800
Try! Take a guess!

164
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:05,100
You fool, why don't you try
asking your neighbours.

165
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:08,900
You think I burnt your field?

166
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:15,000
No one does such a thing here.
Grow up!

167
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:25,200
And you guys,
thank you for joining us.

168
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:29,200
Now why don't you
stay for dinner too!

169
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,700
'Salley!'

170
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,000
Are you sure you're old enough,

171
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,300
...to do business in town?

172
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,700
I'm a man now!

173
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,700
For a safe journey.

174
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Is Pema in?

175
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,000
We leave...

176
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:40,700
... my money?

177
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,100
Okay.

178
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,300
How old are you?

179
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:08,400
You ask me that every year!

180
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,100
Careful, it is fragile.

181
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,500
-I hear something!
-Don't move!

182
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,500
- ...someone... -Oh!

183
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,200
Hurry! Pema's coming!

184
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,900
My Sari, you tore it!

185
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,600
You must leave now.

186
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,400
Hurry! Leave.

187
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:37,300
What are you still doing here?
Pema's here.

188
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,100
Keep calm.

189
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,100
Why you're so worried.

190
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:44,500
She told me this would happen!

191
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,400
Look Apa, a pony just like yours!

192
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:21,500
I made it myself!

193
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:23,100
That's good.

194
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:29,700
This is for you.

195
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,000
Very nice. Thanks.

196
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,700
Aren't you going to...

197
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,700
Later, I have some work.

198
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,300
... try it on?

199
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:49,400
Tashi!

200
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:50,600
Sonam!

201
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:11,400
It's about Apo?

202
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:18,200
When Apo knew it was time...

203
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:27,800
...he went to prepare himself
in the sacred cave.

204
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:33,600
He asked that I accompany him.

205
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:40,800
We both meditated together until ...

206
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:49,300
He asked that I give you this.

207
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:18,200
I realize now that my
task is not over...

208
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:24,400
...and so I will be
returning to Samsara.

209
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,600
I know that we shall meet again.

210
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
Perhaps when we do...

211
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:38,200
...you will be able to tell me
what is more important:-

212
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,600
Satisfying one thousand desires

213
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:45,800
... or conquering just one.

214
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,200
Yours Apo.

215
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:18,000
I've heard so much about
wild-weddings in your region!

216
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:22,600
And for your marriage,
I should be there...

217
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:26,800
...but you know
I can't leave the farm.

218
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:31,500
It feels so strange knowing...

219
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:36,800
...I won't be coming back.

220
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:42,700
Look after yourself.

221
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,200
Yashodhara.

222
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,800
Do you know that name?

223
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:07,100
Prince Siddhartha, Gautama,

224
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,400
Sakyamuni, Buddha.

225
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,700
Everybody knows these names...

226
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:15,800
... but...

227
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,900
... Yashodhara?

228
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:33,900
Yashodhara was married
to Siddhartha.

229
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,900
She loved him dearly.

230
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:41,300
One night Siddhartha left her

231
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,900
and their son, Rahul ...

232
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:48,400
... while they were sleeping,
to seek Enlightenment...

233
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:50,300
... to become Buddha.

234
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:02,900
He did not even say
a word to her when he left.

235
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:12,900
Yashodhara has shown
compassion for the sick

236
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,700
... and ailing long before
Siddhartha ever did...

237
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,100
... long before Siddhartha
was even aware of suffering!

238
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:31,700
Who can say if he owed
his Enlightenment to her?

239
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,100
Pema ...

240
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,600
Perhaps Yashodhara wanted

241
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,900
to leave Siddhartha and Rahul.

242
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:03,000
How can we ever know if Yashodhara

243
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,900
fell victim to anger ...

244
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,300
... to loneliness or bitterness...

245
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:13,800
... after Siddhartha left her.

246
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:29,800
Who even thought about her?

247
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:53,100
What must she have said
when Rahul, her son...

248
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:57,900
...asked that eternal question:
Where is my father?

249
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:02,600
What must she have told him?

250
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:22,400
How could a mother leave her own
child in the middle of the night?

251
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,900
It is only possible
for a man to do.

252
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:31,500
Tashi, only for a man.

253
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:43,600
After that,
Yashodhara had no choice.

254
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:48,400
She had to lead a life
of renunciation.

255
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:55,500
She cut off her hair ...

256
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:02,400
... and lived like an ascetic.

257
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,100
Oh Tashi ...

258
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:32,600
If your thoughts toward Dharma
were of the same intensity ...

259
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,600
... as the love and passion
you have shown me...

260
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:41,500
... you would have become a Buddha ...

261
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,900
... in this very body ...

262
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,700
... in this very life.

263
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,500
Pema ...

264
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:58,300
Forgive me.

265
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,600
I am going back with you.
Back where I belong.

266
02:13:55,500 --> 02:14:02,400
"How can one prevent a drop of
water from ever drying up?"

267
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:23,900
By throwing it into the sea ...

268
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,300
The End
