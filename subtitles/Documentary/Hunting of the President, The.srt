in the southern colonies--

[ Scoffs ] Well,
as a matter of fact, I won´t,

[ Chuckling ]

300
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:05,554
[ Will ] There is a lengthy
legal precedent, Your Honor,
going back to 1789,

301
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,724
whereby a defendant
can claim self-defense against
an agent of the government...

302
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,194
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

303
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,395
[ Clears Throat ]
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

304
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:18,233
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote--
- 1887 ?

305
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,135
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

306
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:24,440
- He´s gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defense, sir,

307
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,242
by the Constitution
of the United States.

308
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:29,144
- Don´t tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

309
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,713
"Liberty," in case you´ve forgotten,
is a soul´s right to breathe.

310
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,316
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

311
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,685
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what ?

312
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,922
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

313
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:44,693
I´ve been sitting here
for ten minutes now lookin´ over
this rap sheet of yours.

I just can´t believe it.

Grand theft auto,
February of ´94.

00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,908
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

318
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:03,179
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,850
Joke. January ´95,
impersonating an officer.

Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

321
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:14,891
I´m also aware that you´ve been
through several foster homes.

00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:18,895
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You´re going in.

I don´t recall meeting anyone
who matches that description.
I think l´d remember.

Oh, all right, you got me. It´s the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

leave you alone all night.

- Yo, what´s up, baby ?

Oh, yeah,

I was wonderin´ maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

- Yeah ?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you ?

but, uh, there´s no chance
that you´re pre-law, is there ?

do you want ?

do you want ?

I´ve spoken to the judge,
and he´s agreed to release you
under my supervision.

00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,897
- Really ?
- Yeah.

354
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,838
- Under two conditions.
- What are those ?

355
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,542
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

356
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:12,945
- What for ?
- Go over the proof you´re working on,

357
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:17,783
get into
some more advanced...

358
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,853
combinatorial mathematics,

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,855
finite math.

Sounds like a real hoot.

361
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:31,630
And the second condition
is that--

362
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:34,000
that you see a therapist.

363
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:41,173
I´m responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

364
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:46,278
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

365
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:50,783
All right. I´ll do the math,
but l´m not gonna meet
with any fuckin´ therapist.

- Get out, Will.

439
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:44,083
I don´t need therapy.

440
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:47,953
- That´s enough. Get out !
- [ Imitating Spooky Sound ]

441
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:52,191
- I called Mel Weintraub
this morning to see--
- Oh, what´s the use ?

442
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,226
What do you want to do ?

443
00:32:56,261 --> 00:33:00,832
- [ Sighs ] Well, there´s someone.
- Who is he ?

444
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:06,371
He used to be my, uh--
my roommate in college.

445
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:13,846
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

446
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:15,882
It´s also very important
in a clinical situation.

447
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:18,818
Why is trust
the most important thing...

448
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:23,289
in making a breakthrough
with a client ?

449
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:27,860
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

- Vinnie.
- Um--

451
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,600
Because, uh--

452
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:37,637
Trust is, uh--
Trust is life.

453
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:41,374
Wow. That´s very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

454
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:44,177
[ Professor ] Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

455
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:47,647
If a patient doesn´t feel
safe enough trust you, then
they won´t be honest with you.

456
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,849
Then there´s really no point
for them being in therapy.

457
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:54,020
I mean, hey, if they don´t
trust you, you´re never gonna
get them to sleep with you.

458
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,090
That should be the goal
of any good therapist. Nail ´em
while they´re vulnerable.

459
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:58,859
That´s my motto.

460
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,461
Oh, good, everyone´s back.
Welcome back, everybody.

461
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:06,633
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

462
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:13,874
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

463
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:17,944
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field´s medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

464
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,814
- Hello.
- Anyone know what
the Field´s medal is ?

465
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:23,684
It´s a really big deal.
It´s like the Nobel prize for math.

466
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:28,789
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It´s a great thing.

467
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,959
It´s an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that´s it for today.

468
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:35,496
Thanks. We´ll see you Monday.
We´ll be talking about Freud.

469
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:38,867
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

470
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:43,404
- How are you ?
- It´s good to see you.

471
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:45,439
Good to see you.

472
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:49,076
- Sean, I think I got something
interesting for ya.
- Yeah ?

473
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,646
What, you have to have
blood and urine ? What´s up ?

474
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:54,048
Why didn´t you come
to the reunion ?

475
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:57,585
You know, l´m--
I´ve been busy.

476
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:59,621
- You were missed.
- Really ?

477
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:03,992
- So how long has it been
since we´ve seen each other ?
- Before Nancy died.

478
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:06,027
Yeah, l´m sorry.

479
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,763
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

480
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:10,498
I got your card.
It was nice.

- Come here.
- Now that´s a takedown.

483
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:21,843
Hey, what happened ?
Did you get leniency or what ?

484
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,615
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We´re gonna miss the game.

488
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:36,758
- I´ve got a full schedule.
I´m very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

489
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:39,829
This-This boy is incredible.
I´ve never seen anything like him.

490
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,298
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry ?

491
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:47,436
- You ever heard of Ramanujan ?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

492
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:52,240
It´s a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was lndian.

493
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:55,210
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

494
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:57,213
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in lndia.

495
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,715
He had no formal education.

496
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,284
- He had no access
to any scientific work.
- Coffee ?

497
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,586
- You, sir ?
- Just a little.

498
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:07,089
But he came across
this old math book,

499
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:09,759
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

500
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,794
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

501
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:14,931
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh--

502
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,101
- Well, he mailed it
to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

503
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:22,472
- And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:26,142
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

505
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:28,712
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

506
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,115
This-This Ramanujan--

507
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:35,185
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

508
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:38,688
- Well, this boy´s just like that.
- Hmm.

509
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:42,325
- But he´s-- he´s a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

510
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:44,393
I need someone
who can get through to him.

511
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:47,964
- Like me ?
- Yeah, like you.

512
00:36:48,064 --> 00:36:51,135
- Why ?
- Well, because you have
the same kind of background.

513
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:54,504
- What background ?
- Well, you´re from
the same neighborhood.

514
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:57,875
- He´s from Southie ?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:00,777
Boy genius from Southie.

516
00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:05,015
- How many shrinks you go to before me ?
- Five.

517
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,519
- Let me guess.
Barry ? Henry ? Not Rick ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

518
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:12,656
- Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week.
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:14,692
Please ?

It´s a poker game with this kid.
Don´t let him know what you´ve got.

521
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:24,134
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

522
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,571
It´s gonna be hard
for him to find.

Let´s let the healing begin.

- Yeah, please, Tom.

You, too, Gerry.

00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,893
Yeah, of course.

-I like what you´ve done with the place.
-Oh, thanks.

534
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:05,910
Do you buy all these books
retail,

535
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:10,082
or do you send away for, like,
a "shrink kit" that comes with
all these volumes included ?

- Do you like books ?
- Yeah.

- Did you read any of these books ?
- I don´t know.

538
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:18,757
- How about any of these books ?
- Probably not.

539
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:22,528
What about the ones
on the top shelf ? You read those ?

540

- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you
think about ´em ?

00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:29,468
I´m not here for a fuckin´ book
report. They´re your books.
Why don´t you read ´em ?

00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,369
I did. I had to.

United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume l.

Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,

A People´s History in the United States.

- You fuckin´ people baffle me.

You surround yourselves with ´em.

551

- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

- Just like that.

- Uh-uh.

- Do you sculpt ?
- No.

- This is a real piece of shit.

Oh, tell me what
you really think.

567
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:06,967
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

568
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:11,239
It´s also a Winslow Homer
rip-off, except you got
whitey rowin´ the boat there.

569
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:13,240
Well, it´s art, Monet.
It wasn´t very good.

570
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,810
- That´s not really
what concerns me though.
- What concerns you ?

571
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:18,279
-Just the coloring.
-You know what the real bitch of it is ?

572
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:20,481
It´s paint-by-number.

573
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:22,984
Is it color-by-number ? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

574
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,552
- Aren´t they really ?
- You bet.

I think you´re about one step away
from cuttin´ your fuckin´ ear off.

- Really ?
- Oh, yeah.

Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent" ?

578

- You ever heard the sayin´,
"any port in a storm" ?
- Yeah.

579
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:40,134
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way ?

580
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:43,671
- Maybe you´re in the middle
of a storm, a big fuckin´ storm.

Nope.

If I ask you about women,

you´ll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.

You may have even been laid
a few times.

to wake up next to a woman...

and feel truly happy.

You´re a tough kid.

But you´ve never been near one.

You´ve never held your best friend´s
head in your lap...

and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin´ to you for help.

682
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:37,321
If I asked you about love,
you´d probably quote me a sonnet,

683
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:41,559
but you´ve never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

685
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:50,435
Feelin´ like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,

who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

687
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:56,774
And you wouldn´t know
what it´s like to be her angel,

688
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:59,877
to have that love for her
be there forever.

689

Through anything.
Through cancer.

690

And you wouldn´t know about sleepin´
sittin´ up in a hospital room...

for two months,
holding her hand,

692
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:10,989
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

that the terms "visiting hours"
don´t apply to you.

You don´t know about real loss,

695
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:22,968
´cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

I doubt you´ve ever dared
to love anybody that much.

I look at you. I don´t see
an intelligent, confident man.

the depths of you.

You were in there for an hour.

He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

738
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:34,791
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that ?

739

to talk to me if he doesn´t want to.

We know your theory, Alexander,
but the boy´s found
a simple geometrical picture.

- Look now.
He´s joining the two vertices.

- But, Gerry.

I was on this plane once,

755
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:08,687

he does his whole, you know,

756
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:11,323

- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.

a fuckin´ blow job and a cup of coffee."

01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:23,531
- Why ? Go on. What ? Five ?
- No.

877
01:02:23,597 --> 01:02:26,867
Seven ? Eight ?
How many ?

878
01:02:26,934 --> 01:02:29,136
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not !

879
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:32,039
No, I swear to God. I swear to God.
I´m lucky 13 right here.

880
01:02:32,106 --> 01:02:34,042
Do you know
all their names ?

881
01:02:34,108 --> 01:02:36,710
Do l-- Yeah,
they´re my brothers.

882
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:38,880
What are they called ?

883
01:02:38,946 --> 01:02:43,284
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry,
Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy,
Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

884
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,819
Say it again.

885
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:49,990
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry,
Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy,
Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

886
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,660
And Willy.

887
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,061
- Willy ?
- Yeah.

888
01:02:54,128 --> 01:02:55,630
- Will.
- Wow.

889
01:02:55,696 --> 01:02:59,500
- Do you still see all of them ?
- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

890
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:02,170
-I´m livin´ with three of ´em right now.
-Oh, yeah ?

891
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,738
- Yeah.
- I´d like to meet them.

892
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:06,174
Yeah, we´ll do that.

893
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:08,776
Oh, you know,
I read your book last night.

894
01:03:08,843 --> 01:03:11,412
- Oh, so you´re the one.
- [ Laughs ]

895
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:13,448
Do you still, uh--
Do you still counsel veterans ?

896
01:03:13,515 --> 01:03:14,816
No, I don´t.

897
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:19,554
- Why not ?
- Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

898
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:25,160
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh,
if you never met your wife ?

899
01:03:25,227 --> 01:03:27,162
What ? Wonder if l´d be
better off without her ?

900
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:29,364
- No, no, no, l´m not saying,
like, better off.
- No.

901
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:33,435
- I didn´t mean it like that.
- It´s all right.
It´s an important question.

902
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:35,770
´Cause you´ll have bad times,
but that´ll always wake you up...

903
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,106
to the good stuff
you weren´t paying attention to.

904
01:03:38,173 --> 01:03:40,776
And you don´t regret
meetin´ your wife ?

905
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:43,545
Why ? ´Cause the pain
I feel now ?

906
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:48,984
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don´t
regret a single day I spent with her.

907
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:56,191
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you ?

908
01:03:56,258 --> 01:03:58,994
October 21, 1975.

909
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:01,162
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin´ day ?

910
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:06,235
Oh, yeah, ´cause it was game six
of the World Series, biggest
game in Red Sox history.

911
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:11,407
- Yeah, sure.
- My friends and I had slept out
all night to get tickets.

912
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:14,977
- You got tickets ?
- Yep. Day of the game
I was sittin´ in a bar,

913
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:18,547
waitin´ for the game to start
and in walks this girl.

914
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:21,984
It was an amazing game though.
You know, bottom of the eighth,
Carbo ties it up.

915
01:04:22,052 --> 01:04:24,186
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

916
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:28,091
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

917
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:30,226
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he´s got that weird stance.

918
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:33,896
- Yeah, yeah.
- And then-- Boom !
He clocks it, you know.

919
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:36,632
High fly ball
down the left field line !

920
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:39,268
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin´ at the ball.

921
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:41,872
But that´s nothin´, ´cause Fisk,
he´s wavin´ at the ball like a madman.

922
01:04:41,938 --> 01:04:43,874
- Yeah, l´ve seen that.
- "Get over ! Get over !

923
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,375
- Right.
- Get over !"

924
01:04:45,441 --> 01:04:49,846
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans--

925
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:52,015
They charge the field,
you know.

926
01:04:52,082 --> 01:04:54,418
Yeah, and he´s fuckin´
blowin´ people outta the way.

927
01:04:54,484 --> 01:04:56,620
"Get outta the way !
Get outta the way !"

928
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:59,856
I can´t fuckin´ believe you had
tickets to that fuckin´ game !

929
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:03,026
- Did you rush the field ?
- No, I didn´t rush the
fuckin´ field. I wasn´t there.

930
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:06,096
- What ?
- No, I was in a bar,
havin´ a drink with my future wife.

931
01:05:06,162 --> 01:05:10,768
You missed Pudge Fisk´s home run
to have a fuckin´ drink
with some lady you never met ?

932
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:13,036
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.

933
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:15,639
- I don´t care if--
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

934
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:18,709
- I don´t care if Helen
of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy !

935
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:20,911
That´s game six ! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours ?

936
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:23,281
- They let you get away with that ?
- They had to.

937
01:05:23,347 --> 01:05:26,951
-What did you say to ´em ?
-I just slid my ticket across the table.

938
01:05:27,017 --> 01:05:30,121
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."

939
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:32,356
- "l gotta go see about a girl" ?
- Yes !

940
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:34,425
That´s what you said ?
They let you get away with that ?

941
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:36,627
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.

942
01:05:36,694 --> 01:05:40,497
- You´re kiddin´ me ?
- No, l´m not kidding you, Will.

943
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:43,233
That´s why l´m not talkin´
right now about some girl
I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

944
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,736
and how I always regretted
not goin´ over and talkin´ to her.

945
01:05:45,803 --> 01:05:48,973
I don´t regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

946
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,110
I don´t regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,

947
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:55,913
and I don´t regret the last years
when she got really sick.

948
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,617
And I sure as hell don´t
regret missin´ a damn game.

949
01:05:58,683 --> 01:06:01,419
That´s regret.

950
01:06:01,486 --> 01:06:03,722
Wow !

951
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,726
[ Sighs ]

952
01:06:08,794 --> 01:06:11,430
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

953
01:06:11,496 --> 01:06:14,032
I didn´t know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

954
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,067
[ Both Laughing ]

955
01:06:16,134 --> 01:06:20,205
You know, l´m very, very
useful on the court.

956
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,375
I´m extremely tall.

957
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:26,311
- You´re not that tall.
- I dunk.

958
01:06:27,846 --> 01:06:32,417
- [ Rattling ]
- Will I ever play in the N.B.A. ?

959
01:06:32,484 --> 01:06:36,054
"lt is decidedly so."
Hmph.

960
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:41,160
Why do we always stay here ?

961
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:43,862
´Cause it´s nicer
than my place.

962
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:46,432
Yes, but l´ve never
seen your place.

963
01:06:46,498 --> 01:06:48,734
I know.
[ Laughs ]

964
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,270
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers ?

965
01:06:51,337 --> 01:06:54,807
Well, they don´t really
come down here that much.

966
01:06:54,874 --> 01:06:57,009
I think I can make it
to South Boston.

967
01:06:57,076 --> 01:07:01,748
It´s kind of a hike.

968
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:04,817
Is it me you´re hiding from them
or the other way around ?

969
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:07,420
- All right, we´ll go.
- When ?

970
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:09,922
I don´t know.
We´ll go sometime next week.

971
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:15,428
What if I said I would not
sleep with you again until
you let me meet your friends ?

972
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:21,034
[ Groans ]

973
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:24,771
I´d say it´s, like, 4:30 in the mornin´.
They´re probably up.

974
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:28,108
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

975
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:32,512
If you´re not thinking
with your wiener, then you´re
acting directly on its behalf.

976
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:36,148
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment ?

977
01:07:36,216 --> 01:07:40,921
I don´t know. Let´s ask.
"Outlook does not look good."

978
01:07:40,988 --> 01:07:44,390
- [ Chuck On Phone ] What ?
- Fuck the-- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

979
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:47,694
"Outlook" ? That´s the
same thing that told you
you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

980
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:51,832
Exactly, so look out. You´d better
start buying some season tickets.

981
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:56,703
Mmm ! I plan to. I´m tall.
I like wearing shorts.

982
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,006
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

983
01:07:59,072 --> 01:08:01,876
- You´re not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

984
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:04,978
Maybe l´m all
about three points.

985
01:08:05,045 --> 01:08:07,314
I´m all about home runs.

986
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:11,618
[ Laughs ] Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

987
01:08:14,721 --> 01:08:17,558
[ Laughing ]

988
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:26,734
A leprechaun´s got his dick
in the monkey´s ass.

989
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:30,538
Morgan comes runnin´ in, goin´,
"l don´t mind it. I don´t mind--"

990
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:32,540
[ Laughing ]

991
01:08:32,607 --> 01:08:36,311
Well, I can´t believe you
brought Skylar here when we´re
fuckin´ all bombed and drinkin´.

992
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:39,680
I know, Morgan. It´s a real rarity
we´d be all drinkin´.

993
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,617
My uncle Marty drinks. He´ll go
on a bender for six, eight months.

994
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:45,520
Did I ever tell ya what happened
to him when he was drivin´
up there and got pulled over ?

995
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,888
- I told you guys, right ?
- Marty, yeah.

996
01:08:47,956 --> 01:08:51,559
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.

997
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:54,996
He´s always tellin´ stories. Every time
we come here he´s got another story.

998
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:59,067
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

999
01:08:59,133 --> 01:09:04,272
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

1000
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:07,008
My uncle Marty´s
drivin´ home, right ?

1001
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:11,847
Bombed out of his tree, right ? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

1002
01:09:11,913 --> 01:09:16,050
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle´s fucked basically.

1003
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,353
Got him out of the car,
tryin´ to make him walk the line.

1004
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:22,291
He gets out of the car, pukes,
and the statie´s pretty sure
he´s over the legal limit.

1005
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:26,161
So he´s about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

1006
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,299
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there´s this huge fuckin´ boom.

1007
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:33,869
- Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around--
- He got shot ?

1008
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,905
No. So-- So-- You
heard this story before.

1009
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,908
Yeah, Morgan, stop.
Stop.

- You´re drivin´ him nuts.
- I´m gonna break your neck. Shut up !

1014
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,587
He told you the story
once before.

1015
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,357
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don´t move."

1016
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,361
Statie goes runnin´ down the road
to deal with the other accident.

1017
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:02,365
After a few minutes of just
lyin´ in his own piss and vomit,

1018
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,433
my uncle starts wonderin´
what he´s doin´ there.

1019
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,036
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

1020
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,106
The next mornin´
my uncle´s just passed out.

1021
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,441
- He hears this knockin´ at the door.
- [ Knocking ]

1022
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:15,444
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open-- "What ?"

1023
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,480
It´s the state trooper
that pulled him over.

1024
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,483
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, ´What ?´

1025
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,086
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."

1026
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:25,721
He´s like, "l never
seen you before in my life.

1027
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,525
I´ve been home all night with my kids.
I don´t know who the fuck you are."

1028
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,894
He´s like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage."

1029
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:34,297
My uncle´s like, "What ?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage."

1030
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,034
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.

1031
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:42,305
And there´s-- The statie´s police
cruiser is in my uncle´s garage.

1032
01:10:42,373 --> 01:10:44,875
- [ Morgan Laughing ]
- He was so fuckin´--

1033
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,411
He was so fuckin´ hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

1034
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:51,248
The best part about it is,
the fuckin´ state trooper...

1035
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:53,751
was so embarrassed
he didn´t do anything.

1036
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:57,154
He´d been drivin´ around all night in my
uncle´s Chevelle, lookin´ for the house.

1037
01:10:57,221 --> 01:11:01,258
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story ?

1038
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:03,561
He got away.
That´s the point.

1039
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:06,797
- Well, question--
- Come on. Stop.

1040
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:09,667
- I´m tryin´ to clarify somethin´.
- You´re embarrassing him.

1041
01:11:09,734 --> 01:11:12,236
- It doesn´t make any sense.
- It does make sense,

1042
01:11:12,303 --> 01:11:14,271
if you listen to the story
and quit askin´ questions.

1043
01:11:14,339 --> 01:11:17,675
Well, let´s see if you can get this one.
I´ve got a little story for you.

1044
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:22,480
All right, there´s an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.

1045
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:28,119
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

1046
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:31,322
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

1047
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:33,457
She´s like,
"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

1048
01:11:33,524 --> 01:11:35,794
You´re such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.

1049
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,230
I want to give ya
a little present.

1050
01:11:38,296 --> 01:11:41,266
Anything your little heart desires,
l´m goin´ to give it to ya.

1051
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:43,268
What would ya like ?

1052
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:48,006
Paddie´s like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That´s a very sweet offer.

1053
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:53,011
Now, in 50 years, there´s one thing
that´s been missing,

1054
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:56,848
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

1055
01:11:56,915 --> 01:12:00,619
I would like for it."
Mary´s like, "All right."

1056
01:12:00,685 --> 01:12:05,124
She takes her teeth out, puts ´em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.

1057
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,128
Afterwards, Paddie´s like, "Yeah, geez,
now that´s what l´ve been missin´.

1058
01:12:09,194 --> 01:12:13,098
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever !

1059
01:12:13,164 --> 01:12:15,500
Beautiful, Mary !
I love ya !

1060
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:18,504
Is there anything
that I can do for you ?"

1061
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:23,209
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."

1062
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:25,578
- Oh !
- Oh, my God !

1063
01:12:25,644 --> 01:12:29,048
- That´s filthy.
- It´s not that filthy.
I´ve heard filthy.

1064
01:12:29,115 --> 01:12:33,386
[ Laughing ]

1065
01:12:33,452 --> 01:12:37,456
- Get off of me !
- All right. See you guys later.

1066
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:40,793
All right.
Take it easy, Bill.

1067
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:43,329
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin´ by.

1068
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:45,364
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

1069
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,902
You don´t want to rush
to judgment on that one,
´cause they´re not all like me.

1070
01:12:48,968 --> 01:12:51,704
Oh. I´m sure.
It was nice to meet ya.

1071
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:54,441
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1072
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:58,611
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don´t know what you´re doin´, dude.

1073
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:01,347
- You´re givin´ us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you ?

- Come on, Chuck.
- You´re walkin´, bitch.

All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1076
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:11,124
I don´t know what you´re
gettin´ all serious about.

1077
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:15,095
- You´re droppin´ me off first.
- It´s really out of the way.

1078
01:13:15,162 --> 01:13:18,064
Oh, okay. Just ´cause you
don´t have to sleep in your
one-room palace tonight...

1079
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:20,067
don´t start
thinkin´ you´re bad.

1080
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:22,402
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1081
01:13:22,469 --> 01:13:25,605
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight.
Not any other night.

He knows once you see that shit-hole
he´s gettin´ dropped like a bad habit.

1083
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,378
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1084
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:33,881
We´re gonna do that
another time.

1085
01:13:33,947 --> 01:13:35,882

No shit !
You didn´t say that.

For Christ´s sake, Marty,
it´s a joke.

1091

- I know someone that
actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke.

- Gerry.

- Have trouble findin´ the place ?
- No, I took a cab.

- Couple of sandwiches too.

- Nuts ?
- No, thank you.

1106
01:14:36,378 --> 01:14:39,481
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.

- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

at all about his future ?

No, we haven´t gotten into that yet.
We´re still bangin´ away at the past.

Maybe you should. My phone´s been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

- What kind ?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1112
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:02,404
The kind of place where a mind
like Will´s is given free rein.

1113
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:08,144
That´s great that there are
offers, but I don´t really
think he´s ready for that.

you understand, Sean.

- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

- So who won the bet ?
- I did.

This isn´t about me, Sean.

I´m nothing compared
to this young man.

You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau ?

1130
01:16:01,564 --> 01:16:06,236
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown for
their study of the universe.

1131
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:10,841
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

1132
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:13,544
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1133
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,546
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1134

just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.

have heard of him.

- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn´t, Sean.

This boy has that gift.

He just doesn´t got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s,
there was a young man graduated
from University of Michigan.

1141
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:40,037
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.

1142
01:16:40,104 --> 01:16:42,540
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1143
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:45,676
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.
Showed amazing potential.

1144
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:48,679
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1145
01:16:48,746 --> 01:16:51,682
- Yeah, so who was he ?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1146
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,617
Haven´t heard of him.

- Yo !

- Unabomber.

what l´m talking about.

- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah--

1151
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:07,898
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1152
01:17:07,966 --> 01:17:10,035
Direction´s one thing.
Manipulation´s another.

- We have to let him find--

every night twisting my mustache
and hatching a plan...

1155
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,809
to ruin this boy´s life !

1156
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,278
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,

1157
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,814
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field´s medal.

1158
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:25,316
Maybe he doesn´t want
what you want.

1159
01:17:25,384 --> 01:17:28,152
There´s more to life
than a fuckin´ Field´s medal.

1160
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:32,156
This is too important, Sean,
and it´s above personal rivalry.

1161
01:17:32,224 --> 01:17:34,659
Wait a minute.
Let´s talk about the boy.

1162
01:17:34,726 --> 01:17:37,462
Why don´t we give him time
to figure out what he wants ?

1163
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:40,799
That´s a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn´t it ?

1164
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:43,502
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin´ prick !

1165
01:17:44,903 --> 01:17:48,340
Oh, l´m sorry. I´m sorry
that I came here today.

1166
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,575
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1167
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:52,777
Nice to be in the loop.

1168
01:17:52,845 --> 01:17:56,448
The boy´s in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1169
01:17:56,516 --> 01:18:00,953
Well, Will, l´m not exactly sure
what you mean.

1170
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,388
We´ve already
offered you a position.

1171
01:18:03,455 --> 01:18:05,491
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1172
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:08,827
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin´.

1173
01:18:08,894 --> 01:18:12,165
But I think we all know
that person is not gonna
represent you as well as I can.

1174
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:15,368
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

Retainer.

1176
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,009
You want us to give you
cash right now ?

1177
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:27,146
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy--
Now, I didn´t say that.

1178
01:18:27,212 --> 01:18:32,452
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,

1179
01:18:32,518 --> 01:18:36,355
would be concurrently
improved if I had...

1180
01:18:36,423 --> 01:18:39,091
$200 in my back pocket
right now.

[ Clears Throat ]
I don´t think I can-- Larry ?

1182
01:18:44,264 --> 01:18:48,467
- I´ve got $73.
- Will you take a check ?

1183
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:53,306
Let me tell you somethin´.
You´re suspect.

1184
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:58,712
Yeah, you. I don´t know
what your reputation is in this town,

1185
01:18:58,778 --> 01:19:01,514
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,

1186
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:04,184
you can bet
l´ll be lookin´ into you.

1187
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:09,189
Now, any business
we have heretofore,

1188
01:19:09,256 --> 01:19:13,060
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1189
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:15,295
Good day, gentlemen.

1190
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:19,100
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

[ Chattering ]

01:19:33,414 --> 01:19:35,349
- How´s it goin´ ?
- Fine.

01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,485
Yeah.

1194
01:19:37,552 --> 01:19:39,487
Good.

1195
01:19:40,554 --> 01:19:43,190
- Want some help ?
- No !

1196
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:46,461
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we´ll go to the batting cages.

1197
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:48,730
No.

1198
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:52,467
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1199
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:56,304
- It´s really important... to me, okay ?
- All right.

1200
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:01,309
- Why don´t we just
hang out here all day ?
- Yes, why don´t we ?

1201
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:07,348
- All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.
- [ Chuckles ]

1202

Seeing as you´re intent
on breaking my balls,

1203
01:20:12,253 --> 01:20:15,857
- Let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1204
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:17,893
Do you have
a photographic memory ?

1205
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:23,965
I don´t know. I just kind
of remember. I mean, how do you
remember your phone number ?

1206
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,967
You just do.

1207
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:28,937
- Have you studied organic chemistry ?
- A little bit.

1208
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,906
- Oh, just for fun ?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1209
01:20:31,974 --> 01:20:34,542
Yeah, it´s so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1210
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,246
- Are you mad ?
- [ Laughs ]

1211
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:39,848
Have you completely
lost your mind ?

1212
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:44,519
Nobody studies it for fun.
It´s not a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1213
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:47,056
- Someone like me ?
- Yeah.

1214
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:51,393
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1215
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:55,998
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.

1216
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,868
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1217
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:02,905
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1218
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:08,677
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don´t understand.

1219
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:10,813
I don´t understand
how your mind works.

1220
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,116
- Did you play the piano ?
- I want to talk about this.

1221
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,351
No, l´m trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano ?

1222
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:19,989
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at
a piano, you see Mozart.

1223
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:23,659
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay ?

1224
01:21:23,727 --> 01:21:27,530
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1225
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:29,932
- So what are you saying ?
You play the piano ?
- Not a lick.

1226
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,870
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1227
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:38,741
But Beethoven, Mozart--
They saw it. They could just play.

1228
01:21:38,809 --> 01:21:42,779
I couldn´t paint you a picture.
I probably can´t hit the ball
out of Fenway.

1229
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:48,285
- And I can´t play the piano.
- But you can do my
O-chem paper in under an hour.

1230
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:53,891
Right. Well, I mean, when
it came to stuff like that,
I could always just play.

1231
01:21:55,259 --> 01:21:57,227
That´s the best
I can explain it.

1232
01:21:57,294 --> 01:22:01,298
- Come here.
I have to tell you something.
- Huh ?

1233

- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

Well--

- It´s not fair.
- What´s not fair ? What ?

1236
01:22:25,389 --> 01:22:28,493
I´ve been here for four years,

1237

and l´ve only just found you.

Well, you found me.

- Are you awake ?
- No.

Yes, you are.

01:23:01,093 --> 01:23:03,028
What ?

1242
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:08,166
I want you to come
to California with me.

1243

- You sure about that ?
- Oh, yeah.

1244
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,845
Yeah, but how do you know ?

1245
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:25,083
I don´t know.
I just know.

1246
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,919
Yeah, but how do you know ?

1247
01:23:27,987 --> 01:23:31,056
I know because I feel it.

1248
01:23:31,122 --> 01:23:35,995
- Because that´s a really
serious thing you´re saying.
- I know.

1249
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:38,530
You could be in California
next week...

1250
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:41,800
and you might find out
something about me you don´t like.

1251
01:23:41,867 --> 01:23:43,936
Maybe you wish
you hadn´t said that,

1252
01:23:44,003 --> 01:23:46,372
but you know it´s such a serious thing
you can´t take it back.

1253
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,575
Now l´m stuck in California with someone
that doesn´t really want to be with me,

- A what ? What´s a take-back ?

1255
01:23:54,247 --> 01:24:00,152
I don´t want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.

01:24:00,219 --> 01:24:03,956
Well, I can´t go to
California with you, so--

Why not ?

1258
01:24:07,026 --> 01:24:11,163
Well, one, because
I got a job here.

1259
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:14,501
And, two,
because I live here.

Look, um, if you don´t love me,
you should just tell me.

I´m not sayin´
I don´t love you.

Then why ? Why won´t you come ?
What are you so scared of ?

Well, what aren´t
you scared of ?

You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you--

will approve of...

and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1271

and talk about how you
went slummin´, too, once.

Why are you saying this ?
What is your obsession with this money ?

and I inherited this money.

You don´t think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

01:25:06,254 --> 01:25:09,924
That I would give it back
in a second if it meant I could
have one more day with him.

But I can´t, and that´s
my life, and I deal with it.

when you´re the one that´s afraid.

What the fuck am I afraid of ?

that I won´t love you back.

You know what ?
l´m afraid too.

01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:28,321
- Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.
- That´s what l´m saying.

1437
01:35:28,387 --> 01:35:31,924
You´ll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1438
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:34,460
where you´re always afraid
to take the first step,

1439
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:38,330
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1440
01:35:38,398 --> 01:35:40,400
- You gonna take the
professor´s side on this ?
- Don´t give me a line of shit.

1441
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,435
- No.
- I didn´t want the job.

1442
01:35:42,502 --> 01:35:44,471
It´s not about the job. I don´t care
if you work for the government.

1443
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,675
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1444
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:52,746
What are you passionate about ?
What do you want ?

1445
01:35:52,846 --> 01:35:55,215
There are guys who work
their entire life layin´ brick...

1446
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,551
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1447
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:00,086
- I didn´t ask for this.
- No.

1448
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,656
You were born with it, so don´t cop out
behind: "l didn´t ask for this."

1449
01:36:02,722 --> 01:36:06,527
- What do you mean, cop out ?
What´s wrong with layin´ brick ?
- Nothing.

1450
01:36:06,593 --> 01:36:08,895
There´s nothin´ wrong.
That´s somebody´s home l´m buildin´.

1451
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:11,833
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay ?

1452
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,834
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1453
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:16,103
Exactly. That´s
an honorable profession.

1454
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,105
What´s wrong with
fixin´ somebody´s car ?

1455
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:20,107
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That´s honor in that.

1456
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,110
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1457
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,512
There´s honor in takin´
that 40-minute train ride...

1458
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:27,048
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

1459
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:30,151
- And their wastebaskets
are empty. That´s real work.
- That´s right.

1460
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:33,220
And that´s honorable. I´m sure
that´s why you took that job.

1461
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,322
I mean, for the honor of it.

1462
01:36:35,423 --> 01:36:40,061
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1463
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:43,831
Why did you work at the most
prestigious technical college
in the whole fuckin´ world ?

1464
01:36:43,897 --> 01:36:47,201
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people´s formulas...

1465
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:53,174
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it ?

1466
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:56,211
´Cause I don´t see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1467
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:02,083
So what do you
really wanna do ?

1468
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:07,422
I wanna be a shepherd.

1469
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:09,357
Really ?

1470
01:37:09,424 --> 01:37:13,395
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread,
get some sheep and tend to them.

1471
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:16,397
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What ?

1472
01:37:16,465 --> 01:37:19,434
You know, if you´re gonna
jerk off, why don´t you just do
it at home with a moist towel ?

1473
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:21,470
- You´re chuckin´ me ?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1474
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:23,505
- No, no, no, time´s not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1475
01:37:23,572 --> 01:37:26,241
- I´m not leavin´. No.
- You´re not gonna answer,
you´re wastin´ my time.

1476
01:37:26,308 --> 01:37:28,277
I thought we were friends.

1477
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,980
- Playtime´s over, okay ?
- Why are you kickin´ me out ?

1478
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:35,384
You´re lecturin´ me on life ?
Look at you, you fuckin´ burnout.

1479
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:37,686
- What winds your clock ?
- Workin´ with you.

1480
01:37:37,753 --> 01:37:40,856
Where´s your soul mate ? You wanna
talk about soul mates ? Where is she ?

1481
01:37:40,923 --> 01:37:43,058
- Dead.
- That´s right. She´s fuckin´ dead.

1482
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:45,861
She fuckin´ dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away ?

1483
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:50,133
- At least I played a hand.
- You played a hand and you lost.
You lost a big fuckin´ hand.

1484
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,602
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1485
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:56,772
Look at me.
What do you wanna do ?

1486
01:38:03,713 --> 01:38:07,951
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1487
01:38:08,017 --> 01:38:11,755
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can´t give me a straight answer,

1488
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:15,791
because you don´t know.

1489
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,662
I´ll see ya, Bo-peep.

1490
01:38:22,633 --> 01:38:24,767
- Fuck you.
- You´re the shepherd.

1491
01:38:29,505 --> 01:38:31,741
Shepherd.

1492
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,910
[ Whispers ]
White little prick.

1493
01:38:35,145 --> 01:38:37,113
I just wanted to,
you know, um,

1494
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:40,684
call you up,
uh, before you left, um--

1495
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,386
I´ve been takin´ all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

1496
01:38:43,454 --> 01:38:45,389
so l´m not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1497
01:38:45,455 --> 01:38:48,158
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

1498
01:38:49,659 --> 01:38:51,628
Yeah.

1499
01:38:54,198 --> 01:38:56,133
I love you.

1500
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:02,973
Will ?

1501
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:05,876
You take care.

Will, come on.
Will !

1520
01:40:21,519 --> 01:40:23,622
Will, that´s it !
We´re done !

1521
01:40:23,688 --> 01:40:28,427
I´m sitting in your office
and the boy isn´t here.

1522
01:40:28,494 --> 01:40:30,529
Well, it´s ten past 5:00.

1523
01:40:30,596 --> 01:40:32,631
An hour and
ten minutes late.

1524

# I can make you satisfied
in everything #

1525
01:40:36,102 --> 01:40:39,605
Well, if he doesn´t show up and I file
a report saying he wasn´t here...

1526
01:40:39,672 --> 01:40:43,576
and he goes back to jail,
he won´t be on my conscience.

1527
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:46,512
# Now be coming true #

1528
01:40:46,578 --> 01:40:49,582
Okay. Fine.

1529
01:40:51,117 --> 01:40:53,920
What´s up ?

1530
01:40:54,987 --> 01:40:56,922
Thanks.

1531
01:40:59,559 --> 01:41:03,463
Ah ! God, that´s good.

1532
01:41:07,267 --> 01:41:09,769
So how´s your lady ?

1533
01:41:09,836 --> 01:41:12,672
Ah, she´s gone.

1534
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:15,074
Gone ? Gone where ?

1535
01:41:15,141 --> 01:41:18,812
Med school.
Medical school in California.

1536
01:41:18,878 --> 01:41:20,814
- Really ?
- Yeah.

1537
01:41:20,881 --> 01:41:23,851
- When was this ?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1538
01:41:28,221 --> 01:41:30,157
That sucks.

1539
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,696
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings ?

1540
01:41:36,764 --> 01:41:38,799
I think the week
after l´m 21.

1541
01:41:38,865 --> 01:41:41,602
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what ?

1542
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:45,906
Yeah, fuckin´ sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1543
01:41:45,973 --> 01:41:49,377
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

1544
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:51,412
I´m gonna be
a fuckin´ lab rat.

1545
01:41:51,478 --> 01:41:54,849
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1546
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:57,151
What do I want a way
outta here for ?

1547
01:41:57,218 --> 01:41:59,486
I mean, l´m gonna fuckin´
live here the rest of my life.

1548
01:41:59,554 --> 01:42:01,655
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1549
01:42:01,723 --> 01:42:06,326
Fuckin´ take ´em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1550
01:42:07,896 --> 01:42:11,298
Look, you´re my best friend,
so don´t take this the wrong way.

1551
01:42:11,365 --> 01:42:14,268
But in 20 years if
you´re still livin´ here,

1552
01:42:14,335 --> 01:42:17,605
comin´ over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

1553
01:42:17,672 --> 01:42:19,974
still workin´ construction,
l´ll fuckin´ kill ya.

1554
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:22,610
That´s not a threat. That´s a fact.
I´ll fuckin´ kill ya.

1555
01:42:22,677 --> 01:42:24,846
What the fuck
are you talkin´ about ?

1556
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:28,116
- Look, you got something
none of us have.
- Oh, come on !

1557
01:42:28,182 --> 01:42:32,054
Why is it always this ? I fuckin´
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1558
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,291
- What if I don´t want to ?
- No, no, no. Fuck you.
You don´t owe it to yourself.

1559
01:42:36,357 --> 01:42:38,592
You owe it to me,

1560
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:41,229
´cause tomorrow l´m gonna
wake up and l´ll be 50,

1561
01:42:41,296 --> 01:42:43,798
and l´ll still
be doin´ this shit.

1562
01:42:43,865 --> 01:42:46,401
That´s all right.
That´s fine.

1563
01:42:46,468 --> 01:42:49,071
I mean, you´re sittin´ on
a winnin´ lottery ticket.

1564
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:52,841
You´re too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that´s bullshit.

1565
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:57,779
´Cause l´d do fuckin´ anything
to have what you got.

1566
01:42:57,846 --> 01:43:00,716
So would any of
these fuckin´ guys.

1567
01:43:00,783 --> 01:43:03,452
Be an insult to us
if you´re still here in 20 years.

1568
01:43:03,519 --> 01:43:06,088
Hangin´ around here
is a fuckin´ waste of your time.

1569
01:43:06,155 --> 01:43:08,290
- You don´t know that.
- I don´t ?

1570
01:43:08,356 --> 01:43:11,861
- No. You don´t know that.
- Oh, I don´t know that.
Let me tell you what I do know.

1571
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:15,798
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1572
01:43:15,865 --> 01:43:19,869
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it´s great.

1573
01:43:19,935 --> 01:43:22,638
You know what the
best part of my day is ?

1574
01:43:22,705 --> 01:43:27,109
It´s for about ten seconds:
from when I pull up to the curb
and when I get to your door.

1575
01:43:27,176 --> 01:43:31,881
´Cause I think maybe l´ll
get up there and l´ll knock on
the door and you won´t be there.

1576
01:43:31,947 --> 01:43:35,418
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.

1577

the patient-doctor relationship ?

1721
01:54:20,909 --> 01:54:23,078
Naw. Only if you
grab my ass.

1722
01:54:26,848 --> 01:54:29,050
- Take care.
- You too.

1723
01:54:29,118 --> 01:54:31,053
Yeah.

1724
01:54:32,855 --> 01:54:34,890
Hey.

1725
01:54:34,957 --> 01:54:37,326
Good luck, son.

1726
01:54:48,438 --> 01:54:51,240
[ Morgan ]
Two beers.

1727
01:54:53,943 --> 01:54:55,979
What´s up ?
Did you guys go ?

1728
01:54:56,045 --> 01:54:58,414
No. I had to talk him down.

1729
01:54:58,481 --> 01:55:02,185
- Why didn´t you yoke him ?
- Little Morgan´s
got a lot of scrap to him.

1730
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:04,186
People try to whip
his ass every week.

1731
01:55:04,254 --> 01:55:06,723
- Fuckin´ kid won´t back down.
- What are you sayin´ about me ?

1732
01:55:06,789 --> 01:55:10,293
- Was I talkin´ to you ?
None of your fuckin´ business.
- [ Door Opens ]

1733
01:55:10,359 --> 01:55:13,630
- [ Chuckie ] Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers !

1734
01:55:13,697 --> 01:55:15,698
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch ?

1735
01:55:15,765 --> 01:55:19,602
-Happy birthday.
-Thought we forgot, huh, bitch ?

1736
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:22,272
- Come on !
- I´m goin´. I´m goin´.

1737
01:55:22,338 --> 01:55:24,274
All right. Who´s first ?

1738
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,777
- Come on, motherfucker !
- Who´s first ?

1739
01:55:26,843 --> 01:55:28,779
# Oh, Danny boy #

1740
01:55:28,845 --> 01:55:32,382
Here´s your present.

1741
01:55:32,448 --> 01:55:34,451
- Come on, bro.
- What ?

1742
01:55:34,518 --> 01:55:38,789
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1743
01:55:38,855 --> 01:55:42,726
I knew I wasn´t gonna fuckin´
drive you every day, so--

1744
01:55:42,793 --> 01:55:46,863
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That´s not what I was sayin´ !

1745
01:55:46,931 --> 01:55:49,433
But, uh, you´re 21 now.

1746
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:53,070
You´re legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1747
01:55:53,136 --> 01:55:55,606
- How do you like it ?
- This is like--

1748
01:55:58,075 --> 01:56:02,013
It´s the ugliest fuckin´ car
l´ve ever seen in my life.

1749
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:04,114
- Come on, brother.
- How´d you guys do this ?

1750
01:56:04,182 --> 01:56:09,120
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts,

1751
01:56:09,186 --> 01:56:11,255
and Morgan was out panhandlin´
for change every day.

1752
01:56:11,322 --> 01:56:13,257
I had the router to do
all the bodywork.

1753
01:56:13,324 --> 01:56:15,259
Yeah, I have a fuckin´ job,
too, brother.

1754
01:56:15,326 --> 01:56:17,762
Guy´s been up my ass for
two years about a job. I had
to let him help with the car.

1755
01:56:17,828 --> 01:56:19,897
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan ?

1756
01:56:19,964 --> 01:56:22,199
- Yeah, had one. Now l´m fucked again.
- So what is it ?

1757
01:56:22,267 --> 01:56:25,937
- A lawn mower ? What do ya got ?
- It´s a straight fuckin´ six.

1758
01:56:26,004 --> 01:56:27,939
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1759
01:56:28,006 --> 01:56:31,076
It´s a good car.
The engine´s good. Engine´s good.

1760
01:56:31,142 --> 01:56:34,545
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1761
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,555
Hi.

1762
01:56:45,023 --> 01:56:47,058
Come on in.

1763
01:56:49,161 --> 01:56:51,129
Sean, l, um--

1764
01:56:51,196 --> 01:56:54,232
Me too, Gerry.

1765
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:56,668
Yeah. Good.

1766
01:56:57,736 --> 01:56:59,872
I heard you´re
takin´ some time.

1767
01:56:59,938 --> 01:57:04,543
Yeah. Travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1768
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:06,577
So where are you going ?

1769
01:57:06,645 --> 01:57:10,649
India and China
and Baltimore.

1770
01:57:11,917 --> 01:57:13,986
Oh.

1771
01:57:14,052 --> 01:57:16,055
You know when
you´ll be back ?

1772
01:57:16,121 --> 01:57:19,525
Oh. I got this flyer
the other day.

1773
01:57:19,591 --> 01:57:22,428
It says, uh, class of ´72
is having a reunion in six months.

1774
01:57:22,494 --> 01:57:24,430
Yeah, I got
one of those too.

1775
01:57:24,497 --> 01:57:26,432
Why don´t you come ?
l´ll buy ya a drink.

1776
01:57:26,499 --> 01:57:29,368
The drinks at
those things are free.

1777
01:57:29,435 --> 01:57:32,939
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1778
01:57:37,309 --> 01:57:41,114
- Oh.
- How about a drink right now ?

1779
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:44,350
Yeah. It´s a good idea.

1780
01:57:44,417 --> 01:57:46,786
Come on.
This one´s on me.

1781
01:57:49,556 --> 01:57:51,924
- I got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh !

1782
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:55,328
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1783
01:57:55,395 --> 01:57:57,730
This is my ticket
to paradise.

1784
01:57:57,797 --> 01:57:59,866
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery ?

1785
01:57:59,932 --> 01:58:02,969
- What ? Four to one ?
- About 30 million to one.

1786
01:58:03,036 --> 01:58:05,171
- I still have a shot, you know ?
- [ Laughs ]

1787
01:58:05,238 --> 01:58:11,111
Yes, just about as big chance
as you being hit by lightning
here on the staircase right now.

1788
01:58:11,177 --> 01:58:14,447
It´s a possibility too. I mean,
32 million. If you look at the size--

1789
01:58:14,515 --> 01:58:18,451
[ Bell Tolling ]

1790
01:59:09,637 --> 01:59:11,606
[ Horn Honks ]

1791
01:59:20,681 --> 01:59:22,617
[ Tires Screeching ]

1792
01:59:43,905 --> 01:59:46,308
Will !

1793
02:00:03,258 --> 02:00:05,261
[ Knocking ]

1794
02:00:05,327 --> 02:00:07,262
Will ?

1795
02:00:44,667 --> 02:00:47,804
[ Horn Honks ]

1796
02:01:14,498 --> 02:01:16,433
He´s not there.

1797
02:01:33,484 --> 02:01:37,455
# l´ll fake it
through the day #

1798
02:01:37,521 --> 02:01:40,791
[ Will´s Voice ] Sean, if
the professor calls about that job,

1799
02:01:40,857 --> 02:01:45,429
just tell him sorry,
I had to go see about a girl.

1800
02:01:45,496 --> 02:01:47,431
Will.

1801
02:01:49,033 --> 02:01:52,370
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.
