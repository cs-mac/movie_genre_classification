1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,511
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,198
They shut down the main reactor.

3
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,878
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,876
This is madness.

5
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,709
We're doomed.

6
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,711
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,875
What's that?

8
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,429
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,915
At last!

10
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,712
Where have you been?

11
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,955
They're heading in this direction.

12
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,798
What are we going to do?

13
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,592
We'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel...

14
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,119
smashed into who knows what!

15
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,033
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

16
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,233
<i>The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.</i>

17
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,874
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

18
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,673
What have you done with those plans?

19
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,519
We intercepted no transmissions.

20
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,312
This is a consular ship.

21
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,431
We're on a diplomatic mission.

22
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,676
If this is a consular ship...

23
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,916
where is the ambassador?

24
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,511
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans...

25
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,518
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

26
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,039
There's one. Set for stun.

27
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,072
She'll be all right.

28
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,997
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

29
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,112
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

30
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,879
You'll be deactivated for sure.

31
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,074
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher...

32
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,269
you overweight glob of grease!

33
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,958
Now come out before
somebody sees you.

34
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,032
Secret mission?
What plans?

35
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,388
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,919
I'm not getting in there.

37
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,357
I'm going to regret this.

38
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,839
There goes another one.

39
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,996
Hold your fire.
There's no life forms.

40
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,712
It must have short-circuited.

41
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,992
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

42
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,917
Are you sure this thing is safe?

43
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,995
Oh.

44
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,716
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

45
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,070
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.

46
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,269
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic...

47
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,799
Don't act so surprised,
Your Highness.

48
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,275
You weren't on any
mercy mission this time.

49
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,313
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

50
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,159
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

51
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,918
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,678
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate...

53
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,153
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

54
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,999
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

55
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,633
Take her away!

56
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,112
Holding her is dangerous.

57
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,719
If word of this gets out...

58
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,558
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

59
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,148
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

60
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,840
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,235
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

62
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,588
Leave that to me.

63
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,233
Send a distress signal...

64
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,510
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.

65
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,959
Lord Vader,
the battle station plans...

66
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,195
are not aboard this ship...

67
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,673
and no transmissions were made.

68
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,189
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting...

69
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,799
but no life forms were aboard.

70
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,559
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

71
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,275
Send a detachment down to retrieve
them... See to it personally, Commander.

72
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,789
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

73
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,955
Yes, sir.

74
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,557
How did we get into this mess?

75
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,240
I really don't know how.

76
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,873
We seem to be made to suffer.

77
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,274
It's our lot in life.

78
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,472
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

79
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,477
My joints are almost frozen.

80
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,674
What a desolate place this is!

81
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,432
Where do you think you're going?

82
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,152
Well, I'm not going that way.

83
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,793
It's much too rocky.

84
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,672
This way is much easier.

85
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,631
What makes you think...

86
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,557
there are settlements over there?

87
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,479
Don't get technical with me.

88
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,717
What mission?
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,994
I've just about had enough of you.

90
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,439
Go that way.

91
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,357
You'll be malfunctioning within a day...

92
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,993
you nearsighted scrap pile.

93
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,350
And don't let me catch you
following me begging for help...

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,879
because you won't get it.

95
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,992
No more adventures.

96
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,997
I'm not going that way.

97
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,639
That malfunctioning little twerp.

98
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,751
This is all his fault.

99
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
He tricked me into going this way...

100
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,357
but he'll do no better.

101
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,518
Wait! What's that?

102
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,959
A transport.

103
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,672
I'm saved!

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,438
Over here!

105
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,549
Hey!

106
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,272
Hey!

107
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,756
Help! Please help!

108
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,234
R2?

109
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,990
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

110
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,028
Someone was in the pod.

111
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,720
The tracks go off in this direction.

112
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,671
Look, sir, droids.

113
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,233
We stopped.

114
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,952
Wake up! Wake up!

115
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,557
We're doomed.

116
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,071
Do you think they'll melt us down?

117
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,197
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

118
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,878
Will this never end?

119
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,479
All right, fine. Let's go.

120
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,636
Luke! Luke!

121
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,917
Luke, tell Uncle
if he gets a translator...

122
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,712
be sure it speaks Bocce.

123
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,229
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.

124
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,234
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

125
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,316
No, not that one.

126
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,509
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

127
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,959
Protocol? Why, it's
my primary function, sir.

128
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,435
I am well-versed in all the customs...

129
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,118
I have no need for a protocol droid.

130
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,719
Of course you haven't, sir.

131
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,989
Not in an environment such as this.

132
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,348
That is why I have
been programmed...

133
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,516
What I really need is
a droid who understands...

134
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,437
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

135
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,711
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

136
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,480
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

137
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,037
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

138
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,718
Can you speak Bocce?

139
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,274
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me...

140
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,628
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.

141
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,988
Luke!

142
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,471
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

143
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,715
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

144
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,829
But I was going into Tosche Station...

145
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,279
to pick up some power converters.

146
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,799
You can waste time
with your friends...

147
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,319
when your chores are done.

148
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,317
Now come on. Get to it.

149
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,476
All right. Come on.

150
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,031
And the red one. Come on.

151
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,589
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

152
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,269
Uncle Owen!

153
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,719
Yeah?

154
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,434
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

155
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,835
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

156
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,633
Excuse me, sir...

157
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,070
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

158
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,395
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

159
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,794
What about that blue one?

160
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,150
We'll take that one.

161
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,429
Take this away.

162
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,834
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

163
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,678
He really is in first-class condition.

164
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,949
I've worked with him before.

165
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,876
Here he comes.

166
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,879
O.K. Let's go.

167
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,752
Now, don't you forget this.

168
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,552
Why I should stick
my neck out for you...

169
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,511
is quite beyond my capacity.

170
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,798
Thank the maker!

171
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,831
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

172
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,430
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination...

173
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,549
I can barely move.

174
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,669
It just isn't fair.

175
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,279
Oh, Biggs is right.

176
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,595
I'm never gonna get out of here.

177
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,597
Is there anything I might do to help?

178
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,029
No. Not unless you can alter time...

179
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,435
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

180
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,073
I don't think so, sir.

181
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,474
I'm only a droid...

182
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,953
and not very knowledgeable
about such things...

183
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,718
not on this planet, anyway.

184
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,071
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

185
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,475
Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe...

186
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,909
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

187
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,109
I see, sir.

188
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,878
You can call me Luke.

189
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,319
I see, Sir Luke.

190
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,589
Ha ha.

191
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,914
Just Luke.

192
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,555
Oh... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

193
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,955
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.

194
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,229
Hello.

195
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,596
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

196
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,676
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

197
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,358
With all we've been through...

198
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,152
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are...

199
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,599
what with the rebellion and all.

200
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,517
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

201
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,596
That's how we came
to be in your service...

202
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,039
if you take my meaning, sir.

203
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,229
Have you been in many battles?

204
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,588
Several, I think.

205
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,153
Actually, there's not much to tell.

206
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,032
I'm not much more
than an interpreter...

207
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,912
and not very good at telling stories.

208
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,270
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

209
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,277
Well, my little friend...

210
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,073
you got something jammed
in here real good.

211
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,519
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

212
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,871
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

213
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,956
What's this?

214
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,991
"What is what"?
He asked you a question.

215
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,030
What is that?

216
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,479
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

217
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,636
You're my only hope.

218
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,838
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

219
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,598
You're my only hope.

220
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,839
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

221
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,269
Old data. Pay it no mind.

222
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,675
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

223
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,997
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

224
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,395
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

225
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,158
A person of some importance, I believe.

226
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,315
Our captain was attached...

227
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,555
Is there any more
to this recording?

228
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,839
Behave yourself, R2.

229
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,678
You're going to get us into trouble.

230
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,439
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

231
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,351
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

232
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,879
a resident of these parts...

233
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,718
and it's a private message for him.

234
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,717
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

235
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,717
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

236
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,239
But with all
we've been through...

237
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,272
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

238
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,392
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

239
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,034
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

240
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,957
I don't know any Obi-Wan...

241
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,311
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

242
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,112
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

243
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,593
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

244
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,119
I wonder who she is.

245
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,229
Sounds like she's in trouble.

246
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,157
I better play back the whole thing.

247
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,076
He says the restraining bolt...

248
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,760
has short-circuited
his recording system.

249
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,553
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

250
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,875
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

251
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,275
Oh, yeah. Well...

252
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,709
I guess you're too small
to run away on me...

253
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,989
if I take this off.

254
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,075
OK...

255
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,391
There you go.

256
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,431
Wait a minute.
Where'd she go?

257
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,915
Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

258
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,075
"What message"?

259
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,270
The one you've just been playing!

260
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,311
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

261
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,431
Luke! Luke!

262
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,913
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

263
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,439
I'm sorry, sir...

264
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,233
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

265
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,918
Here. See what you can do with him.

266
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,598
I'll be right back.

267
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,829
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.

268
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,276
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

269
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,630
No, I don't like you, either.

270
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,111
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

271
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,708
What makes you think that?

272
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,149
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

273
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,113
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

274
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,235
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

275
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,713
Do you know what
he's talking about?

276
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,795
Mm-mm.

277
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,878
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

278
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,672
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

279
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,031
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

280
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,559
and have its memory erased.

281
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,557
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

282
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,754
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

283
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,869
He won't.

284
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,275
I don't think he exists any more.

285
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,675
He died about the same time
as your father.

286
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,994
He knew my father?

287
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,758
I told you to forget it.

288
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,078
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

289
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,031
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

290
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,912
working on those condensers.

291
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,029
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,869
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,549
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

294
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,752
about me staying on another season?

295
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,950
And if these new droids
do work out...

296
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,911
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

297
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,679
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

298
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,518
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

299
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,551
Harvest is when I need you the most.

300
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,591
It's only one season more.

301
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,233
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...

302
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,873
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,798
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

304
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,558
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

305
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,352
But it's a whole 'nother year!

306
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,833
Look, it's only one more season.

307
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,951
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

308
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,956
Where are you going?

309
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,229
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

310
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,078
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

311
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,031
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

312
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,388
Most of his friends have gone.

313
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,511
It means so much to him.

314
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,312
I'll make it up to him next year.

315
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,395
I promise.

316
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,751
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

317
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,791
He has too much of his father in him.

318
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,876
That's what I'm afraid of.

319
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,038
Ooh!

320
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,513
What are you doing
hiding back there?

321
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,791
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,639
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

323
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,239
Kept babbling on about his mission.

324
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,918
Oh, no.

325
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,233
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

326
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,749
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

327
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,757
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

328
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,279
How could I be so stupid?

329
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,515
He's nowhere in sight.

330
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,914
Blast it!

331
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,349
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

332
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,072
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.

333
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,156
We'll have to wait until morning.

334
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,429
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

335
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,835
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

336
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,359
Boy, am I gonna get it.

337
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,199
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

338
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,550
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,999
Come on.

340
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,309
Luke?

341
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,635
Luke!

342
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,354
Luke!

343
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,035
Have you seen Luke this morning?

344
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,071
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...

345
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,428
so he left early.

346
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,913
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

347
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,439
I think so.

348
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,028
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

349
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,515
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

350
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,438
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

351
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,993
Dead ahead.

352
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,998
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

353
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,033
Hey, whoa! Where do
you think you're going?

354
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,072
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,078
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

356
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,794
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.

357
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,114
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

358
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,593
into a million pieces right here!

359
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,711
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

360
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,191
What's wrong with him now?

361
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,470
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

362
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,275
Sandpeople, or worse.

363
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,197
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

364
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,355
Come on!

365
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,511
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...

366
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,517
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

367
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,959
They're Sandpeople, all right.

368
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,719
I can see one of them now.

369
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,078
Hello, there.

370
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,517
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

371
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,795
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.

372
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,153
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

373
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,875
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

374
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,468
Ben?

375
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,033
Ben Kenobi?

376
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,037
Boy, am I glad to see you.

377
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,038
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.

378
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,111
Tell me, young Luke...

379
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,993
what brings you out this far?

380
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,712
This little droid.

381
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,199
I think he's searching
for his former master...

382
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,551
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

383
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,511
He claims to be the property...

384
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,153
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

385
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,395
Is he a relative of yours?

386
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,795
Do you know who
he's talking about?

387
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,956
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

388
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,550
Obi-Wan.

389
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,390
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

390
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,829
A long time.

391
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,155
I think my uncle knows him.

392
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,713
He said he was dead.

393
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,558
Oh, he's not dead.

394
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,749
Not yet.

395
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,233
You know him?

396
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,113
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.

397
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,829
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

398
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,269
since, oh, before you were born.

399
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,118
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

400
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,834
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

401
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,709
Very interesting.

402
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,919
I think we better get indoors.

403
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,395
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

404
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,751
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

405
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,833
3PO.

406
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,394
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

407
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,353
Can you stand?

408
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,959
We've got to get out of here before
the Sandpeople return.

409
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,469
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

410
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,160
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

411
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,599
I'm done for.

412
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,392
No, you're not.

413
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,509
What kind of talk is that?

414
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,198
Quickly. They're on the move.

415
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,796
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

416
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,592
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

417
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,472
That's what your uncle told you.

418
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,318
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

419
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,555
Thought he should
have stayed here...

420
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,432
and not gotten involved.

421
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,391
You fought in the Clone Wars?

422
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,273
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

423
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,628
the same as your father.

424
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,792
I wish I'd known him.

425
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,549
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

426
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,159
and a cunning warrior.

427
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,156
I understand you've become...

428
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,874
quite a good pilot yourself.

429
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,753
And he was a good friend.

430
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,916
Which reminds me...

431
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,634
I have something here for you.

432
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,439
Your father wanted you to have this...

433
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,879
when you were old enough...

434
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,956
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

435
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,559
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

436
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,557
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...

437
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,352
like your father did.

438
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,198
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

439
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,230
I'll close down for a while.

440
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,952
Sure. Go ahead.

441
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,032
What is it?

442
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,799
It's your father's lightsaber.

443
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,037
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

444
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,630
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

445
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,596
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

446
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,836
For over a thousand generations...

447
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,757
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

448
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,792
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

449
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,593
before the dark times...

450
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,233
before the Empire.

451
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,989
How did my father die?

452
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,192
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

453
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,312
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

454
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,274
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

455
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,314
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

456
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,194
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

457
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,996
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

458
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,553
The Force?

459
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,911
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

460
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,919
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

461
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,792
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

462
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,876
it binds the galaxy together.

463
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,993
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

464
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,951
and where you come from.

465
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,593
I saw part of a message he was...

466
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,631
I seem to have found it.

467
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,673
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

468
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,074
Now he begs you to help him...

469
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,316
in his struggle against the Empire.

470
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,079
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

471
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,077
But my ship has fallen under attack...

472
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,316
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

473
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,078
I have placed information...

474
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,758
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...

475
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,632
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

476
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,478
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

477
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,158
You must see this droid...

478
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,714
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

479
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,478
This is our most desperate hour.

480
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,513
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

481
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,474
You must learn
the ways of the Force...

482
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,716
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

483
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,149
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

484
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,679
I've got to get home.

485
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,074
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

486
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,839
<i>I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.</i>

487
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,952
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

488
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,159
I can't get involved.

489
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,555
I've got work to do.

490
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,114
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...

491
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,312
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

492
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,476
It's all such a long way from here.

493
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,477
That's your uncle talking.

494
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,749
My uncle.

495
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,269
How am I ever gonna explain this?

496
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,072
Learn about the Force, Luke.

497
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,910
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

498
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,874
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

499
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,788
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

500
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,196
Until this battle station
is fully operational...

501
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,673
we are vulnerable.

502
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,756
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

503
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,757
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

504
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,155
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...

505
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,350
not to this battle station.

506
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,074
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...

507
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,792
in the Imperial Senate...

508
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,912
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

509
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,519
I have just received word...

510
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,074
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

511
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,634
The last remnants
of the old Republic...

512
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,113
have been swept away.

513
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,832
That's impossible.

514
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,110
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

515
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,993
The regional governors
now have direct control...

516
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,758
over their territories.

517
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,759
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...

518
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,199
fear of this battle station.

519
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,072
And what of the rebellion?

520
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,997
If the rebels have obtained...

521
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,314
a complete technical readout
of this station...

522
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,032
it is possible, however unlikely...

523
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,355
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

524
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,519
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

525
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,949
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

526
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,354
would be a useless gesture...

527
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,710
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

528
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,276
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

529
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,595
I suggest we use it.

530
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,073
Don't be too proud...

531
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,316
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

532
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,671
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...

533
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,950
next to the power of the Force.

534
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,356
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

535
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,278
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

536
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,755
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

537
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,757
or given you
clairvoyance enough...

538
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,996
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...

539
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,439
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

540
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,788
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

541
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,433
As you wish.

542
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,476
This bickering is pointless.

543
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,151
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

544
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,953
by the time this station
is operational.

545
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,310
We will then crush the rebellion...

546
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,793
with one swift stroke.

547
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,231
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.

548
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,998
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

549
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,109
It's just, I've never heard of them...

550
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,150
hitting anything this big before.

551
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,269
They didn't...

552
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,755
but we are meant to think they did.

553
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,677
These tracks are side-by-side.

554
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,870
Sandpeople always ride single file...

555
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,797
to hide their numbers.

556
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,115
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

557
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,550
And these blast points,
too accurate...

558
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,954
for Sandpeople.

559
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,356
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

560
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,517
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

561
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,950
If they traced the robots here...

562
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,229
they may have learned
who they sold them to...

563
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,271
and that would lead
them back... home!

564
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,879
Wait, Luke!

565
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,877
It's too dangerous!

566
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,153
Uncle Owen!

567
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,589
Aunt Beru!

568
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,994
Uncle Owen!

569
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,439
And now, Your Highness...

570
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,357
we will discuss the location...

571
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,630
of your hidden rebel base.

572
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,477
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...

573
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,079
had you been there.

574
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,838
You'd have been killed, too...

575
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,396
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

576
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,035
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

577
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,832
There's nothing for me here now.

578
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,076
I want to learn
the ways of the Force...

579
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,633
and become a Jedi
like my father.

580
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,959
Mos Eisley spaceport.

581
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,074
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

582
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,077
We must be cautious.

583
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,956
How long have you
had these droids?

584
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,229
Three or four seasons.

585
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,588
They're up for sale
if you want them.

586
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,472
Let me see your identification.

587
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,751
You don't need to see
his identification.

588
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,110
We don't need to see
his identification.

589
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,470
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

590
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,353
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

591
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,755
He can go about his business.

592
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,155
You can go about your business.

593
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,190
Move along.

594
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,469
Move along.

595
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,715
Move along.

596
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,189
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

597
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,675
Go on, go on.

598
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,276
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.

599
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,719
I thought we were dead.

600
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,434
The Force can have
a strong influence...

601
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,959
on the weak-minded.

602
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,393
Do you really think we're
gonna find a pilot here...

603
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,999
that'll take us to Alderaan?

604
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,918
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

605
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,359
only watch your step.

606
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,118
This place can be a little rough.

607
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,231
I'm ready for anything.

608
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,079
Come along, R2.

609
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,392
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

610
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,396
What?

611
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,033
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

612
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,229
We don't want them here.

613
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,429
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?

614
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,549
We don't want any trouble.

615
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,477
I heartily agree with you, sir.

616
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,715
Uh...

617
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,068
I'll have one of those.

618
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,798
He doesn't like you.

619
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,592
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,188
I don't like you, either.

621
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,038
You just watch yourself.

622
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,275
We're wanted men.

623
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,517
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

624
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,039
I'll be careful.

625
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,309
You'll be dead!

626
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,237
This little one's not worth the effort.

627
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,510
Come, let me get you something.

628
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,996
Aah!

629
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,913
I'm all right.

630
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,315
Chewbacca here is first mate...

631
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,318
on a ship that might suit us.

632
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,510
I don't like the look of this.

633
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,279
<i>Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

634
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,597
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

635
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,915
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

636
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,793
<i>Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?</i>

637
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,275
Should I have?

638
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,472
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

639
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,436
I've outrun imperial starships.

640
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,516
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

641
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,676
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

642
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,635
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

643
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,318
What's the cargo?

644
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,398
Only passengers...
myself, the boy...

645
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,953
two droids...

646
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,878
and no questions asked.

647
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,878
What is it, some kind
of local trouble?

648
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,958
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...

649
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,911
any imperial entanglements.

650
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,635
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

651
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,955
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

652
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,398
10,000, all in advance.

653
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,228
10,000?

654
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,955
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

655
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,196
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?

656
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,276
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

657
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,675
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

658
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,758
We can pay you 2,000 now...

659
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,758
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.

660
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,677
Seventeen, huh?

661
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,348
O.K. You guys got
yourselves a ship.

662
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,674
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.

663
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,835
Docking Bay 94.

664
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,075
Ninety-four.

665
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,870
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest...

666
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,275
in your handiwork.

667
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,436
All right.
We'll check it out.

668
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,159
17,000!

669
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,759
Those guys must really
be desperate.

670
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,836
This could really save my neck.

671
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,474
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.

672
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,113
You'll have to sell your speeder.

673
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,437
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

674
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,995
Going somewhere, Solo?

675
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,792
Yes, Greedo.

676
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,035
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

677
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,037
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

678
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,116
It's too late.

679
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,515
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

680
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,916
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

681
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,838
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

682
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,837
I'm lucky I found you first.

683
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,030
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

684
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,550
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

685
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,114
I don't have it with me.

686
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,831
Tell Jabba...

687
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,315
Jabba's through with you.

688
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,829
He has no time for smugglers...

689
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,394
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

690
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,078
Even I get boarded sometimes.

691
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,156
Do you think I had a choice?

692
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,193
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

693
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,276
Over my dead body.

694
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,594
That's the idea.

695
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,508
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

696
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,868
I'll bet you have.

697
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,917
Sorry about the mess.

698
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,150
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

699
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,192
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

700
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,117
The final checkout is completed.

701
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,719
All systems are operational.

702
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,637
What course shall we set?

703
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,318
Perhaps she would respond...

704
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,237
to an alternative
form of persuasion.

705
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,679
What do you mean?

706
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,597
I think it is time
we demonstrated...

707
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,358
the full power of this station.

708
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,913
Set your course for Alderaan.

709
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,359
With pleasure.

710
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,675
Lock the door, R2.

711
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,031
Check this side of the street.

712
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,317
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.

713
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,959
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke...

714
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,479
than stay here with you.

715
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,795
I don't know what
all this trouble is about...

716
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,512
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.

717
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,794
You watch your language.

718
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,752
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

719
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,359
Look at this.

720
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,391
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

721
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,919
It'll be enough.

722
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,992
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

723
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,959
Right here, Jabba.

724
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,793
I've been waitin' for you.

725
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,751
Have you now.

726
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,871
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

727
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,512
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

728
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,596
Why haven't you paid me...

729
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,951
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

730
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,640
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.

731
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,988
Don't send one of these twerps.

732
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,635
Han, I can't make exceptions.

733
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,479
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

734
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,034
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

735
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,674
of an imperial starship?

736
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,597
It's not good business.

737
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,792
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

738
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,235
You think I had a choice?

739
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,032
But I got a nice, easy charter.

740
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,355
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.

741
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,311
I just need a little more time.

742
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,753
Han, my boy, you're the best.

743
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,155
So, for an extra 20%...

744
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,111
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

745
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,196
Okay, 15%.

746
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,356
But if you fail me again...

747
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,278
I'll put a price on your head so big...

748
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,234
you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.

749
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,874
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.

750
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,669
Come on!

751
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,276
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...

752
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,674
we ought to do well.

753
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,477
What a piece of junk!

754
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,716
She'll make.5 past light speed.

755
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,239
She may not look like much...

756
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,918
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.

757
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,600
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

758
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,075
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board...

759
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,553
we'll get outta here.

760
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,149
Hello, sir.

761
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,273
Which way?

762
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,070
All right, men,
load your weapons.

763
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,074
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

764
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,638
Chewie, get us out of here!

765
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,114
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

766
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,474
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

767
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,510
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.

768
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,153
Try and hold 'em off.

769
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,838
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations...

770
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,790
for the jump to light speed.

771
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,278
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.

772
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,072
They're gonna try
and cut us off.

773
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,918
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

774
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,837
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

775
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,234
We'll be safe enough...

776
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,191
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.

777
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,117
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

778
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,911
Here's where the fun begins.

779
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,792
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

780
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,480
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

781
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,238
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

782
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,397
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

783
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,509
Without precise calculations...

784
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,675
we'd fly right through a star...

785
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,199
or bounce too close
to a supernova...

786
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,231
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

787
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,315
What's that flashing?

788
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,190
We're losing a deflector shield.

789
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,639
Go strap yourselves in.

790
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,512
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

791
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,955
We've entered the Alderaan system.

792
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,229
Governor Tarkin.

793
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,713
I should have expected...

794
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,637
to find you holding Vader's leash.

795
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,239
I recognized your foul stench...

796
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,237
when I was brought on board.

797
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,476
Charming to the last.

798
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,114
You don't know
how hard I found it...

799
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,117
signing the order
to terminate your life.

800
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,355
I'm surprised you had the courage...

801
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,879
to take the responsibility yourself.

802
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,912
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

803
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,632
I would like you to be my guest...

804
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,070
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

805
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,158
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

806
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,589
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin...

807
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,314
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

808
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,273
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

809
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,675
In a way,
you have determined...

810
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,519
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.

811
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,392
Since you are reluctant...

812
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,318
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base...

813
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,193
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...

814
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,198
on your home planet of Alderaan.

815
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,435
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

816
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,959
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...

817
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,991
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

818
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,509
Then name the system.

819
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,517
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

820
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,200
Where is the rebel base?

821
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,670
Dantooine.

822
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,153
They're on Dantooine.

823
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,555
There. You see, Lord Vader?

824
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,033
She can be reasonable.

825
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,878
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

826
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,399
What?

827
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,794
You're far too trusting.

828
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,319
Dantooine is too remote...

829
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,829
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.

830
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,713
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

831
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,875
No!

832
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,116
Commence primary ignition.

833
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,477
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

834
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,875
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

835
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,433
as if millions of voices...

836
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,357
suddenly cried out in terror...

837
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,959
and were suddenly silenced.

838
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,719
I fear something terrible
has happened.

839
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,640
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

840
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,234
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

841
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,237
I told you I'd outrun them.

842
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,076
Don't everybody thank me at once.

843
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,478
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

844
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,398
Now be careful, R2.

845
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,599
Argh!

846
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,392
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

847
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,193
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

848
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,550
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

849
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,592
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets...

850
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,039
when they lose.

851
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,116
Wookiees are known to do that.

852
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,798
Grrr...

853
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,275
I see your point, sir.

854
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,719
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

855
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,239
Let the Wookiee win.

856
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,749
Argh!

857
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,433
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

858
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,471
You mean it controls your actions?

859
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,398
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.

860
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,632
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

861
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,352
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.

862
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,675
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

863
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,917
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

864
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,519
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

865
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,835
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

866
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,270
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

867
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,313
There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

868
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,228
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

869
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,113
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

870
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,038
This time, let go
your conscious self...

871
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,956
and act on instinct.

872
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,231
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.

873
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,679
How am I supposed to fight?

874
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,710
Your eyes can deceive you.

875
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,875
Don't trust them.

876
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,115
Stretch out with your feelings.

877
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,036
You see? You can do it.

878
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,718
I call it luck.

879
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,308
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

880
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,715
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.

881
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,593
Good against the living,
that's something else.

882
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,558
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.

883
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,988
You know, I did feel something.

884
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,235
I could almost see the remote.

885
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,236
That's good.

886
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,112
You've taken your first step...

887
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,958
into a larger world.

888
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,309
Yes?

889
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,113
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.

890
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,037
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

891
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,390
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

892
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,910
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

893
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,873
She lied. She lied to us!

894
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,594
I told you she would never...

895
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,995
consciously betray the rebellion.

896
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,997
Terminate her immediately.

897
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,109
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.

898
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,559
Cut in the sublight engines.

899
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,318
What the...

900
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,157
Arrghh arrgh!

901
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,555
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

902
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,829
Some kind of asteroid collision.

903
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,836
It's not on any of the charts.

904
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,154
What's going on?

905
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,430
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

906
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,754
What do you mean?
Where is it?

907
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,074
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

908
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,519
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

909
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,516
What? How?

910
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,198
Destroyed by the Empire.

911
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,515
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

912
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,914
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...

913
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,558
There's another ship coming in.

914
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,590
Maybe they know what happened.

915
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,869
It's an imperial fighter.

916
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,515
It followed us!

917
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,551
No. It's a short-range fighter.

918
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,591
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

919
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,392
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

920
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,396
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

921
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,430
Not if I can help it.

922
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,549
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

923
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,510
It would be as well to let it go.

924
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,516
It's too far out of range.

925
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,789
Not for long.

926
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,559
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

927
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,194
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

928
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,878
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...

929
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,069
to tell anybody about us.

930
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,198
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

931
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,834
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

932
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,271
That's no moon.

933
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,799
It's a space station.

934
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,638
It's too big to be a space station.

935
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,149
I have a very bad feeling about this.

936
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,952
Turn the ship around.

937
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,150
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

938
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,396
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

939
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,795
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

940
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,718
Why are we still
moving towards it?!

941
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,558
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

942
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,238
There's got to be
something you can do!

943
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,679
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

944
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,949
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

945
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,513
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

946
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,108
You can't win...

947
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,276
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

948
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,270
Clear Bay 327.

949
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,630
We are opening
the magnetic field.

950
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,829
To your stations!

951
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,188
Come with me.

952
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,439
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

953
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,437
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

954
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,829
Yes?

955
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,313
<i>We've captured a freighter...</i>

956
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,668
<i>entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

957
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,438
<i>Its markings match
those of a ship...</i>

958
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,869
<i>that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley.</i>

959
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,356
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

960
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,278
She may yet be of some use to us.

961
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,628
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.</i>

962
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,316
<i>316, report to control.</i>

963
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,157
There's no one on board, sir.

964
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,874
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

965
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,797
It must be a decoy, sir.

966
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,319
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

967
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,270
Did you find any droids?

968
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,230
No, sir.

969
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,191
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

970
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,753
Send a scanning crew aboard.

971
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,598
I want every part
of this ship checked.

972
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,630
Yes, sir.

973
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,079
I sense something...

974
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,033
a presence I've not felt since...

975
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,079
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

976
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,838
I want every part
of this ship checked.

977
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,437
There's no one here.

978
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,637
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

979
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,113
I use them for smuggling.

980
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,798
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

981
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,194
This is ridiculous.

982
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,514
Even if I could take off...

983
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,959
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

984
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,433
Leave that to me.

985
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,199
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

986
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,548
Who's the more foolish...

987
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,591
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

988
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,119
Argh!

989
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,359
The ship's all yours.

990
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,277
If the scanners pick up anything...

991
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,197
report it immediately.

992
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,038
All right, let's go.

993
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,719
Hey, down there!

994
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,636
Could you give us a hand
with this?

995
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,673
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

996
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,995
TK-421, do you copy?

997
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,512
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

998
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,392
I'll see what I can do.

999
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,831
Grrr!

1000
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,958
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...

1001
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,514
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

1002
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,073
Bring them on!

1003
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,269
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

1004
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,277
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

1005
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,039
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

1006
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,400
He says he's found
the main controls...

1007
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,795
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

1008
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,956
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

1009
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,640
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor...

1010
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,113
in seven locations.

1011
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,673
A power loss
at one of the terminals...

1012
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,234
will allow the ship to leave.

1013
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,079
I don't think you boys can help.

1014
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,838
I must go alone.

1015
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,473
Whatever you say.

1016
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,238
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

1017
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,759
I want to go with you.

1018
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,030
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

1019
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,673
They must be delivered safely...

1020
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,678
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

1021
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,679
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

1022
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,389
The Force will be with you always.

1023
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,456
Argh argh argh!

1024
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,059
You said it, Chewie.

1025
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,456
Where did you dig up
that old fossil?

1026
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,377
Ben is a great man.

1027
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,889
Yeah, great at getting us
into trouble.

1028
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,294
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

1029
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,694
Well, anything's better
than just hangin' around...

1030
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,935
waiting for 'em to pick us up.

1031
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,890
Who do you think...

1032
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,459
What is it?

1033
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,536
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

1034
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,890
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."

1035
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,614
Well, who... who has he found?

1036
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,616
Princess Leia.

1037
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,332
The princess?
She's here?!

1038
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,336
Princess?

1039
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,654
Where? Where is she?

1040
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,974
Princess? What's going on?

1041
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,850
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

1042
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,017
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

1043
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,095
Oh, no!

1044
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,539
We've got to do something!

1045
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,139
What are you talking about?

1046
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,409
The droids belong to her.

1047
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,370
She's the one in the message.

1048
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,569
We got to help her.

1049
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,849
Now look, don't get
any funny ideas.

1050
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,049
The old man wants us
to wait right here.

1051
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,499
But he didn't know
she was here.

1052
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,611
Just find a way back into that
detention block.

1053
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,650
I'm not going anywhere.

1054
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:26,815
They're going to execute her.

1055
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,339
Look, a few minutes ago, you said...

1056
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,370
you didn't want to just wait here
to be captured.

1057
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,455
Now all you want to do is stay?

1058
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,172
Marching into the detention area...

1059
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,369
is not what I had in mind.

1060
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,489
But they're gonna kill her!

1061
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,178
Better her than me.

1062
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,894
She's rich.

1063
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,329
Argh!

1064
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,575
Rich?

1065
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,213
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1066
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,218
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

1067
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,455
What?

1068
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,933
Well, more well
than you can imagine.

1069
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,335
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

1070
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,449
You'll get it.

1071
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,569
I better.

1072
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,053
You will.

1073
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,613
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

1074
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,729
All right.

1075
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,690
What's your plan?

1076
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,048
Um...

1077
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,570
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

1078
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,577
O.K.

1079
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,736
Now... I'm gonna
put these on you.

1080
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:15,815
Grrr!

1081
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:19,694
O.K. Han, you... you put those on.

1082
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,855
Don't worry, Chewie.

1083
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,379
I think I know
what he has in mind.

1084
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,173
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

1085
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,939
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

1086
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,499
Lock the door.

1087
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,736
And hope they don't have blasters.

1088
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,498
That isn't very reassuring.

1089
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,009
Grrr!

1090
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,499
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1091
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,771
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1092
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,136
<i>316, report to control.</i>

1093
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,734
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1094
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,374
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1095
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,050
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

1096
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,574
This is not gonna work.

1097
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,769
Why didn't you say so before?

1098
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,777
I did say so before.

1099
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,417
Where are you taking this... thing?

1100
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,134
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

1101
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,649
I wasn't notified.

1102
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,816
I'll have to clear it.

1103
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,889
Argh!

1104
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,248
Look out! He's loose!

1105
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,210
He'll tear us all apart!

1106
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,568
I'll get him!

1107
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,855
Look out!

1108
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:04,690
Arrgh!

1109
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,135
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

1110
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,579
Here it is... 2187.

1111
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,134
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

1112
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,255
Uh... Uh, everything's
under control.

1113
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,529
Situation normal.

1114
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,809
<i>What happened?</i>

1115
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,215
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

1116
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,456
but, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now.

1117
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,219
We're fine... We're all fine
here now. Thank you.

1118
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,455
How are you?

1119
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,377
<i>We're sending a squad up.</i>

1120
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,819
Uh, negative, negative!

1121
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:36,408
We have a... a reactor leak
here, uh, now.

1122
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,529
Give us a few minutes
to lock it down.

1123
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,412
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

1124
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,134
<i>Who is this? What's your
operating number?</i>

1125
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,329
Uh...

1126
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,615
Boring conversation anyway.

1127
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,459
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1128
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,689
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

1129
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,650
Huh?

1130
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,259
Oh, the uniform.

1131
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,811
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

1132
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,293
You're who?

1133
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,489
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

1134
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,655
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1135
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,895
Ben Kenobi?!
Where is he?

1136
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:15,930
Come on!

1137
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,014
He is here.

1138
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,370
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1139
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,649
What makes you think so?

1140
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,214
A tremor in the Force.

1141
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,409
The last time I felt it...

1142
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:28,576
was in the presence
of my old master.

1143
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,055
Surely he must be dead by now.

1144
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,899
Don't underestimate the Force.

1145
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,817
The Jedi are extinct.

1146
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,056
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1147
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,456
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

1148
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,013
Yes.

1149
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,095
<i>We have an emergency alert...</i>

1150
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,734
<i>in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

1151
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,929
The princess?

1152
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,288
Put all sections on alert.

1153
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,819
Obi-Wan is here.

1154
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,851
The Force is with him.

1155
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:53,969
If you're right...

1156
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,897
he must not be
allowed to escape.

1157
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,453
Escape is not his plan.

1158
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,172
I must face him alone.

1159
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,450
Argh!

1160
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,571
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

1161
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,575
Watch your left.

1162
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,179
They went down the cell bay.

1163
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,133
Can't get out that way.

1164
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,773
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

1165
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,052
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

1166
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,499
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1167
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,814
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1168
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,578
Are there any other ways
out of the cell bay?

1169
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,338
We've been cut off!

1170
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,576
What was that?
I didn't copy.

1171
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,897
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1172
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,738
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1173
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,693
All other information
on your level is restricted.

1174
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,253
Open up in there!

1175
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,132
Open up in there!

1176
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,852
Oh, no!

1177
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,459
There isn't any other way out!

1178
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,258
Argh!

1179
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,976
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!

1180
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,738
This is some rescue!

1181
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,452
You came in here, and you didn't
have a plan for getting out?

1182
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,457
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1183
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,695
Well, I didn't...

1184
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,255
What the hell are you doing?

1185
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,610
Somebody has to save our skins.

1186
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,452
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

1187
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,652
- Get in there!
- Arrgh!

1188
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,499
Get in there, you big furry oaf!

1189
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,735
I don't care what you smell.

1190
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,533
Get in there, and
don't worry about it.

1191
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,499
Wonderful girl!

1192
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,416
Either I'm going to kill her...

1193
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,610
or I'm beginning to like her.

1194
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,694
Get in there!

1195
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,496
Aah!

1196
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,295
Ah!

1197
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,853
Argh!

1198
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,299
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

1199
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,776
What an incredible smell
you've discovered!

1200
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,450
Let's get out of here.

1201
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,774
Get away from there.

1202
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,810
No, wait!

1203
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,176
Will you forget it?!
I already tried it!

1204
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,733
It's magnetically sealed.

1205
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,816
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

1206
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,771
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1207
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,095
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

1208
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,653
Ya know, it's not
gonna take 'em long...

1209
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,213
to figure out
what happened to us!

1210
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,137
It could be worse.

1211
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,170
Woorr!

1212
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,934
It's worse.

1213
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,493
There's something alive in here.

1214
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,939
That's your imagination.

1215
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,733
Something just moved past my leg.

1216
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,336
Look! Did you see that?

1217
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,290
What?

1218
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,058
Grrr!

1219
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:09,650
Woorr!

1220
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,610
Kid!

1221
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,570
Luke!

1222
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,053
Luke!

1223
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,090
Luke!

1224
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,329
Luke!

1225
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:20,855
Aah!

1226
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:21,890
Woorr!

1227
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,376
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1228
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,809
Blast it!
My gun's jammed.

1229
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,498
Where?

1230
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,530
Anywhere!

1231
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,055
Luke, Luke!

1232
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,378
Help him!

1233
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,535
What happened?

1234
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,695
I don't know.

1235
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,936
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

1236
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:17,529
I got a bad feeling about this.

1237
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,776
Grrr!

1238
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,650
The walls are moving!

1239
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,008
Don't just stand there!

1240
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,495
Try and brace it with something.

1241
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,297
Grrr!

1242
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,819
Help me!

1243
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:47,969
Wait a minute!

1244
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,252
3PO!

1245
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,610
Come in, 3PO!

1246
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,173
<i>3PO!</i>

1247
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,052
<i>Where could he be?</i>

1248
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,457
Take over. See to him.

1249
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,770
Look, there.

1250
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,419
They're madmen.

1251
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,734
They're heading for the prison level.

1252
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,293
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1253
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,819
Follow me.

1254
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,736
You stand guard.

1255
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,859
Come on.

1256
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,819
Oh!

1257
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,451
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

1258
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,856
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

1259
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,379
All right.

1260
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:55,690
3PO!

1261
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,094
Come in, 3PO!

1262
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,573
3PO!

1263
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,019
Get on top!

1264
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,209
I can't.

1265
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,093
Where could he be?! 3PO!

1266
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,176
3PO, will you come in!

1267
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,619
They aren't here.

1268
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,889
Something must have
happened to them.

1269
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,339
See if they've been captured.

1270
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:11,415
Hurry.

1271
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,253
One thing's for sure...

1272
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,733
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1273
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,291
Get on top of it.

1274
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:23,455
I'm trying.

1275
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,972
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1276
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,055
Where could they be?

1277
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,979
"Use the comlink"?

1278
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,660
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

1279
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,768
Are you there, sir?

1280
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,572
3PO!

1281
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,689
We've had some problems.

1282
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,889
Will you shut up
and listen to me?!

1283
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,738
Shut down all
the garbage mashers...

1284
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:49,736
on the detention level, will ya?!

1285
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,418
Do you copy!?

1286
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,816
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1287
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:57,374
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1288
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,138
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1289
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:11,976
What?

1290
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,533
Ha ha!

1291
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,571
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2!

1292
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,213
Curse my metal body!

1293
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:23,049
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

1294
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,659
We're all right! You did great!

1295
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,089
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch...

1296
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,256
on unit number...
Where are we?

1297
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,577
3263827!

1298
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,018
If we can just avoid
any more female advice...

1299
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,256
we ought to be able
to get outta here.

1300
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,779
Well, let's get moving.

1301
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,810
Grrr!

1302
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,737
Where are you going?

1303
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,849
Aw...

1304
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,333
No, wait! They'll hear!

1305
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,292
Come here, you big coward.

1306
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,330
Chewie, come here.

1307
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,734
Listen...

1308
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,328
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

1309
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,258
but from now on, you do
as I tell you, OK?

1310
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,211
Look, Your Worshipfulness...

1311
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,137
let's get one thing straight.

1312
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,933
I take orders from
just one person... me.

1313
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,971
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1314
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,217
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

1315
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,332
No reward is worth this.

1316
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,130
Give me regular reports, please.

1317
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,295
Right.

1318
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,739
Do you know what's going on?

1319
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:10,532
Maybe it's another drill.

1320
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,933
You seen that new VT-16?

1321
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,290
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1322
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,411
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see...

1323
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,531
What was that?

1324
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,139
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1325
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,170
Don't worry about it.

1326
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,330
There she is.

1327
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,609
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1328
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,650
Yes, sir.

1329
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,611
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

1330
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,935
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1331
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,413
We're right above you.
Stand by.

1332
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,132
You came in that thing?

1333
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,249
You're braver than I thought.

1334
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,608
Nice! Come on.

1335
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,450
It's them!

1336
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,490
Blast them!

1337
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,535
Get back to the ship!

1338
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,013
Where are you going?
Come back!

1339
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,095
He certainly has courage.

1340
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,494
What good will it do us...

1341
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,690
if he gets himself killed?
Come on.

1342
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,256
Aah!

1343
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,850
Aah!

1344
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,529
Whoop!

1345
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,174
I think we took a wrong turn.

1346
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,210
There's no lock.

1347
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,294
That oughta hold them
for a while.

1348
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,819
Quick! We've got to get across.

1349
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,578
Find the controls
that extend the bridge.

1350
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,019
I think I just blasted it.

1351
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,858
They're coming through!

1352
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,255
Here, hold this.

1353
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:23,529
Here they come.

1354
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,018
For luck.

1355
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,458
We think they may be splitting up.

1356
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,697
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1357
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,735
Where could they be?

1358
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,217
Close the blast doors!

1359
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,416
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

1360
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,335
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1361
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,893
We meet again at last.

1362
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,978
The circle is now complete.

1363
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,455
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1364
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,536
<i>Now I am the master.</i>

1365
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,458
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1366
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,210
Your powers are weak, old man.

1367
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:10,853
You can't win, Darth.

1368
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,857
If you strike me down...

1369
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,177
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1370
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,259
You should not have come back.

1371
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,540
Didn't we just leave this party?

1372
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:55,209
What kept you?

1373
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,216
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1374
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,329
The ship all right?

1375
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,098
It seems OK,
if we can get to it.

1376
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,938
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1377
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:16,009
Look!

1378
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,252
Come on, R2, we're going.

1379
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,049
Now's our chance! Go!

1380
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,690
Ben?

1381
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,258
No!

1382
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,850
Come on!

1383
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,049
Come on!

1384
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,579
Come on!

1385
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,769
Luke, it's too late!

1386
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,572
Blast the door, kid!

1387
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,090
<i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

1388
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,859
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

1389
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,448
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
O.K. Hit it!

1390
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,297
Aargh!

1391
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,850
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1392
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,572
Hold them off.

1393
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,215
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1394
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,855
I can't believe he's gone.

1395
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,775
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1396
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,653
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1397
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,058
You in, kid?
OK, stay sharp.

1398
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,569
Here they come.

1399
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,612
They're coming in too fast!

1400
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,699
We've lost the lateral controls!

1401
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,970
Don't worry.
She'll hold together.

1402
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,337
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1403
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,610
Ha ha!

1404
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,099
Got him! I got him!

1405
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,370
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1406
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,298
There's still two more
of them out there!

1407
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,173
That's it! We did it!

1408
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,336
We did it!

1409
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,815
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1410
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,779
Are they away?

1411
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,812
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1412
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:39,092
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1413
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,780
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1414
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,572
This had better work.

1415
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,340
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1416
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:49,418
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1417
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,690
That doesn't sound too hard.

1418
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,048
They let us go.

1419
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,374
It's the only explanation...

1420
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,979
for the ease of our escape.

1421
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,135
Easy? You call that easy?

1422
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:58,170
They're tracking us.

1423
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,892
Not this ship, sister.

1424
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:03,535
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1425
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,218
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1426
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:08,093
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1427
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:10,654
I only hope that
when the data's analyzed...

1428
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:12,293
a weakness can be found.

1429
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,853
It's not over yet.

1430
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,618
It is for me, sister.

1431
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:17,378
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution...

1432
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,252
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1433
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,529
I expect to be well paid.

1434
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,775
I'm in it for the money.

1435
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,777
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1436
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,413
If money is all that you love...

1437
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,895
then that's what you'll receive.

1438
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,691
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1439
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,936
I wonder if he really cares
about anything...

1440
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:35,493
or anybody.

1441
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,019
I care.

1442
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,689
So...

1443
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,253
what do you think of her, Han?

1444
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,132
I'm trying not to, kid.

1445
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,216
Good.

1446
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,293
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1447
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,659
I don't know.
What do you think?

1448
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,213
You think a princess
and a guy like me...

1449
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,012
No!

1450
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,290
You're safe.

1451
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,614
When we heard about Alderaan...

1452
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,855
we feared the worst.

1453
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,572
We have no time
for sorrows, Commander.

1454
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,418
You must use the information
in this R2 unit...

1455
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,416
to help plan the attack.

1456
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,939
It's our only hope.

1457
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,054
Yes.

1458
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,533
<i>We're approaching
the planet Yavin.</i>

1459
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,457
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1460
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:26,014
<i>We are preparing
to orbit the planet.</i>

1461
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,296
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1462
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,138
and carries a firepower...

1463
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,091
greater than half the starfleet.

1464
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:44,338
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1465
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:49,488
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1466
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,736
Pardon me for asking, sir...

1467
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,613
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1468
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:58,096
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter...

1469
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:59,175
to be any threat...

1470
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,939
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1471
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,972
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1472
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,217
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1473
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:10,934
The approach will not be easy.

1474
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:14,052
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1475
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,377
and skim the surface
to this point.

1476
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,094
The target area
is only 2 meters wide.

1477
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,256
It's a small thermal exhaust port...

1478
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,769
right below the main port.

1479
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,892
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1480
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,534
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction...

1481
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,776
which should destroy the station.

1482
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:36,336
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1483
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,688
The shaft is ray-shielded...

1484
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,458
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1485
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,935
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1486
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,336
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1487
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:47,735
They're not much bigger
than 2 meters.

1488
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:51,091
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1489
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:01,175
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1490
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,131
<i>The moon with the rebel base...</i>

1491
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,455
<i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1492
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:07,775
This will be a day long remembered.

1493
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:10,209
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1494
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:14,697
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1495
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,297
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1496
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:24,173
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1497
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,458
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1498
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,979
That's right. Yeah.

1499
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:34,649
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

1500
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,418
And even if I didn't...

1501
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:39,054
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1502
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,738
Why don't you come with us?

1503
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:42,612
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1504
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,493
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1505
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:46,848
You know what's about to happen...

1506
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,208
what they're up against.

1507
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,455
They could use
a good pilot like you.

1508
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,979
You're turning
your back on them.

1509
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,375
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1510
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,297
Besides, attacking
that battle station...

1511
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,409
ain't my idea of courage.

1512
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,213
It's more like... suicide.

1513
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,416
All right.

1514
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,690
Take care of yourself, Han.

1515
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:06,254
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1516
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,654
Hey, Luke.

1517
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:13,129
May the Force be with you.

1518
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:16,890
Argh!

1519
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,215
Argh!

1520
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,568
What are you looking at?

1521
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,418
I know what I'm doing.

1522
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,936
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1523
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,937
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1524
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,333
What's wrong?

1525
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,893
Oh, it's Han.

1526
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,136
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1527
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,773
He's got to follow his own path.

1528
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,652
No one can choose it for him.

1529
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:49,693
I only wish Ben were here.

1530
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,617
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1531
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,457
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1532
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:02,536
Hey, Luke!

1533
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:03,649
Biggs!

1534
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,418
I don't believe it.
How are you?

1535
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:06,370
Great.

1536
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,455
Hey, coming up?

1537
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:08,774
I'll be right up there with you...

1538
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,492
and have I got stories to tell you.

1539
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,737
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1540
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,420
Sir, Luke is
the best bush pilot...

1541
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:18,098
in the outer-rim territories.

1542
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,255
You'll do all right.

1543
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,608
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1544
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,253
I gotta get aboard.

1545
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,529
We'll hear all your stories when
we get back, all right?

1546
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:24,536
All right.

1547
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,649
Hey, Biggs.

1548
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:27,099
I told you I'd make it someday.

1549
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,050
It'll be like old times, Luke.

1550
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:29,818
They'll never stop us.

1551
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,498
Hey, this R2 unit of yours
seems a bit beat up.

1552
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,609
You want a new one?

1553
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,298
Not on your life.

1554
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,739
That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

1555
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:39,770
You OK, R2?

1556
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,655
Good.

1557
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:46,931
<i>Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.</i>

1558
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,528
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1559
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,651
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1560
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:44,053
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1561
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:55,539
<i>Standby alert.</i>

1562
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,776
<i>Death Star approaching.</i>

1563
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,892
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1564
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,649
All wings report in.

1565
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,610
Red 10 standing by.

1566
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,729
Red Seven standing by.

1567
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:17,849
Red Three standing by.

1568
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,129
Red Six standing by.

1569
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,579
Red Nine standing by.

1570
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,610
Red Two standing by.

1571
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,650
Red 11 standing by.

1572
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,532
Red Five standing by.

1573
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,697
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1574
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:33,617
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1575
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:34,855
Hold tight.

1576
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,972
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1577
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,532
Look at the size of that thing!

1578
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:45,128
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1579
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,375
This is it, boys.

1580
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,013
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1581
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,255
I copy, Gold Leader.

1582
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:53,813
We're starting for
the target shaft now.

1583
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:54,895
We're in position.

1584
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,055
I'm going to cut across the axis...

1585
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,295
and try and draw their fire.

1586
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:12,698
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1587
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,253
I see it. Stay low.

1588
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,853
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1589
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,215
Luke, pull up!

1590
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:30,849
Are you all right?

1591
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:32,049
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.

1592
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:39,298
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1593
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:40,375
but they're so small...

1594
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,615
they're evading our turbolasers.

1595
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,492
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1596
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,531
Get the crews to their fighters.

1597
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,130
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming...

1598
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:52,057
from the right side
of that deflection tower.

1599
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,135
I'm on it.

1600
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,091
I'm going in.
Cover me, Porkins.

1601
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,414
I'm right with you,
Red Three.

1602
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,774
I've got a problem here.

1603
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,696
Eject.

1604
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:05,696
I can hold it.

1605
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:06,650
Pull up!

1606
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:09,374
No, I'm all... Aah!

1607
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,771
<i>The rebel base
will be in firing range...</i>

1608
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,333
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

1609
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,019
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1610
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,334
Squad leaders, we've
picked up a new group of signals.

1611
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,018
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1612
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,732
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1613
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,929
Pick up your visual scanning.

1614
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,970
Here they come.

1615
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,738
Watch it. You've got one
on your tail.

1616
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,810
I'm hit!

1617
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,175
You've picked one up!
Watch it!

1618
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,574
I can't see it!

1619
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:56,098
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him!

1620
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,690
I'll be right there.

1621
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,177
Several fighters have broken off...

1622
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:14,655
from the main group.
Come with me.

1623
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,889
Fall in! Fall in!

1624
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,930
Watch your back, Luke.

1625
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:21,970
Watch your back.

1626
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,294
Fighters above you, coming in.

1627
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:30,415
I'm hit, but not bad.

1628
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,859
R2, see what you can do with it.

1629
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,050
Hang on back there.

1630
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,614
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1631
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,173
There's a heavy fire zone.

1632
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,096
Red Five, where are you?

1633
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,573
I can't shake him!

1634
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,899
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1635
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:50,578
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1636
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:58,329
Thanks, Wedge.

1637
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:00,610
Good shooting,
Wedge. Red Leader...

1638
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,855
this is Gold Leader.

1639
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,049
We're starting our attack run.

1640
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:07,175
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.

1641
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,570
Stay in attack formation.

1642
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,453
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1643
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,209
Switch all power...

1644
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,695
to front deflector screen.

1645
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:25,219
Switch all power...

1646
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,171
to front deflector screen.

1647
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:32,418
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1648
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,655
Say about 20 guns...

1649
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,611
some on the surface,
some on the towers.

1650
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:38,459
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1651
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,378
Switch to targeting computer.

1652
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:47,691
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1653
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:52,015
The guns!
They've stopped!

1654
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:54,979
Stabilize your rear deflectors.

1655
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,738
Watch for enemy fighters.

1656
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:58,532
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1657
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:02,496
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1658
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:03,848
Yes, sir.

1659
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:18,809
It's no good.
I can't maneuver.

1660
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:19,929
Stay on target.

1661
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:20,890
We're too close.

1662
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:22,009
Stay on target.

1663
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:24,650
Loosen up!

1664
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:30,259
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1665
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,574
I copy, Gold Leader.

1666
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,610
They came from behind.

1667
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:38,937
We've analyzed their attack, sir...

1668
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,335
and there is a danger.

1669
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,769
Should I have your
ship standing by?

1670
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,653
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1671
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,418
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1672
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:51,100
<i>Rebel base, three minutes
and closing.</i>

1673
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,575
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1674
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,019
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1675
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,210
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1676
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:59,137
Red Three standing by.

1677
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:00,739
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1678
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,259
Keep half your group
out of range...

1679
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,608
for the next run.

1680
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:06,015
Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.

1681
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:09,291
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1682
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,538
This is it!

1683
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:24,931
We should be able to see it by now.

1684
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:28,252
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1685
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:31,128
There's too much interference.

1686
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,295
Red Five, can you see them
from where you are?

1687
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,217
No sign of any...
Wait. Coming in.35.

1688
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,250
I see them.

1689
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:37,775
I'm in range.

1690
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:39,930
Target's coming up.

1691
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:45,176
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1692
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,495
Close up formation.

1693
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:50,890
Almost there.

1694
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,451
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1695
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,729
Almost there.

1696
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,658
I can't hold them.

1697
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,492
Aah!

1698
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:14,979
It's away!

1699
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,093
It's a hit!

1700
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:22,176
Negative, negative.
It didn't go in.

1701
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,814
It just impacted on the surface.

1702
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,613
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1703
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,935
Turn to.05.
We'll cover for you.

1704
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:38,370
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1705
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,650
Get set up for your attack run.

1706
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,658
Aah!

1707
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,932
<i>Rebel base,
one minute and closing.</i>

1708
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,176
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1709
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,018
We're going in full throttle.

1710
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,459
That ought to keep those
fighters off our back.

1711
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,571
Right with you, boss.

1712
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:05,850
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1713
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:07,891
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1714
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,056
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1715
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,169
My scope shows the tower...

1716
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,619
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1717
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,139
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1718
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,371
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1719
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,694
What about that tower?

1720
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:28,889
You worry about those fighters!

1721
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,135
I'll worry about the tower!

1722
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:38,373
R2, that stabilizer's
broken loose again.

1723
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,728
See if you can't lock it down.

1724
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,216
Fighters coming in.3.

1725
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:00,249
I'm hit!
I can't stay with you!

1726
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:02,610
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1727
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,650
Sorry.

1728
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,532
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1729
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,819
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time.

1730
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,055
We can't hold them.

1731
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,814
R2, try and increase the power.

1732
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,415
Hurry up, Luke!

1733
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:25,973
Quick! Quick!

1734
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,609
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1735
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,775
I'm on the leader.

1736
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:41,459
Hang on, R2.

1737
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:58,575
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1738
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:03,251
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1739
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,495
The Force is strong with this one.

1740
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,133
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1741
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,734
His computer's off.

1742
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:17,657
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!

1743
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:19,293
What's wrong?

1744
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,978
Nothing. I'm all right.

1745
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,529
I've lost R2!

1746
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,779
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1747
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:41,573
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1748
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,258
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1749
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,735
You may fire when ready.

1750
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:47,976
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1751
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,138
I have you now.

1752
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:05,415
What?

1753
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,450
Yahoo!

1754
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,494
Look out!

1755
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,053
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1756
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,973
<i>Stand by.</i>

1757
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,299
<i>Stand by.</i>

1758
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,330
Great shot, kid!

1759
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,530
That was one in a million!

1760
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:47,972
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1761
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:07,059
Luke!

1762
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:12,179
Hey! Hey!

1763
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,972
I knew you'd come back.
I just knew it.

1764
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,328
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit...

1765
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:16,688
and take all the reward.

1766
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:19,254
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1767
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:20,495
Oh, no!

1768
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,929
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1769
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:26,291
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1770
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,138
We'll get to work
on him right away.

1771
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,534
You must repair him.

1772
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,457
Sir, if any of my circuits
or gears will help...

1773
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,410
I'll gladly donate them.

1774
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:33,609
He'll be all right.

1775
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,179
Argh!

1776
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:10,608
Argh!

1777
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:19,859
Argh!
