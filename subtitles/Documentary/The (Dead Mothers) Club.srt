1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,640
I wanted to make plans and meet up,
Episode 17

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:07,870
I wanted to make plans and meet up,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,310
but we're meeting at the last minute.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,070
I know.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,180
I didn't have any appointments today.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,010
If you said that

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,650
you had cancelled your appointment for me,

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,680
I would've been so happy.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,120
Oh, is that right?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,520
I'll pour you a drink.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,020
Thank you.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,800
So what is it you wanted to talk about?

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,530
Let's drink first.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,110
President Baek, will you

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,710
treat me as you do your own daughters?

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,110
My daughters.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,750
My own daughters, you say?

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,250
Since you're younger than my eldest daughter.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,920
I guess it's alright.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,520
What is this about?

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,330
Oh, President Baek.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,960
You re a lot more impatient than you look.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,470
Of course, I'd like to ask for advice on

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,670
business from a talented and

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,810
famous individual, as yourself.

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,440
But before I do,

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,250
I think we should become closer.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,750
You still have a lot to learn.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,890
Pardon?

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,820
Do I seem that easy to you?

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,360
I always place my

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,500
objective reasoning first over personal feelings.

33
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,270
In the cold battlefield of business,

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,000
that's how you're able to survive.

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,640
All human relationships are about business.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,610
And you want me to treat you like a daughter?

37
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,150
Those rules apply between parents and

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,950
children, too, and that's my creed.

39
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,550
Sir, what I had meant was...

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,260
Do you know what my nickname is?

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,430
It's viper, a mamushi.

42
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,700
I revel in my nickname.

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,440
Let me pour you a drink.

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,520
<i>So you're nickname is "viper"?</i>

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,060
<i>Fine, I'll show you how a viper</i>

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,190
<i>meets its demise.</i>

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,150
Yeonhui, you should eat up.

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,950
Women who are too skinny aren't attractive.

49
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,020
I prefer plumper women.

50
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,760
Why did you say that to me earlier?

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,530
Oh goodness.

52
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,860
You're still dwelling on that?

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,770
I told you I didn't mean anything by it.

54
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,670
It's nothing at all.

55
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,780
The Yu Seongbin I know wouldn't say

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,050
something without meaning anything by it.

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,550
Tell me.

58
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,620
It's really nothing at all.

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,320
I didn't mean anything by it.

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,790
Seongbin.

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,520
Tell me why you said that.

62
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,800
Seongbin!

63
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,700
Do you know a woman named Grace Lee?

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,200
Grace Lee?

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,410
Your husband, Jeong Byeongguk, is rumored

66
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,710
to be having an affair with her.

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,310
But I don't know if that's true.

68
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,580
And because it's not for sure,

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,650
I thought I had made a mistake by telling you.

70
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,920
And I didn't want to go into the details.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,890
Where did you hear it from?

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,400
Well...

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,860
No, forget it.

74
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,530
I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

75
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,400
I was just worried about you.

76
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't worry. I trust my husband.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,770
He would never cheat on me.

78
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,010
Seongbin.

79
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,340
I'm happy now.

80
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,850
I know, Yeonhui.

81
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,420
Is it okay for me to be happy?

82
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,390
You won't think badly of me, will you?

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,650
Yeonhui.

84
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,220
There are times when I question

85
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,190
whether it's okay for me to be happy.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,530
Do I have a right to be happy?

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,400
No one else may know, but you know why

88
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm thinking this.

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,640
You know about my past.

90
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,310
I know.

91
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,980
But it's great to see you so happy.

92
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm envious, even jealous.

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,720
So don't think such things.

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,890
You deserve to be happy, Baek Yeonhui.

95
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,560
Have confidence.

96
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,130
Forget about Donghyeon.

97
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,400
I've forgotten him.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
I've erased him from my mind.

99
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,710
I can't even remember his face anymore.

100
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,740
Or when his birthday is.

101
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,950
Or even the date we first met.

102
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,850
Or the day of his death.

103
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,490
I didn't mean to forget.

104
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,320
I just forgot naturally.

105
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,160
I had loved him so much, but I started to forget.

106
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,800
I hate myself for being so shameless.

107
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,510
But I'm so scared and concerned that

108
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,610
people might find out about my past.

109
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm a really terrible person, Seongbin.

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,750
Really terrible...

111
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,360
Is it okay for me to go on like this?

112
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,430
Yes.

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,170
You're doing well.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,230
Why isn't she picking up?

115
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,530
<i>The person you are trying to reach is not...</i>

116
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,480
Honey.

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,380
Why are you home so late?

118
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,250
I told you I'd be coming home late.

119
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,820
I had an appointment. Is Jinwu in bed?

120
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,690
All you care about is Jinwu. What about me?

121
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,360
Shh! You'll wake up the family.

122
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,240
I went to your shop to treat you to dinner.

123
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,810
What is that on your chest?

124
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,180
Is it a diamond?

125
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,580
Diamond?

126
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,080
It was a gift.

127
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,850
A gift? From whom?

128
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,250
A friend.

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,160
Are you talking about Mr. Yu

130
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,660
who works at your father's firm?

131
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,470
You're lucky to get a gift from a guy.

132
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,930
Yes, I'm lucky.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,400
Stop meeting with him.

134
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,310
Now that you're married, stop seeing him.

135
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,080
But Seongbin and I go way back.

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
Whatever!

137
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,830
Hello?

138
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,100
It's me.

139
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,340
Why couldn't I reach you?

140
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,310
<i>Why? Did you miss me?</i>

141
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,580
<i>Tell me that you missed me.</i>

142
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,980
<i>Then I'll go see you right away.</i>

143
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,250
Oh, really?

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,490
It's a little late.

145
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,790
See you tomorrow.

146
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,930
Jinwu, say "Ah".

147
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,770
No, I want my mom to feed me.

148
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,770
Okay, Jinwu. Here you go.

149
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,640
You should eat well to grow up strong.

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,940
That's good.

151
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,050
Why did you get home so late last night?

152
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm sorry, mother. I had an appointment.

153
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,650
You're a mother.

154
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,620
You should've come home early.

155
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,620
Come on, mom.

156
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,060
You didn't say anything

157
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,330
when Byeongguk stayed out all night.

158
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,860
Be quiet.

159
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,530
Men and women are different.

160
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,780
Yeonhui works, too.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,540
What are you saying?

162
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,370
This is sexual discrimination.

163
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,800
If I report it to the labor ministry,

164
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,970
you'd be in big trouble.

165
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,940
Jeong Yumi, stop it.

166
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,610
If you keep that up...

167
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,110
Byeongguk.

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,420
How is the deal With Lasar going?

169
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,320
Grace Lee still hasn't made a decision?

170
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,090
We'll sign the contract soon.

171
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,990
It's taking longer than I thought.

172
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,830
Who is Grace Lee?

173
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,830
Huh?

174
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,130
The Lasar assistant manager from the States.

175
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,670
You should take more interest

176
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,070
in your husband's work.

177
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,940
Do you know how important she is right now?

178
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,980
This is really delicious.

179
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,010
You should try some. It's so tasty.

180
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,920
They should sign the contract already.

181
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,750
Why are they stalling?

182
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm so nervous.

183
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,360
Byeongguk?

184
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,730
What happened to the deal with Lasar?

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,630
You said it'd go well.

186
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,960
It will go well.

187
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,430
So why is it taking so long?

188
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm going mad.

189
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,500
It'll be over soon.

190
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,310
It'll go well.

191
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:59,150
<i>It'll go well</i>

192
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Do you know Grace Lee?</i>

193
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,090
<i>Byeongguk.</i>

194
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,030
<i>How is the deal with Lasar going?</i>

195
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,800
<i>Grace Lee still hasn't made a decision?</i>

196
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,070
Grace Lee?

197
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,680
Honey, who is Grace Lee?

198
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,610
Can you tell me more about her?

199
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,750
Huh? Why?

200
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,050
Mother said that

201
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,680
I should take more interest in your work.

202
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,990
And I'm curious, too.

203
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,760
She is Lasar's assistant manager.

204
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,630
How old is she? Is she Korean?

205
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,300
Does she come to the office often?

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Why are you interrogating me?

207
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,800
It doesn't really concern you.

208
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,910
Honey?

209
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,150
Do you have any spicy soup?

210
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,520
My stomach hurts and my mouth feels dry.

211
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,350
That's why I've made some bean sprout soup.

212
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,920
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

213
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
Where is Junhui?

214
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,790
She’s sick. She can't go to work today.

215
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,930
How is she sick?

216
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,370
She's been sick with a cold since last night.

217
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,430
Really?

218
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,650
It's me. Can I come in?

219
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,720
Come in.

220
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,130
What's wrong? You're not well?

221
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,300
It's not a big deal.

222
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,970
You don't have a fever.

223
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,630
I'm fine.

224
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,100
But I don't think I can go to work.

225
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,070
If you're sick, you should take the day off.

226
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
Call me later.

227
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,910
Dad?

228
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,580
Do you think I should go overseas to study?

229
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,320
Why would you say that out of the blue?

230
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,760
Why?

231
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,330
Because Yunmi studied overseas,
do you think you're falling behind?

232
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,190
You studied overseas, too.

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
That was then.

234
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,400
You're talented.

235
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,070
I'm not saying this as your dad

236
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,240
but as the owner of a company.

237
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,840
You're doing very well, so cheer up.

238
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,790
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

239
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,090
Oh, Junhui?

240
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,420
Hi, Yeonhui.

241
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,790
Yeongeun, can you get us some coffee?

242
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,860
Okay.

243
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,800
What's up? You didn't go to work?

244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
No, I wanted to see you first.

245
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,200
You should've told me in advance.

246
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,370
I would've come to work earlier.

247
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,840
I just got here.

248
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,670
Enjoy your coffee.

249
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,650
But what are you doing here so early?

250
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,750
Yeonhui.

251
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,580
What is the nature of

252
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,190
your relationship with Yu Seongbin?

253
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,060
What do you mean by that?

254
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,460
I saw you yesterday when you came

255
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,930
to our workplace, driving off with him.

256
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,670
Seongbin and I had a dinner appointment.

257
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,200
Without a single apology,

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
he cancelled our dinner to go with you.

259
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,740
Do you know how upset I was?

260
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,640
Junhui, that's because...

261
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,250
I know that Seongbin had liked you

262
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,480
for a long time.

263
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,050
And I was relieved it wasn't so anymore.

264
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,150
But now I discover that it was you,

265
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,590
not Seongbin, who is to blame.

266
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,890
Why did you pick Seongbin up from work?

267
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,630
Why did you do that?

268
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,860
Do you like Seongbin?

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,430
Do you love him?

270
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,330
Have you forgotten that

271
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,830
you're a married woman?

272
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,240
Junhui, how can you say that?

273
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,940
I've been keeping quiet because of my pride

274
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,110
but I like Seongbin.

275
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,550
No, I love him.

276
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,780
That's why I want to marry him.

277
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,320
So from now on, try not to come between us.

278
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,590
That's what I came to tell you.

279
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Junhui!

280
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,260
Junhui!

281
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,130
Junhui, hear me out, will you?

282
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,330
How can you leave like this?

283
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,200
Seongbin and I

284
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,700
have been friends since college.

285
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,740
But you know this already.

286
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,770
There's nothing going on between us.

287
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,140
How can you take it that way?

288
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,750
Is that what you think of me?

289
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,750
Don't come between the two of you?

290
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,880
Are you saying that I'm having an affair

291
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,050
when I have my husband and Jinwu?

292
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,290
But Seongbin only cares about you.

294
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,360
He just feels sorry for me.

295
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,900
Because I've always been such a fool.

296
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,100
You say the same thing.

297
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
You call me foolish and clumsy.

298
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,410
When did I say that?

299
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,880
Never mind. Give me my coffee.

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,780
I might as well finish it, as long as I'm here.

301
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,420
I want you to pay for it.

302
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
I can't offer it for free all the time.

303
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
I don't make a lot of money.

304
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,730
A professional dry cleaning

305
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,260
service washed them.

306
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,600
But there still were stains on the napkins?

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,130
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,270
That's why I adamantly filed a complaint.

309
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,070
This won't do.

310
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,540
Let's look for another dry cleaning service.

311
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,350
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,910
And Chef Bae?

313
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,020
I know what you're going to say.

314
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm glad to hear that.

315
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,950
Don't forget to wear your chef bandana.

316
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,820
It's right here.

317
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,850
And cut your hair short.

318
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,720
I already had it trimmed.

319
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,540
A bit shorter.

320
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
I can't cut it any shorter.

321
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,630
Why not? You can trim it a bit shorter.

322
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,470
Are you telling me to shave it bald?

323
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,870
I'm not saying that.

324
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,480
Fine, that would be even better.

325
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,440
Are you telling me to become a monk?

326
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,910
What?

327
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,880
Why would I cut my hair like a monk?

328
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,050
Are you playing with me here?

329
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,960
You want to play around? Fine then.

330
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,860
What? Gosh!

331
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,790
My goodness!

332
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,370
Why did you do that?

333
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,630
What?

334
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,170
Cheese!

335
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,540
Whiskey!

336
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,010
Chansik.

337
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,410
No, I mean Chef Michael.

338
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,280
What's wrong with you today?

339
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,850
Ms. Jeong is in a bad mood.

340
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm in a worse mood.

341
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,090
Worse, worse, worse!

342
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,630
What?

343
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,900
What's wrong with the two of them?

344
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,000
I just can't believe him.

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Unbelievable!

346
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,140
He must be crazy. Crazy!

347
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,240
I have an awful headache.

348
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,510
Come in.

349
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
This is Dutch coffee.

350
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,060
What is this for?

351
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,500
I didn't ask for any coffee.

352
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
For 24 hours,

353
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,270
vapors formed drop by drop to create it.

354
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,440
So?

355
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,600
I know you're in a bad mood right now.

356
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
A very bad mood.

357
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,080
No, you're feeling worse than that.

358
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,880
So I hope the coffee will comfort you.

359
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,720
Ms. Lee, what's wrong with you?

360
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,950
Are you playing with me?

361
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,890
What's wrong with everyone today?

362
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,150
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,360
Wait.

364
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
Did you get in touch with Lee Hwayeong?

365
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,430
No, not yet.

366
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,900
Okay, you may leave.

367
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,830
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,940
Gosh.

369
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,140
If she finishes up the contract and leaves

370
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,110
for New York, all would be well.

371
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,380
I'm in a bad enough mood to begin with!

372
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,410
Why is that chef making me even more upset?

373
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,820
Geez!

374
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,160
Ms. Baek, are you okay?

375
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,070
Yes, I'm fine.

376
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,030
I'll clean it up.

377
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,470
- Yeongeun?
- Yes?

378
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,170
Do you know Grace Lee?

379
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,210
Have you heard of her?

380
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,380
Grace Lee? I do know her.

381
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,850
You do?

382
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,720
How do you know her?

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,220
She's a regular customer here.

384
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,550
And you two are really close.

385
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,620
We're close?

386
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,420
Who is it?

387
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,130
The person from America.

388
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
Hwayeong?

389
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Hwayeong is Grace Lee?

390
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,730
Yes, it's her American name.

391
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,310
Are you sure about this?

392
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,740
I'm pretty sure.

393
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,650
<i>Do you know a woman named Grace Lee?</i>

394
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,580
<i>Your husband, Jeong Byeongguk,</i>

395
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>is rumored to be having an affair with her.</i>

396
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,450
Oh.

397
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,690
How do you do?

398
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,130
Hello.

399
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,060
I didn't know I'd run into

400
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,930
your husband like this.

401
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,930
He's so handsome.

402
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,470
You should be on guard always.

403
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,470
Why?

404
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,200
What if someone were to

405
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,770
take him away from you?

406
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,640
Even I want to steal him away.

407
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,610
Ms. Baek!

408
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,950
I think she put in a good word

409
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,990
about us to Lasar's main office.

410
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,320
They're nearly done looking over it.

411
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,190
Only the final decision is left.

412
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,620
That's a relief.

413
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,830
We've been working on this for seven years.

414
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,300
Mr. Jeong, the madam is here to see you.

415
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,640
Who are you talking about?

416
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,070
Your wife is here.

417
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,670
My wife?

418
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,640
Honey?

419
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,050
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

420
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,280
What are you doing here?

421
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,220
I have something to ask you.

422
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,120
I'll leave you two to talk.

423
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,190
You said you wouldn't come here.

424
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,560
With the coffee shop close by,

425
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,660
it won't do us any good if you're

426
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,200
always paying me a visit.

427
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,070
So Grace Lee is Lee Hwayeong?

428
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,870
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,040
Huh?

430
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,680
Oh, I didn't?

431
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,510
I didn't think I had to.

432
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,210
We even had dinner together.

433
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,050
Why didn't you say anything then?

434
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,820
That's because...

435
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,220
Wait. Did you come all the way

436
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,990
here to ask me that?

437
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,390
It's not such a big deal.

438
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,730
Honey.

439
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,630
What?

440
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,300
<i>Mr. Kwon from Arabesque is on the phone.</i>

441
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,600
Put him through.

442
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,840
Hello, Mr. Kwon. This is Byeongguk.

443
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,510
Yes.

444
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,260
<i>The person you are trying to reach is not...</i>

445
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,940
My boyfriend gave it to me.

446
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,710
Oh, hello! How are you?

447
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,110
Hello.

448
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,950
I guess you're here to meet your husband.

449
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,080
Bye now!

450
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,360
She doesn't look so well.

451
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,930
Maybe she found out about the affair.

452
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,860
Watch what you say!

453
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,770
You don't know the truth.

454
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,270
You should look after your daughter.

455
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,800
Your daughter will end up in hell that way.

456
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,770
What?

457
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,370
Did you see my daughter having an affair?

458
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,940
Do you have any evidence?

459
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,550
How dare you wag your finger

460
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,110
at me in such a vulgar way?

461
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,310
Vulgar way?

462
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
Your name sounds very vulgar.

463
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,520
So I can be vulgar to you.

464
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,450
You're the one that's vulgar.

465
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,790
Do you know that?

466
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,060
I give her an inch and she takes a mile.

467
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,160
Who do you think you are?

468
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,530
Hey, newbie. Bae Chuja!

469
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,110
Good shot!

470
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,370
Let's take a break.

471
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,180
Does your wife play golf, too?

472
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,920
No.

473
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,690
I told her to learn but she's good at such things.

474
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,020
All she cares about is our son.

475
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,160
She's always either at work or home.

476
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,700
Wait, my wife came to my office earlier.

477
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,640
Why?

478
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,370
She asked me why I didn't

479
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,140
tell her you were Grace Lee.

480
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,410
I had forgotten all about it.

481
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,240
So I was very surprised to hear her say it.

482
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,080
I came up with an excuse.

483
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,520
She such an innocent and good woman

484
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,120
that I'm sure she'll just let it go.

485
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,260
Innocent and good?

486
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,560
Do you really think so?

487
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,860
The way I see it,

488
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,660
she's got you wrapped around her finger.

489
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,670
Lee Hwayeong.

490
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Don't say that about my wife.

491
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,870
You don't know her.

492
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,890
Oh, man!

493
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,990
What's wrong with this club?

494
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,960
That fool. That stupid loser.

495
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,970
You've been fooled by Baek Yeonhui.

496
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,070
Mom.

497
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,410
Mom, will you do this for me?

498
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,840
Do it yourself.

499
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,280
Mom!

500
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,680
Do it yourself.

501
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,350
Mom, mom.

502
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,620
Jeong Jinwu, what s wrong with you?

503
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,520
Why are you whining?

504
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,050
Didn't I tell you not to act like this?

505
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,690
Jinwu, come here.

506
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,260
I'll give you something yummy to eat.

507
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,990
What's wrong?

508
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,330
Grandma!

509
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,370
Who yelled at my dear grandson?

510
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,870
Who gave you the right to scold him?

511
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,870
Mother.

512
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,040
Jinwu keeps whining

513
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,810
even over things he can do alone.

514
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't say that.

515
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,410
He rarely gets a hug from you.

516
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,450
So what if he whines a little?

517
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,980
How can you be so cold?
You're his mother!

518
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,420
Did you forget what we went through

519
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,520
to have him?

520
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,630
But mother, I should scold him if he deserves it.

521
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,690
I'm afraid he'll end up being spoiled.

522
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,030
Don't worry.

523
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,200
Why worry about that already?

524
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,570
You're such a worrywart.

525
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm home.

526
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,370
Mom, I'm home.

527
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,340
Dad!

528
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,940
Come here, my boy!

529
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,650
Jinwu, what about me?

530
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,650
Say, "Auntie! Welcome home!"

531
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,150
- No.
- Hey!

532
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,560
Did you have a good day today, Jinwu?

533
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,220
How come you're coming home together?

534
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,430
Did you plan on coming home together?

535
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,590
Not at all.

536
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,830
Usually, it's hard to see each other at home.

537
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,270
But we met at the door by chance today.

538
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,800
Did you have dinner?

539
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,540
- Yes.
- Not me.

540
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,570
I'm sorry but can you fix me something?

541
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,010
I'll wash up.

542
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,010
Jinwu, you can come hang out with me.

543
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,210
Let's go.

544
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,210
Jinsuk.

545
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,350
Doesn't Byeongguk look worn out these days?

546
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,620
It's because of that Grace Lee woman.

547
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,960
She's done that to my precious son.

548
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,030
I hope that the deal is finalized soon.

549
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,600
Yeonhui, your mother hasn't been
getting us Oriental medicine lately.

550
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,430
In the past,

551
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,640
she used to bring us some every month.

552
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,510
But after Jinwu was born, that ended.

553
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,640
I'll ask my mother about it.

554
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,380
It's not because I don't want
to buy it myself.

555
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,850
Mothers-in-law are supposed

556
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,420
to be like mothers, too.

557
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,850
Get your husband some tea

558
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,160
so he can unwind a bit.

559
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,920
Okay.

560
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,930
Why is she so down?

561
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,660
What's wrong with her?

562
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,370
Come on.

563
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay, okay.

564
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,270
How many times must I tell you

565
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,410
that people like Yeonhui are hard to come by.

566
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,940
She never complains.

567
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,480
Nor does she say she wants to move out.

568
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,450
She grew up like a princess

569
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,050
but she doesn't ask us to treat her like one.

570
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,720
Fine.

571
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,420
Her looks, family and educational background.

572
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,290
They can't be beat.

573
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,030
I said I get it. You can stop now.

574
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,300
But you know what?

575
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,670
There's nothing I lack either.

576
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,600
So why can't I get married?

577
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,690
I'm really tired.

578
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,220
Did you come home early?

579
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,360
Yes.

580
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,190
Come to think of it.

581
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,930
I think I was too hard on you earlier

582
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,130
when you came to see me at my office.

583
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,970
You may be an owner of a coffee shop

584
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,570
but I should've offered you a drink.

585
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,480
It's okay. I'll do it.

586
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,050
Oh, my little Jinwu.

587
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,280
Let's go.

588
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,670
<i>Grace Lee</i>

589
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
What are you doing?

590
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,850
What are you doing with my phone?

591
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,620
It was ringing.

592
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,750
You've been acting strange lately.

593
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,950
You never used to act like this before.

594
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,860
It's not that.

595
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,420
It's Grace Lee.

596
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Why is she calling me at this hour?

597
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,760
Why didn't you tell me

598
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,570
that you knew Grace Lee?

599
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,770
That again? How is that important?

600
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,870
It's strange.

601
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,040
What? What's strange?

602
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,010
It wasn't important.

603
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,280
It's true.

604
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
You have your own work.

605
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,480
In the same way,

606
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,150
I have my work with Grace Lee.

607
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,390
If I told you about our business relationship,

608
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,220
would you have been able to befriend her?

609
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,160
It'd be awkward for all of us.

610
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,190
I was only trying to be considerate.

611
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,460
So why are suspecting me like this?

612
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,000
Are you really suspicious of me?

613
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,270
Is that it?

614
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,610
You don't trust me?

615
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,470
No, I don't trust you.

616
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,610
Honey.

617
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,440
Hwayeong and I have been close.

618
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,650
But the two of you acted as if you

619
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,580
met for the first time. Does that make sense?

620
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,880
And if it doesn't?

621
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,250
Are you saying I'm having an affair

622
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,720
behind your back or something?

623
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,360
That really doesn't make sense.

624
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,260
I thought you were pure and good.

625
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,500
Why are you acting like this?

626
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,960
You don't trust me?

627
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,000
What did I do wrong?

628
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,330
This is so funny.

629
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,990
Wait.

630
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,140
Turn that down.

631
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,510
Why?

632
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,930
Don't make me out to be the bad guy.

633
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,420
Why are you treating me like a fool?

634
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,850
What's going on?

635
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,770
What are you two doing?

636
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,280
See you next time...
