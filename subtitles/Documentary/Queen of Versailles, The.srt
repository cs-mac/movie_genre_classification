1
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,719
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,089
I'm here.

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:13,889
What is that?

4
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,613
You'll shock them. This is enough.

5
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:17,943
Didn't you bring your gun?

6
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:18,943
Kids these days are fearless, you know.

7
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:19,943
Where's our reinforcement?

8
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,513
What reinforcement?

9
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:22,673
We can get them between the two of us.

10
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:23,843
Didn't you ask for a reinforcement?

11
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:26,673
- Are you kidding me? - Why would I kid you now?

12
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:28,673
- Didn't you do it? - You said you did it.

13
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,173
What I meant was that you should do it.

14
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:32,443
- Darn it. - Give them a call now.

15
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:33,643
- Hello? - You surprised me.

16
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:35,543
We need a reinforcement right now.

17
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,613
- Oh, my. - Stay alert.

18
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,113
- I'll fire. - Darn it.

19
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:43,313
Give me a moment.

20
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:45,073
Everyone, be careful.

21
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:46,413
The first shot is a blank shell...

22
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,043
and the next one is real.

23
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,373
Right?

24
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:51,673
But what are you going to do?

25
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,173
We have over five guys.

26
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,673
That means at least five of you will die.

27
00:00:57,873 --> 00:01:01,713
No. We're allowed to fire only four shots.

28
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,373
- Four shots? - Yes.

29
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,973
- It's up to me. Darn you. - Fine.

30
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:07,373
Hey, it's apparently four shots.

31
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,213
The four of you will die.

32
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,473
- My goodness. Hold this. - Okay.

33
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,613
How dare you tell me to come and go?

34
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,143
- Bring it on. - Jang Do Jang!

35
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,843
Where are you? I'm here.

36
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,773
Come out quickly wherever you are.

37
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,413
You are all dead.

38
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,843
Hey, it's raining.

39
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,043
Let's put an end to this and go home.

40
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,973
You jerk!

41
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,843
Darn it. There are a lot of them.

42
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,613
Where are you? Come out.

43
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:48,643
What are you looking at?

44
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,413
Help.

45
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,943
- Hold out. - I can't hold out anymore.

46
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,113
Wait, wait.

47
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,073
Move.

48
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,943
Hey, take this!

49
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:29,643
Darn it.

50
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:50,913
Take this.

51
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,273
Jang Do Jang.

52
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:35,773
You...

53
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:40,843
You jerk.

54
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:01,413
(Queen of Mystery)

55
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:05,613
(A complete victory for the experienced detective)

56
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,573
It must be a thief.

57
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,743
Things keep disappearing.

58
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,813
Check it again.

59
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,313
We're busy, you know.

60
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:17,283
My calculations aren't wrong.

61
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,573
Then it must've been your employee.

62
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,913
I called you to catch the culprit.

63
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,013
There's no evidence.

64
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,413
How can I catch the culprit...

65
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,013
when there's no evidence?

66
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,913
Did you find something?

67
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,073
Someone who's stealing something...

68
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,143
or anything suspicious.

69
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:33,283
Not yet.

70
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:37,113
Take your time then.

71
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:39,973
I'll go make a round.

72
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,873
What?

73
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,873
This is my first day of work here.

74
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:48,973
The first experience is important.

75
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:50,813
This is a great chance.

76
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,143
Good luck.

77
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:54,943
Well, sir...

78
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,943
How can you leave it up to this newbie?

79
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,343
Do you think it disappeared in the storage?

80
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:14,573
Only I...

81
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,213
have the access.

82
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:21,673
That means it disappeared in the store.

83
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:24,043
I'm telling you a thief stole it.

84
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,143
Then why isn't there a footage of someone stealing it?

85
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,213
There are so many surveillance cameras in the store.

86
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,513
You should find out who did it, Constable.

87
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:35,443
I'm not a constable, I'm a lieutenant.

88
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,673
I'm a head of a police station.

89
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:37,673
Goodness.

90
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:40,543
You're the new head?

91
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,773
I thought he was.

92
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,313
You look so young though.

93
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,513
You don't even look 30.

94
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,313
I'm not.

95
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:57,613
Stop.

96
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:00,713
Who are you?

97
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,713
This employee is strange.

98
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:03,413
Who? Which one?

99
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:07,713
This guy? He's my son.

100
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:10,143
He looks after the store when I'm not here.

101
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,813
He is very nervous.

102
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:15,143
Look. His body is tense.

103
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,273
Maybe he's tired?

104
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:19,073
He isn't like that other times.

105
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,673
So what?

106
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,513
My son is a bit timid.

107
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:27,073
Whenever this boy shows up, he gets tense.

108
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,773
He's shaking his hands a bit too.

109
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:36,243
Let's see.

110
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,913
She's right. He's like that on other days too.

111
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,943
But he doesn't look like he's stealing?

112
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,873
Just pay for your stuff.

113
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,843
Don't bother him trying to catch a thief.

114
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:58,873
That boy only uses his card to pay.

115
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:02,873
You're right.

116
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,213
Who pays with cash nowadays?

117
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,613
Everyone uses a card.

118
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,373
Really? Then...

119
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:11,073
I'll use my card too.

120
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:15,313
You can't pay with your library card!

121
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:16,873
Seodong District Library?

122
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,973
It's like this one, right?

123
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,743
(Seodong District Library)

124
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:24,573
- Yes. - I could tell right away...

125
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,413
because I go to the library often.

126
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,513
He used his library card to pay?

127
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,673
Nobody stole anything.

128
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,243
Your son just gave things away.

129
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,843
He knew he was being recorded,

130
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,643
so he pretended to pay with the card.

131
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:40,813
He came here only when your son was working because...

132
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:42,013
I'm home.

133
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:46,573
It's the same uniform as the boy was wearing.

134
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:49,713
Why you little... Come over here.

135
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,573
Darn you!

136
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,143
- Come over here! - Stop.

137
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,673
Was it you who did it?

138
00:07:56,673 --> 00:07:59,343
Why did you do it? I give you allowance.

139
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:02,213
- Why? - Please! Stop!

140
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,773
Well...

141
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,573
I don't know. I'm frustrated too!

142
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,643
You're missing a button.

143
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,773
One of them is a different color.

144
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,943
Your shoes look big on your feet.

145
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,343
That's why you tie the shoelaces tight.

146
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,213
Where are your shoes?

147
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:26,573
I think you should talk to his teacher.

148
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:29,713
Maybe someone is bullying your son.

149
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:36,213
I didn't know because I was too busy working.

150
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,573
We have a school violence prevention team,

151
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:40,813
so don't worry.

152
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,573
Sir. Please help.

153
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,513
Will you give me a discount?

154
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,143
(Queen of Mystery)

155
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:58,043
(Seol Ok, the Queen of Mystery)

156
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,743
Mother. Breakfast is ready.

157
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,073
Okay.

158
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,343
Where's Ho Cheol?

159
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:08,813
He has a lot of work, so he can't come home.

160
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,513
Poor Prosecutor.

161
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,883
I hope he doesn't skip his breakfast.

162
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:18,973
I'm leaving.

163
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:20,473
Won't you have breakfast?

164
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,713
She doesn't eat breakfast?

165
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,073
Since when?

166
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,443
Since high school.

167
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,513
Bye, Seol Ok.

168
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:29,573
See you.

169
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,243
She's missing out.

170
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,743
It's too salty.

171
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:58,313
How will you open a store with this cooking skill?

172
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,443
I tried. Is it bad?

173
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,143
Won't you eat more?

174
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,213
No. I'm late.

175
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,913
Where are you going?

176
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,443
Do you think I'm an old lady who stays at home?

177
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,243
I have a seminar.

178
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:18,273
Have a good day.

179
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,843
Are you going somewhere today?

180
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,243
I'll go to the side dish store.

181
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,243
Okay.

182
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:42,313
Don't chitchat with classless women.

183
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,313
You'll embarrass your husband if you do.

184
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:47,883
Yes, Mother. Enjoy your seminar.

185
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,113
Okay.

186
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:58,413
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

187
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,873
You all owe me one.

188
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,913
- Goodness. - I win.

189
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:02,973
Got it.

190
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:04,613
How's your daughter-in-law?

191
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:06,873
My daughter-in-law?

192
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:10,343
Think about it. She's a young thing.

193
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:11,873
You never know.

194
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,143
They seem to be doing really well.

195
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,573
They go grocery shopping and have tea together.

196
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,843
They don't go grocery shopping together.

197
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,373
I saw her together with a tall man.

198
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,143
A tall man?

199
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,043
He had a nice complexion.

200
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:29,773
Yes, he had great skin.

201
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,243
And he...

202
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:33,413
- smiles with his eyes. - That's right.

203
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,273
He looked young.

204
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:37,243
He looked like a college student from behind.

205
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,913
Isn't it Officer Hong?

206
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,943
(Police Substation)

207
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,273
This is Officer Hong.

208
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,513
You're on your way?

209
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,243
Okay. Where should I meet you?

210
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:55,343
People could see us, so I'll meet you at the locker.

211
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,313
There's a reason.

212
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,273
Yes, Officer Hong. I'll see you soon.

213
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,143
Stop. I win.

214
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:09,043
There.

215
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,473
You lose.

216
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,213
Gosh.

217
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,113
Why would she date a police substation officer?

218
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,643
Her husband is a prosecutor.

219
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,743
Don't you know prosecutors are above police officers?

220
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:24,743
That has nothing to do with cheating.

221
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:27,543
Cheating? Not everyone can cheat.

222
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,573
She has no education, no money.

223
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,273
She doesn't even have a good background.

224
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:35,873
She's lucky to have a prosecutor husband.

225
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,943
Men won't fall for her.

226
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,113
You don't know anything.

227
00:12:58,273 --> 00:12:59,513
(Gyung Mi)

228
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,443
- Hello? - It's me.

229
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,313
If my mother-in-law comes by...

230
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,073
What should I tell her?

231
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:07,713
Make something up.

232
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:11,343
We both have to. Your mother-in-law's too sharp.

233
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,643
Say I went to get ingredients.

234
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:18,013
Why are you going to get ingredients?

235
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,613
I'm seeing Officer Hong again.

236
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,243
Really?

237
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,513
You're enjoying this.

238
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,213
This is too dangerous.

239
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,473
You can't dupe your mother-in-law...

240
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,673
I don't care. I don't care.

241
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,713
I'm so excited.

242
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:41,673
Try and think if there's anything fishy.

243
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:44,113
Don't regret when it's too late.

244
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:48,973
Your daughter-in-law has been going out a lot.

245
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,073
What?

246
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,143
That's because...

247
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:57,573
Does she take calls on the balcony in secret?

248
00:13:57,573 --> 00:13:59,143
That's a sign.

249
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,313
That too.

250
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,743
No problem. They usually go in threes.

251
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,143
She has a friend who owns a lunchbox place.

252
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,143
Business seems to be booming.

253
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:45,273
She goes there every day to learn how to cook.

254
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:48,613
But her cooking never really improves.

255
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:49,613
It's salty.

256
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,843
Seol Ok? It's me.

257
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:06,843
Ask where she is.

258
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:09,673
Would you tell the truth if you were her?

259
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,113
Where are you?

260
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:15,913
The lunchbox place?

261
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,913
Okay. See you later.

262
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,713
She said she's at the lunchbox place.

263
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,113
You can't believe that.

264
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,673
Shall we go over there?

265
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:37,213
Yes, let's. I was getting bored of playing cards.

266
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,473
Let's continue next time.

267
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,073
- Let's go. - Come along.

268
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,613
She said she's at the lunchbox place.

269
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:46,243
- What an idiot. - Let's go and check.

270
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,143
I'll go and check the site.

271
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:52,243
The Bangtan Market locker case?

272
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:54,373
- I'll come with you. - No.

273
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:58,013
You must have a lot to do. Stay here.

274
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:06,343
What is he trying to do?

275
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:08,673
Don't you think he's like Sherlock Holmes?

276
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,243
The missing parcel case and the phone theft case.

277
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,673
Cases that even...

278
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:17,013
- detectives can't... - He just got lucky.

279
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:22,343
Getting on his good side won't earn you a promotion.

280
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:23,813
Don't waste your energy.

281
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,143
Are you going somewhere?

282
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,443
To patrol.

283
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,713
To check the sauna, more like.

284
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,213
Did she go to get groceries?

285
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,913
See? I told you something smelled fishy.

286
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,643
You just wait. I'll check for you.

287
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,013
Is that the police substation?

288
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,073
What are you going to do?

289
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:00,973
Wait and see.

290
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,013
Is Officer Hong in?

291
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:08,243
He's on patrol? Where to?

292
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,243
Bangtan Market?

293
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,113
They must be together.

294
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,643
What are you saying?

295
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,313
Why would Seol Ok be with him?

296
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,713
He went to Bangtan Market. Let's go.

297
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,113
Why would we go there?

298
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,773
To check if they are together.

299
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:26,973
What if they aren't?

300
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,473
Then they aren't together.

301
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,743
- Right. - We can get snacks while we're there.

302
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:35,843
The rice cakes the hunchback granny makes?

303
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,473
They're the real deal.

304
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,843
Aren't they?

305
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:41,773
The lady makes them with herbs she gathered herself.

306
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:45,543
Shall we go mugwort-picking when it's warmer?

307
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,313
It's from the left.

308
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,343
You don't need gloves.

309
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,813
We already checked for prints.

310
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:20,943
Hello.

311
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:23,443
Just in case the case is reopened.

312
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:25,543
The prints are all smudged or overlapping.

313
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:27,213
They won't be helpful.

314
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:30,443
The lockers are in the middle of the market.

315
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:34,443
I keep my bags here when they're heavy.

316
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,243
Do you live nearby?

317
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,443
No.

318
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:45,113
What a lot of effort.

319
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:49,083
I didn't do much. I just...

320
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,213
A waste of effort.

321
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:52,913
What?

322
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,843
I really didn't do anything.

323
00:18:57,243 --> 00:19:00,643
The thief, I mean. He tried too hard.

324
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,043
Do you see something already?

325
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,143
I see a waste of energy and time.

326
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:12,543
A waste?

327
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:15,143
An unfocused and complicated method.

328
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:17,213
He's an amateur.

329
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,213
A professional wouldn't be so obvious.

330
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:26,213
A professional would break into a locker...

331
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:28,773
swiftly and easily.

332
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,613
He'd get a copy of a locker key...

333
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,373
and alter it to make a master key.

334
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:45,043
So he uses the master key to open the other lockers?

335
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,083
Yes.

336
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,973
Then I shouldn't look up people with similar records.

337
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,813
He's a complete novice.

338
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:53,643
He's never broken into a locker before.

339
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,943
At first, he thought it would be easy.

340
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:02,413
He put something sharp and pointed into the keyhole.

341
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,083
When it didn't open,

342
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,343
he used something else.

343
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,313
Something like a crowbar.

344
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,313
He forced it open with brute strength.

345
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,843
He must be strong...

346
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,083
if he warped the steel door.

347
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:28,243
He got better as he went along.

348
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:31,343
He opened the rest with much less effort.

349
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,413
Your right. The last locker just popped open.

350
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,973
He got better at it as he went from left to right.

351
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:47,273
So the criminal...

352
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:49,043
He opened them in order.

353
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:52,643
Why do you think he stopped halfway?

354
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:56,113
Who guards these lockers?

355
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,543
The market stalls, lockers,

356
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,273
and office are guarded by two security guards.

357
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,413
They go on patrol at 7pm after the market closes.

358
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,443
By the time they circle the whole market,

359
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,213
it's about an hour later.

360
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:13,313
Then the guards on patrol startled him.

361
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,443
They appeared before he was done.

362
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,143
Then it all makes sense.

363
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:22,143
The guard noticed nothing strange at midnight.

364
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:25,973
He found the lockers like this at 1am.

365
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:30,143
The criminal couldn't finish it in an hour.

366
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,643
What happened?

367
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,743
What did the criminal take?

368
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,473
That's the odd part.

369
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,113
He didn't touch the cash.

370
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,913
He left the money?

371
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,613
After all that hard work?

372
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,743
Yes. He left a laptop, MP3 player,

373
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,643
and a luxury brand wallet.

374
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,643
Is nothing missing at all?

375
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:03,143
No. Some ingredients for memorial service food,

376
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:06,013
powdered formula, and a ginseng gift set was stolen.

377
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,873
Why would anyone steal that?

378
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:13,013
That's what I don't get.

379
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,513
What could it be for?

380
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,273
I think the thief is...

381
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:22,143
Is?

382
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,313
Someone who, despite being poor,

383
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,643
never ever considered stealing...

384
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,643
because he's a decent person.

385
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,613
His father's death anniversary's coming up,

386
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:33,013
but the son had no money.

387
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:36,073
That's when he came across these lockers.

388
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,513
Do people use baby formulas for a memorial service?

389
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:41,373
Well...

390
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,143
This little boy...

391
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:46,973
had an older brother...

392
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,313
who got hurt while working at a construction site.

393
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:51,443
That is why he had to raise his baby niece or nephew.

394
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:52,843
The baby formula was for them.

395
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:54,413
What about the ginseng gift set?

396
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,673
He must've been living with his mother.

397
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:03,813
An unemployed young man who works to provide...

398
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,143
for his young nephew and mother...

399
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:09,013
would be in need of cash, not these.

400
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:12,613
You're right. You can buy these with money.

401
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:13,943
Why did he steal them?

402
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,073
This is definitely an amateur.

403
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:24,073
Don't you think some kids trashed this?

404
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,573
They didn't need it. They just did it for fun.

405
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,073
It's like stealing for fun.

406
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,343
No. Kids couldn't have done this.

407
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:34,573
This person isn't a professional,

408
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,713
but this person controlled...

409
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:39,373
the scene too well to be an amateur.

410
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,013
Then...

411
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:44,113
It's definitely an adult.

412
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:45,413
An adult?

413
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:47,843
A very...

414
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,843
dangerous adult.

415
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:55,713
- Let's take a break. - Yes.

416
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:57,373
Just once more.

417
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:58,643
I can't do it.

418
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,743
- My legs hurt. - Let's sit.

419
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,513
You can't sit anywhere on the streets.

420
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,913
- My gosh. - My legs hurt.

421
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:08,143
Goodness, my legs are giving out.

422
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,943
Hey, did you hear that?

423
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:13,973
Someone robbed the lockers.

424
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:15,573
A thief?

425
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:16,973
That's scary.

426
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:19,543
Let's carry our stuff around no matter how heavy it is.

427
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,743
Look at those two men...

428
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:26,343
with rough faces. Who are they?

429
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:30,113
They look like troublemakers.

430
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:33,113
- Are they thugs? - Quiet.

431
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,343
Could they be the thieves?

432
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,913
They would've run away already. They won't be here.

433
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:45,643
She's right.

434
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:51,013
Goodness, my beautiful face. Darn it.

435
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:54,913
Here's your coffee.

436
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,143
- Hey. - Yes?

437
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,843
My stitches ruptured.

438
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,413
I think it's infected.

439
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:01,113
- Give me the ointment. - The ointment?

440
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,443
That man.

441
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:07,213
This guy.

442
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,573
I can't see his face.

443
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,343
I have another one here.

444
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:18,373
Right here and here.

445
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:23,073
You're right. These are the same person.

446
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:26,073
He doesn't look like a type who shops for groceries.

447
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,013
Let's see.

448
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,043
Is this a thug?

449
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,273
He has a lot of scars on his face.

450
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:39,673
He's probably the action head.

451
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:42,413
Bosses these days don't do anything that harms them.

452
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:45,573
He does seem suspicious, lurking around the area.

453
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,813
Do you think he's our man?

454
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,873
You can take him in and interrogate him.

455
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:52,643
That'll be hard to do.

456
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:53,873
Why?

457
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,443
The office wants me to wrap this up.

458
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:59,613
It's not like this is a huge criminal case.

459
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,873
Such petty robbery won't bump up our performance.

460
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,773
It's not a petty robbery.

461
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,373
Did you find something?

462
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:11,543
This is...

463
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:13,573
Yes, this is?

464
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,243
a drug case.

465
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:21,143
What?

466
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:26,813
Let's go.

467
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,013
Wasn't it hot?

468
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,443
It's cool.

469
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,273
It's cool? That was hot.

470
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,543
Let's go.

471
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:44,513
So weird.

472
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,373
My back hurts.

473
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:53,843
That's odd. They said he went to the market.

474
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,343
Was it Bangtan Market? Isn't it Baebang Market?

475
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:01,513
I'm sure they said he went to a market, but...

476
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,113
Isn't this a police car?

477
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,543
It is.

478
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,873
- We found the right place. - We did.

479
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:11,873
We don't have to walk anymore.

480
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:13,843
We can wait in front of this car.

481
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,913
Oh, right.

482
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,113
I forgot to buy some rice cakes at the market.

483
00:27:19,113 --> 00:27:21,373
- Let's go and get them. - Okay.

484
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,213
What if Officer Hong gets here before you return?

485
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:29,143
In that case, you can wait here.

486
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:30,813
I'll go and get them.

487
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:33,273
We have to have rice cakes when we're here.

488
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:34,813
- You're right. - I'll be back.

489
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,943
- Take some money. - I've got some.

490
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:39,373
- Okay then. - Let's sit here.

491
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,243
My goodness.

492
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:45,873
It was a hard day.

493
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,313
They robbed the locker from the left to the right...

494
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:53,113
and from the top to the bottom strategically.

495
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,773
Will kids plan this out for fun?

496
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:57,073
So diligently?

497
00:28:01,573 --> 00:28:04,443
But none of the things missing are worth any money.

498
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:11,313
What he robbed are food ingredients for a ritual.

499
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:12,773
What did he take?

500
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:13,843
Give me a second.

501
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:19,273
He took frying powder to make pancakes,

502
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,413
starch, and flour.

503
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:26,573
What will kids do with those?

504
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,743
Teenagers are already full of energy.

505
00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:33,143
Why would they want ginseng gift set so much?

506
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,913
He's an amateur when it comes to theft...

507
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,773
and he doesn't care about things or money.

508
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:46,743
If it's not about money or a prank,

509
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,513
why did he rob the lockers?

510
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:50,143
He was looking for something.

511
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,043
Looking for something?

512
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:56,473
Something so precious that's worth more than money.

513
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:58,313
Something so big.

514
00:28:58,713 --> 00:28:59,943
Something so big?

515
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:03,873
Officer Hong, this is a drug case.

516
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:07,443
This is not an adult entertainment district.

517
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,243
Why would anyone put drugs in a market?

518
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,943
This is a delivery failure.

519
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:13,413
It's got something to do with drug trafficking.

520
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:15,843
Have you waited for long?

521
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:18,113
- Here you are. - Oh, my.

522
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,743
This is warm.

523
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:21,413
Smell it.

524
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,273
This looks good.

525
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:26,643
Ma'am.

526
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:30,143
I thank you for assisting me with my investigation.

527
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:33,413
I fell short of expectation, but I solved the cases...

528
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:35,073
thanks to your help.

529
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:37,343
However,

530
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:40,073
I think you're way off this time.

531
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:42,143
How can it be drug trafficking?

532
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:45,113
The ginseng gift set. Were they all powders?

533
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:47,373
Yes. Ginseng powder.

534
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:50,073
Starch, baby formula, flour.

535
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:52,843
Isn't it weird?

536
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,213
White powder.

537
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,413
Flour.

538
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:07,313
People call drugs crystal or flour.

539
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:11,243
Drugs?

540
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:17,073
The thief was looking for white powder which is...

541
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:19,343
worth 300,000 dollars per 1kg.

542
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:23,843
If it's pure enough, it goes up to 350,000 dollars.

543
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:27,073
Is that why he didn't care about cash?

544
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,943
Why would he care about a couple hundred bucks?

545
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:32,213
But still, how can anyone leave drugs...

546
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,973
that are worth thousands of dollars in a market?

547
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,043
It was a deal.

548
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:44,143
A quiet deal of a huge dealer and a small dealer.

549
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:48,613
It's not too quiet.

550
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,373
But unlike their plan,

551
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,373
there was a delivery accident.

552
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:57,443
They lost the key.

553
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:01,313
And they lost the delivery man as well.

554
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:04,143
They cannot find out where their stuff is.

555
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:05,543
That's why they tore everything down.

556
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:07,313
If this is a real drug case...

557
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:09,413
It's probably connected with gangs.

558
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:12,673
The gang member from the surveillance camera.

559
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,673
(Mother)

560
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:26,143
Yes, Mother.

561
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:30,543
Oh, are you still at the side dish shop?

562
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:34,243
Of course.

563
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:35,913
Is she at the side dish shop?

564
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:38,643
I can't wait anymore. Let's leave.

565
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:40,773
I had too many rice cakes.

566
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,613
- I'm thirsty. - Quiet.

567
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:45,243
I see. That's good.

568
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:48,273
I'll stop by with the ladies on my way home.

569
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:49,773
What?

570
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,413
Goodbye.

571
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:01,813
Gangs and drugs. That makes sense.

572
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:04,213
Right?

573
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,913
Ma'am.

574
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:15,373
It's him.

575
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:37,813
- My goodness, thank you. - Goodness.

576
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,573
Well...

577
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,143
Thanks so much for your hard work.

578
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,873
- Here. Open wide. - Thank you.

579
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,713
Are you here to grocery shop?

580
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:51,943
We're just strolling around.

581
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,873
He's alone.

582
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,143
I told you.

583
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,973
It's nice to see you all being friendly.

584
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,273
Friendly?

585
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:04,373
My legs hurt.

586
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,913
Where are you heading? I'll give you a ride.

587
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,413
No, it's okay.

588
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:08,843
You must be busy.

589
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:10,773
Goodness.

590
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:15,713
What?

591
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,043
No.

592
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:47,513
Clouds float again today

593
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:51,913
On the road to Seonwangdang

594
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,973
Flowers bloom

595
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:48,143
(Dong Ho's Lunchbox)

596
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:49,143
Is this it?

597
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:51,613
Thank you.

598
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,243
Mother, you're here.

599
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:04,313
Are these your friends?

600
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:08,373
Ladies, she's my daughter-in-law's best friend.

601
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,313
She owns this place. Say hi.

602
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:14,543
Hello, I'm Kim Gyung Mi.

603
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:15,983
She's the divorced...

604
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,013
Where's Seol Ok?

605
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:23,273
I didn't see her when I passed by.

606
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:25,613
She's in the kitchen. That's why you didn't see her.

607
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:26,613
Kitchen?

608
00:35:26,613 --> 00:35:28,313
Is there's a kitchen inside?

609
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:29,843
Of course. It's not outside.

610
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:32,673
Mother!

611
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,073
- Mother. - What are you doing?

612
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,513
It's cold out, isn't it?

613
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:38,643
- Gosh, stop it. - You're too cold.

614
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,773
- You should try the new dishes. - Out of my way.

615
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,773
Mother!

616
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,513
- Mother. - Is she here?

617
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:46,773
- Mother. - What are you doing?

618
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:48,843
- I have a headache. - So what?

619
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:51,573
- Get out of my way. - It hurts.

620
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:56,643
Well... She's not here.

621
00:35:58,613 --> 00:35:59,943
Where did she go?

622
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:06,143
Tell me. Where is she?

623
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:15,943
Mother. You're here.

624
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:22,073
Yes. Someone gave me a ride.

625
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,373
What about your friends?

626
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:25,943
They're outside.

627
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,143
Are you leaving?

628
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:31,313
Yes. I just wanted to see you. Bye.

629
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,713
Don't you want to taste the fish?

630
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,483
- It's okay. - It's a huge fish.

631
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:55,073
You fried my fish for sashimi.

632
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,743
My gosh.

633
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:02,213
Take it out!

634
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:10,873
(Dong Ho's Lunchbox)

635
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:22,913
I paid 200 dollars for that sea bream.

636
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:24,713
And you're drinking my liquor.

637
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:26,983
You don't even pour me a glass.

638
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:38,983
What's wrong with your mother-in-law?

639
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,943
She watches you and meddles with you.

640
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:42,543
Why can't she leave you alone?

641
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,743
Because her son's a prosecutor.

642
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,643
How much does he make?

643
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:50,143
Does he make more than I do?

644
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:51,983
Of course not.

645
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,813
I paid for my sister-in-law's graduate school.

646
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:59,143
He wouldn't have become a prosecutor without you.

647
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:03,513
Thanks to him I'm a prosecutor's wife.

648
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,673
Thanks to him you couldn't go to college...

649
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,313
and your mother-in-law looks down on you.

650
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:10,143
Who says she looks down on me?

651
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:13,443
I can tell when I see it.

652
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,073
It's so unfair.

653
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:18,843
Still, don't get a divorce.

654
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,483
Why not? You said I'm pathetic.

655
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,573
Just don't.

656
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,113
Do whatever you can to hang in there.

657
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:30,373
Do you regret getting divorced?

658
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:32,573
Regret?

659
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:36,413
Hey. I'm totally free.

660
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,143
I'm free from the in-laws and my family kicked me out.

661
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,343
I can't be any freer than this.

662
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:45,743
But don't get a divorce.

663
00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:49,213
You'll enjoy the freedom all to yourself?

664
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,913
Are you going home? We just started.

665
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:57,983
- I need to go. - Leave that.

666
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,773
Let me, the lonely soul, take care of herself.

667
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:02,873
By the way, you have a parcel.

668
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,273
Yes!

(Police Officer)

670
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:14,073
I'll start studying tomorrow.

671
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:17,513
Thanks.

672
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,413
I'm sorry Sea Bream.

673
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:26,343
Why do you study when you won't even apply?

674
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:27,813
It makes me relieved.

675
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:29,673
You will when you pass the exam...

676
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,113
and you'll have to apply to pass.

677
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:34,443
You never know. Maybe I can take the exam this year.

678
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:36,143
What if you pass the exam?

679
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:38,843
Do you think he'll say yes?

680
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:43,113
I saw yakbab out here. Can I take it?

681
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:46,673
My mother-in-law really likes it.

682
00:39:48,143 --> 00:39:49,573
She thinks I made it.

683
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:52,013
She says she doesn't like what I do,

684
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:54,873
but she keeps me around because of this yakbab.

685
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,043
Gosh. I can't believe you're on her side.

686
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,143
She pretends to be refined,

687
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:01,313
but she's just a mean old granny.

688
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:10,813
She'd have a fit if I passed the exam.

689
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:14,073
You're afraid you'll pass, aren't you?

690
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,143
This year will be the last one.

691
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,613
Please bear with me.

692
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:20,013
Just go home.

693
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:21,013
Bye.

694
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:22,713
Take the yakbab.

695
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:26,213
I made it for your mother-in-law anyway.

696
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:27,643
I hope you don't get a divorce.

697
00:40:27,643 --> 00:40:28,713
I know.

698
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:32,143
I love you.

699
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,873
Goodness. She's insane.

700
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,043
It was a natural sea bream.

701
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:57,743
- Goodness. - My yakbab.

702
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:59,543
Tteokbokki and fried laver roll. Take out please.

703
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:01,143
- Okay. - Give me some soup first.

704
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:02,143
Okay.

705
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:06,943
- Be careful, it's hot. - Okay.

706
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:33,313
(Baebang 2 Police Substation)

707
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:46,413
What are you doing?

708
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:49,273
Did something happen to him?

709
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,773
He must've fought with his girlfriend.

710
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:56,643
Does he have a girlfriend?

711
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:58,773
I'm sure he does.

712
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:07,713
Hello?

713
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:12,643
At Bangtan Market?

714
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:15,813
Yes.

715
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:19,213
Today?

716
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,043
That locker?

717
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:28,113
Okay. Got it.

718
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,743
Sir. What happened with the locker case?

719
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:36,573
Of course, it should be resolved.

720
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:38,843
Officer Hong solves...

721
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,943
every case he looks at.

722
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:42,943
It's more complicated than I thought.

723
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,943
Such a fuss over a simple theft.

724
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,373
It's not a simple theft.

725
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:53,773
The detectives at the station say...

726
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:57,113
some kids did it, just for fun.

727
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:01,113
They don't need you to come over.

728
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:05,543
This is drug case that's connected to gangs.

729
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:07,643
- Drugs? - Drugs?

730
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:13,073
It's just a figure of speech.

731
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:16,843
Don't take things too seriously, sir.

732
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:20,513
I'm worried for you.

733
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:25,013
Hello?

734
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,143
Hello, ma'am.

735
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:30,543
I'm sorry I disappeared like that.

736
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:32,243
You must've had your reasons.

737
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:34,143
You don't need to explain.

738
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:36,843
Okay. Thank you.

739
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:38,143
So...

740
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:41,073
They're replacing the lockers today.

741
00:43:41,773 --> 00:43:44,143
The merchants complained that it was an eyesore.

742
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:47,243
Today? What about what's inside?

743
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,043
That's a problem.

744
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:51,243
We can't keep them until the owners show up.

745
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:55,573
People came forward to claim what was in the top row.

746
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:57,413
I'm worried about the rest.

747
00:43:58,243 --> 00:44:01,643
I think they'll be taken to the lost and found.

748
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,743
I think we can find out who did it.

749
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,143
What?

750
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:11,813
What are you doing? Let's do the laundry.

751
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:13,513
Hello?

752
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,273
Hello?

753
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:17,513
(Unknown number)

754
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,313
I wish she'd give me her number.

755
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,773
What's the secret call about?

756
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:26,713
It's not a secret. It was a friend.

757
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,373
What friend? A boyfriend?

758
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:32,473
All Gangnam women have one these days.

759
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,143
Shall we do the laundry?

760
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:35,273
Yes.

761
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:41,713
Everything feels damp.

762
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:44,273
Let's wash them while the weather's nice.

763
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:46,543
All these?

764
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,543
It's nothing for two housewives.

765
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:52,413
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

766
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:55,773
Two housewives?

767
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:05,543
Mother, don't we need some groceries?

768
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:07,513
There's nothing to eat.

769
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:09,773
Make bibimbap with the leftovers.

770
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,073
Why go shopping?

771
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,143
Don't waste precious daylight.

772
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:15,943
Strip the covers first.

773
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:17,473
Okay.

774
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:28,113
Mother, don't you need to use the toilet?

775
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,643
Why? So you can call your friend back?

776
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:37,843
I'm very constipated.

777
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:41,543
I'll be in there a long while.

778
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:43,743
Do you want to go first?

779
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:47,073
I ate so little there's nothing to expel.

780
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,343
Just when I'm about to poop, if someone knocks,

781
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:54,413
it goes back up inside.

782
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:57,943
Okay. Go and get things done.

783
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:02,573
I'll go to the bathroom then.

784
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:03,673
Okay.

785
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:05,613
Wait.

786
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:09,573
Air the bathroom well afterward.

787
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:11,843
What was in there a while tends to stink.

788
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:13,873
Okay.

789
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:23,273
There's another reason they're against the pipeline.

790
00:46:27,413 --> 00:46:29,243
The thief will come back...

791
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:31,813
to collect his things.

792
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,543
It's too much to give up on.

793
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:36,073
When?

794
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:38,373
- Today. - Today?

795
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:41,243
It'll get harder once the lockers are replaced.

796
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:44,343
He'll have to reveal himself at the lost and found.

797
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:47,013
If he couldn't get his things back then,

798
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:48,573
he will return today.

799
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,743
What if he did?

800
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:52,273
Then he won't show up.

801
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,313
But you can still catch him.

802
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,143
I can catch a thief who won't show up?

803
00:46:58,373 --> 00:46:59,913
You'll catch the accomplice.

804
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,613
How can we catch...

805
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,273
The person who put things in the locker.

806
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:10,373
Bingo. One of them is the accomplice.

807
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,973
- I'll head over right away. - See you there.

808
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,843
No, it could be dangerous. Stay at home.

809
00:47:16,273 --> 00:47:18,773
It's more dangerous for me here.

810
00:47:19,313 --> 00:47:20,343
What?

811
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:23,443
Never mind. See you at the market.

812
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:25,713
Okay then.

813
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:41,573
Do you need all that to go on a patrol?

814
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:42,773
Just in case.

815
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:44,513
Are you going to Bangtan Market?

816
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:45,843
Somewhere nearby.

817
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:49,273
I think you're going to see the wrecked lockers.

818
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:52,573
Is it really a drug-related case?

819
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,213
I'm crazy curious.

820
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:56,073
We'll find out soon.

821
00:48:56,073 --> 00:48:59,243
Could you please take me with you?

822
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:01,213
I found the lost cat,

823
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:02,773
sent the drunk man home,

824
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,413
and broke up a scuffle.

825
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:06,073
I'm not busy at all.

826
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:32,013
He didn't break into the rest of the lockers.

827
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:33,843
But...

828
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:36,643
one locker's claimed.

829
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:41,373
Is this the one?

830
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,243
People came forward to claim what was in the top row.

831
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:47,013
I'm worried about the rest.

832
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:53,573
How odd. Why is the key missing?

833
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,713
Is it being used?

834
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:06,743
The market's closed,

835
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:09,413
and the lockers will be replaced tonight.

836
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:11,543
This is the perfect time.

837
00:50:12,773 --> 00:50:14,113
Where can I hide?

838
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:53,643
What is taking her so long?

839
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:57,613
Is she still in the bathroom?

840
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:04,413
How long will she be in there for?

841
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:13,073
Did she go somewhere?

842
00:51:16,013 --> 00:51:17,373
Hold on a second.

843
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:22,843
Will her poop go back inside?

844
00:51:26,473 --> 00:51:28,043
I'm a mother-in-law...

845
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:32,843
who worries about my daughter-in-law's constipation.

846
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,613
There's no way we can wash the beddings today.

847
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:52,613
It's freezing.

848
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:55,643
Why is it raining? I don't have an umbrella.

849
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,573
The shower won't last long.

850
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,073
Wait and see.

851
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:01,613
Jang Do Jang will come back here.

852
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:04,213
I really need to go.

853
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,473
- What? - I have to go.

854
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:09,443
How many times has this been?

855
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:11,443
Wear a diaper, will you?

856
00:52:12,073 --> 00:52:13,073
My goodness.

857
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,673
- Get lost. - What?

858
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,243
Go home.

859
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:17,473
- I'll wait. - Go.

860
00:52:17,473 --> 00:52:20,143
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

861
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:23,113
He's so unreliable.

862
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:34,143
Officer, I think the thief's here.

863
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:55,073
What was that?

864
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:58,313
Lady! Stop right there!

865
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,913
- Save me! - Get her!

866
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:02,443
Get her! She's the accomplice!

867
00:53:02,443 --> 00:53:04,273
She's the one we're after!

868
00:53:04,273 --> 00:53:06,413
- Go after her! - What?

869
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:10,843
Save me! Someone help me!

870
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:12,843
Are you sure about this?

871
00:53:14,213 --> 00:53:15,213
Get her!

872
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:18,443
Officer Hong.

873
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:19,573
Are you okay?

874
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,543
- Who are they? - Why are the police here?

875
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:24,813
- Get them. - What?

876
00:53:24,813 --> 00:53:28,013
- Maybe it isn't her. - This got complicated.

877
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:30,273
I'm fine. Get the thieves.

878
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,713
- Forget it. Let's get out of here. - What?

879
00:53:48,243 --> 00:53:50,613
Run! Faster!

880
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,913
Hurry up.

881
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:57,313
It hurts.

882
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:05,143
Not that way. Let's go this way.

883
00:54:05,873 --> 00:54:07,073
Wait, wait.

884
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,443
Let me sort this out.

885
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:12,043
Don't get too excited.

886
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,313
I won't.

887
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:14,943
Don't move!

888
00:54:15,373 --> 00:54:16,373
Wait.

889
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:18,743
- Hands up. - Calm down.

890
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,213
- Let's do this peacefully. - Hands up!

891
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:26,343
What do you think you're doing?

892
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:30,313
Seodong Police Station, Ha Wan Seung...

893
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:32,743
What are you two doing here?

894
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,073
Are there really drugs in the locker?

895
00:54:38,913 --> 00:54:40,243
How do you know that?

896
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:43,113
The thief will return tonight.

897
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,813
That's why you shouldn't be here in uniform!

898
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,373
I respect you, sir.

899
00:54:47,373 --> 00:54:48,913
Don't respect him.

900
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:51,073
We put so much work into this...

901
00:54:51,073 --> 00:54:52,873
and you might have ruined it!

902
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:54,843
Shoot.

903
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:57,543
Help him up.

904
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:58,873
You idiots.

905
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:08,843
Here it is. I found it.

906
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:13,473
My heart's still racing.

907
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:23,773
Why was I so shocked?

908
00:55:25,313 --> 00:55:27,343
I was hiding to catch the thief.

909
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:32,313
Why was I so surprised to see him?

910
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:38,143
But then, he did look a bit...

911
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:48,213
You came back in time.

912
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:51,913
They're replacing the lockers tonight.

913
00:55:56,873 --> 00:55:59,313
You must use your fists a lot.

914
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:01,513
Are you a boxer?

915
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:04,743
I don't think you wear gloves.

916
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:10,043
You must fight a lot with your bare hands.

917
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,573
Are you looking for something?

918
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:26,373
It's not that one.

919
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:29,873
It's 46.

920
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:32,273
That's the key you have.

921
00:56:44,273 --> 00:56:45,943
It's a master key.

922
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:49,873
You opened 46, 47, and 48.

923
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:53,043
I bet it opens 49 as well.

924
00:56:56,443 --> 00:56:57,913
It's not what you're looking for.

925
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:02,243
Could it be in 49?

926
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:27,473
You worked hard for nothing last time.

927
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:31,273
Did you get some expert help this time?

928
00:57:54,643 --> 00:57:55,713
Calm down.

929
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:58,413
They fixed the surveillance camera.

930
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:08,143
I'll leave you alone.

931
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:10,813
I'm not with the police.

932
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:12,613
I was just at the market when...

933
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:13,843
Shoot.

934
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,543
(Queen of Mystery)

935
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,443
I'm Seodong's Drug Sniffer.

936
00:58:41,673 --> 00:58:44,213
They put the stash all in one place...

937
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:46,343
and were dealing for the location.

938
00:58:46,343 --> 00:58:47,513
Let's get them.

939
00:58:47,513 --> 00:58:50,243
The Yakuza always pays up.

940
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:53,513
I'll get them on the scene. In person.

941
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:55,013
Let's stake them out.

942
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:58,973
Yes. You shouldn't be doing this.

943
00:58:59,143 --> 00:59:00,613
You scumbag.

944
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:06,543
Who are you? Why were you hiding there?
