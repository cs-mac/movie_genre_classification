00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:20,140

(piano music)

7
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,299
- [Voiceover] I read a sign
once above the rear view

8
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,601
mirror of my old school bus.

9
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,838
It said: Be kind to
everyone because everyone

10
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,907
is fighting some sort of battle.

11
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:03,251
- [Boy] When I grow up,
I want to help people.

12
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,755
(frantic medical orders)

13
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,823
- Will, put it at
360 and go again.

14
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,958
- CPR

00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,794
("The Sun II" by Snakadaktal)

16
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,531
* Touch my mouth

17
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,802
* Help me sleep

18
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,873
* Embrace my lungs

19
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,677
* Your breath I keep

20
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,881
* Share your warmth

21
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,519
* Knock our teeth

22
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,390
* My shoulder blade

23
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,827
* You lay your cheek

24
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,698
* Scratch my arm

25
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,270
* Kiss your crown and hold

26
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,440
* Your head to mine

27
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,977
* And feel you breathe

28
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,950
* Bastille

29
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,386
* I could have been

30
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,723
* I could have been you

31
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,692
* Bastille

32
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,561
* You couldn't control

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,963
* You couldn't
control the blue *

(multiple conversations)

35
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:34,575
- See you Harry, see you at
work next week, all right?

36
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,510
- Who's driving?

37
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:37,945
- [Everyone] He is!

38
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,847
- Will? Straight home, okay?

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,351
- Thank you so much,
I've had a great time.

00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:03,737

41
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:39,339
(techno dance music)

42
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,389
- Where's your girlfriend?

43
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:58,392
- Single. What about you?

44
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,360
- Just broke up.

45
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,074
- All right, we're out
of here, have a good one.

46
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:33,093
(haunting vocals)

47
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:00,153
* Should I do this, it was bliss

48
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:05,626
* My heart singing it was his

49
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:11,599
* Cause you changed everything

50
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:40,661
(doors closing)

51
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,107
(knocking on door)

52
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,544
- William!

53
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,046
(knocking on door)

54
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,649
William McIntyre,
it's the police.

55
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,786
(knocking on screen)

56
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,187
William McIntyre?

57
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,523
Constable Rossi, this is
Senior Detective Bridges.

58
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,691
- Do you have any
problems with us

59
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,726
searching your premises?

60
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,032
- What for?

61
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,102
- [Rossi] I'll
check the bedroom.

62
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,207
These aren't yours are they?

63
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,810
- They're just from work,
I ran out of my script.

64
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,211
- Whatever you say
may be taken down

65
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,680
and used in evidence,
do you understand?

66
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,014
- You're kidding me.

67
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,183
- Come on, let's go.

68
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,787
- Josh!

69
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,529
- Do you know this girl?

70
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:02,209
- Yeah. Just the other night.

71
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,616
- Your career is over.

72
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,821
- I don't know what
you're suggesting.

73
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,991
- [Detective] William, we're
not suggesting anything,

74
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,961
because we know you did it.

75
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,691
- Mr. Palmer.

76
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,662
- Jane, please tell the
court what happened next.

77
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:04,204
- And then, he had
my arms pressed down

78
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,406
- Your honor!

79
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,008
This is all hearsay evidence!

80
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,110
- [Judge] Mr. Peters
please sit down.

81
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,879
(multiple voices)

82
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,280
Order!

83
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,185
This court will
adjourn till 10:30.

84
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,789
- She drank with me
for ten hours, Francis.

85
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,791
Of course she's going to
feel weird and out of it.

86
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,325
- Then how do you
explain the morphine?

87
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,393
- I don't know.

88
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,995
Maybe she took
some pain killers.

89
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,329
Maybe we scored some
drugs when we were out.

90
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,932
- Maybe's not good
enough, William, okay?

91
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,168
Maybe's not good enough.

92
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,439
(door slamming)

93
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,943
- [Judge] Jury foreperson,
how do you find the defendant?

94
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,413
- Guilty, Your Honor.

95
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,315
- What?

96
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,217
No!

97
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,322
William!

98
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,730
(sad music)

99
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,098
- Will.

100
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,900
We'll lodge an
appeal immediately.

101
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,368
- You said 80/20 our way.

102
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,370
- Yeah, I know, but
I'll have it sorted

103
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,372
in a couple of weeks, okay?

104
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,373
- I didn't do it.

105
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,976
- Okay, come on, let's go.

106
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,411
- Hold your head up, William.

107
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,848
- McIntyre?

108
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,083
- Yes, ma'am.

109
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,386
- Get your clothes off.

110
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,189
- What? Now?

111
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,291
- Hurry up.

112
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,394
- Raise your arms.

113
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,397
Lift your nuts.

114
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,701
Turn around.

115
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,372
Bend over.

116
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,075
Now cough.

117
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,377
(coughing)

118
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,278
- There you go.

119
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,212
- Have a good one.

120
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,114
- See ya, Patsy.

121
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,924
- Hey, bro

122
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,929
- I'm Benjy, the subway bandit.

123
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,766
You know I was on four
TV stations last night?

124
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,003
First store, I was
in an Elvis suit

125
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,038
and then I dressed
up as Spiderman.

126
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,774
(laughing)

127
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,510
You should have seen
me on the cameras.

128
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,546
You know they got
cameras in stores now?

129
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,849
Are you listening
to me straighty?

130
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,917
- [Will] Yeah.

131
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah, well just as well, mate.

132
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,388
Because no fag boy
brushes me off,

133
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,457
you know what I mean?

134
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,960
No one.

135
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,166
What are you looking at bushy?

136
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,335
- A dead man.

137
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,470
- What he'd just say?

138
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,439
- [Will] I didn't quite,

139
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,540
I didn't quite catch it.

140
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,875
- Oh mate, you are
so full of sh...

141
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,144
(thudding)

142
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:02,182
(dramatic music)

143
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,075
(cat calls and yelling)

144
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:41,521
(dramatic music)

145
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:55,969
(yelling and jeering)

146
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,034
- Morning muster is at six.

147
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,437
There are seven
further musters a day.

148
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,105
Any questions?

149
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,607
- Yeah, I need a see a nurse.

150
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,951
- McIntyre, Reed, Taylor.

151
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,585
B-Yard.

152
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,653
- Hey, Benjy!

153
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,521
Asked to be put in with me.

154
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,058
- Up yours, princess,
you can't afford this!

155
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,627
- And my prison will not
tolerate this kind of talk!

156
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:59,466
(yelling and jeering)

157
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,643
- Welcome home, Jimmy.

158
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,413
- Don't you tell 'em.

159
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,417
- Tell 'em what?

160
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,686
- What you're in for.

161
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,534
- I like those.

162
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,283
Boo!

163
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:39,399
(low sustained noise)

164
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:53,746
(multiple conversations)

165
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,023
- Hey, pretty boy.

166
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,228
- Bruno, move it.

167
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,335
- Hello pretty boy! Ha!

168
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,704
- Cal's still going to
get that big fellow, mate.

169
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,039
- Boo!

170
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,110
- Don't talk too
much to this one,

171
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,478
and for God's sake don't
tell him what you're in for.

172
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,115
Butch.

173
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,352
You got ten days before
parole review, right?

174
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,155
- Now why would I do
anything to stuff that up?

175
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,458
- So we have an
understanding then?

176
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,766
- What are you in for?

177
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,069
- Uh, robbed a servo.

178
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,473
- A servo?

179
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,308
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,677
A petrol station.

181
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:02,282
- I know what a
fucking servo is.

182
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,686
- Can you get me smack in?

183
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,389
- No.

184
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,791
- Vs? Wizz? Juice?

185
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,759
- Uh, no.

186
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,667
- I shit, shower and shave first

187
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,803
and every night I get
your dessert, got it?

188
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,805
- Yeah.

189
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,309
I'm Will.

190
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,645
- Tuck your shit up there.

191
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,854
- Here.

192
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:47,160
(crickets)

193
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,801
(jeering and yelling)

194
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,405
- [Butch] You awake?

195
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,208
- Yeah.

196
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,847
- Ta for the smokes.

197
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,883
Butch.

198
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,188
- Pardon?

199
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,824
- Me name's Butch.

200
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,759
- Oh.

201
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,632
Oh.

202
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,169
Right.

203
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:36,643
(loud alarm)

204
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,752
- McIntyre.

205
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,221
Hurley.

206
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,822
Where's Hurley?

207
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,990
- I'm taking a shit.

208
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,359
(laughter)

209
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,827
- Wrong answer, get out here.

210
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,897
(laughter)

211
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,369
You think that's funny, boy?

212
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,805
See me after muster.

213
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,009
Reed.

214
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,912
Benard.

215
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,650
- [Warden] Count is correct,
all prisoners break off.

216
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,920
(alarm ringing)

217
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,957
- Hey, I'm George.

218
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,027
How long ya?

219
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,362
- Six years.

220
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,630
But I'm appealing.

221
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,831
- That'll take a few
months to come through...

222
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,800
- A few months?

223
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,935
- At best, copper.

224
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,905
The system is jammed
up with appeal.

225
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,541
We're all innocent.

226
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,010
Look pal, the best
way out of here,

227
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,678
and the earlier for you,

228
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,581
is to stay out of trouble.

229
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,518
And read this.

230
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,486
If you want a new
cell mate I'm in a two

231
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,656
all by myself, just ask Graham.

232
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,831
- Says here you were a nurse.

233
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,366
- Yeah. I'm a nurse.

234
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,900
- Were.

235
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,303
A nurse.

236
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,072
Seeing you're such
a caring person,

237
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,575
we need someone to
look after Fung.

238
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,976
- Sorry?

239
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,879
- Fung Poi, over there.

240
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,923
Now don't get too close to him.

241
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,560
He killed his mother.

242
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,930
Now he will need
assistance, with everything.

243
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:42,001
- You'll get five
dollars 20 each day.

244
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,837
- When do I start?

245
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:49,008
- By the look of things, he
needs to excrete right now.

246
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,346
Enjoy, McIntyre.

247
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,983
- Which one's your cell?

248
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,600
Come on, Fung.

249
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,910
Hi.

250
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,514
- You might want to keep
books like these on the low.

251
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,015
- Yeah.

252
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,919
- Heard you came in on
the bus with Jimmy Cove.

253
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:36,088
- Yeah, he took my shoes.

254
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,793
- Listen kid, that
boobhead's done time in every

255
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,796
state in Australia.

256
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,968
Story goes he ate a
bloke's ear for breakfast.

257
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,775
- [Announcement]
Attention prisoners,

258
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,810
the church service will
be held in the prison

259
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,546
chaplain's room in five minutes.

260
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,081
Any prisoners wishing to
attend the church service

261
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,950
please come to the guard's desk

262
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,653
and collect your ID card.

263
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:12,425
(yelling and cheering)

264
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,476
- Oy!

265
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,945
- Hey.

266
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,149
- Come here.

267
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:49,762
(groaning)

268
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,634
Did you see my boys
in the library?

269
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,136
- Yeah, yeah.

270
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,106
- Did they say anything to ya?

271
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,909
- No, mate not a thing.

272
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,479
- I'm not your mate.

273
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,482
- I'm Will.

274
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,151
- I know.

275
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,887
- Okay then.

276
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,590
It's okay, Fung.

277
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,161
Thanks for the ciggies.

278
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,665
(groaning)

279
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:36,142
- That Walsh prick
put you in with Butch?

280
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,978
So he had a good
job in the outer

281
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,148
and now he's got you
looking after Jackie Chan.

282
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,818
(laughing) Piss off.

283
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,157
These walls have ears, pal.

284
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,893
Don't trust no one.

285
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,135
- Sorry there, Fung.

286
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,172
Almost, yep.

287
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,547
- You're needed at
the front house.

288
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,615
You've got a visitor.

289
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,916
- Who?

290
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,018
Can I just finish here?

291
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,221
- Yeah, you can finish there.

292
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,858
But, I wouldn't miss this one.

293
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,669
- [Radio] Front gate clear.

294
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,275
- William McIntyre?

295
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,646
- You know who I am.

296
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,681
- Well if I go by what
someone shouted at you

297
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,584
from the gallery at your trial,

298
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,352
yeah, a sick maggot.

299
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,923
- You drove an hour and
a half to call me that?

300
00:25:56,956 --> 00:26:00,827
- No. To deliver these.

301
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,995
We're appealing your sentence.

302
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,131
Only six years.

303
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,100
What kind of crack was
your judge smoking?

304
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,270
Appeal shouldn't be too long.

305
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,306
Enjoy your new home.

well here, Francis.

344
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,040
- [Francis] William, things
are moving along we just have

345
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,441
find a Queen's Counsel.

346
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,109
- Why can't you do it?

347
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,712
- Me? This matter
is way beyond me.

348
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:00,947
Look, your matter
is going before the

349
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,315
Supreme Court of Appeal.

350
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,217
- I know, and it's not
about my innocence.

351
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,452
- Don't worry
about their appeal,

352
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,187
the court has to hear
about ours first.

353
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,722
Look, I'm going to find
someone experienced

354
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,223
who can fight the appeal against

355
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,259
your conviction technically.

356
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,727
- I need someone who
can fight the charges

357
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,395
based on the truth,
Francis, not a technicality.

358
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,031
- We're going to get the
right person for the job.

359
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,169
- Bah!

360
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,846
- McIntyre. You're up, let's go.

361
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,146
- Get your clothes on.

362
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,817
- Will, William McIntyre.

363
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,496
William.

364
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,974
This was your father's,
before he passed away.

365
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,216
How are they treating you?

366
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,418
- I'm okay, Mum.

367
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,320
- How can you say that?

368
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,490
- Mum, I'm okay.

369
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,826
- You're in a maximum
security prison for

370
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,828
something you didn't do.

371
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,563
You've got years to serve.

372
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,198
It is not okay!

373
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,967
- Ma'am, I'm going to have
to ask you to keep it down.

374
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,970
- I knew this would happen.

375
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,838
- This is not right!

376
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:06,906
- Mum!

377
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,174
Mum.

378
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,508
- Ma'am you're going
to have to leave.

379
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,442
- Don't you touch me!

380
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,577
- She's going to be okay.

381
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,880
- You don't touch me!

382
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,082
William!

383
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,151
They can't do this to you!

384
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,555
(crying) I love you!

385
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:29,161
- I love you too.

386
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,611
- Was that your mum?

387
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,213
- Yeah.

388
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,548
- How was it?

389
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,583
- Shit.

390
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,156
- At least you got
someone to visit ya.

391
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,391
- I reckon it makes
your time harder.

392
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,560
- Ah, turn it up.

393
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,596
- Baxter.

394
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,034
Sanders.

395
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,538
- Anything beats the
same old same old.

396
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,677
- What did you do?

397
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,213
- I burned a bridge.

398
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,550
- What'd you do?

399
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,353
- I had a one night stand.

400
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,427
- Then why aren't you in there.

401
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,896
- I didn't rape her.

402
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,598
We were drunk.

403
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,101
We had sex. I left.

404
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,338
- Then why would she cry rape?

405
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,441
- Turned out she wanted
her boyfriend back.

406
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:52,611
His best mate saw us getting on.

407
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,483
- Didn't your mother
ever tell you not to have

408
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,651
sex before you were married?

409
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,122
Sanders? That's from Cove.

410
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,226
- What the hell are
those guys doing?

411
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,595
- They fatten em up
and bang 'em in the pot

412
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:10,963
Baxter.

413
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,631
- Will.

414
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,636
- Jimmy Cove has
taken a liking to ya.

415
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,171
- How do you know him?

416
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,440
- Me five-eight crossed
him on another tour.

417
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,042
- And?

418
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:27,279
- Now that was a bridge
Andy shouldn't have burned.

419
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,483
Jimmy whacked him on the spot.

420
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,586
- He doesn't seem like...

421
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,722
- They never do,
kid, they never do.

422
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:41,960
(hip-hop music)

423
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,780
- Hey Will!

424
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,250
How you doing, buddy?

425
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,120
I heard some copper
came and saw you today.

426
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,622
- Yeah, mate they want
me to do more time.

427
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,723
I'm fighting these
bastards George,

428
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,692
I'll be out of here
before Christmas.

429
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,527
- Christmas, eh?

430
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,762
Sounds like that
little book I gave you

431
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,764
is starting to make sense, mate.

432
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,699
(punching)

433
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,168
- What are you appealing?

434
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,702
- What are you appealing?

435
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,803
- The whole thing.

436
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,704
I found that every
successful conviction

437
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,306
gets the DPP.

438
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,574
- DP what?

439
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,708
- Public prosecutions.

440
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,710
They allocate credit
points for funding.

441
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,679
Rape is such an easy
charge to go down for.

442
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,814
- Does that really effect
the jury's verdict though?

443
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,649
- Yeah, does that really?

444
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,285
- We lost all the intelligent
jurors through selection,

445
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,786
we're left with the ones
with nothing better to do

446
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,322
than watch Judge Judy live.

447
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,824
- Maybe they're worried
they all get ahead of you?

448
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,027
- Come over to their house.

449
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,731
- Shut up Benjy!

450
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,533
- We'll win the
appeal, I'm sure of it.

451
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,336
She won't know what's hit her
with a defamation lawsuit.

452
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,672
(cheering)

453
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,074
- Hey, Macker.

454
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,575
Story says your friends
with Jimmy the big

455
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,577
whacker from A-yard.

456
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:06,678
- We've had words.

457
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,080
- Can you tell him
Taz needs a suit?

458
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,082
- Yeah, sure.

459
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,151
- Careful.

460
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,852
- Yeah, careful Will.

461
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,122
- It's all good.

462
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,726
(rap music)

463
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:28,467
- You've been in
a bit I take it?

464
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,876
(laughing)

465
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,512
- First time.

466
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,754
- Jimmy?

467
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,832
- It's not enough.

468
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,177
Come here, I won't hit ya.

469
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:23,589
(groaning)

470
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,159
I told ya I wouldn't hit ya.

471
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:32,198
You tell that ration
it's this next time.

472
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,134
- Okay, Jimmy.

473
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,176
- What are you in for?

474
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,645
- Parking fines.

475
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:49,815
(laughing)

476
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,325
- Fucking parking
fines (laughing)

477
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,693
(crickets)

478
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:02,861
(dogs barking)

479
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:03,829
(alarm ringing)

480
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,863
- Out of bed! Get up!

481
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,733
Right lads, out of bed!

482
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,438
- What do we have here then?

483
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,740
- What?

484
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,847
(knocking on door)

485
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,487
- McIntyre.

486
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,826
Do you know that if we
were to inform the police

487
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,629
about what we found
in your possession,

488
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,400
you'd be looking at
another four to five years?

489
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,974
We'll be investigating
every visitor on your list.

490
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,010
- Yes, ma'am but
I'm telling you...

491
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,912
- And know this.

492
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,916
Your every move will be
under closest scrutiny.

493
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,688
- McIntyre.

494
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,395
- Ralph if they want to settle
two million out of court

495
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,830
then surely you've got
to accept that offer.

496
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,501
Look Ralph, I've got an
old friend at the door

497
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,269
can I give you a call back?

498
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,405
Okay, bye.

499
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,940
Francis.

500
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,542
How are you?

501
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,876
- Yeah, I'm good.

502
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,512
I wanted to have a quick
chat to you about something..

503
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,280
- Francis! You've never
been a very good liar,

504
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:30,482
I told you you should
never become a lawyer.

505
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,418
What's going on?

506
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,686
- I went down on a case
I did for Legal Aid.

507
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,954
- Legal Aid?

508
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,689
- Yeah. I took it as
part of my percentage

509
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:40,592
for community placements.

510
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,863
- Nothing wrong with
a Legal Aid case.

511
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,400
I'm intrigued as to why
you've brought it to me.

512
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,305
Julie, he didn't do it.

513
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,540
- You haven't forgotten
our first year subject

514
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,942
on professional
boundaries have you?

515
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,310
Who sentenced him?

516
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,312
- Hoggins.

517
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,781
- Hoggins hasn't had an
appeal against conviction

518
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:03,915
in 20 years.

519
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,651
- And that's why
we need you, Julie.

520
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:06,852
- We?

521
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,053
- Well I need you,
okay, I need you.

522
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,789
This case, it's
different, it's not right.

523
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,992
- Yeah, and I'd need 40
thousand dollars up front.

524
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,996
- He's only go two.

525
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,467
- Then I'll see you at
the Christmas party.

526
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,606
- How's Liz?

527
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:31,009
- She's taken it a little hard.

528
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,479
How are you going?

529
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,446
- What do you mean?

530
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,015
What has she said?

531
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,885
- You know her, she's a
sensitive little thing.

532
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,854
Look, how are you really going?

533
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,728
- Hanging in there.

534
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:55,133
That bitch is still
sticking to her story, John.

535
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,036
This is bullshit.

536
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:03,409
- William, you have
to forgive her.

537
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,514
- My life has been ruined.

538
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,049
I've lost my career, my freedom.

539
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,718
The newspapers have
smashed any reputation

540
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,653
I have left, and even
some of my good friends

541
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,022
have snubbed me.

542
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,060
And you expect me
to forgive her?

543
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,464
- Then you'll be free.

544
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,566
- Time's up, come on.

545
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,906
- You're crazy, you know that.

546
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:37,943
- The hard part
will be you'll have

547
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,579
to keep forgiving her.

548
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,085
Will?

549
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,988
Liz believes you.

550
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,094
- Come on!

551
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,697
Let's go Will!

552
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,100
- You can join us.

553
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,635
- Sure Benjy.

554
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:05,771
- You just need to
wear this outfit.

555
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,105
- Mcintyre!

556
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,008
- You're girlfriend's
here, mate.

557
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,944
- This is for you.

558
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,680
Smells nice.

559
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:18,750
- [Benjy] Razz, what if they
offer you to play inside?

560
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,621
Razz? Razz!

561
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,735
- [Voiceover] Dear Will.

562
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,070
I really don't
know what to write.

563
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,739
I cry nearly every
night thinking of what

564
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,741
has happened to you.

565
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,477
I'm sorry that I have
not come in to see you.

566
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:48,013
I'm glad Dad has been
able to visit though.

567
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,615
He says I should
just keep praying for

568
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,483
a positive outcome.

569
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:54,219
His faith in God
drives me crazy.

570
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,987
I would love to come
and see you but don't

571
00:40:56,021 --> 00:41:00,125
know whether I'll be
able to keep it together.

572
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,928
I'm thinking of you.

573
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,163
Your special friend, Liz.

574
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,911
- Watch it, pal.

575
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,515
- Will!

576
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:25,584
Razz? Razz?

577
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,253
I knew you'd come around.

578
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,021
You just gotta drive
the getaway car.

579
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:33,024
- Benjy, shut up. Not now.

580
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,763
Look, I think Fung wants to
help you when you get out too.

581
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:42,233
- So, can you drive?

582
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,737
- What's up?

583
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,973
- Got a letter.

584
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,643
- You blokes are all the same.

585
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:55,180
Want everything to be perfect
and then you'll be happy.

586
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,649
- I know what you're in for.

587
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,251
How many armed
robs have you done?

588
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,255
- Enough.

589
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:08,259
You gotta take risks, cupcake.

590
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,663
- Can you not call me cupcake?

591
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,665
- Risks.

592
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,767
Without them you'll never know.

593
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,937
- My friend John
calls that faith.

594
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,239
- Faith? Fuck faith.

595
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,575
(laughing)

596
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,210
- Something you
hope for and certain

597
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,645
of what you can't see.

598
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,246
- Yeah, well my rewards
are certain, pal.

599
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,750
- Oh, they don't really
pay off though do they?

600
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,986
- What's her name?

601
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,254
- Liz.

602
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,224
- Liz. Lizzie.

603
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,329
Well I'll tell
you this for free.

604
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,364
Everyone you thought
would be in your business

605
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,867
apart while your here won't
be seen for 500 mile and

606
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,004
others you never
expected just rock up.

607
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,879
- I had some really good mates.

608
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,616
- Bullshit. Bullshit!

609
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:09,154
Really good mates, eh?

610
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:15,360
So where are they now?

611
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,763
You see 'em?

612
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:20,365
They watch ya?

613
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:24,002
They would take a bullet for ya?

614
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,911
- Rode the wave, eh?

615
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,646
- The what?

616
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,347
- The wave.

617
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,085
- You guess.

618
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,692
- You are so missing out.

619
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:52,831
You don't know what I'm
talking about do ya?

620
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:03,041
The ocean waves.

621
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:09,114
It's like, it's like
you're completely alone.

622
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:14,419
You're surrounded by
this massive thing.

623
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,354
The swell comes up behind ya.

624
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,424
You snap up onto
your board, and boom!

625
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,659
You're away.

626
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,361
It's gotcha.

627
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,796
You're hurtling
along this barrel

628
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,164
and you can hear your heart.

629
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:30,668
Boom. Ba-boom. Ba-boom.

630
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,106
- Then what?

631
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,942
- Then bang!

632
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,711
You lose your balance, it
knocks you upside down.

633
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,713
Madness.

634
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,448
You're smashed up in its
grip like a rag doll in

635
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,852
a washing machine.

636
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:52,390
That's worth the risk.

637
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:57,162
(yelling and screaming)

638
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:32,063
(heavy breathing)

639
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:40,071
(piano music)

640
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,287
- Excuse me.

641
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,023
Wouldn't it be good to
break Hoggin's track record

642
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:41,893
of not having one conviction
overturned in 20 years?

643
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,601
- I'm sorry.

644
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,073
Now what were we saying?

645
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,113
- That's it!

646
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,615
That's it, Fung!

647
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,688
Hi mate, just a can of Sustagen,

648
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,190
a can of coke

649
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,059
and some of those noodles.

650
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,660
Awesome.

651
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,363
Can I grab a
plastic bag as well?

652
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,599
(moaning)

653
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:31,642
Come on, mate.

654
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,984
- Oy! Macker!

655
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:43,054
Give us your tin of powder.

656
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,140
- Butch.

657
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:09,014
I worked for this.

658
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,384
If you want some powder,
don't put me on the show.

659
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:17,088
Come to me in private
and ask for it.

660
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,625
- Come on, move along.

661
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,060
- What?

662
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:25,430
(laughter)

663
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,639
- You know the drill.

664
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,676
- Got delectable
beans today, boys.

665
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,280
- Rubbish again as usual.

666
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:46,384
- Can I have some Sustagen?

667
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,322
- Sure.

668
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:55,560
I'll get some for you
when I finish my meal.

669
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,696
- I'm getting a
little impatient.

670
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,670
- Fuck off.

671
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:25,156
- You look like crap.

672
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,695
- Great to see you too.

673
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,366
- You look like you're
handling yourself all right.

674
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,704
- I was actually
scared shitless.

675
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:46,377
(laughing)

676
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,181
- Okay

677
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,754
- You been in the slot?

678
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,624
- Oh yeah. Three weeks, mate.

679
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:00,558
- What's it like?

680
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,128
- Fish and chips.

681
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,200
- What brings you to B-yard?

682
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:12,637
- Politics. How's
your appeal going?

683
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,106
- It's going.

684
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,241
One minute they're saying
it shouldn't be too

685
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,376
far away, the next...

686
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,078
- I've been thinking
about this tart.

687
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:22,780
- What tart?

688
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,750
- The one that got
you into this mess.

689
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,654
You need to get hold of ten G.

690
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,527
- Ten G? What for?

691
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,265
- Yeah, you get ten G to
me and I'll sort it out.

692
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,801
- Sort what?

693
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:47,805
- Sort her out, idiot.

694
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,674
You shouldn't be locked
up in this shithole.

695
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,276
- Jimmy, are you saying that
for ten thousand dollars

696
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,777
you could have this girl
murdered, that's what you meant.

697
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:53,878
- I didn't say that.

698
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:54,912
For ten thousand dollars

699
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,846
exactly what your said

700
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,717
- Don't bring your Bible
bullshit here, son!

701
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:07,458
I've heard you're shacking
up with Georgie boy.

702
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,895
Don't you get caught
up with all of his...

703
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:13,398
- Caught up?

704
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,400
Caught up.

705
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,736
The only person caught
up here Jimmy, is you.

706
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,477
When are you just
going to be yourself?

707
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,757
- What was your first job, Will?

708
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,561
- Mowing lawns.

709
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,832
- Mowing lawns?

710
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:52,837
You remember your first day?

711
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,441
- Yeah, yeah I do.

712
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,879
- Well I was eight me first day.

713
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,750
I used to ride my
little yellow scooter

714
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,486
through the streets
of the cross.

715
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,421
My mother's friends
would give me a couple

716
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:12,557
coins, you know give me a cuppa.

717
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,393
Couple a coffees.

718
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,665
Five cents for
every cup delivered.

719
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,537
That was me pocket
money, next couple years.

720
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,242
Coffee run for hookers.

721
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:39,650
One day, I couldn't find mum.

722
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,288
It was a Friday
when I went looking.

723
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,925
I found her up this
alleyway and just

724
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,496
getting the crap
beat out of her.

725
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:01,306
So I stabbed the prick.

726
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:07,978
And he never did get up.

727
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,658
So I am who I am, boy.

728
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,961
And I don't need no life lesson

729
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,598
from some pimply ass kid

730
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:31,336
who knows shit.

731
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:46,351
Ten K.

732
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:52,957
And she's gone.

733
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:07,037
(grunting)

734
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:21,452
(crashing)

735
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,796
- [Will] Dear Jane.

736
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,369
(crying)

737
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:42,473
Don't know why you said
what you said against me.

738
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,646
One thing I do know
that happened that night

739
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,816
is that we slept together.

740
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,821
I forgive you.

741
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:01,426
(crying)

742
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,679
Apples are up.

743
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,147
- Playing in
Friday's forty game?

744
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,451
- Now that you're in
B-yard, I think I will.

745
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,189
- Attention prisoners,
the church service will

746
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,192
be held in the prison
hamplain's room in five minutes.

747
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,094
Any prisoners wishing to attend

748
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,929
the church service
- (jeering and yelling)

749
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:42,132
please come to the
guard's desk...

750
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,936
- Thank you.

751
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,739
- You got a buddy today George.

752
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,842
(laughing)

753
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,479
- Don't worry about the boys.

754
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:01,218
- Oy, Macker.

755
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,120
You better watch your back.

756
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,824
- Why is that Butch?

757
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,695
- Cause you're not always
going to have your bodyguards.

758
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:16,133
- George says, I've got
angels all around me.

759
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,838
And if anything were
to happen to me,

760
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,140
I'd hate to imagine what
would happen to them.

761
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,610
- You're filling this kid's
head with shit, George.

762
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:28,178
- It's only shit
if it stinks, mate.

763
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:34,118
And frankly, right
now, all I can smell

764
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:37,488
is the stench of
your rotting soul.

765
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:39,824
- Are you crazy George?

766
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:43,460
- Butch it's time
you found the truth.

767
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,663
Look.

768
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,902
Whoever believes and is baptized

769
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,904
shall be saved.

770
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:57,141
But whoever doesn't
believe shall be condemned.

771
00:57:58,643 --> 00:57:59,644
- So what?

772
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,746
- So we gotta do this for you.

773
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:02,780
- Do what George?

774
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,515
- Will get the door.

775
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,217
- Have faith, Butch.

776
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,821
- Look out, Fung.

777
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,790
- Rip your top off.

778
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,959
Come on.

779
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:20,565
We claim this soul in
the name of the father,

780
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:24,902
the son and the
holy ghost, amen.

781
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,540
- Welcome to the kingdom.

782
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:44,221
(door slamming)

783
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,558
(alarm ringing)

784
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,960
- [Warden] All prisoners
return to your cells.

785
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,962
Night lockdown in two minutes.

786
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,931
All prisoners
return to your cells

787
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,567
Night lockdown in two minutes.

788
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,949
(thunder claps)

789
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,320
- McIntyre.

790
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,255
- Sorry, sir.

791
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,590
What's up?

792
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:20,925
- You're up.

793
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,293
You've got a visitor.

794
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:29,867
- William.

795
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,101
Hi, Julie Nile.

796
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:32,837
- Hi, Will.

797
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,204
- Francis told me you've
been studying the law

798
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,373
closely in regards
to your matter.

799
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,808
- I have.

800
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,276
It seems a pretty
clear cut case.

801
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,079
- Your trial judge has
died and the police have

802
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:45,149
lost important video
footage, and the complainant

803
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:48,285
still isn't backing
down from her story.

804
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,323
And I'll be taking your case.

805
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,694
- I have no idea who
you are, but thank you!

806
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:59,029
- First things first.

807
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,397
No guarantees.

808
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,366
- I'm praying
we're going to win.

809
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:03,834
- William please know
the prosecution counsel

810
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:06,303
is not going to
back down that easy.

811
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,237
- But I didn't do it.

812
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,640
- I know what your stand is.

813
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:12,643
- Mrs. Nile it's not my stand.

814
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,311
- Okay we better get
this ball rolling.

815
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,647
How are you doing in here?

816
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:17,748
- You know what?

817
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,650
- What's that?

818
01:00:19,684 --> 01:00:22,787
- I actually like some
of the guys in here.

819
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,388
- You don't belong in here.

820
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,255
- So you know I'm innocent.

821
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,290
- I didn't say that.

822
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,659
- But it's the truth.

823
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,828
- Truth?

824
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,763
- It's the law that
sets us free, William,

825
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:35,199
not the truth.

826
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:44,141
- This is the best day I've had.

827
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,342
- Lizzie seen ya.

828
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,344
- Naw, it's my new mouthpiece.

829
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,913
Francis was my old mouthpiece.

830
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,180
He's not old but he was the
one who represented me...

831
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,448
- Slow down, pal,
slow down you're

832
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,717
giving me an ear ache.

833
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,818
- Sorry, man I'm
just pretty stoked.

834
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,419
- Good for you.

835
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,221
You know that suit
you were in court,

836
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:00,357
Des is still looking for one.

837
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,092
- I really need it
for my appeal though.

838
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:04,962
- Of course, mate, of course
I'll get it back to 'ya.

839
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,197
- Hey Jimmy, hey Will.

840
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:09,099
- Hi Will!

841
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:10,835
- Hey, I overheard the
boys are going to get

842
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,970
you back for breaking
our Randy's jaw.

843
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:17,341
- Ow! Well I'll break it
again if he comes near me.

844
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:22,346
And yours too if you
talk to me again.

845
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,716
- Just sayin'

846
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,252
- He's just trying to help.

847
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,453
- I think Brooks is right.

848
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:30,988
(laughing)

849
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,389
- He's far from right, Macker.

850
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:33,958
Far from right.

851
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:38,095
- No, I mean I haven't
heard Benjy talk like that.

852
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:42,733
- Heard it all before,
pal, all before.

853
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,737
- [Warden] Count is correct.
All prisoners break off.

854
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:50,240
(alarm ringing)

855
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:52,509
- I've gotta make a call, mate.

856
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,344
- I gotta talk, Braz.

857
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,880
Braz!

858
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:00,417
- Hello?

859
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,419
- Francis, hi it's Will.

860
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,989
- Oh, hey Will, how are things?

861
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,490
- Yeah, hanging in there.

862
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,492
Listen, thanks so
much for sending Julie

863
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:10,027
to come and see me.

864
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,763
I tell you what, she
sounds pretty serious.

865
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,031
Francis?

866
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,532
You there?

867
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,936
- Weil I told you
I'd do my best.

868
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,438
- Nearly a year and
a half, Francis,

869
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,041
I guess that's not too
far off a couple of weeks.

870
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,310
- These things take time.

871
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,278
- Do we have an appeal date yet?

872
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:29,780
- Yeah, about that,
I wanted to say that

873
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:31,448
(alarm ringing)

874
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,116
hello?

875
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:33,550
(alarm ringing)

876
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,919
Will, you there?

877
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,054
- [Warden] Attention
staff, code blue,

878
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,056
all prisoners return to
your cells immediately

879
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,326
I repeat, all prisoners return
to your cells immediately.

880
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,797
(alarm ringing)

881
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,803
(dramatic music)

882
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:16,093
(door slamming)

883
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:53,530
- It's Benjy.

884
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,265
- In here, even the
small things can

885
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:58,035
make people crack.

886
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,906
- I hate this place.

887
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,843
- If it wasn't today it would
have been tomorrow, mate.

888
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:10,114
A walking time bomb.

889
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,649
Those who hope in the Lord

890
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,618
will renew their strength.

891
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:17,487
They will sore on
wings like eagles.

892
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,025
They will run, and
not grow weary.

893
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:24,561
They will walk,
and not be faint.

894
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,599
Welcome to the
jungle, my friend.

895
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:35,872
(hard rock music)

896
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:56,560
(yelling and jeering)

897
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:00,264
* The underdog I won't
break and won't bend

898
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:03,333
* Don't need no rules

899
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,308
* We rise

900
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,611
* We rise

901
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,615
* We rise

902
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,652
* We rise

903
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,992
* Rise

904
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:32,662
* The battle lines
have been drawn

905
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,101
* Why's the man a
prisoner of a man

906
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,604
* A heavy hand a broken back

907
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,141
* The dogs of war
are ready for attack

908
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:46,276
* We rise

909
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,647
* We rise

910
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,482
* A prisoner of man

911
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:54,384
* We rise

912
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,155
* We rise

913
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:01,158
* Ready for attack

914
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,560
* Rise

915
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,546
- Touchdown!

916
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:31,321
- [Jimmy] For the first time
in all me 26 years behind bars

917
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:35,992
I felt like a free man.

918
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,163
* We rise

919
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,732
* We rise

920
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,736
* We rise

921
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,674
* Rise

922
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:58,082
(groaning)

923
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:36,486
- You got bugalugs?

924
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:39,523
- Stop it, stop it.

925
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,730
You all right?

926
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,165
- I'm okay, Mum.

927
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:51,468
- Oh good. It's just
that, I shouldn't

928
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:54,104
listen to that stupid
woman next door

929
01:07:54,138 --> 01:07:57,541
- Mum, what is it?

930
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,411
- You must be Mrs.
Cove. I'm Will.

931
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:04,814
- You better take a seat, bloke.

932
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:23,433
- About your plea, what
are you going to do?

933
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,436
- I'm not sure, Mum.

934
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,805
I'm still on the fence.

935
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,615
- Well I think you should
tell them the truth son,

936
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:41,551
plead guilty.

937
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,828
That'll set you free.

938
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,343
I didn't mean to upset you.

939
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:09,913
Look, I've been in prison too.

940
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:11,948
Here.

941
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:16,220
I just want you to be free.

942
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:28,898
(piano music)

943
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:47,577
(laughter)

944
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:16,072
- Julie, what a surprise!

945
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,541
- Good morning, Francis.

946
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:18,908
- There's just one more thing.

947
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,577
- There always is.

948
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,811
- Appeal date.

949
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:22,979
- The ninth of May.

950
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,314
- That's just weeks away

951
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:25,649
- I need you to keep
the dates quiet until

952
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,851
we gather the
necessary paperwork.

953
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:29,319
We need to get access to
the witnesses who weren't

954
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:30,954
brought forward in
the first trial.

955
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,489
- Yeah.

956
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,824
Do you think we'll win.

957
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:35,825
- Well we have to.

958
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,627
He's innocent.

959
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:42,599
(hip hop music)

960
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:03,119
- You know William McIntyre?

961
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,588
If things get too tough

962
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:05,555
- How many times
you want Brooksy?

963
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:08,658
- An many as it takes.

964
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:21,838
Jimmy hasn't been
telling you to keep

965
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,440
away from me, has he Will?

966
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,775
- I tell him to keep away
from the game, not the player.

967
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:26,976
(laughter)

968
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:30,914
- Oh, Jimmy that is so sweet.

969
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:37,554
(upbeat music)

970
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:45,629
- Watch it Brooksy.

971
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,496
- Or what?

972
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,631
- Boo!

973
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:50,934
(laughter)

974
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:55,439
- Cut this off.

975
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:05,849
(cheering)

976
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:10,086
* You'll be the
life of the party

977
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,202
* You'll be the
life of the party *

978
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:30,440
(alarm ringing)

979
01:13:31,675 --> 01:13:34,010
- Get out of bed!

980
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:38,081
Come on!

981
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,750
- Get a move on

982
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:45,088
- You must have really
pissed the chief off.

983
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:48,124
- It's not like you to
keep bad company, George.

984
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:51,628
- Yeah, it's all that
home brew under my bed.

985
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,902
- Sorry for the early
wake up call, boys.

986
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,136
- It's not your fault.

987
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,038
- Actually it is.

988
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:04,508
- What do you mean?

989
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,509
- I've got something
important I need

990
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:06,242
to ask Will.

991
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,243
- Ah shit.

992
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,978
You ratted on us so you
could have a tea chat...

993
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:11,881
- Yeah, yeah,
righto, St. Georgie.

994
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:16,185
(dog panting)

995
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,494
- It's pretty cold, mate.

996
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,031
- It's pretty important, mate.

997
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,600
- Come on boys, up.

998
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,504
Let's go, Jimmy.

999
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,522
- Will, ya there?

1000
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,524
- Yeah.

1001
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,163
- The other day you were
telling me about surfing.

1002
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,198
- Yeah.

1003
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:10,707
- Where do you go?

1004
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:13,877
- Anywhere.

1005
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,512
- But where do you go?

1006
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:21,250
- Rainbow Bay.

1007
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:27,957
- Sounds nice.

1008
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:30,594
- Yeah, yeah it is.

1009
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,229
- You know the last job
I was telling you about.

1010
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,098
- Yeah the...

1011
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:38,968
- Well I gotta go to court
today and enter a plea.

1012
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:40,837
- Oh yeah?

1013
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,609
- What should I do?

1014
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:52,849
If I plead guilty
they'll shoot me off to

1015
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,951
Risdon for another ten years,

1016
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:58,254
if I plead not I have a
trial or two and they'll

1017
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,255
move me anyway.

1018
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,725
Either way I'm screwed.

1019
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:08,131
Still there, Will?

1020
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:10,600
- Yeah, yep.

1021
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,269
I'm thinking.

1022
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:17,641
- What would you do?

1023
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,315
- I'd...

1024
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,054
I'd plead guilty.

1025
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,326
Then face the music.

1026
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:46,169
- Sounds good, Will.

1027
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:54,310
- I'll say a prayer for you.

1028
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:05,354
- Love you, ya bugger.

1029
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,101
- I love you too, mate.

1030
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,078
- What's wrong McIntye?

1031
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,714
Lost your bum chum?

1032
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:06,449
- [Fung] (moaning)

1033
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:09,485
- Everybody knows why
you were his friend.

1034
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,156
With a charge like yours,
you'd be dead in here.

1035
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:18,694
(laughing) Why'd you
give him a return, eh?

1036
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,736
Now look who's got your back.

1037
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,238
A useless invalid.

1038
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,140
- [Fung] (moaning)

1039
01:18:31,174 --> 01:18:34,710
- Leave him Walsh,
you bloody coward.

1040
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,014
- What's the matter McIntyle?

1041
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,751
Did you think you were
going to get your suit back?

1042
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,388
There was no poor
prick going to court.

1043
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,926
Jimmy sold it for
a pouch of tobacco.

1044
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,865
I can see right
through you, McIntyre.

1045
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:59,735
- I said leave him!

1046
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,438
- Leave him boy!

1047
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,007
- George!

1048
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:06,810
- George!

1049
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:09,245
- George, it's not worth it.

1050
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,179
(alarm ringing)

1051
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:11,180
- [George] Leave me, Butch.

1052
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,349
He was beating up Fung!

1053
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:18,922
- Fung, breathe
Fung, breathe, mate.

1054
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:22,458
Come on, mate.

1055
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:27,063
(alarm ringing)

1056
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,068
- Right, we ready?

1057
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,804
- Yep. Here are the affidavits,
the precedent cases,

1058
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:37,473
and the last trial
transcript queries here.

1059
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,342
And uh,

1060
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,077
Will gave me this to give
you just in case needed

1061
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,246
some help.

1062
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,182
- Okay.

1063
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,917
- McIntyre?

1064
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:49,919
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:19:51,855 --> 01:19:56,860
(dramatic music)

1066
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,448
You happy, sir?

1067
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,851
- It's a job.

1068
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:23,987
- Not with your job.

1069
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,289
In here.

1070
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:36,432
- I haven't been since
I was a kid, sir.

1071
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,639
- Nice of you to
join us Ms. Nile.

1072
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:47,543
I didn't think the tall
poppies came down here.

1073
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,314
- It's Mrs. Nile, Barry.

1074
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:55,051
- All stand.

1075
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:02,525
This court is now in session.

1076
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,528
- Bring the prisoner in.

1077
01:21:12,936 --> 01:21:16,372
- All people to do with
McIntyre vs. the Crown are

1078
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:20,576
under oath by order of
her Majesty the Queen.

1079
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,513
- Yes, Mrs. Nile.

1080
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:28,251
- Your Honors, I'm here today
representing Mr. Mcintyre.

1081
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:30,019
Our case is succinct.

1082
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:32,588
We have three pertinent
precedents which prove

1083
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:37,326
Mr. McIntyre's first trial
was a miscarriage of justice.

1084
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,996
- A miscarriage of justice
is certainly going for the

1085
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:42,265
jugular, Mrs. Nile.

1086
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:43,599
- Yes, Your Honors.

1087
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,169
I wish to waste no one's
time on this matter.

1088
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:48,271
And by doing so we
can hopefully achieve

1089
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:49,705
a decision forthwith.

1090
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,442
- In reply to the defensive
submission, Mr. Darnbury.

1091
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,212
Will you be seeking adjournment?

1092
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,548
- Yes, of course, Your Honor,
that will be necessary.

1093
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:02,018
- These shifty fucks.

1094
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,452
- Yes, William,
welcome of the world of

1095
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:05,454
getting your stripes.

1096
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:08,357
Now stick with me here,
we're almost there.

1097
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:09,558
Okay, they're going
to take you back

1098
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,027
to the prison tonight, and bring

1099
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,096
you back early in the morning.

1100
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,497
Then we're going to
hear the prosecution's

1101
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,699
argument against our submission.

1102
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:19,435
Then the judges are going
to go away and decide.

1103
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,470
This may take a few days.

1104
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:22,738
- I'm burning up, Julie.

1105
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,740
- This is the last leg
of the marathon, yeah?

1106
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,408
- Okay.

1107
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:26,609
- Okay.

1108
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,511
- See you tomorrow.

1109
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,279
- Julie?

1110
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,948
Thank you.

1111
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,159
(crickets)

1112
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,528
(television news)

1113
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,563
- Doubtful.

1114
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:51,167
Almost.

1115
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:56,372
Will?

1116
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,441
- Hey.

1117
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,977
You know how it is.

1118
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:04,380
Hey, Fung.

1119
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,648
- How was your mouthpiece?

1120
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:07,283
- Yeah, she's good.

1121
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,585
- McIntyre.

1122
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,691
- McIntyre.

1123
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:16,759
- Yes, ma'am.

1124
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,227
- You have been
cleared of any further

1125
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:20,563
inquiry into the contraband
found in your cell.

1126
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,166
Keep out of trouble.

1127
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,700
That's all.

1128
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:29,405
- Here's to staying
out of trouble.

1129
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,407
Here, Fung.

1130
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,177
- Here's to a four percent
of prison sentences being

1131
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,545
directly alcohol related.

1132
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:39,315
- If there was no alcohol
there'd be no prisoners.

1133
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,350
Cheers!

1134
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,258
- Still would have been
easier to have pleaded

1135
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,460
guilty than go through all this.

1136
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:53,129
- [Television] An armed bandit
today has pleaded guilty

1137
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,563
to his latest
- Turn it up!

1138
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:56,132
- [Television] armed
robbery in Hamilton and has

1139
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:58,467
walked free from court.

1140
01:23:58,501 --> 01:24:00,569
After presiding Judge
Hanlin took into account

1141
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:03,272
his remorse and time
already spent in prison,

1142
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:06,342
James Francis Cove,
51, now wants to walk

1143
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,211
from his life of crime.

1144
01:24:08,244 --> 01:24:11,080
He has revisited the staff
he terrorized at the bank,

1145
01:24:11,114 --> 01:24:13,749
asking for their forgiveness.

1146
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,485
Cove, who has served
jail time in every state

1147
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:20,189
in Australia culminating
26 years, is confident

1148
01:24:20,223 --> 01:24:24,560
he can turn his life around
with the help of his mother.

1149
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:27,330
- I haven't earned an honest
days living in all me life.

1150
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,498
That's not cricket.

1151
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,767
it shouldn't be that way.

1152
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,237
- Aw, it's real good
to have him home.

1153
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,705
He'll be fine.

1154
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,374
- Can you believe it George?
- [Reporter] Has he been

1155
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,442
- [Reporter] welcomed
back into the house with

1156
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:41,510
open arms?
- Yes I can, mate.

1157
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:43,779
- [Mum] Oh, yeah,
yeah, definitely.

1158
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:46,649
(alarm ringing)

1159
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,384
- [Warden] All prisoners
return to your cells

1160
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,553
Night lockdown two minutes.

1161
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,788
All prisoners
return to your cells

1162
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,857
Night lockdown two minutes.

1163
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,792
- [Julie] Scientific
evidence led by Dr. Ulas

1164
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,395
and Dr. Flogan during the
first trial which formed

1165
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,364
an important part
of the Crown case,

1166
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:03,599
now turns out to be invalid.

1167
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:06,235
Effectively as a result of
the concessions made under

1168
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:09,405
oath by both witnesses
the scientific support for

1169
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,141
the complainant's
allegations of drink spiking

1170
01:25:12,175 --> 01:25:14,810
offered in the first
trial, have now evaporated.

1171
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,513
- None of this takes away
from the fact that traces

1172
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:20,683
of morphine were
found in her urine.

1173
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:22,751
- Mr. Darnbury brings
new light to an important

1174
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,387
fact, Mrs. Nile.

1175
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,689
- Yes, I'm well aware of
this only fact the Crown's

1176
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:28,757
entire case rests upon,

1177
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,227
but as we've been told
by experts during the

1178
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,796
first trial, that any
codeine pill purchased off

1179
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:37,166
the supermarket shelf,
for let's say a hangover,

1180
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,869
when broken down to its
base form is morphine.

1181
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,172
I'm sorry Your Honor, I
think I need to take a

1182
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:44,240
bathroom break.

1183
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:45,774
- (laughing) So
what is your point.

1184
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,710
- All stand.

1185
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,480
This court is now
adjourned till, 4:44 pm.

1186
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,716
- William, it's not
looking too good.

1187
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:54,683
- You're doing great, Julie.

1188
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:56,852
We're nearly there, I
can see the finish line.

1189
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:59,255
- Topper's giving me grief.

1190
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:00,723
I'll show him tall poppy.

1191
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:03,926
- Stuff Darnbury,
you're not a tall poppy.

1192
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:05,928
- What did you just say?

1193
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,596
- I was just using
the marathon analogy

1194
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,733
- No, no you said
something, Darnbury...

1195
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:12,668
- You said a tall poppy.

1196
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:14,403
- Francis, wait right
here, if I'm not back

1197
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:16,739
in five minutes tell
him I'm the lavatory.

1198
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:19,742
Come on!

1199
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:22,378
(phone ringing)

1200
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,649
Shit!

1201
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:31,720
(phone ringing)

1202
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,856
- Bugger, forgot
to feed Mr. Chips.

1203
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:35,991
(phone ringing)

1204
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,794
- You guys go on,
I'll see you in a bit.

1205
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:42,197
(phone ringing)

1206
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:47,770
Hey, Mr. Chips.

1207
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:50,273
- Come on, Stevie,
my battery's dying!

1208
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,276
(phone ringing)

1209
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:03,719
Oh, Dad, what have I
gotten myself into?

1210
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,988
Come on, come on, come on.

1211
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:07,656
(phone ringing)

1212
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,891
Come on, come on, come on,

1213
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:10,659
- Department, Stevie Best.

1214
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:12,995
- Stevie, you're alive!

1215
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:14,597
- Jules.

1216
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,031
- Stevie I need you to
do me a favor, right now.

1217
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,000
- Sure, sure, what is it?

1218
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:22,271
- Okay, I have a morphine trace
level I need you to check.

1219
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,940
- Okay, just let me
get in the system.

1220
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,509
- Stevie, we only
have two minutes.

1221
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:27,943
- Okay, fire away.

1222
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:31,780
- Okay, the reading is
500 micro milligrams.

1223
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:33,949
- It's coming up pretty low.

1224
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:36,785
- I need you to fax
that to me right away.

1225
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:40,989
(clock ticking)

1226
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:44,560
See anything come through
the fax yet, Donna?

1227
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,929
- Must be the water
us commoners drink.

1228
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:49,532
- Indeed, I'll be taking
a filter next time.

1229
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:50,699
- No, not yet.

1230
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,835
- All stand.

1231
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:56,972
- Mrs. Nile, you were about
to respond to Mr. Darnbury's

1232
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,975
point regarding the morphine
in Ms. Tier's urine.

1233
01:28:00,543 --> 01:28:02,978
- Yes, Your Honor, I was.

1234
01:28:03,412 --> 01:28:05,914
Furthermore, to the
concessions made earlier,

1235
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:09,318
I believe significantly
damaged the Crown case during

1236
01:28:09,352 --> 01:28:12,721
the first trial
for many reasons.

1237
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:15,858
The jury was simply left
with the evidence of

1238
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:17,460
Ms. Tier's symptoms.

1239
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:21,330
- What is your point Mrs. Nile?

1240
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:32,307
(fax machine)

1241
01:28:39,582 --> 01:28:42,985
- The truth, Your Honors,

1242
01:28:43,018 --> 01:28:45,754
and anybody else
who cares to listen,

1243
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:47,055
is this.

1244
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:49,958
The reliability of the
account Ms. Tier gave during

1245
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:53,696
the first trial is not only
weakened by this report

1246
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:57,032
from Dr. Grieven, showing
sedative or stimulant drugs

1247
01:28:57,065 --> 01:29:00,769
are found in less than five
percent of reported cases

1248
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:02,070
for drink spiking.

1249
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,972
But if you care to take
a look at this drug level

1250
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:06,975
analysis report, just
sent over by our state's

1251
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:10,045
leading toxicology
laboratory, you will see that

1252
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:13,782
the levels of morphine
found in Ms. Tier's urine,

1253
01:29:13,816 --> 01:29:16,385
are equivalent to that of
someone having ingested

1254
01:29:16,419 --> 01:29:19,388
poppy seeds on a bagel.

1255
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:20,723
(laughter)

1256
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:22,157
- This can not be
entered as evidence now!

1257
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,926
- Sit down Mr. Darnbury.

1258
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:27,396
It's a fact of
pre-existing evidence.

1259
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,732
We are going to need
time to make a decision.

1260
01:29:29,765 --> 01:29:32,535
- All stand.

1261
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:44,780
- McIntyre.

1262
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:48,584
Come with me.

1263
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:12,541
They overturned your
conviction, son.

1264
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:19,882
(piano music)

1265
01:30:22,485 --> 01:30:23,652
- We won.

1266
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:25,988
- Yep. You're free to go!

1267
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,524
- Yay! (laughing)

1268
01:30:28,557 --> 01:30:29,925
Sorry, sir.

1269
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,994
- Never mind. Now, listen,
you can't tell anyone,

1270
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:33,729
not even George.

1271
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:35,931
We want to get you
out of here alive.

1272
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:39,167
We'll call by before
tomorrow morning's let out.

1273
01:30:55,618 --> 01:30:57,853
- I'm sorry.

1274
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:04,126
(piano music)

1275
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,887
- [Will] Jimmy Cove.

1276
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:44,292
- [Jimmy] Love you, ya bugger.

1277
01:32:48,697 --> 01:32:52,768
* Somewhere there's forgiving

1278
01:32:54,136 --> 01:32:57,606
* It's what I'm stronger for

1279
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:03,912
* The world had
turned against me

1280
01:33:06,181 --> 01:33:09,317
* Left me standing tall

1281
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:12,621
* There's hope in these walls

1282
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:15,323
(hawk call)

1283
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:21,630
* The first time I cried

1284
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:26,268
* My feelings can't hide

1285
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:28,937
* On the other side

1286
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,308
* The hands that I hold

1287
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:36,745
* My stories now told

1288
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:40,816
* On the other side

1289
01:33:42,818 --> 01:33:45,654
* I loved lost and found

1290
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:49,057
* It breaks down these walls

1291
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:54,963
* I begin to rise

1292
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:10,378
* Somewhere our horizons

1293
01:34:12,347 --> 01:34:16,384
* Or what we're searching for

1294
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,257
* Falling in together

1295
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:27,830
* Living day to day

1296
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,867
* To feel any more

1297
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:40,175
* I first heard this sound

1298
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:42,310
- [Will] I read a sign
once above the rear vew

1299
01:34:42,344 --> 01:34:44,713
mirror of my old school bus.

1300
01:34:44,747 --> 01:34:47,950
It said: Be kind to every
one because every one

1301
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:50,685
is fighting some sort of battle.

1302
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:54,990
* My stories untold

1303
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:59,427
* On the other side

1304
01:35:01,263 --> 01:35:03,832
* And after the fall

1305
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:07,435
* The darkness will call

1306
01:35:08,103 --> 01:35:11,473
* Til it's time to rise

1307
01:35:11,506 --> 01:35:15,744
(waves crashing)

1308
01:35:20,783 --> 01:35:25,788
(piano music)

1309
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:41,536
* Final journey now begins

1310
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:46,141
* Let your soul unfold its wings

1311
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:50,779
* Step into the light of love

1312
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:59,154
* Reach for blue
and tranquil skies

1313
01:35:59,187 --> 01:36:03,458
* Soar into a paradise

1314
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:08,496
* And touch the
face, the face of God

1315
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:14,536
* The bonds of mother earth

1316
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:19,207
* Are clearly left behind

1317
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:23,311
* Upwards keep ascending

1318
01:36:23,345 --> 01:36:28,083
* Beyond the hands of time

1319
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:35,223
* Over sunset hills that rise

1320
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:40,829
* Where the golden eagle flies

1321
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:47,202
* We will walk and meet again

1322
01:36:50,005 --> 01:36:55,010
* We know this is not the end

1323
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,514
* Love like ours will never end

1324
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:04,286
* It shall never end

1325
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:15,397
* Behold a beauty so pristine

1326
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:20,135
* Moral hearts can only dream

1327
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:24,973
* You are now where we will be

1328
01:37:29,044 --> 01:37:33,115
* And until then we'll reminisce

1329
01:37:33,148 --> 01:37:37,485
* A trail of memories we'll kiss

1330
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:42,524
* And those you love
you must set free

1331
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:48,263
* The bonds of mother earth

1332
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:52,600
* Are clearly left behind

1333
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:56,538
* Upwards keep ascending

1334
01:37:57,405 --> 01:38:02,410
* Beyond the hands of time

1335
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:09,084
* Over sunset hills that rise

1336
01:38:09,351 --> 01:38:14,356
* Where the golden eagle flies

1337
01:38:16,091 --> 01:38:21,096
* We will walk and meet again

1338
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:28,603
* We know this is not the end

1339
01:38:30,572 --> 01:38:33,308
* Love like ours will never end

1340
01:38:33,341 --> 01:38:37,645
* It shall never end

1341
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,084
* Love like ours will never end

1342
01:38:42,117 --> 01:38:46,254
* It shall never end

1343
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:53,395
* Over sunset hills

1344
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:59,267
* Over sunset hills

1345
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:06,941
* Sunset hills

1346
01:39:16,518 --> 01:39:21,523
(piano music)

1347
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:27,689
(heavy metal music)

1348
01:40:51,746 --> 01:40:55,350
* We gotta walk this battlefield

1349
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:58,553
* The underdog he won't
break he won't bend

1350
01:40:58,586 --> 01:41:00,622
* Don't need no rules

1351
01:41:00,655 --> 01:41:03,425
* No referee

1352
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:06,594
* There's no surrender
and no territory

1353
01:41:06,628 --> 01:41:08,463
* We rise

1354
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:12,734
* We rise

1355
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:15,503
* No referee

1356
01:41:15,537 --> 01:41:17,205
* We rise

1357
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:21,109
* We rise

1358
01:41:23,245 --> 01:41:25,480
* Rise

1359
01:41:27,782 --> 01:41:31,453
* The battle lines
have been drawn

1360
01:41:31,486 --> 01:41:34,889
* Why's the man the
prisoner of the man

1361
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:39,594
* A heavy hand a broken back

1362
01:41:39,627 --> 01:41:42,797
* The dogs of war
are ready for attack

1363
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,666
* We rise

1364
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,836
* We rise

1365
01:41:49,237 --> 01:41:50,772
* A prisoner of man

1366
01:41:50,805 --> 01:41:52,707
* We rise

1367
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,844
* We rise

1368
01:41:57,312 --> 01:41:59,314
* Ready for attack

1369
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:01,249
* Rise

1370
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:04,852
* Rise

1371
01:42:35,217 --> 01:42:36,884
* We rise

1372
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:40,688
* We rise

1373
01:42:42,757 --> 01:42:44,459
* We rise

1374
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:49,431
* Rise
