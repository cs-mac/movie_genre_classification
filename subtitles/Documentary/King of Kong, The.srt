1
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,213
Move along.

2
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,026
Oh!

3
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,988
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

4
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,284
It's hysterical, Manny.

5
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,756
As long as we're laughing...

6
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,258
we won't cry
over the box office.

7
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,919
Talk about depressing.

8
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,522
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around
like circus ponies.

9
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,123
That's depressing.

10
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,533
I love a good chorus line.

11
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,132
What's this?
It's a play.

12
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,698
Who wrote it, Annie?

13
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,573
Some guy. Driscoll.

14
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,273
Driscoll.

15
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,211
From the Federal Theatre.

16
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,648
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got
an audience.

17
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,254
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

18
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,483
It always does.

19
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,486
See you tomorrow.

20
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,658
The trick is to
start to build right from
the back of your throat.

21
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,359
Works well
out through the nose, too.

22
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,234
Have you eaten today?

23
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,499
Oh...

24
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,871
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

25
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,136
Hey.

26
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,174
You're all I've got.

27
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,878
Come on, take me to dinner.

28
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,878
Okay.

29
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,086
You think the kitchen
will still be open
on Third?

30
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,688
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.

31
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,692
Harry, what's going on?

32
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,233
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

33
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,866
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck
in two weeks.

34
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,603
How we gonna eat?

35
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,802
They're not getting away
with this!
They just did.

36
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,314
Ann, it's no use.

37
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,313
The show, it's over.
It's done.

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,382
I'm done.

39
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,552
I'm leaving, Annie.

40
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,319
I'm going back to Chicago.

41
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,788
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,526
I'm sorry, Annie.

43
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,939
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

44
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,905
You gotta
think of yourself now.

45
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,771
You should try out
for that part.

46
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,848
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

47
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,818
Every time you reach out
for something
you care about...

48
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,619
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

49
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,283
But not this time, Annie.

50
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,385
Not this time.

51
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,667
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

52
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,805
Look, miss,
I told you already,
call my office.

53
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,807
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.

54
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,935
Now, why would I want to
do that when we can
talk about it in person?

55
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,639
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

56
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,182
But I already
sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

57
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,275
What can I say? Jack
Driscoll's very particular
about who he works with.

58
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,014
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

59
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,282
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?

60
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,914
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

61
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,959
Well, that's too bad,
'cause we just gave the part
to someone else.

62
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,427
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

63
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,194
I know times are tough.

64
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,260
You want my advice?

65
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,665
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

66
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,369
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

67
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,070
There's a new place.
It just opened.

68
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,281
Now listen, princess,
this gig ain't the Palace,
you understand?

69
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,051
Just play the date,
take the money...

71
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
forget you was ever there.

72
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,096
How much more is there?

73
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,361
Another five reels.

74
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,065
Lights up.

75
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,341
This is it?

76
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,242
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

77
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,941
Another one of your
safari pictures?

78
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,110
You promised us romantic
scenes with Bruce Baxter
and Maureen McKenzie!

79
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,881
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

80
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,546
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

81
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,180
so she could
get her teeth fixed.

82
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,090
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

83
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,720
Carl,
you've been in production
for over two months.

84
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,458
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up
the screen...

85
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,432
once we get them on the ship.

86
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,533
What ship?

87
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,431
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

88
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,306
What location? Carl!
You're supposed to be
shooting on the back lot.

89
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes, I understand that.

90
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,344
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

91
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,676
and I'll tell you why.

92
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,581
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

93
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,778
Life intervened.

94
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,246
I've come into possession
of a map.

95
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,688
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

96
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,888
A place that was
thought to exist
only in myth.

97
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,222
Until now.

98
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,324
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

99
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,732
Is he asking for more money?

100
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,397
He's asking us
to fund a wild-goose chase.

101
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,932
I'm talking about
a primitive world
never before seen by man.

102
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,103
The ruins
of an entire civilization.

103
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,283
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

104
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,810
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

105
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,189
Will there be boobies?

106
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,655
Boobies?

107
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,825
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

108
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,694
In my experience,
people only go
to these films...

109
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,135
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

110
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,772
What are you, an idiot?

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,037
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time
on nudie shots?

112
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,739
No! They respected
the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

113
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,271
Not that you'd know
what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

114
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,048
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

115
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,293
Zelman and Associates.

116
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,534
Give me that, quick.

117
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,232
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

118
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,440
Preston, you have
a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.

119
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,977
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

120
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,988
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

121
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,354
He's had a lot of
near-success.

122
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
He's a preening self-promoter.

123
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,226
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser"
written all over him.

124
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,787
I understand
your disappointment...

125
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,992
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

126
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,866
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

127
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,367
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

128
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,272
The animal footage has value.

129
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,777
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

130
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,245
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

131
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,679
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

132
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,180
Get him back in.

133
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,815
Mr. Denham.

134
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,026
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

135
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

136
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
Tell them the studio
pressured us into
an early departure.

137
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,559
It's not ethical!
What are they gonna do,
sue me?

138
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,729
They can get in line.

139
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,237
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

140
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,742
You realize that none of
the camera equipment
is on board?

141
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
We have no permits,
no visas.

142
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,306
That's why I have you,
Preston.

143
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,474
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

144
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,483
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

145
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,540
He's there.

146
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,450
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay
for the ship?

147
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,613
Get in.

148
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,088
You get out of there!
Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

149
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,222
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

150
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,434
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice
at this.

151
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,067
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

152
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,502
Red Label, 80% proof...

153
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,409
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

154
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,538
You got it.

155
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
Tell Maureen
she doesn't have six hours
to put on her face.

156
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,349
If she wants to be
in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

157
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,048
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

158
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,817
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

159
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,986
Yesterday. I told you.

160
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,694
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

161
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,755
That's what you told her.

162
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,827
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

163
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,203
God damn it, Preston,
all you had to do was
look her in the eye and lie.

164
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,999
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

165
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,510
She's unavailable.

166
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

167
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,774
You'll never get her
into a size four.

168
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,411
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into
Maureen's costumes.

169
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,983
Fay's a size four.

170
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,549
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

171
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,628
Cooper, huh?

172
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,161
I might have known.

173
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,936
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

174
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,471
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

175
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,972
Not an option.
Carl.

176
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,508
I said I'd find a girl.

177
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,840
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

178
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,744
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

179
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,675
Defeat is always momentary.

180
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,711
What?

181
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,306
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

182
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,910
Excuse me.

183
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.

184
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,688
Vaudeville, huh?

185
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,788
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

186
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,663
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

187
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,201
Mr. Denham...

188
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,226
I want you to know...

189
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,102
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity
from strangers.

190
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,039
Or, for that matter...

191
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,667
taking things
that don't belong to me.

192
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,645
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

193
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,682
It's just that
I haven't been paid
in a while.

194
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,150
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

195
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,623
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

196
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,186
No, no. Oh, God, no.

197
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,789
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

198
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,959
I'm not that type
of person at all.

199
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,730
What type of person are you?

200
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
I'm someone
you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

201
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,901
Believe me, I am on
the level. No funny business.
Please sit down.

202
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,543
Please. Please.

203
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,542
Okay.

204
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,078
Ann, I want you to imagine...

205
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,817
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

206
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,189
You're filming
in the Far East?

207
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,758
Singapore.

208
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

209
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,495
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

210
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,267
And she can't
escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control...

211
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,243
are compelling her
down a road from which
she cannot draw back.

212
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,504
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude
to this moment...

213
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,253
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

214
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

215
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650
She falls in love.

216
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,420
Yes.

217
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,554
But she doesn't trust it.

218
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

219
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,160
Uh...

220
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,431
really?

221
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,971
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

222
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,440
Why is that?

223
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,434
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

224
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,517
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

225
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,112
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under
some time pressure.

226
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,624
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

227
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,023
you're perfect. Look at you.

228
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,085
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

229
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,258
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna
break their hearts.

230
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,626
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

231
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,297
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

232
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,933
Good luck with your picture.

233
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,340
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

234
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,813
I'm offering you money.

235
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,545
Adventure, fame,
the thrill of a lifetime,
and a long sea voyage.

236
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,711
You want to read a script?

237
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,847
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

238
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
Jack Driscoll?

239
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,624
Sure. Why?

240
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,686
Wait. You know him?

241
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,325
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

242
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,403
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

243
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,496
Jack Driscoll does not
want just anyone
starring in this picture.

244
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
He said to me, "Carl...

245
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,375
"somewhere out there
is a woman
born to play this role."

246
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,845
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

247
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,481
Knew what?

248
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,750
It was always
going to be you.

249
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

250
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,928
Keep the change.

251
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,772
Is this
the moving picture ship?

252
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
Not exactly.

253
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,278
It's actually
this one over here.

254
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,954
Don't let appearances
deceive you. It's much more
spacious on board.

255
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,890
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

256
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,056
This is all of it?
Yeah.

257
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,724
We're taking
the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

258
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,496
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

259
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,128
Carl!
Yes!

260
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

261
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,368
It's bad, it's bad.

262
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,345
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

263
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
Who?
Men in uniform.

264
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,709
The studio called the cops.

265
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,212
Englehorn! Cast off!

266
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,189
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

267
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

268
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,054
I cannot do that.

269
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
We are waiting
on the manifest.

270
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,932
What? Who? English, please.

271
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,065
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

272
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,765
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

273
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,273
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

274
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,506
Can we talk about this later?

275
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,410
Can't you see
we're in the company
of a VIP guest?

276
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,516
Ma'am.

277
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,786
Ann Darrow.

278
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,949
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

279
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,319
Sure.

280
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,458
Nervous?

281
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,001
Nervous? No.

282
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,303
Why? Should I be?

283
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,470
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

284
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,546
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

285
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,415
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

286
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,919
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

287
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,314
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

288
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,427
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

289
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,759
Do I have a choice?

290
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,332
Please follow me.

291
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,665
If there's anything
that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

292
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,638
If there's anything
that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

293
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,491
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

294
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,964
Listen. If anyone comes
to the door, don't open it.
You haven't seen me.

295
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,624
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

296
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,897
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

297
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,897
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

298
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,000
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

299
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,243
What's this?
It's the script.

300
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,010
This is a script?

301
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,883
Jack, this is 15 pages.

302
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,582
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages
there, Carl.

303
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

304
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,126
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

305
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,220
No, Jack, you can't
do this to me.
I have a beginning...

306
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,891
but I need a middle
and an end. I gotta have
something to shoot.

307
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,163
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

308
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,132
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

309
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,010
You're gonna pay me?

310
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,013
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

311
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,015
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

312
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,917
How's $2,000 sound?

313
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,023
Sounds great.

314
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,820
I thought it might.

315
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,418
Sounds great.
Okay.

316
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,294
Raise the spring line!

317
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,957
Watch the aft!

318
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,101
And voilà.

319
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,972
Thanks.

320
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,841
You've written "two grand."

321
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,682
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from
the beginning.

322
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,457
"Two thousand dollars."

323
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,028
It is the 29th, isn't it?

324
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,900
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

325
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,502
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

326
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,735
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me
when you get back.

327
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,175
All right.

328
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,651
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

329
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,222
And may I just say how
excited we are to have you
back with us, sir?

330
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,095
Be a sport
and lend a hand here,
would you?

331
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,635
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

332
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,433
Christ!

333
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,141
Appreciate the help, fellow.

334
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
Let me get the door for you.

335
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,604
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

336
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,213
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.

337
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,223
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.

338
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,566
Oh, Christ!

339
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,376
God damn it!

340
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,223
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

341
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,750
Oh, no! No!

342
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,994
You're much better off
sticking with film.

343
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,666
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

344
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,264
I happen to love the theater.

345
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,195
No, you don't.

346
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,466
If you really loved it...

347
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,503
you would have jumped.

348
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,183
You! This is your fault!

349
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,762
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light,
fresh straw.

350
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,861
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?

351
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,270
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.

352
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,037
You sell them to zoos?

353
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,701
Zoo, circus.

354
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,606
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

355
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.

356
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,712
Stain unremovable.

357
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,323
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

358
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,291
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

359
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,452
Choy.

360
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,130
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

361
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,998
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

362
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,535
Spoiled for choice.

363
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,336
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

364
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,138
Or a chimpanzee?

365
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,240
I'll take this one.

366
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,855
I told you to lock it up.

367
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,456
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't
give the orders!

368
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,593
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

369
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,703
Get them out of here.

370
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,711
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.

371
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,109
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

372
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,019
Lamb's brains
in walnut sauce.

373
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,855
Jimmy.

374
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,031
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

375
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,089
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

376
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,302
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

377
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,977
He don't mean no harm.

378
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,971
Thanks.

379
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,812
I'll keep him
out of your way.
It's okay.

380
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,409
It's just that
he likes it down here.

381
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,081
It's where I found him
four years ago.

382
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,017
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

383
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,728
His arm was broken
in two places.

384
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,798
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.

385
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,295
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

386
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
But it wasn't anyplace good.

387
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,267
You got to straighten up.

388
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,705
Jimmy.

389
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,506
You don't want to
be on this ship
the rest of your life.

390
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,950
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.

391
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,519
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

392
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,523
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

393
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,718
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

394
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,350
I've been reading.

395
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,992
Where'd you get this?

396
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,322
I borrowed it.

397
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,771
On long-term loan.

398
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,706
Look at this. Look, look.

399
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,040
"Adventures on
a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

400
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,746
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.

401
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,322
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

402
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,458
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

403
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,499
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

404
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,796
I'm a huge fan.

405
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,804
I've read everything
you've ever written.

406
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,339
No, too much.

407
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,306
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

408
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,376
Seagulls.

409
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,541
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

410
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,776
I don't care, Mike.

411
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,251
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

412
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,520
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you
to the crew.

413
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,786
This is Herb, the cameraman.

414
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,056
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

415
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,291
May I say
what a lovely dress?

416
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,266
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

417
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,294
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

418
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,403
Now, what does a girl
have to do around here
to get some breakfast?

419
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,501
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

420
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,036
Fancy my porridge
à la walnuts?

421
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,780
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...

422
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,248
Ann?

423
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,888
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

424
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,796
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honor to be
a part of this.

425
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,437
Gee, thanks.

426
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,941
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

427
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,571
Really?

428
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,438
Yes,
and what I most admire...

429
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,144
is the way
you've captured the voice
of the common people.

430
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,183
Well, that's my job.

431
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,423
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

432
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,960
if you don't mind me
saying...

433
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,088
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

434
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,931
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

435
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,803
He's so much
younger in person.
And much better-looking.

436
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,501
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

437
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,737
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

438
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,610
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

439
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,514
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

440
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,314
the tweedy twerp
with his nose in his book
and his head up his a...

441
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,220
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

442
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,506
Good Christ!

443
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,970
She's standing
at the railing.

444
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,561
She doesn't know it yet...

445
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,299
but they are sailing
towards disaster.
You got that?

446
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,206
Okay, so she turns...

447
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,413
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

448
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,344
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

449
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,354
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

450
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,085
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

451
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,991
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

452
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,621
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened
to anyone.

453
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,289
I was joking, Carl.

454
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,665
The point is,
she's horrified.
She has to look away.

455
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,499
And that's when she sees it.

456
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,041
Sees what?

457
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,404
What?

458
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,317
The island.

459
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,427
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

460
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,596
Jack, keep your voice down.

461
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,659
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

462
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,261
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

463
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,363
All right.
It has a local name...

464
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,965
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

465
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,739
They call it Skull Island.

466
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,540
Did you get that?

467
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,679
What's wrong
with this place?

468
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,479
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

469
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,053
Because, technically,
it hasn't been
discovered yet.

470
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,426
Okay. All right.

471
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,892
So we arrive at this place.

472
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,692
S...

473
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,528
K...

474
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,934
U...

475
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,132
L...

476
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,903
L...

477
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,746
Island.

478
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,114
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

479
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,354
I think this is
awfully exciting! I've never
been on a ship before.

480
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

481
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,556
I guess you don't think
much of women
on ships, do you?

482
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,596
No, they're a nuisance.

483
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,333
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

484
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,673
Cut!

485
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
It's great.

486
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,517
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

487
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,491
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

488
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,118
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some
flow now, huh?

489
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,027
It was pure effluence.

490
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,861
I beefed up the banter.

491
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,060
Try to resist that impulse.

492
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,364
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

493
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,906
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

494
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,168
Actors.

495
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,608
Travel the world,
but all they ever see
is a mirror.

496
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,423
Good legs.

497
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,689
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

498
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,291
Yeah.

499
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,997
Not that you don't
have good legs.
Just making conversation.

500
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,370
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

501
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,867
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

502
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,776
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

503
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,874
but Mr. Baxter
felt very strongly that
when a man likes a woman...

504
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
he must ignore her.

505
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,120
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

506
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,184
No?

507
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,987
Interesting theory.

508
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,719
I know. I should have...

509
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...

510
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,689
I'm sorry. I was...

511
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,758
And you made it your own.

512
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,226
I was nervous.

513
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

514
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,306
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

515
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,776
Miss Darrow.

516
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,613
You don't have to be nervous.

517
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,488
Thank you.

518
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,020
Let's take it...

519
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,426
Would you please...
We're trying to
shoot a scene.

520
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,124
Okay.
Thank you.

521
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,658
Okay, again.

522
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
We're close. Turn southwest.

523
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

524
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,514
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

525
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

526
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,358
I'll make it
worth your while.

527
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,690
There's nothing out there.

528
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,835
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

529
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,841
If someone were to tell you
this ship was headed
for Singapore...

530
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,050
what would you say?

531
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,920
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

532
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

533
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,292
Gentlemen, please.

534
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,225
We're not looking
for trouble.
No.

535
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,971
You're looking
for something else.

536
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,742
Yes, we are.

537
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,779
We're going to find
Skull Island.

538
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,216
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

539
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,986
For 25 cents,
you get to see the last
blank space on the map.

540
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,586
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

541
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,522
What do you mean?

542
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
Seven years ago,
me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

543
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,491
on a Norwegian bark.

544
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

545
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,503
He'd been drifting for days.

546
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,974
His ship had run aground
on an island
way west of Sumatra.

547
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,502
An island hidden in fog.

548
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,546
He spoke of a huge wall...

549
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,582
built so long ago...

550
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
no one knew who'd made it.

551
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,258
A wall 100 foot high...

552
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,360
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

553
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,122
Why'd they build the wall?

554
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

555
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,768
neither beast nor man...

556
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,543
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

557
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,942
A lion or a tiger.

558
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,216
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

559
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
What else did he say?

560
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,548
Nothing.

561
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,387
We found him
the next morning. He'd stuck
a knife through his heart.

562
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,722
Mmm-hmm.

563
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,954
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do
better than that.

564
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,463
Monsters belong in B movies.

565
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,559
If you find this place...

566
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,506
if you go ashore
with your friends
and your cameras...

567
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,370
you won't come back.

568
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,869
Just as long as
you understand that.

569
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,593
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

570
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,432
You're writing a stage comedy?

571
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,471
I'm writing it for you.

572
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,506
Why would you do that?

573
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
Why would I write
a play for you?
Yes.

574
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,576
Isn't it obvious?

575
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,651
Not to me.

576
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,686
Well...

577
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,025
it's in the subtext.

578
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,995
I guess
I must have missed it.

579
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,903
It's not about words.

580
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,042
Message for you, Captain.

581
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,065
What's going on?

582
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,673
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

583
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,509
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

584
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,179
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

585
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,148
Did you know that?

586
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,220
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

587
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,697
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

588
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

589
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,104
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

590
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,273
What do you want?

591
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,610
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

592
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,615
I want you off my ship.

593
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,677
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

594
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,762
I'm finished.

595
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,096
It's over for me, Jack.

596
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,326
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

597
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,489
Check our position.
Use the stars.

598
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,264
There are no stars, Captain.

599
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,107
What is that?

600
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,171
What?
That.

601
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,812
That right there.

602
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,617
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

603
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,788
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth
by lead line.

604
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,559
Aye, Captain.

605
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,998
30 fathoms, no bottom!

606
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,811
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

607
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,444
Dead slow ahead, both.

608
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,475
You should stop the ship.

609
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,651
15 degrees port.

610
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,254
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

611
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,454
We'll find clear conditions.

612
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,654
We have seabed!

613
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,894
25 fathoms!

614
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,241
We're shallowing!

615
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,674
20 degrees starboard!

616
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

617
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,506
Get me another reading!

618
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,342
Another reading!

619
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,617
22 fathoms!

620
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,217
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

621
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,638
10 fathoms!

622
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,016
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

623
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,762
Stop engines!

624
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,867
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

625
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,031
Half astern both, Captain!

626
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,805
Rocks!

627
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,076
Rocks!

628
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,816
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

629
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,690
To port! Rocks everywhere!

630
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,452
Take the wheel, Hayes.

631
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
Hang on!

632
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,668
Full ahead!

633
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,377
Rocks to port, Captain!

634
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,111
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

635
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,831
Ah!

636
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,129
Shore up that breach!

637
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,470
Get me more men
down here now!
Come on, move, move!

638
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,809
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

639
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,515
What about the prop?

640
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,778
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

641
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,082
But she struck hard
against the rock!

642
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,317
Captain!

643
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,754
Better come up quick!

644
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,027
Right there!

645
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,937
Want me to bring them back?

646
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,275
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

647
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,840
I want this ship fixed
and ready to float
on the next high tide!

648
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,546
Come on, move it.

649
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,712
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

650
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,224
Can you believe this, Jack?

651
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,401
We've got our picture.

652
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,725
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

653
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
Why doesn't he turn back?

654
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,370
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

655
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,871
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

656
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,773
But there's another part...

657
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,645
that needs to know.

658
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,721
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

659
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,892
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

660
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,958
<i>"and could not remember...</i>

661
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,559
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...</i>

662
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,701
<i>"of those ages
that are gone...</i>

663
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,602
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.</i>

664
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,706
<i>"We are accustomed to look...</i>

665
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...</i>

666
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
<i>"but there...</i>

667
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:29,054
<i>"there you could look
at a thing
monstrous and free."</i>

668
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,299
It's not
an adventure story...

669
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,498
is it, Mr. Hayes?

670
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,839
No, Jimmy.

671
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,343
It's not.

672
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,235
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

673
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,740
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

674
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,973
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

675
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,343
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

676
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,150
I will handle this.

677
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,222
Look. Chocolate.

678
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,194
You like chocolate?

679
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,630
It's good to eat.

680
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,235
You want?

681
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,475
Take it.

682
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,589
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

683
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,098
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

684
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,465
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

685
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,666
Aah!

686
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,059
All right!

687
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,920
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

688
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,361
They're harmless!

689
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,175
Ann!

690
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,764
Jack.

691
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,386
Seen enough?

692
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,891
Lighten the ship!

693
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,062
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

694
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,895
Just heave it!

695
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,668
We got away.

696
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,471
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

697
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,309
What about Mike?
He didn't get away!
He's still there!

698
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,313
Mike died doing
what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

699
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,445
And I'll tell you
something else. I'm gonna
finish this film for Mike!

700
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,522
I'll finish it...

701
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,730
and I'll donate
the proceeds...

702
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
to his wife and kids.

703
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,231
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

704
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,440
Hear, hear!

705
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,348
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

706
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,722
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

707
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,592
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

708
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,241
Drop those
spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

709
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,821
Where's Ann?
What?

710
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,056
Where's Ann?

711
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,425
Ann!

712
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,554
She's free!

713
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,492
Full ahead, both engines!

714
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,207
Ann!

715
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,699
No! Stop! Turn back!

716
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Stop!

717
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,969
We have to turn back.

718
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,835
They've taken Ann.

719
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,340
No!

720
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,349
Kong! Kong! Kong!

721
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:48,435
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

722
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,173
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

723
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,574
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

724
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,650
Come on, move it!

725
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,333
Pull harder!

726
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,575
Row! Row!

727
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,972
Come on!

728
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,918
Kong.

729
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,099
Spread out! Find her!

730
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,278
Miss Darrow!

731
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,279
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

732
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,745
Ann!

733
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,653
She's here somewhere!

734
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,195
What in God's name was that?

735
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,164
Behind the wall!

736
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,499
Behind the wall!

737
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,526
She's gone!

738
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,269
Carl, what is it?

739
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,576
You saw something.

740
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,555
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

741
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,024
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

742
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,588
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

743
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,791
Choy!

744
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,127
Not you, Jimmy.

745
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,364
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

746
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,202
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

747
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,605
Stay here.

748
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,578
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!

749
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,816
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

750
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,320
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

751
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,189
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

752
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,132
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

753
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,398
And you got 24 hours!

754
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,303
24 hours?

755
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,699
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

756
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,688
Miss Darrow!

757
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,193
Ann!

758
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,004
Miss Darrow!

759
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:14,644
Miss Darrow!

760
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,361
What is it?

761
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,172
Fire!

762
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,514
Cut it out.

763
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,243
Hold your fire.

764
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,011
Hold your fire!

765
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,019
Stay down, damn it.
Stay down.

766
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:44,900
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

767
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,496
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

768
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,045
Aren't these things supposed
to be extinct?

769
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,614
They are now.

770
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,949
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

771
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:51,904
Miss Darrow!

772
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,670
Ann!

773
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,210
No!

774
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,135
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

775
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,809
Ann!

776
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,253
Ann!

777
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,666
Christ,
it's a bleeding boneyard!

778
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,538
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

779
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,808
Ann! Ann!

780
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,320
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

781
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,383
Jesus, Jimmy.
Hey, I need that!

782
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,689
I'm not giving you a gun!

783
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,787
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

784
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,425
I was in the Army.
I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

785
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,030
I wanna help bring her back.

786
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,847
Don't make me regret it.

787
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:49,163
Conserve your ammunition!

788
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:00,007
I'm knackered.

789
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:04,380
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

790
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:05,923
Fellows, we don't have
time for this.

791
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,459
We've lost too much ground
already. Come on, get up!

792
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:11,963
They're not about to
quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

793
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:14,429
All right,
you got five minutes!

794
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,600
Everybody stay in sight.

795
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:24,042
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

796
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:55,638
Bloody Nora!

797
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:05,011
Is that
what took Miss Darrow?

798
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:12,717
There's only one creature
capable of leaving
a footprint that size.

799
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:21,064
The abominable snowman.

800
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:25,364
Yeah, a snowman.
We dead meat.

801
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,471
It's got to be what,
20, 25 feet?

802
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,009
Carl saw it.

803
01:22:33,412 --> 01:22:34,902
Let's ask him.

804
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:38,209
Denham!

805
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,048
Where'd he go?

806
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,037
Walk forward, Bruce.

807
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,373
What?
You're the star
of this picture.

808
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,505
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

809
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:18,248
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

810
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:30,799
Are you sure about this,
Denham?

811
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,362
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

812
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,373
I need you in the shot,
or people will say
they're fake.

813
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,636
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

814
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:49,310
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

815
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,685
I'm not moving.

816
01:23:56,461 --> 01:23:58,793
Mother of God.

817
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:22,117
What's this?

818
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:49,813
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

819
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:52,679
Carl?
He's up there, filming.

820
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:04,527
Bugger this!

821
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:06,627
Watch out.

822
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:13,734
Run, Jack!

823
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,066
Holy Christ.
Go, Jimmy, run!

824
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:21,468
Run, run, run!

825
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:29,945
Let go!
I'm not leaving the camera!

826
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,318
Let go, you idiot!

827
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:33,220
Carl, run!

828
01:25:46,671 --> 01:25:47,933
Look out!

829
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:49,798
Look out!

830
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,649
Coming through!

831
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:46,981
No!

832
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:48,921
Come on.

833
01:28:30,068 --> 01:28:32,798
Carl! Carl!

834
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:38,499
Get up! Come on. Come on.

835
01:28:53,325 --> 01:28:55,987
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

836
01:28:56,695 --> 01:28:59,289
Herb! Herb, come on!

837
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:01,093
Take the tripod!

838
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,561
Come on!

839
01:29:03,768 --> 01:29:06,328
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

840
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:07,428
Go!

841
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:09,200
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

842
01:29:09,874 --> 01:29:12,536
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

843
01:30:20,278 --> 01:30:22,007
Jimmy, do a head count.

844
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,605
I want to know how many
are injured and how bad.

845
01:30:24,682 --> 01:30:25,944
Injured?

846
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,115
Four of us are dead!

847
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:37,590
It's not your fault.

848
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:40,725
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

849
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,599
You're absolutely right,
Preston.

850
01:30:44,002 --> 01:30:46,402
And I'll tell you
something else.

851
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:48,769
Herbert didn't die
for nothing.

852
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:51,972
He died for
what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

853
01:30:52,043 --> 01:30:56,104
He died believing
there was still some mystery
left in this world.

854
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:59,175
And we could all
have a piece of it...

855
01:30:59,384 --> 01:31:01,909
for the price
of an admission ticket.

856
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:05,850
God damn it, Preston,
we're gonna finish this film
for Herb.

857
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:07,918
We'll finish it...

858
01:31:08,026 --> 01:31:10,927
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

859
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:20,433
Come on, guys.
We need more rope.

860
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:24,364
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

861
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:28,139
Englehorn sails
in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

862
01:31:28,213 --> 01:31:30,841
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be
stranded here.

863
01:31:32,684 --> 01:31:36,085
Miss Darrow was a great gal,
no question.

864
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,283
And she was
a wonderful person.

865
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:41,587
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

866
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:45,795
I always knew you were
nothing like the tough guy
you play on screen.

867
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:47,593
I just never figured you
for a coward.

868
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:49,792
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

869
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,803
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

870
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:56,432
In the real world,
they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

871
01:31:56,508 --> 01:32:00,035
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

872
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,969
Be seeing you.

873
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:05,580
Anyone else?

874
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:09,086
Well, see you.
Come on.

875
01:37:05,783 --> 01:37:06,977
No!

876
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,118
I said no!

877
01:37:16,594 --> 01:37:20,155
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

878
01:39:42,573 --> 01:39:45,371
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

879
01:39:47,678 --> 01:39:49,202
Keep paddling.

880
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:28,017
What the hell was that?

881
01:41:09,226 --> 01:41:11,592
Come on.
Get them out of there!

882
01:41:13,397 --> 01:41:14,728
Preston!

883
01:41:19,904 --> 01:41:21,531
Give me your hand.

884
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:23,165
Jack!

885
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:29,943
Jack!

886
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,016
Choy!
Help!

887
01:41:36,187 --> 01:41:38,178
Swim, you filthy bugger.

888
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,781
Choy!

889
01:42:50,694 --> 01:42:51,718
Stay with him.

890
01:42:51,796 --> 01:42:53,229
Swim to shore
as fast as you can!

891
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:54,525
Hold on. Preston!

892
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,326
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

893
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,460
Don't let go
of the camera!

894
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:09,075
Come on,
get up out of that water.

895
01:43:10,014 --> 01:43:11,242
Get up!

896
01:43:51,169 --> 01:43:52,659
Come on, come on.

897
01:44:04,916 --> 01:44:06,884
Preston. Preston.

898
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,120
It's working.

899
01:44:38,083 --> 01:44:40,142
Did you get that, did you?

900
01:45:40,478 --> 01:45:41,843
No!

901
01:45:42,581 --> 01:45:43,605
No.

902
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:49,143
No.

903
01:46:39,671 --> 01:46:40,797
What is it?

904
01:46:45,577 --> 01:46:46,874
Mr. Hayes?

905
01:46:50,448 --> 01:46:53,042
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

906
01:46:53,551 --> 01:46:54,813
You understand?

907
01:46:55,387 --> 01:46:58,356
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

908
01:46:59,891 --> 01:47:01,859
It's not about
being brave, Jimmy.

909
01:47:30,488 --> 01:47:31,512
Go back!

910
01:47:33,558 --> 01:47:34,957
Back across the log!

911
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,720
I ain't gonna run!
Get Jimmy out of here!

912
01:47:37,963 --> 01:47:39,260
No!
Get back! Get back!

913
01:47:44,169 --> 01:47:45,500
Move back!

914
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,714
No! No!
Stay back.

915
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:04,479
No!

916
01:48:09,761 --> 01:48:11,058
Look at me.

917
01:48:13,298 --> 01:48:15,858
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.

918
01:48:20,038 --> 01:48:21,403
Do as I say.

919
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:24,140
Go with Jack.

920
01:48:26,578 --> 01:48:27,636
Run!

921
01:48:31,182 --> 01:48:33,616
No!
Shoot him!

922
01:48:35,153 --> 01:48:36,142
No!

923
01:48:51,202 --> 01:48:54,000
Here! Over here!

924
01:49:12,123 --> 01:49:14,091
Hold on! Hold on!

925
01:49:18,196 --> 01:49:20,460
Lumpy! Help me!

926
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:24,099
Bloody hell, Choy!

927
01:54:45,757 --> 01:54:46,815
No!

928
01:54:50,995 --> 01:54:52,189
Oh, my!

929
02:01:27,658 --> 02:01:28,955
Wait!

930
02:02:18,475 --> 02:02:19,601
Carl.

931
02:02:24,682 --> 02:02:26,274
Jimmy. Jimmy.

932
02:02:27,151 --> 02:02:28,140
Jimmy.

933
02:02:29,253 --> 02:02:30,413
You all right?

934
02:03:20,371 --> 02:03:21,633
No.

935
02:04:14,124 --> 02:04:16,149
Get off! Get it off!

936
02:04:23,467 --> 02:04:24,491
Get off!

937
02:04:38,382 --> 02:04:39,474
Get it off!

938
02:04:39,850 --> 02:04:41,044
Get it off! Get it off!

939
02:05:45,416 --> 02:05:46,542
Kill it!

940
02:05:58,629 --> 02:06:00,028
Stop moving!

941
02:06:20,084 --> 02:06:21,813
Get it off my face!

942
02:06:22,786 --> 02:06:25,186
Stay still.
I am standing still.

943
02:06:27,691 --> 02:06:29,488
Hold on.
Be careful!

944
02:07:04,328 --> 02:07:06,956
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

945
02:07:07,631 --> 02:07:09,155
Coming through!

946
02:07:17,608 --> 02:07:20,202
Get out of there now! Climb!

947
02:07:27,284 --> 02:07:29,081
Nobody get in my way.

948
02:07:32,189 --> 02:07:33,986
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

949
02:07:34,057 --> 02:07:36,548
Get up the rope.
Let's go. Hurry up.

950
02:08:03,053 --> 02:08:05,317
Jimmy, let's go.

951
02:08:09,593 --> 02:08:11,220
Come on.
Okay.

952
02:08:14,865 --> 02:08:15,854
Go.

953
02:08:20,571 --> 02:08:22,801
Just as you go down...

954
02:08:23,507 --> 02:08:25,975
for the third
and final time...

955
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:29,811
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

956
02:08:30,447 --> 02:08:32,677
and your lungs fill
with water...

957
02:08:33,283 --> 02:08:37,481
do you know what happens
in those last precious seconds
before you drown?

958
02:08:37,654 --> 02:08:40,521
Come on, buddy.
Get up the rope. Come on.
Get out of here. Come on.

959
02:08:40,591 --> 02:08:43,287
Your whole life passes
before your eyes.

960
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:45,828
And if you've lived
as a true American...

961
02:08:46,096 --> 02:08:48,496
you get to watch it all
in color.

962
02:08:49,333 --> 02:08:50,925
Oh, and you will.

963
02:08:51,001 --> 02:08:53,526
Now, why don't you climb
up the rope, huh? Come on.

964
02:08:59,009 --> 02:09:01,136
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

965
02:11:55,819 --> 02:11:57,343
It's beautiful.

966
02:12:18,809 --> 02:12:20,140
Beautiful.

967
02:12:31,621 --> 02:12:32,952
Beautiful.

968
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:21,564
There.

969
02:13:24,641 --> 02:13:25,733
Thank God.

970
02:13:25,809 --> 02:13:27,777
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

971
02:13:27,878 --> 02:13:29,846
He insisted on
a rescue mission.

972
02:13:31,181 --> 02:13:34,639
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

973
02:13:35,952 --> 02:13:38,216
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

974
02:13:38,288 --> 02:13:41,724
No matter how many times
you flush them
down the toilet...

975
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:44,282
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

976
02:13:45,228 --> 02:13:48,061
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.

977
02:13:48,832 --> 02:13:51,494
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

978
02:13:59,442 --> 02:14:00,670
Driscoll!

979
02:14:02,145 --> 02:14:05,808
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

980
02:14:07,083 --> 02:14:08,448
She's dead.

981
02:14:11,254 --> 02:14:12,812
She's not dead.

982
02:14:16,726 --> 02:14:18,956
Jack's gonna bring her back...

983
02:14:19,930 --> 02:14:22,524
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

984
02:14:23,233 --> 02:14:25,758
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

985
02:14:28,371 --> 02:14:29,929
More than okay.

986
02:14:31,174 --> 02:14:32,732
Think about it.

987
02:14:32,809 --> 02:14:35,642
You got a boat
full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

988
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:38,480
You wanna trap the ape?

989
02:14:45,322 --> 02:14:46,949
I don't think so.

990
02:14:47,524 --> 02:14:50,960
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

991
02:14:52,462 --> 02:14:54,225
I heard you were the best.

992
02:15:02,339 --> 02:15:03,465
Jack!

993
02:15:06,543 --> 02:15:08,306
Look after yourself!

994
02:15:08,945 --> 02:15:10,572
Keep the gate open, will you?

995
02:15:10,947 --> 02:15:12,346
Sure thing, buddy.

996
02:15:13,383 --> 02:15:14,714
Good luck!

997
02:15:27,998 --> 02:15:29,363
I'm sorry.

998
02:18:08,224 --> 02:18:09,282
Ann.

999
02:19:17,827 --> 02:19:18,919
Jack!

1000
02:19:19,796 --> 02:19:20,888
Run!

1001
02:19:51,194 --> 02:19:52,821
Jack, Jack!

1002
02:20:00,536 --> 02:20:01,696
Jack.

1003
02:20:10,747 --> 02:20:12,715
Ann, it's okay.

1004
02:20:13,549 --> 02:20:15,949
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!

1005
02:20:29,232 --> 02:20:30,597
Let's go. Come on.

1006
02:20:31,334 --> 02:20:32,562
Come on!

1007
02:22:04,827 --> 02:22:05,919
Carl!

1008
02:22:06,095 --> 02:22:08,791
Please! Somebody help us!

1009
02:22:10,933 --> 02:22:12,400
They've gone.

1010
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:16,029
Carl. Christ.

1011
02:22:16,606 --> 02:22:17,698
Carl!

1012
02:22:18,541 --> 02:22:20,702
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1013
02:22:20,777 --> 02:22:22,005
Not yet.

1014
02:22:23,446 --> 02:22:24,538
Wait.

1015
02:22:25,214 --> 02:22:26,306
Wait.

1016
02:22:30,453 --> 02:22:31,545
Wait!

1017
02:22:42,265 --> 02:22:43,493
Come on!

1018
02:23:55,972 --> 02:23:57,462
Now!
Throw them!

1019
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:58,939
Throw!

1020
02:23:59,809 --> 02:24:00,833
No!

1021
02:24:03,212 --> 02:24:04,440
Hold him!

1022
02:24:04,514 --> 02:24:06,004
Are you out of your mind?

1023
02:24:14,724 --> 02:24:16,851
Stop!
Hold the line!

1024
02:24:17,593 --> 02:24:18,992
Keep him down!

1025
02:24:24,567 --> 02:24:25,556
Heave!

1026
02:24:26,602 --> 02:24:27,933
Please!

1027
02:24:28,404 --> 02:24:30,099
No! Stop!

1028
02:24:30,439 --> 02:24:31,428
Jack.

1029
02:24:32,508 --> 02:24:33,770
No.
Get her out of...

1030
02:24:33,843 --> 02:24:35,743
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

1031
02:24:35,811 --> 02:24:37,779
No!
Get her out of his sight!

1032
02:24:37,847 --> 02:24:39,781
It's too late.
Throw it!

1033
02:24:42,051 --> 02:24:43,143
Look out!

1034
02:24:45,454 --> 02:24:46,921
Let go of me.

1035
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:52,687
We gotta go. Come on.

1036
02:24:53,262 --> 02:24:54,456
Come on.
Stop it.

1037
02:24:54,530 --> 02:24:56,054
Leave me alone!

1038
02:24:57,233 --> 02:24:58,757
Ann, please come on.

1039
02:25:06,075 --> 02:25:07,906
Kill it!
No. No!

1040
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:10,374
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!

1041
02:25:12,582 --> 02:25:14,106
All of you, run!

1042
02:25:14,183 --> 02:25:15,844
Come on. Come on!

1043
02:25:32,602 --> 02:25:33,899
Look out!

1044
02:25:45,181 --> 02:25:46,808
Move it! Move it!

1045
02:25:49,185 --> 02:25:50,550
Come on, come on!

1046
02:25:59,462 --> 02:26:01,089
Stay there!
It's me he wants!

1047
02:26:01,163 --> 02:26:03,358
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!

1048
02:26:03,432 --> 02:26:06,094
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!

1049
02:26:06,168 --> 02:26:07,692
No!
Ann, stay there!

1050
02:26:10,172 --> 02:26:11,571
Get it out!

1051
02:26:14,310 --> 02:26:16,175
Get the hell out of here!

1052
02:26:16,245 --> 02:26:18,236
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

1053
02:26:18,314 --> 02:26:19,611
Don't be crazy.

1054
02:26:20,816 --> 02:26:21,908
Let me go!

1055
02:26:23,252 --> 02:26:24,719
Cast off!

1056
02:26:27,023 --> 02:26:28,285
Come on, Carl!

1057
02:26:29,759 --> 02:26:31,590
Row!
Wait.

1058
02:26:31,861 --> 02:26:33,988
Row, God damn it!

1059
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,366
Go back.

1060
02:26:52,281 --> 02:26:53,407
Jimmy, no!

1061
02:27:00,389 --> 02:27:01,378
No!

1062
02:27:18,474 --> 02:27:20,305
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1063
02:27:20,376 --> 02:27:21,900
Hide out in the back!

1064
02:27:44,467 --> 02:27:46,094
Wait!
No!

1065
02:27:46,802 --> 02:27:49,396
No! No! Please don't!

1066
02:29:47,623 --> 02:29:50,148
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1067
02:29:52,895 --> 02:29:54,886
We're millionaires, boys!

1068
02:29:55,197 --> 02:29:57,097
I'll share it with all of you!

1069
02:29:57,933 --> 02:30:02,427
In a few months
his name will be up
in lights on Broadway!

1070
02:30:04,607 --> 02:30:08,703
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1071
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:10,297
Mr. Denham!

1072
02:31:12,007 --> 02:31:14,032
What can I say?
What can I say?

1073
02:31:14,109 --> 02:31:15,508
Any comments, Mr. Denham?

1074
02:31:16,845 --> 02:31:18,472
The Mayor, thank you.

1075
02:31:19,682 --> 02:31:20,671
Ready.

1076
02:31:20,849 --> 02:31:22,180
What am I?

1077
02:31:22,585 --> 02:31:24,314
Thank you very much.

1078
02:31:28,157 --> 02:31:29,647
Get used to it.

1079
02:31:29,858 --> 02:31:33,055
Listen, it's great to see you.
Ready?
I'm really
appreciating that...

1080
02:31:33,128 --> 02:31:34,595
Look at you!
I remember you.

1081
02:31:34,663 --> 02:31:37,655
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

1082
02:31:37,733 --> 02:31:39,530
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1083
02:31:53,349 --> 02:31:54,509
Carl!

1084
02:31:56,385 --> 02:31:57,579
Zelman!
I told them.

1085
02:31:57,653 --> 02:31:59,120
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1086
02:31:59,188 --> 02:32:01,179
Let's get a shot of this.

1087
02:32:01,657 --> 02:32:02,783
Come on.

1088
02:32:03,525 --> 02:32:05,857
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!

1089
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:11,165
<i>Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.</i>

1090
02:32:12,167 --> 02:32:14,431
No woman is worth this.
This woman is worth it.

1091
02:32:14,503 --> 02:32:16,494
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1092
02:32:16,572 --> 02:32:17,800
Oh, really?

1093
02:32:17,873 --> 02:32:19,534
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.

1094
02:32:19,608 --> 02:32:21,803
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!

1095
02:32:23,946 --> 02:32:26,608
<i>You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.</i>

1096
02:32:27,349 --> 02:32:29,283
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

1097
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:33,085
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1098
02:32:34,089 --> 02:32:36,489
<i>Why would I write
a play for you?</i>

1099
02:32:39,895 --> 02:32:41,522
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1100
02:32:41,797 --> 02:32:43,287
Oh, I'm sorry.

1101
02:32:44,533 --> 02:32:46,398
I couldn't help but overhear.

1102
02:32:49,905 --> 02:32:52,635
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1103
02:32:52,708 --> 02:32:55,506
and halfway through
the hors d'oeuvres,
he clutches my hand.

1104
02:32:55,577 --> 02:32:57,772
And that's when he told you
how he felt?

1105
02:32:57,846 --> 02:33:00,576
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1106
02:33:00,649 --> 02:33:02,617
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1107
02:33:02,685 --> 02:33:04,710
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

1108
02:33:04,787 --> 02:33:08,245
He said it was
not about the words.
Oh, please!

1109
02:33:08,457 --> 02:33:12,587
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1110
02:33:12,961 --> 02:33:17,261
He said we'd talk
about it later.
Only there was no later.

1111
02:33:19,001 --> 02:33:20,559
It never happened.

1112
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:23,333
That's how it ended.

1113
02:33:23,472 --> 02:33:27,203
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1114
02:33:29,078 --> 02:33:32,445
I honestly believed
things might actually
work out...

1115
02:33:33,549 --> 02:33:35,540
which was really very...

1116
02:33:38,821 --> 02:33:40,049
foolish.

1117
02:33:40,289 --> 02:33:42,917
Men.
Oh, they'll give you
the world...

1118
02:33:42,991 --> 02:33:45,391
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1119
02:33:45,461 --> 02:33:47,361
slip through their fingers.

1120
02:33:47,429 --> 02:33:48,657
Typical.

1121
02:33:49,264 --> 02:33:52,927
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use
their brains.

1122
02:33:53,902 --> 02:33:55,802
Romance. Who needs it?

1123
02:34:20,529 --> 02:34:21,860
Thank you.

1124
02:34:22,698 --> 02:34:24,063
Thank you.

1125
02:34:27,002 --> 02:34:28,333
Thank you.

1126
02:34:30,139 --> 02:34:31,504
Thank you.

1127
02:34:33,308 --> 02:34:34,775
Ladies and gentlemen...

1128
02:34:36,378 --> 02:34:38,869
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1129
02:34:39,648 --> 02:34:41,377
The story of our adventure...

1130
02:34:42,217 --> 02:34:45,186
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1131
02:34:46,155 --> 02:34:47,645
their lives lost...

1132
02:34:48,423 --> 02:34:50,516
in pursuit of
a savage beast...

1133
02:34:51,693 --> 02:34:54,287
a monstrous aberration
of nature.

1134
02:34:55,531 --> 02:34:57,658
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.

1135
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,698
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1136
02:35:01,170 --> 02:35:02,831
the beast was no match...

1137
02:35:03,438 --> 02:35:04,996
for the charms of a girl.

1138
02:35:08,477 --> 02:35:10,069
A girl from New York...

1139
02:35:13,282 --> 02:35:15,079
who melted his heart...

1140
02:35:15,784 --> 02:35:18,378
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...

1141
02:35:20,322 --> 02:35:23,485
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

1142
02:35:24,526 --> 02:35:26,426
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1143
02:35:27,729 --> 02:35:31,597
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1144
02:35:39,374 --> 02:35:42,832
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1145
02:35:42,978 --> 02:35:45,970
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1146
02:35:47,115 --> 02:35:51,779
He was a king in the world
he knew, but he comes to you
now a captive.

1147
02:35:52,988 --> 02:35:54,649
Ladies and gentlemen...

1148
02:35:54,723 --> 02:35:59,251
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!

1149
02:36:08,637 --> 02:36:11,765
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1150
02:36:12,074 --> 02:36:15,510
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1151
02:36:36,265 --> 02:36:38,062
Observe, if you will...

1152
02:36:41,336 --> 02:36:43,304
I am touching the beast.

1153
02:36:43,605 --> 02:36:47,837
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1154
02:36:54,983 --> 02:36:56,610
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1155
02:37:15,938 --> 02:37:18,133
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1156
02:37:18,206 --> 02:37:19,833
a surprise guest.

1157
02:37:20,642 --> 02:37:22,837
The real-life hero
of this story.

1158
02:37:23,245 --> 02:37:25,679
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1159
02:37:27,349 --> 02:37:32,116
The man who risked all
to win the freedom
of a helpless female.

1160
02:37:33,288 --> 02:37:35,620
A big hand for
Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1161
02:37:41,496 --> 02:37:43,555
Thank you. Thank you.

1162
02:37:44,232 --> 02:37:45,392
Thank you.

1163
02:38:13,095 --> 02:38:14,528
He was right.

1164
02:38:16,098 --> 02:38:18,896
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...

1165
02:38:20,068 --> 02:38:22,366
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1166
02:38:22,738 --> 02:38:25,002
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1167
02:38:26,575 --> 02:38:28,873
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1168
02:38:30,979 --> 02:38:34,380
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things
he loves.

1169
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:51,424
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1170
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:54,799
for we now come
to the climax of
this savage ritual.

1171
02:38:55,003 --> 02:38:57,494
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1172
02:38:58,273 --> 02:39:01,902
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1173
02:39:03,145 --> 02:39:07,206
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl
I've ever met!

1174
02:39:07,949 --> 02:39:09,211
Miss Ann Darrow.

1175
02:39:57,199 --> 02:39:58,928
Save me from the beast!

1176
02:40:07,809 --> 02:40:09,037
Help me!

1177
02:40:13,181 --> 02:40:14,478
Where is she?

1178
02:40:15,650 --> 02:40:17,208
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.

1179
02:40:17,285 --> 02:40:20,686
I heard he offered her
all kinds of money
and she turned him down flat.

1180
02:41:06,501 --> 02:41:07,832
Here's your story, boys.

1181
02:41:07,903 --> 02:41:10,997
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1182
02:41:16,745 --> 02:41:17,734
No.

1183
02:41:26,087 --> 02:41:27,952
We have to get these people
out of here.

1184
02:41:28,023 --> 02:41:30,014
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1185
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:33,955
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

1186
02:41:35,797 --> 02:41:36,821
Head for the exits.

1187
02:41:36,898 --> 02:41:39,332
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1188
02:41:47,509 --> 02:41:48,737
Excuse me, fellows.

1189
02:41:49,678 --> 02:41:52,374
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.

1190
02:41:55,951 --> 02:41:58,943
Get me down! Help me, please!

1191
02:42:01,356 --> 02:42:04,257
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1192
02:42:07,662 --> 02:42:10,324
Go! Go! Get out!

1193
02:42:14,302 --> 02:42:15,792
Go! Go!

1194
02:43:50,799 --> 02:43:53,233
There they are.
Come on, come with me.

1195
02:44:06,047 --> 02:44:07,708
Go!
Wait for me!

1196
02:44:08,616 --> 02:44:09,981
Go back!

1197
02:44:16,991 --> 02:44:18,253
This way!

1198
02:44:26,034 --> 02:44:27,194
Help!

1199
02:44:35,610 --> 02:44:36,599
No!

1200
02:45:16,518 --> 02:45:19,180
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1201
02:45:19,254 --> 02:45:20,744
Come on, pal,
we gotta draw him off.

1202
02:45:20,822 --> 02:45:22,653
It's all yours, buddy.

1203
02:45:39,073 --> 02:45:40,802
Better get out of here, lady!

1204
02:46:01,529 --> 02:46:02,757
Come on.

1205
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:12,929
Buddy!

1206
02:46:14,275 --> 02:46:16,505
Come on. Come on.

1207
02:46:35,296 --> 02:46:36,285
Look out.

1208
02:46:58,953 --> 02:47:00,181
Jesus Christ.

1209
02:52:23,744 --> 02:52:24,005
Fire!

1210
02:52:27,248 --> 02:52:28,340
Stop!

1211
02:52:43,698 --> 02:52:45,029
Listen up.

1212
02:52:45,099 --> 02:52:48,296
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1213
02:52:48,369 --> 02:52:49,768
You hear me?

1214
02:52:50,271 --> 02:52:52,967
It was built for humans,
by humans.

1215
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,668
Not for stinking
lice-infested apes.

1216
02:52:55,743 --> 02:52:57,574
<i>The thought
of some mutant gorilla...</i>

1217
02:52:57,645 --> 02:53:01,979
<i>crapping all over the streets
of this fair city,
fills me with disgust.</i>

1218
02:53:02,250 --> 02:53:04,218
<i>So this is how it's gonna be.</i>

1219
02:53:04,285 --> 02:53:06,617
We find it. We kill it.

1220
02:53:06,954 --> 02:53:11,118
We cut its ugly head off
and we ram it up...

1221
02:53:30,278 --> 02:53:31,836
No. No.

1222
02:56:03,397 --> 02:56:04,728
Beautiful.

1223
02:56:11,172 --> 02:56:12,230
Yes.

1224
02:56:14,875 --> 02:56:16,240
Yes, it is.

1225
03:01:09,636 --> 03:01:10,898
Look at that.

1226
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:13,966
Hey! Hey!

1227
03:01:14,241 --> 03:01:15,868
Nobody past this point.

1228
03:01:17,111 --> 03:01:18,738
You can't go in there!

1229
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:21,069
Hey!

1230
03:01:23,183 --> 03:01:24,480
Stop him!

1231
03:01:27,588 --> 03:01:29,852
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

1232
03:01:29,923 --> 03:01:31,584
What's going on?
Go!

1233
03:05:13,480 --> 03:05:14,777
No!

1234
03:05:15,949 --> 03:05:18,110
No!

1235
03:05:25,092 --> 03:05:27,720
Please! No!

1236
03:05:28,095 --> 03:05:29,289
No!

1237
03:08:25,906 --> 03:08:28,204
Ann. Ann.

1238
03:09:17,524 --> 03:09:18,821
Move along.

1239
03:09:19,292 --> 03:09:21,192
Just one shot! One shot!

1240
03:09:21,862 --> 03:09:23,955
Come, come!
Boys, how about a photo?

1241
03:09:24,030 --> 03:09:25,019
Look at me.

1242
03:09:25,131 --> 03:09:26,860
Come on, watch the camera.

1243
03:09:29,703 --> 03:09:31,227
Come a little closer.

1244
03:09:31,905 --> 03:09:34,100
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!

1245
03:09:34,174 --> 03:09:36,369
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1246
03:09:37,077 --> 03:09:38,635
Why'd he do that?

1247
03:09:38,945 --> 03:09:41,413
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

1248
03:09:41,481 --> 03:09:43,813
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1249
03:09:43,884 --> 03:09:46,546
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1250
03:09:52,759 --> 03:09:55,489
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1251
03:09:58,064 --> 03:10:00,032
It wasn't the airplanes.

1252
03:10:04,404 --> 03:10:06,702
It was beauty
killed the beast.
