1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,002
God is the only being who,
in order to reign,

2
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:09,702
doesn't even need to exist.
- Charles Baudelaire

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,053
Ladies and gentlemen!
On the guitar,

4
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:30,329
senor Diego Armando Maradona
from the world of cinema!

5
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,314
Buenos Aires!

6
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,343
How are you?

7
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:04,955
This is the song from
the movie called UNDERGROUND!

8
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,997
Jorge Luis Borges once wrote that

9
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,265
Argentinos remind him of
boats moored in harbours.

10
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,776
However, the brilliant writer hadn't
counted on Diego Armando Maradona.

11
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:22,004
El Diego was moored to
his mother

12
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,575
only until he was born.

13
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,914
After that, he resembled a boat
without a single rope on its deck.

14
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,814
Diego could easily be the hero

15
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,687
from my first film
DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?

16
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,261
and the Sarajevan suburb of Gorica

17
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,330
could easily become
Fiorito of Buenos Aires.

18
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,833
It wouldn't be hard to imagine Diego

19
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,832
in WHEN FATHER WAS
AWAY ON BUSINESS,

20
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,095
playing the father,

21
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,138
who atones for his adultery in prison
during politically turbulent times.

22
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,400
And nothing would be
easier than to see

23
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:52,574
the footballing magician

24
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,045
acting in BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT
as the man

25
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,208
who is his own worst enemy,

26
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,786
doing everything to his own detriment.

27
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:48,231
This chapel is a creation of the members
of the Church of Maradona.

28
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:53,501
It reflects, it symbolizes
the image of Diego among his own.

29
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,817
This ball represents
Diego's sacrifice for football.

30
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:27,464
We'd like to ask everyone to please
take their seats, to get into place,

31
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:32,409
because when
Diego Armando Maradona arrives,

32
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,141
we'll start the press
conference and give you

33
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,310
all the details concerning
the big march in Mar del Plata.

34
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,692
01,04,2005.

35
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,664
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

36
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,854
I am very proud, as an Argentine,

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,798
to be riding on this train

38
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:33,134
and to repudiate that piece of
human garbage, George Bush.

39
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:37,142
So I want the people
of Argentina to understand

40
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,974
that we are going for dignity,

41
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,014
not for violence,
but to defend what is ours,

42
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:47,519
what is Argentina's, that's all.

43
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,792
It was miraculous that the planet Earth
wasn't knocked off its axis

44
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:59,194
when more than a billion people
all leapt up at the same time.

45
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,393
That was the moment
when we celebrated Maradona's goal

46
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,232
against England
at the World Cup in Mexico.

47
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,739
The Earth continued its undisturbed
journey around the Sun

48
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,674
because it was a leap for justice.

49
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,945
Even God himself
got involved in this case

50
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,916
the first goal against the English
was scored with the player's hand

51
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,248
even though it was
a football championship.

52
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,523
It was one of those rare moments

53
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,457
when a country heavily
in debt to the IMF triumphed

54
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,926
over one of the rulers of the world.

55
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:34,595
For Argentina! Goal!

56
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,332
By Diego Armando Maradona!

57
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,935
A most poetic goal!

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,981
Symbolic! Unforgettable!
To be treasured forever!

59
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:54,247
Diego Armando Maradona! The best
football player in the World Cup!

60
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,658
'WHO is that man? '
I asked myself.

61
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,388
Who is that footballing magician?

62
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,432
The Sex Pistols of
the international football scene.

63
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,967
The cocaine victim, who,
having given up drugs,

64
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:12,664
looked first like a Falstaff

65
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,865
and then like
an advert for spaghetti.

66
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,805
If Andy Warhol were alive,

67
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,504
I'm sure he'd put Maradona in

68
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,240
his sepia alongside
Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung.

69
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,447
If he'd been able to spend his
whole life on the football pitch,

70
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,487
he'd have been a happy man.

71
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,058
As it was, as soon as the referee blew
for the end of the match,

72
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,491
and El Diego,
the greatest footballer of all time,

73
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,996
had walked past the corner flag,
heading for the changing rooms,

74
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,896
all his troubles began.

75
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,302
What do we say?

76
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,272
It's me Bizoo.

77
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,084
Yes?

78
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,349
It's... it's Emir with the...
with the crew.

79
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,586
Hi, how are you?

80
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,752
Thank you.

81
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,295
- My daughter, Dunja.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,830
I am very happy to see you.

83
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,330
Same here.

84
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,871
I cried twice because of him:

85
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:23,068
when we lost
and when he beat England.

86
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,772
When we talk about
the match against England...

87
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:34,286
we talk about it like this.
Bilardo was very intelligent.

88
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,549
We were representing our dead

89
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,128
who were sent to die
by their own country.

90
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:47,825
It wasn't like England pushed
a button and killed everyone.

91
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,996
So we had to go out onto
the pitch and play football.

92
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,873
Thinking about football,
but knowing that

93
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,377
a lot depended
on our beating England.

94
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,607
It was like a war,
winning a football war.

95
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,813
That's what spurred us on.

96
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,185
After the hand goal
against England,

97
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:15,628
everyone said: "That was great,
what you did to the English!",

98
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,821
while the others threw mud at me.

99
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,593
I was so thrilled with that goal,

100
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,897
it was as if I'd stolen
an Englishman's wallet,

101
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,767
it felt like getting away
with a prank!

102
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,932
This good-natured roly-poly looked

103
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,773
more like a character from a film
about the Mexican revolution

104
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,040
than the best footballer of all time.

105
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,609
It was as if he had
stepped out of a Sergio Leone

106
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,242
or Sam Peckinpah's film.

107
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,217
As if he had just said goodbye
to some ladies of ill repute

108
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,350
and stepped into a room,

109
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,327
bringing the smell of
revolutionary gunpowder with him.

110
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,956
I was sure of one thing -
if he hadn't been a footballer,

111
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,160
he would have
become a revolutionary.

112
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,399
Maradona wouldn't need an incentive
to send him off into the woods.

113
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,566
He was a revolutionary at heart.

114
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,974
While everyone is defending
the U.S., I defend Cuba.

115
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,206
I don't care if it pleases people.

116
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,977
It would be much easier to say:
"Leave the U.S. alone."

117
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,919
But I say the Americans
let the Yugoslavs kill each other

118
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,318
because there was no oil.

119
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,720
Otherwise, they'd have moved in.

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,126
They were behind
the killings in Afghanistan.

121
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,900
That really disturbs me.

122
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:33,830
We watch them
killing people on TV

123
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:38,001
and the only ones
making money are CNN, Fox...

124
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,146
But Fidel is great.

125
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,414
I have a tatoo of him.

126
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,180
And you have Che Guevara.

127
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,518
Che Guevara, si.

128
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,931
See you tommorrow.

129
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,364
- I see you...
- See you. Ciao, ciao.

130
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,668
We could make
a nice movie out it.

131
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,373
Nice?

132
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,512
Yes. You sit here.

133
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,856
I won't be seen anyway.

134
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,574
There's nothing harder than when
you want to peer into someone's life

135
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:51,048
and yet at the same time understand
why he or she won't let you in.

136
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,950
It's like a never-ending game
where the doors are opening and closing.

137
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,980
When you yourself have been
persecuted by some journalists,

138
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,684
you begin to hate them.

139
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,625
Not only when they lie,

140
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,198
but also when they are trying to
ferret out the secrets of your life.

141
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,733
And now I'm intending to
present a portrait of

142
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,838
one of the most famous people
on the planet

143
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,600
and suddenly I am taking
on the role of

144
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,239
those very people
I have never liked.

145
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,805
I feel like a paparazzo
waiting for a star to wake up

146
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:24,041
and to step in front of
my camera lens,

147
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,085
so I can sell
the photos to the tabloids.

148
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,616
- They go somewhere else.
- Really?

149
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,122
They're sitting in the car.

150
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,196
This barbed wire crown

151
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:46,328
represents the pitch,
the field, the grounds.

152
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:15,294
The Goal of the Century

153
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,691
...naked aristocracy...

154
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,967
He's awesome!

155
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,383
My best friend, a great brother,
he does everything for us.

156
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,146
You play for Argentino Juniors?

157
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,345
- Yes.
- What position?

158
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,682
Nine.

159
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,290
Will you be like Diego?

160
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,019
No, I've never thought that.

161
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,492
No?

162
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,125
My brother's a Martian.
No question about that.

163
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,226
Travelling through Fiorito to
Maradona's house

164
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,930
looked to me like the journey to
the setting of my first feature film

165
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,505
DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?

166
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,499
While I was looking at
the shanties of poor,

167
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,740
it seemed to me that I knew every face
that was hiding behind the scenes.

168
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,582
While making DOLLY BELL,

169
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,345
I discovered the most wonderful
characteristics of city poor

170
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,281
the aristocratic spirit that had
vanished from the houses of the rich

171
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:46,518
and had moved to
the homes of the impoverished.

172
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,462
The wonderful morality
within the family

173
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,997
where rules are respected
and sacrifices made.

174
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,991
Since then, I have always found

175
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,468
it easy to recognize
that aristocratic spirit,

176
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,405
knowing that in the west,
poverty was an embarrassment,

177
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,978
but here and in Balcans
it's an expression of suffering.

178
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,614
When he was choosing
between River Plate,

179
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,306
who were offering him
more money,

180
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,544
and Boca Juniors,
Diego chose Boca

181
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,622
precisely for
these aristocratic reasons.

182
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,388
Boca were paying less money,
but by joining them,

183
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:27,057
he was fulfilling a dream
dating back to the time

184
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,227
he was walking past the
Bombonera stadium with his father

185
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,305
and promised that one day

186
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:40,113
Diego arrived at Boca's stadium
24 years later as a retired footballer,

187
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,578
carrying a torch, whose weak flame

188
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:46,709
shyly lit the road of return from
the underworld of drug addiction,

189
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,413
back to being among his football fans.

190
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,220
Once a god, always a god.

191
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,722
That evening he reminded me
of the Mesopotamian god, Gilgamesh.

192
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,327
The way in which Diego was
accepted only went to prove

193
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,800
that for gods all is forgiven.

194
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,270
My dad was the only one
who worked.

195
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,813
He had nine mouths to feed,
my mother and eight kids.

196
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,779
We always had food on the table.

197
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:22,254
Not much, sometimes more,
sometimes less,

198
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,913
but we always had food.

199
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,490
This is my house.

200
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,356
But that's what unites a family.

201
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:34,032
I'd share my food with my sister,

202
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,900
or she'd give me some of hers
when she'd eaten enough.

203
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,138
When was the last time
you've been here?

204
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,474
Over 15 years ago.

205
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,810
We made paper balls
and we'd throw them out there.

206
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,882
This was the goal. We'd throw
the ball like this, and head it.

207
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,617
The patio was my stadium...

208
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,725
I have two dreams:

209
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:11,534
to play in the World Cup
and to be a champion.

210
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,068
I realized later,
when I was much older,

211
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:19,342
that my mother,
whenever she'd see

212
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,472
there wasn't enough food,
would get a stomach ache.

213
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,649
But it wasn't true,

214
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,745
it was because
she wanted us to have more.

215
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,219
At the table, my dad
didn't need to say: "Be quiet."

216
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:38,388
The look in his eyes,
the exhaustion from his work,

217
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,465
commanded respect.

218
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,763
I remember when my dad
came home from work

219
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,106
my mom would put
the old suction cups on his back.

220
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,444
It was a ritual, my mom
cupping and us all around.

221
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,486
It was like a massage.

222
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,817
Exactly,
because my dad carried sacks.

223
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:09,589
I think the people around here
have greater dignity

224
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:14,598
than all the people
who may live in other areas.

225
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,202
In my country,
politicians get rich,

226
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,797
but give nothing to the people.

227
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,602
I've often been asked
to go into politics,

228
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,470
and I say: "No, I don't want to
rob the people."

229
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,776
I've met with politicians

230
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,685
and they never want to
meet with me again.

231
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,547
Because I say what I feel.

232
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,593
The gap between rich and poor
has grown much bigger in my lifetime.

233
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,756
Not only here in Argentina,
you can see it in Brazil,

234
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,961
or Venezuela or Cuba,
with the embargo.

235
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:54,301
The Americans are trampling
all over those countries,

236
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,342
they won't let them
get back on their feet.

237
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,277
If they give them a loan,
they demand ten times more in return.

238
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,076
When was that
sense of justice born?

239
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,783
It comes from seeing the world,

240
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,549
and then from reading
a lot of Che Guevara,

241
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,215
and from studying. And from Cuba.

242
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,118
Gabriel Garcia Marques told me:

243
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,196
if no Castro in the history
of Latin America,

244
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,925
Yankees would have been
in Patagonia already

245
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,865
and all of you would have
spoken English already.

246
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,402
I think we're part of the U.S.

247
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:29,974
So, what does he think

248
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,702
the whole world will be
American colony?

249
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,743
- Obviously.
- China?

250
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,039
No, not China.

251
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,950
I met Fidel in 1987.

252
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,784
The Americans gave me
an award

253
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,522
and the Cubans
were giving me an award.

254
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,390
I said to the Americans...

255
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,355
"Keep your award,
I'm getting one in Cuba."

256
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,568
Fidel and I spent

257
00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:00,639
five hours talking about Che,
about Argentina, about Cuba,

258
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,475
and I fell in love with Fidel.

259
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,576
He seemed like a beast
defending his territory.

260
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,676
He's the only politician
- if we can call him that -

261
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:15,947
who cannot be
accused of stealing,

262
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,350
though the Americans have tried.

263
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,863
He's the only politician
who can say:

264
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,331
"I risked my life for my country,
my land."

265
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,062
He's a revolutionary.

266
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,031
The politicians of the world
use money to win elections.

267
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,075
He won by taking up arms.

268
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,569
Because he's got balls!

269
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,813
I love Cuba!

270
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,821
Fidel!

271
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,266
It might seem scandalous,
but Fidel, I'd die for you!

272
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:03,993
Listen!

273
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:10,005
The more I see
how people are in Europe,

274
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,769
how people are in South America,

275
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,246
the more I love Cuba!

276
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,927
I think he didn't come to
Fiorito for last 14 years

277
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,900
because he prefered to
have idealistic image

278
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,936
or the picture of the poor people.

279
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,167
It's better to keep them
in the mind, you know?

280
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,643
To keep them as an idea
that he has to fight for,

281
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,341
somehow, promote or be behind them.

282
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,418
The good part of them will

283
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,147
vanish inmediately thinking about
his money,

284
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,257
how to get money straight from him,

285
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,552
do you have hundred,
do you have two hundred,

286
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,594
and then they're not any more

287
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,631
as good as the idea about
good people is. You know?

288
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,258
How do you feel coming back here

289
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,772
and remembering the worst and
the most difficult part of your life.

290
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,238
Did you ever regret that you
left ever these beautiful fields.

291
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,873
This is the 'goalary'.

292
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:26,782
The 34 little balls
and the shoe represent

293
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,185
the 35 goals Diego scored
as a member of the Argentine team.

294
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:25,239
The Goal of the Century

295
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,666
One day they wanted
to introduce me to Charles of...

296
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:05,409
of England.

297
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,350
No.

298
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:15,085
I would never shake his hand.
Not with all that blood on it.

299
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,029
Never.

300
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,658
He wanted to meet me.
I didn't want to meet him.

301
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:28,097
After what happened
in the Falklands...

302
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,439
I didn't.

303
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,535
Stop Bush

304
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,641
War Criminal

305
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,873
He's a murderer.

306
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:16,844
I don't think he can just decide,

307
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,159
the way he decides for all of us,
for the whole world.

308
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:29,330
Having the most destructive bomb
doesn't mean having power.

309
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:35,304
Power doesn't mean
having a bomb

310
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:39,707
and killing five thousand people.

311
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,475
In my opinion,
he's a cold-blooded murderer.

312
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:49,251
If you want,
we can talk about Bush.

313
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,256
He blames the Colombians
for cocaine.

314
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,729
But in fact, it's the Americans
who use cocaine.

315
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,291
Right?

316
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,995
Yes!

317
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,305
What about the americanos?
They control all the drugs?

318
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:08,867
Obviously!

319
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,672
- Obviously.
- Obvious.

320
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,152
In the train that was
heading to Mar del Plata

321
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:29,159
there was something naive
but appealing about the idea that

322
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,490
nowadays you can influence
the world and your own destiny

323
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,064
without money or
atomic bomb in your pocket.

324
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:38,465
It was a world where apparently
only at football matches

325
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,664
could the small nations triumph
epically over the larger powers

326
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:42,705
and take sweet revenge.

327
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:47,438
It was as if that
unavoidable shudder which

328
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,014
trains produced in me
and the inexplicable excitement

329
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,946
were slowly turning into the belief

330
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,814
that this train wasn't only heading
for Mar del Plata but beyond,

331
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,752
to better times for
Latin America.

332
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,620
Our Bible,
the one we cherish,

333
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,890
the one we carry
in our hearts, everywhere.

334
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,946
Brother, after your conversion
to the Hand of God goal,

335
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:10,545
the Church of Maradona
welcomes you as a new disciple.

336
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,442
...Messiah back in Naples...

337
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,278
09,06,2005

338
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:15,278
"Anyone who
doesn't jump is Ferlaino."

339
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,463
The Neapolitans know

340
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,402
that I was the one
who enabled Naples to win.

341
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,065
When Ferlaino paid me, of course.

342
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,774
There was a feeling...

343
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:36,046
The feeling was that
the south couldn't beat the north.

344
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,013
They couldn't beat the north.

345
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:46,262
We went and played against
Juve in Turin

346
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,463
and scored six goals!

347
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,800
Can you imagine

348
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:58,106
a southern team scoring six
against Agnelli "The Lawyer"?

349
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,741
Argentina eliminated Italy
from the World Cup.

350
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,884
That was the biggest blow
in history for them.

351
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:10,850
Because Matarrese,
another Mafioso,

352
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,425
the president of the Italian league,

353
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,289
had already arranged the finals...

354
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,991
Germany and Italy.

355
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:28,196
And that's when everything
that happened, happened.

356
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,333
They got me out on doping.
Then they got Caniggia on doping.

357
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:37,749
But after that,
no one else.

358
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:43,516
In Italian football, with the exception
of Maradona and Caniggia,

359
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,820
nobody even took an aspirin.

360
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:49,589
15,06,2005.

361
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,127
Belgrade, Serbia

362
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,841
Stribor!

363
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,846
So you gonna meet Maradona.
You met him already?

364
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:10,949
No, never.

365
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:15,782
Not many people can
the opportunity to meet God.

366
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,014
IN the flesh.
So, it's special opportunity.

367
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:21,752
This is the first time I put the shirt
on because I'm meeting the God.

368
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,142
Come here, Stribor.

369
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,835
Your little kid!

370
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,515
When Diego came,
Belgrade was grappling

371
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,711
with the perplexing historical
lesson of how to love

372
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:51,084
the West once again after it
had bombed the town

373
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:55,660
and destroyed it out of
fondness for the country.

374
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,454
Diego looked at the ruined
Ministry of Internal Affairs building

375
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,691
and asked me who had done it.

376
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,167
I didn't want to apportion collective
blame and say "the west",

377
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:09,365
NATO, international community
or United States.

378
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:13,069
Having been raised
in the educational spirit of the west,

379
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:17,649
in my eyes culpability lies
in the actions of an individual.

380
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,774
"Havier Solana", I said,

381
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,284
and Diego just
ironically nodded his head:

382
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,356
"Si, sosialista espagnol"
(Yes, the Spanish socialist).

383
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,687
Senka, Maradona wants to
talk to you.

384
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,190
Hi, Senka. We love you!

385
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,929
A big kiss!

386
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,834
It was no coincidence that

387
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,270
Diego was the last of my friends
to speak to my mother.

388
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,734
The day after his visit,
my mother died

389
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:49,211
and she took all her memories
with her to the afterlife,

390
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,782
including the joy
felt after Maradona's voice

391
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,852
had cheered her up
for a moment at least.

392
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,921
Red Star, Belgrade Stadium

393
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,724
The press room...

394
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,196
The pitch is better
than on the day we played.

395
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,930
It was raining that day.

396
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,240
I'd swear it was this goal.

397
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,471
- This is the place.
- Qual?

398
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,512
- Aca.
- Yeah.

399
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,047
This is where I take it...

400
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:37,789
I make an inside cut, a feint,
and take it again.

401
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,160
A feint, and take it again.

402
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,590
It's up ahead.

403
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:46,700
When I do this,
the goalie is here,

404
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,268
almost outside the penalty area.

405
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:55,678
I feint, to kick hard, put my foot
under the ball to kick it over.

406
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,579
It was complicated,
the goalie was tall,

407
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,386
2 meters tall,
plus his hands over his head.

408
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:10,318
But I was able to
get under it and kick it.

409
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,024
Exactly. Like this...

410
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,363
Like this...
And the ball went like this...

411
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,663
I remember the goalie's face.

412
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,000
"Ciao!"

413
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:16,189
Did you see how
I play with this shoes?

414
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,820
If I had the shoes...

415
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,559
It could be goal.

416
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,841
Hi, I'm Diego.

417
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:39,013
How are you? Good afternoon!
How's the family?

418
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,487
What's up, maestro?

419
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:44,919
Hey there, crazy guy!

420
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,048
See how they know me?

421
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,758
I'm in the neighborhood!

422
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:53,688
How are you? What's up?

423
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,394
Go, Boca, go!

424
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,642
- Three times.
- Three time, yes.

425
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:22,485
Look who's here! Who's that man?

426
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,022
My grandson.

427
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,867
A good leg, a footballer's leg!

428
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,435
When we were kids
we played football

429
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,978
and we never wanted to stop,

430
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,677
we wanted to keep playing.

431
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,881
We played at night
and could hardly see the ball.

432
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,451
You know?

433
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:58,854
So what happened?
Playing in the dark

434
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:03,525
and then in the daytime made
it seem as if you played better.

435
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,631
You see?
The night was here in our heads.

436
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:09,907
And then,
imagining things the next day,

437
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,976
we felt like we played
faster and better.

438
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,573
It's like a foggy day,

439
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:20,378
not being able to see the
entire goal, or half of the pitch,

440
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,782
or the ball going out...

441
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,151
It's like playing
with closed eyes.

442
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,091
When you open them, you have
a much better idea of the pitch,

443
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:33,895
of the goal, of your opponent.

444
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:40,889
The Goal of the Century

445
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,049
...if cocaine is a drug,

446
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,345
I am a drug addict...

447
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:06,248
As we informed you yesterday,

448
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:09,383
his hospitalization
in intensive care

449
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,225
is due to acute hypertension
and cardiac arrhythmia.

450
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,459
24 hours after being admitted,
Mr. Diego Maradona

451
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,034
is in a stable condition.

452
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,592
Black Cat, White Cat

453
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,415
I was dead.
But I didn't die because...

454
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:13,254
the Man up there
didn't want me to.

455
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,026
But I was dead.

456
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:21,124
It was like
all these black blood clots

457
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:25,366
prevented me from
opening my eyes.

458
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:33,568
It was terrible. I couldn't get out.

459
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:37,310
I remember feeling that

460
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,548
I wanted to
get out of there, but couldn't.

461
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:47,785
Do you understand? There
were all these black blood clots

462
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:55,395
and I couldn't get them
back into their pigeonholes

463
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,433
in order to wake up.

464
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:03,004
Later, Dalma told me
that Giannina kept saying:

465
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,168
"Daddy, you can't die, damn it!

466
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,179
You have to live,
to stay with me."

467
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,578
I didn't hear my daughter.

468
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,581
I was in a coma. I was dead.

469
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,553
Black Cat, White Cat

470
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:41,203
What happened was
the Man up there said:

471
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,611
"Not yet. Not yet."

472
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:49,049
"You have to keep on fighting."
"Keep on fighting."

473
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,961
My journeys to Buenos Aires
turned to be in vain,

474
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:05,503
and the thin line between life
and death along

475
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:08,003
which Diego moved had
become his only route.

476
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,001
That year he collapsed

477
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:13,269
and in life he did everything
to his own detriment.

478
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:17,075
Just as his footballing skills
were at one extreme,

479
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,740
with him being far
better than anyone else,

480
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,045
his life was at the other extreme,

481
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,621
being a disintegration of everything

482
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,350
that provides the basis
for normality in life.

483
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:31,820
I think this was why
they worshipped him no matter what.

484
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:34,796
For normality is no longer
what people crave.

485
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:36,264
It is simply too little,

486
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,529
and today everyone
wants much, much more.

487
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:43,038
Normality is not a precondition
for love and adoration,

488
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,301
and when someone
is reconciled to death

489
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:49,174
and when he or she speaks
from the heart as Diego does,

490
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,339
the path to sainthood is nearby.

491
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:55,146
The only problem was that
it wasn't the time for sainthood,

492
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:58,585
and that's why I think
he became a drug addict.

493
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:36,022
- Good, but no tango?
- No.

494
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:46,695
- Do I look like tango?
- Yeah.

495
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:47,805
Yes, tango.

496
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:58,442
I watched people congregating outside
cafes at dawn in Buenos Aires,

497
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,074
listening to the tango
and crying together.

498
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:06,087
The tango originated in 1883
in a bordello somewhere

499
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:10,456
and Jorge Luis Borges calls it
dance of grieving husbands.

500
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:15,125
The tango introduced
the idea of utter solemnity

501
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,962
as the dancers move backwards
and forwards.

502
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,164
The tango is the dance which

503
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:24,674
most obviously suggests the union
between Thanatos and Eros.

504
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,944
It is in this
ram-tam-tam-tam movement,

505
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:33,209
as elegant as death,
as powerful as birth,

506
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,842
that the basic elements of
life are united,

507
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:39,552
and changes in form are
the best indicators of

508
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,750
how time corrects thoughts

509
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:46,728
and how we all risk speaking nonsense
whenever we open our mouths.

510
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:52,935
The fact that the tango originated
in the bordello of yesteryear

511
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,505
gives it an innocence that could

512
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,336
never be found
in the bordello of today.

513
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:16,218
I became a sponsor
of the Church of Maradona

514
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,228
mainly to support
and stay in touch with

515
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:22,197
everything having to
do with Diego.

516
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:25,393
I own the Cocodrilo
in Buenos Aires.

517
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:29,404
I got involved with the kids
in the Church of Maradona

518
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,768
a couple of years ago

519
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,706
because of the wonderful things

520
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:35,369
they were doing
for my friend Diego.

521
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:39,681
The Cocodrilo has
an international reputation.

522
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,748
It's a nightclub

523
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:46,414
but we've gone further,
left the old-time nightclub behind.

524
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:51,017
In the Cocodrilo you have
girls dancing on the bar.

525
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,931
They do shows,
they dance all night long.

526
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:58,331
As you can see, these girls

527
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:01,700
aren't strippers, they're dancers.

528
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,935
After a visit to
the Cocodrillo club,

529
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,378
the fundamental principles
of psychiatry were shaken.

530
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:15,751
Jung's theory is that the
survival instinct leads a man to food,

531
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,482
and Freud claims that eros
is the basic impulse which,

532
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:23,321
through sexual activity,
ensures species reproduction.

533
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,996
In choosing Maradona's goals
as more tempting

534
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,931
than Omar's ballerinas
and the sumptuous feast,

535
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,902
I realised that Borges was right
when he claimed

536
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:36,063
that the tango originated in bordellos;

537
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:40,576
whether it is called rock 'n' roll or
the tango is today of no consequence.

538
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:42,742
The most important thing
is the realisation

539
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,178
that a new psychiatric influence

540
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,217
must be added to Jung's
survival instinct

541
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:51,345
and Freud's ideas on
species reproduction

542
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,650
the influence of Maradona's game

543
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:57,784
as the third of the important feelings
that drive mankind.

544
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:01,160
Emir! You're like everyone else!

545
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,233
The girls always complain!

546
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:07,168
When Diego arrives
or we show videos of his goals

547
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:09,273
all the men are like this,

548
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:11,238
ignoring the girls, who say:

549
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,038
"Please Omar, turn off the TV!"

550
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,705
And it's the same with Emir.
When you can see Maradona...

551
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:20,010
Well, let's enjoy the meal!

552
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,626
Uruguayan...

553
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,601
Hi, how are you?

554
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,440
Good?

555
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,041
How are you?

556
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:49,913
My mother...

557
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:52,571
My father...

558
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:10,865
Hey, are you deaf?

559
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,505
To Puebla!

560
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,046
Look at that goal. What a goal!

561
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:39,690
I would have been happy,

562
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:44,530
so happy to just
spend time with Dalma

563
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,460
when she'd come to wake me up,
and not be afraid of her.

564
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:50,735
Dalma would come
wake me up: "Dad..."

565
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,469
Why? Because I was drugged out.

566
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:58,745
Giannina would slap me
and I wouldn't feel anything,

567
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,345
I was on drugs.

568
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:06,585
That's what
would have made me happy,

569
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,587
seeing my daughters grow up,
like her.

570
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,426
I envy Claudia.

571
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:20,796
I'm better-looking than she is,
but...

572
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,642
The difference is
that Claudia

573
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,778
shared those precious moments
with Dalma and Giannina.

574
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,240
You see?

575
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,716
Now when I watch them
in the videos

576
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:38,754
that Claudia sometimes
shows me,

577
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,120
I say: "Look what I missed."

578
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:46,624
"What an asshole I was
to have missed all that!"

579
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,435
Because you can't go back.

580
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:56,195
I spoiled what's most valuable,
the sentimental value...

581
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,609
The guilt I feel inside,

582
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,646
that's what I feel today,

583
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:10,287
the fact that I never spent an
ordinary birthday with Giannina

584
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:15,884
or an ordinary birthday
with Dalma. Why not?

585
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,860
Because when the party began
I'd go and get high.

586
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,727
And what did I feel? Nothing.

587
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,194
I felt they were my daughters,

588
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:32,476
but I didn't feel them next to me,
that we could hug each other.

589
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:38,472
I felt that my daughters
could tell I was on drugs.

590
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,983
Dalma,

591
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,089
when I'd go to kiss her,
would go like this.

592
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:52,085
The other one, no.

593
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,166
The chubby one, the little one,
with her character,

594
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:59,725
would come over, would give me
would lie down with me.

595
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,497
But not the other one.

596
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:05,442
When Diego
entered difficult times,

597
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,636
his wife Claudia turned into
his guardian angel,

598
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,907
into a woman who
held the keys to his family fortress.

599
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,351
Without returning to that fortress,

600
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,817
Diego would certainly
not have survived.

601
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:20,954
Although as my films prove,
I can't pretend to know women well,

602
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:24,721
in the case of Maradona's
it was easy for me to see that

603
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,490
saying that behind every
successful man stands a woman,

604
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,463
is an empty phrase.

605
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,530
Once I asked Claudia

606
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,660
how Diego had
managed to survive,

607
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,035
she replied no one asked me
how I have survived.

608
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,473
This only conform how limited
my knowledge of women is.

609
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,739
However I realized
that Claudia's battle for Diego

610
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,439
was not only driven by love,

611
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,609
but also by
an unusual religiousness.

612
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:52,347
In a slum I was born,
It was God's will

613
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,549
That I grow up and survive

614
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:58,253
This humble example to
face adversity

615
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:03,197
Eager to succeed in life
With each step I took

616
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,528
On the playground
I forged an immortal left hand

617
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:11,199
With experience
A burning ambition to make it

618
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:14,140
As a young buck,
I dreamed of the World Cup

619
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:18,044
And rising to the top in Primera

620
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:25,988
Perhaps by playing
I could help my family

621
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,025
From the very outset

622
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:32,024
The Doce cheered...

623
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,398
My dream contained a star

624
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,730
Full of goals and dodges

625
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,096
And all the people sang

626
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:45,899
The "Hand of God" was born

627
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,414
Sowed joy in the people

628
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,849
Brought glory to this land

629
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:58,118
Bearing a cross on my shoulders
for being the best

630
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:01,588
For not selling out
I confronted the powerful

631
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:05,093
Curious weakness
If Jesus stumbled

632
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:08,198
Why shouldn't I too?

633
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:11,827
Fame introduced me to
a white woman

634
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,370
Of mysterious taste
And forbidden pleasure

635
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,805
Who addicted me to
the desire to use her again

636
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,639
Taking my whole life

637
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,240
And this is a match that someday

638
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,377
I am going to win

639
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,078
From the very outset

640
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,418
The Doce cheered...

641
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:39,321
My dream contained a star

642
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,899
Full of goals and dodges

643
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,762
And all the people sang

644
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,338
The "Hand of God" was born

645
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,637
Sowed joy in the people

646
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:56,505
Brought glory to this land

647
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,932
I love you all!

648
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,941
- You don't want to go?
- No.

649
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,621
Cocaine,

650
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:06,052
instead of doing me good,
making me feel better,

651
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,261
shut me up inside of myself.

652
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,961
And any questions I had,

653
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,431
when I wanted to ask Claudia,

654
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,371
I kept them inside
and didn't know the answers.

655
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,680
Loneliness, you're filled
with bitterness, loneliness,

656
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:28,114
nostalgia,
that's what it gives you.

657
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:32,850
It was all inside me,
inside this body.

658
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:36,854
That was my biggest burden.

659
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:43,264
A thousand times,
the old lady tried to get me to stop,

660
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,827
tried to talk to me.

661
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,438
She wanted to ask me things
and when she did

662
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:54,603
I'd even lie to her,
because of the coke.

663
01:01:55,279 --> 01:02:01,582
In the name of La Tota,

664
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:06,921
Don Diego,
and the fruit of their love,

665
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:13,463
Diego.

666
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:16,794
We are gathered together
in this Maradonian Temple

667
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,135
to reaffirm the commitment and love,

668
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:24,001
through the Church of Maradona,
of our brother and sister,

669
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,770
Gabriel Diego Chepenecas

670
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,038
and Alejandra Diego Troilo.

671
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,514
They both vow, before this altar
and cradle of Diego himself,

672
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,779
to keep Maradonian faithfulness
and to declare

673
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,379
that Diego was, is and will be
the god of football.

674
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,652
Our Diego who art on the pitch,

675
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,955
Hallowed be thy left hand.

676
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,065
Thy magic come,

677
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,667
Thy goals remembered
on earth as they are in Heaven.

678
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,736
Give us this day our daily joy

679
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,862
and forgive those journalists,

680
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:58,702
As we forgive the Neapolitan Mafia.

681
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:00,742
Lead us not into temptation,

682
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:03,438
Deliver us from Joao Havelange.
Diego.

683
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:07,612
For 20 years,
during Havelange's presidency,

684
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,719
Brazil did not win the championship.

685
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:13,986
You know why?
The Man up there is just.

686
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,088
The Old Man loves justice!

687
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,286
lf, for 20 years,

688
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:24,198
a Mafioso was unable to
win the World Cup,

689
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,767
kind of tough, isn't it?

690
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:29,438
I'm going to tell you the story.

691
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:31,932
Argentina was eliminated
from the World Cup.

692
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,780
We went to play against Australia.

693
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,015
It was a tie, 1-1.

694
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:42,949
We came back here
and we qualified, 1-0.

695
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,446
There was no doping case.

696
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:51,025
No drugs.
Not over there, not over here.

697
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:54,595
There was no ephedrine
over there or over here.

698
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:57,666
No cocaine over there or over here.

699
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,928
During the World Cup

700
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:06,336
after we beat Nigeria, 2-1,
they said:

701
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,444
"They're screwing us up."

702
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:13,607
I'd say Havelange
is the arms dealer,

703
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,775
and Blatter sells the bullets.

704
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:20,517
Alejandra,

705
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,351
do you swear eternal love to
your partner Gabriel,

706
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,828
faithfulness to
the Maradonian Church's principles,

707
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,662
declaring that Diego,
our god of football was,

708
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:35,795
is and will be
the best player of all time?

709
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,572
Yes, I swear.

710
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,807
Gabriel Diego,

711
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:44,840
do you swear eternal love to
your partner Alejandra Diego,

712
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:47,780
and faithfulness to
our Church's principles?

713
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,215
Yes, I swear.

714
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,212
The Church of Maradona
declares you man and wife.

715
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,056
You may kiss the bride.

716
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,726
Remember,
the ball doesn't get dirty.

717
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:24,417
Goal!

718
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:25,775
The Goal of the Century

719
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,969
...when God became showman...

720
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,612
I'm an actor.

721
01:07:36,953 --> 01:07:41,617
I live life the way
I want to live it.

722
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:50,061
Actors are given a text
and they read it.

723
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,867
I don't read it. I live it.

724
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:59,236
That's my performance.
I live my life.

725
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:05,806
Is there any actor in the history
of cinema that you wanted to be?

726
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,246
De Niro.

727
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:10,216
- Raging bull?
- Yes.

728
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:13,288
I see him...

729
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,420
breaking everything!

730
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:23,561
In fact, I identify
with a lot of things.

731
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,964
With what the guy thinks.

732
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:32,039
With his desire to
destroy everything in his way.

733
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,767
I identify with all that.

734
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:40,008
It's just that he's a boxer
and I'm a football player.

735
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,118
That's the difference.

736
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:47,182
He wants to break everything,
I want to score goals.

737
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,524
- How are you, Emir?
- Good, good.

738
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:56,558
This is for you.

739
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,101
Thank you very much, Emir.

740
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:02,196
When did you arrive?

741
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:03,931
Two days ago. On your birthday.

742
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,303
I came to finish the movie with him.

743
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,213
Y he has to work?

744
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,214
Yes, little bit.

745
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,342
Oh, no!

746
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,382
Little bit to make
a best movie of him all the time.

747
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,724
We have to go to Mar del Plata...

748
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:28,827
Have you been with Fidel?

749
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,729
- NO, I go... I go next week.
- Ah, si?

750
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:34,900
- But you've been with Fidel? No?
- Yes!

751
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,207
We'll be happy to know
you're over there.

752
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:47,512
Let me tell you, just between us

753
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,915
and no one else...

754
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:52,920
No one but the 8 million people
watching us.

755
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:59,058
If I were the honorable president of
the United States, I wouldn't go!

756
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:11,597
I am following Diego's charisma
in this movie also.

757
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,766
In certain period before
we spoke about that

758
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:14,842
people need somebody to lead them

759
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:21,274
becuse the leaders of the world today
they are not good enough.

760
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,751
But one moment he asked me:
But who is the leader?

761
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,618
This time I think
he is the leader.

762
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,752
We set off on these journeys
with high hopes

763
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:33,294
that as small nations

764
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,456
our trains would end up
on the main line.

765
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,062
I remember as boys,
we jumped onto the trains

766
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:42,228
heading from the suburbs
to the centre.

767
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:43,771
As we were growing up,

768
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,841
we remembered
the sleepless nights

769
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:48,376
for the shadows of
the train compartments,

770
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:51,912
which flickered on
the ceilings of our pitiful flats.

771
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:54,642
They were the same games
of light and darkness,

772
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:56,217
noise and quiet,
as those of the trains on

773
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:59,322
which people were transported

774
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:02,653
by the fascist regimes to
their places of execution,

775
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:06,159
and by the Bolsheviks to
serve their hefty sentences.

776
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:15,637
When Father Was Away
on Businesss

777
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,173
They were long,
meandering trains,

778
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:23,370
whose light momentarily lit up

779
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:26,744
the faces of the girls
who taught us to kiss,

780
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:30,080
and while the shadows
flashed across naked bodies,

781
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,519
those trains took us
back to the arms of our wives,

782
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:36,421
of the children we
hadn't seen for a long time,

783
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,151
to warm embraces,

784
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:42,061
whether we be political prisoners
or non-believers.

785
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:58,146
When Father Was Away
on Businesss

786
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:25,206
...a force of God...

787
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:12,982
Son of a bitch!

788
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:16,481
You suck!

789
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,636
What a racket!

790
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:45,305
Long live the peoples of
Latin America and the Caribbean!

791
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:49,310
Long live Argentina!

792
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,853
The rain is going away.

793
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:56,789
I was told by our friend

794
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:00,191
Blanca Chancoso

795
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:05,564
that if you blow 3 times
the rain will go away.

796
01:15:06,803 --> 01:15:08,964
We have to blow upwards 3 times...

797
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,037
and the rain will go away.

798
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:21,378
And we will remain,
the peoples of America!

799
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:27,047
In the ALBA Express came
the driver, Diego Armando Maradona.

800
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,489
He came here
in the ALBA Express train.

801
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,165
Come on up, Diego!

802
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,336
Say something to these people,
Diego!

803
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:51,804
I love you!
Thank you for being here.

804
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,549
Argentina has great dignity.
Let's kick out Bush!

805
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,784
Long live Diego!

806
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:02,824
Long live Maradona!
Long live the people!

807
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,825
It's stopped raining.

808
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:12,661
Just in case,
we'll blow one more time.

809
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,011
Evo, a big welcome!
Come on up, brother!

810
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,575
Say something to the people!

811
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,543
Thank you, comandante!

812
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:33,054
Revolutionary greetings to all
the anti-imperialists of Latin America.

813
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:37,951
Good luck! Keep on fighting
to free Latin America! Thank you.

814
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:44,164
We've come here today
to do many things.

815
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:48,026
And we have all brought
a shovel with us.

816
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,332
A gravedigger's shovel!

817
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,242
Because here in Mar del Plata

818
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:59,246
we are digging
the grave of the FTAA!

819
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,351
The grave of the FTAA!

820
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:33,512
The Argentine victory
over the English

821
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,551
in 1986 in Mexico brought
Diego his first world title.

822
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:38,987
Justice triumphed and
at that time it was a justice

823
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:42,114
that was only attainable
through football.

824
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,649
Mar del Plata was not just

825
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:46,387
an emotional reaction
by the Latin Americans,

826
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:49,987
against whom the CIA organised
coups d'etat and military juntas,

827
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:54,160
and filled stadiums with civilians,

828
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,100
who would later be executed.

829
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,139
It was not only because of
the Nazi war criminals

830
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,174
who went unpunished
after the Second World War

831
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,506
and were smuggled to
North America

832
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:06,171
and later dispersed
throughout Latin America,

833
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:10,183
becoming advisors to dictators,
organising dissidents,

834
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:12,287
and killing socialist leaders.

835
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:16,791
In Mar del Plata, Latin America
refused to sign the ALCA agreement,

836
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:21,590
the foundation for which being the
liberalisation of imports and exports,

837
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:23,289
but which was
actually a cover for

838
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:26,368
the economic subjugation
of Latin America.

839
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:30,370
As was the agreement Mexico
signed in 1983.

840
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,841
That agreement was
called the NAFTA

841
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:36,570
and it was a marriage
between North America, and Mexico.

842
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,273
The USA and Canada
invested money

843
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:42,782
and thousands of jobs were
opened up for the Mexicans.

844
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,016
Everything would have been alright

845
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:49,113
if the profits had stayed in Mexico
and hadn't gone to the north,

846
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:52,318
leaving only the workers' salaries
in Mexico.

847
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:39,997
The Goal of the Century

848
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,586
07,03,2007.

849
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,121
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

850
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,080
So, two years later...

851
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:36,058
in march 2005
we started this movie

852
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,660
and at the hotel we were wondering

853
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:41,627
if we are going to
have access to Maradona.

854
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:44,096
We were dreaming
who Maradona is

855
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,395
and we are still at the same place.

856
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:52,968
What happened?

857
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:55,740
Nobody knows...

858
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:16,024
The decompensation was
mainly the result of disorders

859
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,498
related to eating, which
includes alcohol consumption.

860
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:20,431
Alcohol is a drug.

861
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:24,403
It's a case of decompensation.
No other dangerous drugs.

862
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,866
Really! It was fantastic!

863
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:59,900
I felt good on the pitch
because I felt important,

864
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:02,067
as if I really helped the team.

865
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:05,647
I don't want to be dramatic,
but they cut off my legs.

866
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:21,054
If someone makes a mistake,
football shouldn't pay for it.

867
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,465
I made a mistake and I paid.

868
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:29,070
But the ball doesn't get dirty.

869
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,370
Scoring a goal
in front of 100,000 people,

870
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,343
like I did with the English,
for example,

871
01:23:37,947 --> 01:23:42,316
was for me a normal thing.

872
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:48,122
It was my game, my life.

873
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:50,750
You understand?

874
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:53,725
When I came down,

875
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,997
I was like everyone,
like all of you.

876
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,327
And I could talk to you.

877
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,530
What messed me up
was cocaine.

878
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,001
But I was just like you.

879
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:11,204
However,
when you let the tiger out,

880
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,410
when I went onto the pitch,

881
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:17,152
I was in command.

882
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,294
The Goal of the Century

883
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,420
Emir,

884
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,727
do you know what a player
I'd have been if I hadn't taken coke?

885
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,539
What a player we lost!

886
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:16,269
It's like a bad aftertaste.

887
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:19,679
I could have been
much more than I am.

888
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:26,213
Yes, really, it's true.

889
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:31,084
I was born into football.

890
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,858
I knew who I was going to be.

891
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:37,461
But I didn't know I'd take coke.

892
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,591
I knew I was going to buy
a house for my mother,

893
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:45,799
to get married
and have my family,

894
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:49,069
to see the world,
that Argentina would win the Cup.

895
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,873
I said that when I was this big.

896
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,750
It's on tape!

897
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:01,354
I knew all of that.

898
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:05,352
But what happened afterwards...

899
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:08,429
There are still so many things
that today

900
01:26:08,898 --> 01:26:14,803
I feel terribly guilty about inside.

901
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,763
Because...

902
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:24,271
people might say that I'm fine,
or I'm better,

903
01:26:25,047 --> 01:26:28,710
or better than before.

904
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:31,950
But they're not inside me.

905
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:37,387
I know the things I did wrong.

906
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,026
And I can't right them.

907
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:43,795
If I were Maradona

908
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:45,764
I would live just like him

909
01:26:46,402 --> 01:26:48,734
If I were Maradona

910
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,032
in front of any goal

911
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,671
If I were Maradona

912
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:56,004
I would never
make a mistake

913
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:58,375
If I were Maradona

914
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:00,744
lost in any place

915
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:05,917
Life is a lottery
by night and by day

916
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:10,287
Life is a lottery
keep going and going...

917
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,901
If I were Maradona,

918
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:25,006
I would live just like him

919
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,637
A thousand fireworks,
a thousand friends

920
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:30,244
And whatever happens
at 1000 percent

921
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:32,506
If I were Maradona

922
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:35,014
I'd go on Mondiovision

923
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:39,780
To shout at the FIFA
that they're the real thieves!

924
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:44,256
Life is a lottery
by night and by day

925
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:48,823
Life is a lottery
keep going and going...

926
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,024
If I were Maradona

927
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:21,891
I would live just like him

928
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,728
Because the world is a ball

929
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:27,028
lived raw under the skin

930
01:28:27,169 --> 01:28:29,433
If I were Maradona

931
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:31,630
with a game to win

932
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,135
If I were Maradona

933
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:36,540
with a divine hand...
