1
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,272
My Purge playlist.

2
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,473
I put a lot of thought into it,
especially this final tune

3
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,679
as it will be the last
song you'll ever hear.

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,193
Tough choice.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,671
And then I thought,
George Clinton!

6
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,036
The king of interplanetary
funkmanship.

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,754
George's psychedelic rock will leave
you feeling funky, obviously.

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,113
And soulful, which is
the least I can do.

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,197
Now, we played a lot of Purge games
tonight, and we have just one more.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,791
It's simple,
yet effective.

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
It's called "Mommy's Choice."

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,840
Mommy, which one of you will
survive this year's Purge?

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,910
No! No!

14
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
No!

15
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,198
This is just one of a
dozen protests around our capital

16
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,909
after reports emerged claiming
that the New Founding Fathers

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,834
had been using the Purge to
help their own economic agenda.

18
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,959
Here's a recent statement by incendiary
Purge detractor Dante Bishop.

19
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,675
For the past 20 years,
the NFFA has taken to legalized murder

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,990
to decrease
the poor population,

21
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,674
which in turn keeps the
government's spending down.

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,355
Less welfare,
less healthcare, less housing.

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,911
Recent polling suggests
that the growing anti-Purge sentiment

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,879
may have a monumental effect on the
upcoming presidential election.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,509
Establishment NFFA candidate
Minister Edwidge Owens

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,594
has been losing ground to wildcard
Independent candidate Senator Charlie Roan.

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,670
Eighteen years ago, Roan was forced
to watch the brutal execution

28
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,910
of her entire family
on Purge Night

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,913
and entered the political arena
soon after with one goal in mind.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,434
To put an end to
the annual holiday.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,719
I have no doubt that the soul
of our country is at stake.

32
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,074
The Purge has
to come to an end.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,870
Senator Roan is proving to
be the greatest threat to the NFFA regime

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,838
since they first took
office 25 years ago...

35
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,679
Is the cunt that close?

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,511
All polls have her
a point behind.

37
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,954
I'm sorry, Caleb,
I've done...

38
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,878
No sorrys, Minister,
you're doing a great job.

39
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,675
Let us put you
where you need to be.

40
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,513
Thomas.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,915
We have our people out there countering
all this anti-NFFA bullshit.

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,835
What else
can we do?

43
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,515
We do
whatever it fucking takes!

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,914
I have had it with all
these idealistic pigs.

45
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,751
They want the impossible.
Everyone to have.

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,909
Some cannot have.

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Not enough
to go around.

48
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,313
It's time to do something
about all these cocksuckers,

49
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,273
like that rat Bishop
and the cunt Senator

50
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,032
trying to dismantle
everything we've built.

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,358
We are going to use
this year's Purge

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,750
to do some spring cleaning,
gentlemen.

53
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,376
And where will you
be spending Purge Night, Minister?

54
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,439
I will once again be presiding over
my party's Midnight Purge Mass

55
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,794
because I still
believe in it.

56
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,678
The Midnight
Purge Mass,

57
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,197
where our great NFFA leaders gather
together and slaughter innocents.

58
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,429
Is murder our
new religion?

59
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
Senator.

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,916
Murder is our new religion.
That's snappy.

61
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,353
No, the Midnight Purge Mass where
NFFA leaders gather to celebrate

62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,716
the night that saved this
country from economic ruin.

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
We have other ways.

64
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,952
Now, America is
built upon sacrifice.

65
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,392
From the Revolution
all the way to World War II.

66
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,837
Our Lord God sacrificed
his only Son...

67
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,632
Everybody look alive.

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,456
Copy. We have
eyes on her, boss.

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,789
That's why
we must sacrifice every year

70
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,031
in order to rid
ourselves of hatred.

71
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,157
Remember what I said.
She moves, we move.

72
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,838
Now, the stats are undeniable.
There has been far less crime...

73
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,976
This is crap.
Do I have to listen to this?

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,056
Send me to the
Principal's office.

75
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,399
I can't listen
to this anymore.

76
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,256
Okay, we'll send you to
the Principal's office

77
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
'cause you can't
keep your mouth shut.

78
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
More low-income
people are killed

79
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,715
during the Purge
than anyone else.

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,990
The money
generated from the Purge

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,117
lines the pockets of the NRA
and insurance companies.

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,428
Don't listen to her!

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,750
Any government system
that relies on violence

84
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,114
to answer
its problems

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,275
must be rebooted.

86
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,793
She's doing good,
Leo.

87
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,314
It is time to call upon the
better angels of our nature.

88
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,236
He is going
to keep lying.

89
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,794
Jesus Christ.
There she goes again.

90
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,871
Secure the audience.
I'm on it.

91
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,456
I'd like to talk to you guys.

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,029
Put a leash on her, Chief.
She's no good to anyone dead.

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,189
You got it, Leo.

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,909
- Okay. We're on the move.
- Copy, boss.

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,519
Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,114
Go sit down. I'm happy to stay
here for the rest of the night.

97
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,031
Stay close to her.
Keep it tight.

98
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,034
Go out. Purge and purify.
Purge and purify!

99
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,671
Hi. Thank you again.

100
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,111
As she's
done many times before,

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,475
Senator Roan broke
security protocol,

102
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,456
walking off the stage,
stepping into the audience.

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,835
Tell you this much,
she got 'em little titties,

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,275
but she got some
big-ass balls.

105
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,471
She ain't got
a snowball's chance

106
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,118
in a steam bath of
winning this thing,

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,952
but she be taking on
them ol' white-haired

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,678
George Washington
wannabe mofos

109
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
all by herself.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,831
And to that,
I say bully for her.

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,195
Oh, horseshit.
She's full of it too.

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,872
Nothing'll ever change.

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,234
Hey, Laney.
Laney, Laney?

114
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,272
I think we've offended Marcos
with our anti-Senator talk.

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,478
The Senator's
going to win.

116
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,313
She's gonna make real changes too.
You'll see.

117
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,913
All she needs
is Florida.

118
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,751
She gets the 29 electoral votes from
Florida, that puts her over 270.

119
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,711
- She can do it.
- Smartass.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,272
All that useless shit and can't
butter a damn bagel correctly.

121
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,112
I could butter your bagel, boss.

122
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,696
- Oh, you'd butter my bagel?
- Mmm...

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,711
Well, you got jokes
over there.

124
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,776
Yeah, you just be careful,
kid, with all that hope,

125
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,153
'cause it can be
a bad thing.

126
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,549
Hope can lead
to a lot of letdown.

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,789
Tell him, Irish I.

128
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,038
Excuse me, what?

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,033
I'm not
paying attention.

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,874
I'm thinking about
waffles and pussy.

131
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,951
That's all I ever really
think about, actually.

132
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
Mmm-mmm...
- Irish I, ladies and gentlemen.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,798
The fuck you laughing at?
I'm dead serious.

134
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Ah, fuck!

135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,757
The New Founding Fathers
believe in fairness.

136
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,400
And we hear what
the people are saying.

137
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,031
That the Purge benefits
the rich and the powerful.

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,519
That was never the intention.

139
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,675
From this point on,
no one is exempt.

140
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,312
The rules protecting level 10
government officials have been revoked.

141
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,512
Yeah. Come in.

142
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,749
You seeing this?

143
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,671
Yeah, NFFA is revoking
the Purge rule

144
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,816
that protects
government officials

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,671
of ranking 10
on Purge Night.

146
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,593
Yeah, I'll secure a safe house and
full security detail on the night.

147
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,875
No. I'm staying home
on Purge Night.

148
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,871
Senator, I don't think
that's a good idea.

149
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,678
If the voters get wind
that I'm hiding

150
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,751
in a fortress like
some rich asshole,

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,671
I lose votes
and the NFFA wins.

152
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,797
I stay home like
99% of the population.

153
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,199
Make it safe.
Whatever it takes.

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,995
Right.

155
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,709
Half price
on all masks.

156
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,391
Come on inside.

157
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,272
The Purge is
Halloween for adults!

158
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,633
Hordes of young adults are arriving
from Spain, Denmark, South Africa.

159
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,517
They're being called
Murder Tourists

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,318
as they are here
for one reason.

161
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,515
To Purge.

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,676
We're here to
experience the Purge.

163
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,479
To kill. Release all
the anger and hate.

164
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,393
To be like Americans.
We're very excited.

165
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,993
Foreigners coming
to our capital to kill.

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,277
Murder tourism. It's the new booming
business in our country this year.

167
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,312
Murder tourism.

168
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,670
What's happened
to our country, Joe?

169
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,834
Mrs. Sabian,
I wish I knew.

170
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,115
But you take care
of yourself, Mrs. S.

171
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,976
Next time you need something,
just give us a call.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,719
I'll have Marcos run it over
and save you the trip, okay?

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,269
I come by
to flirt with you, Joe!

174
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
What?

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,275
No one's
gonna take that from me.

176
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,296
Ah, you better get out of here. Get
on out of here.

177
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah!

178
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,799
Oh. Get out of here.

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,874
Now she nasty.

180
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,951
She... That's a nasty
woman, right there.

181
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,791
Joe. Mira.

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,472
Son of a bitch!

183
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,916
Where's he going?
I never saw him move so damn fast.

184
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,480
All right, girls, give it up.
I won't have to call the police.

185
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,316
Get outta my face,
old man!

186
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,234
Let's not do this the hard way, okay?
I'm giving you an out.

187
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,232
All right, give up the candy or
I'll have to take it away from you.

188
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,836
You touch me and I scream "rape,"
you cocksucking pig.

189
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,795
Now walk away.

190
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Give it back.

191
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,912
Who are you, bitch?
Better get out of my way!

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
That's Laney Rucker,
Kimmy.

193
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,834
Laney Rucker?

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,828
Holy shit.

195
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,832
OG Queen badass?

196
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,831
Yo! They called
you Pequeña Muerte.

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,515
Little Death.

198
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,715
Yo, you're my
motherfucking hero.

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,877
That makes me proud.

200
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,876
Now give back
whatever you stole.

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,991
And apologize.

202
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,874
Oh, my God.

203
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,710
Sorry, mister.
I was just playin'.

204
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,673
So, Ms. Rucker,
what happened to you?

205
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,518
You look all
whitish now.

206
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,473
Later, Ms. Rucker.
Wish I met you back in the day.

207
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,399
Excuse me.

208
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Well...

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,435
You were a lot more respectful back
when you were shoplifting here.

210
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,456
You know, I distinctly
remember one time,

211
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,515
you called me "sir."

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,919
Oh, bullshit.

213
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,112
But listen, I just want
to say thank you.

214
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,030
You're my family, Joe.

215
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,998
I appreciate that.
Thank you, Laney.

216
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,235
I want men in there.

217
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,039
I want men in there.
I want a lot of men back there.

218
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,918
She's got some security,
but I'm revamping the entire thing.

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,558
We got new barricades
on all the doors,

220
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,358
all the windows
back and front.

221
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,555
Looks safe.

222
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,256
Chief, if you tell me
it's safe one more time,

223
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,759
I'm gonna throw you
down the steps.

224
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,398
Please don't do that.

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,514
Men here. Men here.

226
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,716
We got a security monitor
system in this room.

227
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,916
We got eyes and
ears on everything.

228
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,194
This is her safe room.
She is not to leave her safe room.

229
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,278
No one is to go inside her safe room.
Do we understand each other?

230
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,616
This is a mess. She's not
gonna be happy about it.

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,976
I don't care if
she's happy, Chief.

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,356
And I want to go on record as
saying this is a bad idea.

233
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,509
No matter what
we do here,

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,433
this house and this Senator
are at risk on Purge Night.

235
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,317
You understand me?
Duly noted.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,433
Let's lock it down.

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,433
"Let's lock it down."

238
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,114
It's just me
and you, pal.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,997
Tell me what you want
me to do. I'm there.

240
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,896
Go downstairs, make sure
they take care of the doors.

241
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,751
Keep an eye on that guy. Done.

242
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,798
The NFFA has
created predatory capitalism

243
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,077
where profit-making
is the essence of democracy.

244
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,675
We've come to D.C.
to make some changes.

245
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,150
That was Dante Bishop.
Like his predecessor Carmelo Johns...

246
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Joe's Deli.

247
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,536
...Dante is suspected
of eliminating

248
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,656
wealthy NFFA supporters
on Purge Nights.

249
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Excuse me?

250
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,310
And many are wondering why he has
come to Washington this year.

251
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
Wait, wait. Hold it.
Wait a minute.

252
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,996
Why are you raising
my rates now? Today?

253
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,672
Do you know
what today is?

254
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,872
Yeah, but look, I...
Yeah... I can't afford that.

255
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,832
What do you mean,
you're sorry?

256
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,912
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Let me speak to your... Your super...

257
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,154
Son of a... Son of a bitch!

258
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,309
Joe?

259
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,109
What the hell's
going on?

260
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,838
The damn
insurance company.

261
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,510
They just raised the premium on
my Purge coverage. By thousands.

262
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,670
The day before
the damn Purge.

263
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,797
If I don't pay it by tomorrow,
I have no Purge coverage for this store.

264
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
They can't do that.

265
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,399
Yeah, well,
they just did it.

266
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,474
Just lock the
place down, Joe.

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,152
Yeah, but that's
not enough.

268
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,515
If I have no insurance,
I am screwed.

269
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,709
I'll just have to protect
this place myself.

270
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,736
- Are you crazy?
- That's not a good idea, boss.

271
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Look, we love
this place, too, Joe.

272
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
I've been coming here
since I was born.

273
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,228
But it's just stuff.
It can be replaced.

274
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,634
You can't be.

275
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,995
Yeah, but what about what you
do on Purge Night, Laney?

276
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Huh?

277
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,593
Is that not the pot calling
the kettle brown? No?

278
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,990
That's different, Joe,
and you know that.

279
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,435
I'm protected,
and you won't be.

280
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,231
This is all I got, guys.
This is my slice of the pie.

281
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,228
Man, I cannot,
I can't lose this place.

282
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,038
I can't lose this place.

283
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,669
Hold on, Joe.
Let's talk about this.

284
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,072
Everything is in place.

285
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,119
Team's in position.

286
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,431
Ten minutes
to lockdown, boss.

287
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,879
Hey, Mama.

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,319
You ready?

289
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,628
Yeah.

290
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,399
Vaya con Dios.

291
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,192
Okay, let's go.

292
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,869
Okay. This is gonna be home
for the next 12 hours.

293
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,315
You need anything,
you contact me and me only.

294
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,879
Clear?
Clear.

295
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,389
Let's begin.

296
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,351
This is not a test.

297
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,034
This is your Emergency
Broadcast System

298
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,680
announcing the commencement
of the annual Purge

299
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,751
sanctioned by the
U. S. government.

300
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,358
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime, including murder,

301
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,000
will be legal for
12 continuous hours.

302
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,399
Here we go.

303
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,231
Police, fire and
emergency medical services

304
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,154
will be unavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7 a. m.

305
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,279
And, for the first time
since its inception,

306
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,273
no one has been granted special
immunity from the Purge.

307
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,113
No citizen or group
will be exempt.

308
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,633
Blessed be our New Founding Fathers,
and America, a nation reborn.

309
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,792
May God be with you all.

310
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,831
I see you, Bobby.

311
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,976
You know you
can relax now, right?

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,070
No, I'll relax
in the morning.

313
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,152
Am I interrupting?

314
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,678
Senator, you should
be in the den.

315
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,136
Eric, thank you for
being here tonight.

316
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,195
My pleasure.

317
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,759
Leo, have a drink
with me.

318
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,038
You don't have a choice.

319
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,999
Sounds serious.

320
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,758
Don't say a word.

321
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,239
Or I'll stick my
foot up your ass.

322
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,109
Sit.

323
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,313
It's water, Leo.

324
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,479
Are you scared?

325
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,399
I'm terrified.

326
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,154
What made you apply
for this position?

327
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,792
I like your politics.

328
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,872
No. No bullshit.
I want a real answer.

329
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,229
I lost my son
some years ago.

330
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,239
He was killed.

331
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,896
I almost did something on Purge Night
that would've destroyed a lot of lives.

332
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,399
I want this night gone.

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,752
I know you do, too.

334
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,471
Especially after
what you lost.

335
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,552
Yeah. Despite
all of that,

336
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,795
you have a big problem
with how I do things.

337
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,352
You take risks, Senator.

338
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,796
My job is to eliminate
risks and keep you alive.

339
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,919
You don't
make that easy.

340
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,834
The soul of this country
is at stake, Leo.

341
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,954
The only way that I can win is to risk
everything, and that includes my life.

342
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,271
Peace, not Purge!

343
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,799
You go, girls!

344
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,711
Have a drink on us!

345
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,552
Can't you see
we're working?

346
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,838
Purge, motherfuckers!

347
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,677
Just gonna wait right here
and see what happens.

348
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,673
Purge!

349
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,158
They probably won't
bother us, okay?

350
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,470
Purge.
Purge. Purge.

351
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,475
Go, go, go! Let's move!

352
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,148
Help! Help! Please!

353
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,511
Somebody help! Help! Help!

354
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,358
Please! Please!

355
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,114
Stop! Stop!
Please, stop!

356
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,553
Please, help him!

357
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,277
Something's going down. Hey, looks
like someone needs our services.

358
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,436
Let's go.
Let's do this. Stop.

359
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,152
I shot my husband!
I shot him. Oh, God!

360
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,310
Okay. Calm down.
Tell me what happened.

361
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,796
Oh, no! It was
a mistake! I'm sorry!

362
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,755
Hey, boss!
It's me! It's me.

363
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,279
Come on
outta there, boy.

364
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,037
Good Lord, son.

365
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,437
It's Purge Night. You don't
sneak up on black people.

366
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,872
Good night,
blue cheese.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,237
Where the hell you going?
And why you carrying a chair?

368
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,919
I like sitting.

369
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,111
Yeah, well, you ain't
gonna be staying.

370
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,076
Look, you know I appreciate you coming
out here to watch my back, but I'm good.

371
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,354
I got this.
No.

372
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,872
I'll stay.
Nothing else to do.

373
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,030
Look, please don't
be a pain in the ass.

374
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,792
I want you to go
home and be safe.

375
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,635
I don't want you out here on
Purge Night, son. I got this!

376
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,872
Purge Night, bitch! It's Purge
Night, bitch! It's Purge Night, bitch!

377
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,831
Give me that shit. Let's go!

378
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,351
Fuck you!

379
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Ooh!

380
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,028
Happy Purge,
you old fuck!

381
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,950
You better find
someplace else to go!

382
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,630
I got a wicked
sweet tooth tonight.

383
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,551
And I want my candy bar.

384
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,554
And I'm gonna take it.

385
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,590
You don't got the balls
to stop me.

386
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Fuck!

387
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,314
I have the balls.

388
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,909
Now go.

389
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,313
I already took care
of my mom and dad tonight.

390
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,753
You're next.

391
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,680
I want my candy bar,
cocksucker.

392
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Come on!

393
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,192
So, what's up with that?

394
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,113
Every day in Juárez
was like the Purge.

395
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,117
I know how
to shoot, boss.

396
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,239
Son, I really wish
you'd stayed home.

397
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,397
I don't know.
It's that time.

398
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Eric.

399
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,576
What are you still doing up here?
You're on first floor duty.

400
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,794
How was your chat?

401
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,870
Enlightening. Go.

402
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,873
Chief, find a bedroom.
I got it from here.

403
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,433
All right, Leo.

404
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,429
Boys. Why don't
you take a break?

405
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,558
Go watch some TV, huh?
It's gonna be a long night.

406
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Yes, sir.

407
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,151
I'm coming
outside, boys.

408
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,677
How ya doing
out there, Bobby?

409
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,032
Sniper One,
radio check.

410
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,550
Bobby, radio check.

411
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,593
Sniper Two,
radio check.

412
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,033
Sniper Two.

413
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,478
Someone is coming for you.

414
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,439
What?
Put that on.

415
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,630
Leo, the house is surrounded...
Move, move!

416
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm moving.
What are you...

417
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,954
You said you had men on the roof.
You have snipers.

418
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,816
Not anymore. Not anymore.
What do you mean, not anymore?

419
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,989
Someone betrayed us.
What?

420
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,156
I can't trust anyone.
Put on that vest.

421
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,632
Listen to me!
This isn't a drill.

422
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,109
Someone's coming to kill you.
You understand me?

423
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,315
Move.

424
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,719
Moving.

425
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
What the...
Go!

426
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,936
Okay, what
the hell is that?

427
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,188
That's my little
secret. Move.

428
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,555
One, two, three!

429
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Okay.

430
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,831
Boss! It's just me!

431
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Fuck.

432
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,110
Where the hell is she?
Jesus Christ.

433
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,439
What the fuck is this?

434
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,830
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

435
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,280
Our mark may be
outside. Repeat.

436
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,555
Your mark may be outside.

437
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,352
Check your perimeters.

438
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,431
No payment
unless we find her.

439
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Fuck.

440
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,675
I see her!

441
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Down!

442
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Come here.

443
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,397
Move. Go! Go!
Go! Go!

444
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,708
Hey, Joe,
you up there?

445
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,869
Is that Laney?

446
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,589
Marcos!

447
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,756
My guys!
How you all doing tonight?

448
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,833
We're good. You?

449
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Ah...

450
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,275
I just dropped
someone off at triage.

451
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,236
His wife shot him because she couldn't
stand looking at his face anymore.

452
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,590
She said Purging didn't make her feel
any better like they said it would.

453
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,838
Just stay safe,
Lane.

454
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,313
Anything happens, do not
hesitate to call us.

455
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,791
Yeah, same goes for you.

456
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,479
Okay?
All right.

457
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,914
All right.

458
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,354
God, I hate that she's
out there like that.

459
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,788
Help me! Help me!

460
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,912
Stop. Stop!

461
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,509
What was that?
Some kind of homegrown militia?

462
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,160
Those were skilled mercs with
a lot of money behind them.

463
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,720
Enough to get to
someone on our staff.

464
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm guessing
it's the Minister.

465
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,435
The Minister, the NFFA,
the whole fucking lot of them.

466
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,999
I'm getting
too close.

467
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,275
It's a lot of blood, Leo.
We should call someone.

468
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,434
I don't know who to trust. We are
on our own. You understand me?

469
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,113
Okay. Where do we go?

470
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,391
East. Out of the city.
There are a lot of threats.

471
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,033
There's a lot
of death.

472
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,956
Purge
Sanitation Services.

473
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,232
Death collection haul.

474
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,952
Purge victim
removal and disposal.

475
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,752
Keep Washington clean.

476
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
It's okay.

477
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,673
Death collection haul.

478
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,911
This is how
it's gonna go now.

479
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,309
Like you said, fate of
the country's at stake.

480
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,637
Okay? It's my show now.

481
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,392
Look, I'm not
an idiot.

482
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,154
I know what you're capable of.
I'm the one who hired you.

483
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,536
But if I see something I don't like,
I'm not gonna be quiet about it.

484
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,675
It's not in my nature.

485
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,389
Senator, I need you to follow me.

486
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,275
Come on.

487
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,395
It's Tommy, sir.

488
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,556
He's in bad shape.
He's unconscious.

489
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,952
Everyone else
up there is dead.

490
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,838
Get him to the ground unit.
Get him stabilized.

491
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,957
Then start street surveillance.
I'll search from above.

492
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,317
We need her alive, so let's
find her before the crazies do.

493
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Sir.

494
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,279
They're tracking us.

495
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,713
Where? I'm not seeing them.
How are they seeing us?

496
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,474
Mercenaries?

497
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,434
No. That's a homemade
drone. Purgers.

498
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Now what?

499
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,314
Run. Fast.

500
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,113
Come, come, come!

501
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,153
It's behind you, Leo.
Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up.

502
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Down!

503
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,672
Reason I'm so hard on you, son,
like I am is

504
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,274
someday I'd like to
make you a partner.

505
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,676
Yep. Oh, boy. Coming here from
another country like you did.

506
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,551
Having your own business.

507
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,640
American dream
is still alive.

508
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,596
Whoo-hoo!

509
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,676
We love you, America. America is
the greatest country in the world.

510
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,557
We are gonna kill you.

511
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,917
We will now Purge.

512
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,953
We will torture you and violate
your flesh.

513
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,630
Remove your skin and
share in your blood.

514
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,958
This is the American way.

515
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,669
Senator.

516
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,199
Come with us.

517
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,636
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

518
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,799
Stay.
Yeah.

519
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Yeah.

520
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,752
Well, this is my place.

521
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,400
You can stay all night
if you want to.

522
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,794
Now, I got to ask you 'cause
I'm just a nosey old dog.

523
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,993
What in the Mississippi fuck was you
doing outside on Purge Night, Senator?

524
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,874
Yeah.

525
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,794
There was an assassination
attempt on me.

526
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,476
I can't thank you enough, Mr...
I'm sorry, I know you told me.

527
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,909
Dixon. You can call me Joe, Senator.
Yeah.

528
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,952
Joe, I'm Charlie.

529
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,155
Charlie.
Yeah.

530
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,639
That's Marcos
right there.

531
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,399
Marcos is...
He's a fan of yours.

532
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,758
Hi, Marcos.
Hey, Senator.

533
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,950
He actually think you can
win this thing. Oh, yeah?

534
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,548
Shit! Tell her what
she need to do to win, Marcos.

535
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,039
No, it's not
my place to say.

536
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,238
Well, you saved my life, Marcos.
I'd like to hear it, please.

537
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,076
Florida is the key.

538
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,791
You have to get
the elders.

539
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
That's smart.

540
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,031
He's not wrong, Joe.
What do you think?

541
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,391
I don't think you
got a damn chance.

542
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,518
Well, have
a little faith.

543
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,996
Well, I lost my faith in the system
a long time ago, Senator. Water?

544
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Thank you.

545
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,832
Place is moderately secure. Cameras.
Maybe we stay here.

546
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,358
"Maybe we stay here"? Where you going?
You going back out there?

547
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,274
Joe, do you have a first aid kit?
Leo, my security, was shot.

548
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,316
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

549
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,470
I'm fine.
You're not. Sit.

550
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,317
You want me
to take it off?

551
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,433
It's okay.
It's nothing.

552
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,238
Yeah? Doesn't
look like nothing.

553
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,256
Let me see.
Let me see.

554
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,400
I know a little bit about first aid.
I could help you.

555
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,835
The bullet's deep.

556
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,149
You need stitches.
Yeah.

557
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,275
But we can't
do that here.

558
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,476
Right. Clean it up. Patch it up.
Come on. Move.

559
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Okay.

560
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Fast. Come on.

561
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,037
What about you guys?
Who are you?

562
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,276
Is this necessary?
It's very necessary.

563
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,873
You, what's your name?
Where you from?

564
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,518
Marcos Dali.
Mexico City.

565
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,795
But I've been an American
citizen for two years.

566
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,279
You got a record?

567
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,713
Not here.

568
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,991
What did you do
in Mexico?

569
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,431
I tried to survive.

570
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,956
What are you doing
out on Purge Night?

571
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,473
Protecting the deli
against looters

572
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,835
because my boss lost his
Purge insurance yesterday.

573
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,434
Yeah, that's something
you can look into, Senator.

574
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,636
Insurance companies
screwing the working man.

575
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,153
Yeah?

576
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,071
What's your
name, pal?

577
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,536
You know what,
Mr. Secret Service Man?

578
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
You should be thanking my
black ass for helping you

579
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,113
instead of
interrogating me.

580
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,600
His name is Joe Dixon.

581
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,016
- Joe Dixon, have I offended you?
- Yeah.

582
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,096
Yeah, man,
just a little bit.

583
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,176
Your feelings are
not a concern of mine.

584
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,713
Little respect.
That's all I need.

585
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,597
Everyone shut up,
please!

586
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,428
What?
Look.

587
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,431
You stupid
motherfucker!

588
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,830
You should have let
us take the candy bar!

589
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,830
Now, you're gonna fuckin' pay for it,
you stupid son of a bitch!

590
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,953
Whoo!

591
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,557
It's a good night
to Purge, isn't it?

592
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Oh, hell!

593
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,234
Who the hell
is that?

594
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,896
The looters I was
telling you about.

595
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,956
Purge Night, Senator.
What did you expect?

596
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,193
Hey, you old fuck!
I'm back.

597
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,272
And I brought
some friends.

598
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,518
And I'm gonna
get that candy bar.

599
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,296
They have chainsaws
and they're coming inside.

600
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,736
All right. I got to
get you outta here.

601
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,318
Yeah, but they're
at both entrances.

602
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,551
Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you
and burning this bitch to the ground!

603
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,312
I gotta call her.

604
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Who?

605
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,716
We have a friend out
there in a triage van.

606
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,638
You trust this friend?

607
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,234
Hey, you still
questioning my integrity.

608
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,709
Boy, you are
a piece of work, man.

609
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,080
Come on,
girl, pick up.

610
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,396
Those motherfuckers
blindsided us, man.

611
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,976
I gotta get back out there.
No, no, no.

612
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,753
You're not going anywhere.
I told your mom I'd look after you.

613
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,416
Just hurry up. Hurry up and bandage
me up so I can get back out there.

614
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,096
Okay, you promised me you
were gonna stay home tonight.

615
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,439
Well, I want
to Purge tonight.

616
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,748
No.
I want to Purge.

617
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,512
Laney, what? Laney!

618
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,736
For real, Laney?

619
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,875
Yeah. For real.

620
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,757
You heard me right.
Senator Roan.

621
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,638
Call me back, Lane.
We need you bad.

622
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,793
She'll call back.

623
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,633
We can't count on your friend.
These kids will be in here soon.

624
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,635
What do we do?

625
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Okay.

626
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,988
We're gonna work as a team
to protect this woman.

627
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,355
You gentlemen understand
what's at stake here, yes?

628
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,631
Yes? All right.
Yes.

629
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,277
We are gonna
Purge today

630
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,430
Purge today, Purge today

631
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,190
We are gonna Purge today
Burn this bitch down

632
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,629
Fuck!

633
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,950
Okay, you take the back,
I'm gonna take the front.

634
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,189
I'll take the front
with you.

635
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,920
No, you're not gonna
be on the frontline.

636
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,155
Are you crazy, Leo?
Give me a gun.

637
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,056
I will give you a gun, but you're not
on the frontline. Over my dead body.

638
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,433
Then you better
drop dead.

639
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,558
I think
he's right, Senator.

640
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,789
Thank you, Deli Man.

641
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,077
Deli Man? I agree with you,
you still throwing attitude?

642
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,594
Okay, enough!
Executive decision.

643
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,069
I'm with Leo. We need as
many guns as we can get.

644
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,720
Go, go, go!

645
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,115
Move, move, move!

646
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
Down.

647
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,117
Just point and shoot.
Do not shoot me.

648
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,831
If I want some candy,
I'll take some candy!

649
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,309
I'll take whatever
the fuck I want!

650
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,995
My mom's not
gonna like this!

651
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,710
This is what the Purge is all about.
Me getting mine.

652
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,434
You getting yours and
nobody stopping anybody!

653
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,552
Bye-bye, motherfucker!

654
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,110
Say goodnight, cocksucker.
Because here comes your candy girl!

655
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,519
Here they come.

656
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,400
Fucking asshole!

657
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,315
Hold on!

658
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,275
Wait here.

659
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,239
Pequeña Muerte
is back, bitches.

660
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,394
Hey, guys!
I got your message.

661
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
Laney!

662
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,715
This is our girl.
Go, go, go!

663
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,837
Holy shit,
it really is you.

664
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,995
Where do we go?
The van.

665
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,520
Go.

666
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Come on, Joe.

667
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,431
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be there.

668
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,075
Joe, come on.

669
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,390
You get out of here,
kid. I'm staying.

670
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
They'll kill you.

671
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,029
Go now!

672
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,794
If you stay, I stay.

673
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,228
Just leave.

674
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,828
Joe, listen to me.

675
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,136
For some reason, the Senator
ended up in our neighborhood,

676
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,513
in your deli.

677
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,955
Maybe it's our duty
to help protect her.

678
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,109
We'll rebuild the deli.
Whatever it takes, you and me. I promise.

679
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,077
Come on, guys. Now!

680
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,156
Where we headed?

681
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,595
Underground triage center
service in the community.

682
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,312
It's completely secure.

683
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,789
Expand our perimeter. They're on foot.
They can't be far.

684
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,237
Earl, spoke
with the ground unit.

685
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,517
Tommy regained
consciousness.

686
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,034
Says he got a shot off
at the Senator's security.

687
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,350
He thinks the bullet
is lodged in his shoulder.

688
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,871
How the hell did
it get to this?

689
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Who is he?

690
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,119
Why is he cuffed?

691
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,591
Rondo. Two bullet holes delivered by
a rival gang, but he's a good kid.

692
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,555
He's chained up because I didn't
want him Purging anymore.

693
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,435
So, Senator...

694
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,795
NFFA made a move
on your ass.

695
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,838
Seems that way.

696
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,674
Goddamn conniving, duplicitous,
crooked, cocksucking politicians.

697
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,389
Agreed.

698
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,433
We're not
all that bad.

699
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,755
My experience, Senator?

700
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,957
My people are on our own, no matter
what you all say or promise.

701
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,237
I'm kinda confused here.
Who the hell is this lady?

702
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,080
You big dope!

703
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,429
You give people from the
neighborhood a bad name.

704
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,878
Just some Purgers.

705
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,792
That's crossfire.

706
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,073
Not for us.

707
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,231
You seem really close.

708
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,199
How do you know
each other?

709
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,272
Joe gave me a job seven years ago
when I first came here from Mexico.

710
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,757
I've been working
for him ever since.

711
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,274
And you?

712
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,110
Joe's been looking out
for me since I was a kid.

713
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,351
And he helped me
get out of the life.

714
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,955
Sounds like Joe
is a saint.

715
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,111
Yeah, well,
I ain't no saint.

716
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,112
I'm just doing my part.

717
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,394
Riding around in a van,
on Purge Night, helping people?

718
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,352
It's pretty dangerous.

719
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,472
Unwritten Purge rule is leave
the triage units alone.

720
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,394
It's true,
for the most part.

721
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,672
Seriously, Laney, who the
hell are these people?

722
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,720
Do you read?

723
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,594
Down! Everybody down!

724
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,416
- Anybody hit?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

725
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
You sure?
Yes.

726
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,152
Laney!
I'm okay.

727
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,671
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Rondo is dead.

728
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,800
What the fuck was that?

729
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,920
They found us, Senator.

730
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,198
I want you to turn left!
Go under the freeway.

731
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,793
Move! Move!
Yes.

732
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,755
Tonight,

733
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,795
the gates of hell will
open and invite me in.

734
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,037
It's survival of
the fucking fittest.

735
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,117
Who's the fittest?

736
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,754
I'm the fittest of them all!

737
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,992
What the fuck? We're gonna
lose them under there.

738
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,275
Ground unit,
get your asses moving

739
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,476
and get here now.
We got them cornered.

740
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,039
Turn here and stop.

741
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Do we just
wait here?

742
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,757
No, they'll have units on the ground.
They're gonna be all over us.

743
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,376
We all better figure it out fast
'cause I don't like it here.

744
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,960
It doesn't make any sense.

745
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,216
There was no way they could've
known we'd be in this van.

746
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,549
Doesn't matter.
They did.

747
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,828
You son of a bitch.

748
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,035
Leo?

749
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Leo?
Move.

750
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Leo.

751
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,553
Oh!

752
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,471
Leo, what the hell
are you doing?

753
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
Leo, what...

754
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,872
Trace bullet.
That's how he found us.

755
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,792
Just leave it
here and drive away.

756
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,096
They'll never know
we left here.

757
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,908
Yeah, well, I wish it were that simple.
You all need to see this.

758
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,511
There's a whole bunch of
negroes coming right this way.

759
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
And we sitting up here

760
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,195
like a bucket of motherfucking chicken.

761
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,753
What's your ETA?

762
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,313
Two minutes, Earl.

763
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,399
Open the door, now!

764
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,309
What are we gonna do?

765
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,496
They'll start
blasting if we move.

766
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,919
They'll start blasting
if we don't.

767
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,391
Open the door!
Open the door, now!

768
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,551
Open the goddamn doors!

769
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,315
What's the plan?

770
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,237
Yo, yo, yo!
Quiet down! Quiet down!

771
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,880
- What the hell is that?
- Quiet down!

772
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,960
I know what I heard.
I know what I heard.

773
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,391
I told you I ain't no saint.
Everybody's got a past.

774
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,278
That was a Crip whistle.
They just threw it back.

775
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,352
If this is the right set,
we should be good.

776
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,712
I know, I know
what I heard. I know.

777
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,794
All right.

778
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,873
We're not gonna hurt you.
Just help my fuckin' boy. He's gonna die.

779
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,158
We help you,

780
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,751
you do something
for us.

781
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,896
They're still under the overpass,
but they're on the move.

782
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,797
Get your asses in there.

783
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,436
They stopped.
Stop the truck.

784
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,199
We're going on foot.

785
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,875
Clear!

786
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,636
Earl, we found the trace bullet,
but no sign of the target.

787
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,478
Yeah, we're heading back.

788
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,518
Ground unit, come in.

789
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,472
Ground unit, come in.

790
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,549
Come in, I need a fuckin' sitrep.

791
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,760
Fuck you, motherfucker!

792
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,319
No one following.

793
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,149
We're clear.

794
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,237
We're a few blocks away.

795
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,196
I'm gonna call in and tell
them we have a special guest.

796
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,235
Where are we?

797
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,029
You'll see.

798
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,068
What is this place?

799
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,358
We call this
a Safe Zone.

800
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,718
Senator, Dante Bishop.
Mr. Bishop.

801
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,279
This is Angel.

802
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,352
Dawn called. Told me you
guys were coming through.

803
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,794
So the NFFA came
at you tonight?

804
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,430
Can't say
I'm surprised.

805
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,913
Let me show you around,
get you settled in.

806
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,753
You set all this
up, Mr. Bishop?

807
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,398
Yes, this is
my organization.

808
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,157
We have doctors, and
nurses, EMTs, paramedics.

809
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,356
This is their way of
protesting this damn night.

810
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,718
How many people
know about this place?

811
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,634
Just the volunteers, and the
homeless that we invite in.

812
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,072
Look, these are the real
victims of the Purge.

813
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,351
The people that the NFFA
are trying to eliminate

814
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,193
so that they don't have to
take care of them anymore.

815
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,271
These men that are armed,

816
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,635
you'll have them at all the
entrances and the rooftop?

817
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,109
Yes. My men will
keep you safe.

818
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,910
Or as safe as you
can be on Purge Night.

819
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,039
Appreciate it.

820
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,028
Mr. Bishop.
Yeah.

821
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,793
Thank you, for all of this.
I am impressed.

822
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,272
Well, don't thank me.
Thank the volunteers.

823
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,877
Mr. Bishop,
I've heard stories

824
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,550
of tactics that you
employ on Purge Night.

825
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,189
I can't say that
I agree with any of it.

826
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,473
I'll tell you what.

827
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,069
You get elected,

828
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,438
you stop this night,

829
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,238
and I don't have
to do what I do anymore.

830
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,159
Let's go, Angel.

831
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,388
Fair enough.

832
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,073
You hold down
the fort here.

833
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,153
Keep an eye on her. And keep her
and her people quiet. Okay?

834
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,713
All right,
let's go!

835
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,632
I want access to every
surveillance camera in the city.

836
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,110
We'll do a grid search
for that fucking triage van.

837
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,708
It's out there somewhere.
Find it.

838
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,520
Yeah.

839
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,797
Your crew? Your guys?
They feel like family?

840
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
Boss.

841
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,638
We did the
right thing.

842
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
Yeah.

843
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,592
But it's time to go.

844
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,593
Gotta get back
to the deli.

845
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,836
What? No. Are you fucking crazy?
We're safe here.

846
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,070
Laney, you know I'll
walk back if I have to.

847
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,031
Fine. I'll drive you.

848
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,512
But if we run into any problems,
we're coming right back here.

849
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Deal.

850
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,520
Really? Can you do that?

851
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,075
We'll see her
again, Marcos.

852
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,358
And she's safe here.

853
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,674
Let's hit it.

854
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,757
I don't know, but I bet it
was really cool.

855
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,874
It is, it is.

856
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,078
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

857
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,480
Good.

858
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,875
I'm gonna go take a look around.
Okay.

859
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,629
Stay here.

860
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,313
Okay, boss.

861
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,878
What are you
doing here?

862
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,075
Hand.
Why are you here?

863
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,073
What the hell's
going on here?

864
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,310
He was snooping around!
Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay.

865
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,190
Hey! Hey.
It's all right. It's all right.

866
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,754
Red, back up.
It's okay.

867
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,993
Just put the gun down, all right?
Everybody's okay.

868
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,149
Back up.

869
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,829
We're okay.

870
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,470
All right?
All right?

871
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,634
We're good.
It's all good, okay?

872
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,392
I'm just getting
my weapon.

873
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,519
What's going on?

874
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,828
Just doing my job.

875
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,558
Senator, it's just
a misunderstanding.

876
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,517
Why don't we
go back outside?

877
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,989
Come on.

878
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,936
Are you seeing this, Leo?

879
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,439
Yes, Senator.

880
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,113
Senator, why don't
we go outside...

881
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Stop.

882
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,108
Those are the Minister's
biggest financial supporters.

883
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,038
The NFFA.

884
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,429
Our Lady of Sorrows.

885
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,034
Is that where the Minister is going
to be tonight for the Purge Mass?

886
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,111
- We believe so.
- You believe...

887
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,553
What is all this?

888
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,636
Why do you have all this?

889
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,597
You're gonna assassinate him.

890
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,472
You're gonna assassinate the
Minister tonight, aren't you?

891
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,840
You know, somebody's
got to say it out loud.

892
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,958
What in the fuck
happened tonight?

893
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,712
Nobody's gonna
believe it.

894
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
Mmm-hmm.

895
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,439
Irish Ike's gonna
be like, "Bullshit.

896
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,950
"Now where's my waffles and pussy?"
"...and pussy?"

897
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,238
He got that
one-track mind.

898
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,436
That boy done
lost his mind.

899
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,589
Shit.

900
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,993
I hope he's
okay tonight.

901
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,915
Yeah.

902
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,192
Hold on, guys.
Look.

903
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,311
Those are
government trucks.

904
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,074
I saw them on YouTube
from last year's Purge.

905
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,915
And they're going straight
back towards the Safe Zone.

906
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,555
You cannot do this. I need to win
this thing fair and fucking square.

907
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,950
They are not playing fair and fucking
square and neither should we.

908
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,270
This church will be
locked up like Fort Knox.

909
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,560
You'll never get through.
You're gonna get slaughtered.

910
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,950
Four churches were
built on that site.

911
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,316
The original by your boy George
Washington over 200 years ago.

912
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,233
The man liked to have escape tunnels
attached to all his structures.

913
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,639
They're all over D.C.

914
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,517
The tunnel under
the original church

915
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,750
has been closed up
since the '50s.

916
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,068
But we reopened it.

917
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,560
We're gonna walk
right through there

918
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,592
and into that church without
anybody even knowing it.

919
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,514
The original Founding Fathers are about
to fuck over the New Founding Fathers.

920
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,909
Now how you like
that for irony?

921
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,151
How do you know where
this mass is gonna be?

922
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,835
Because we do whatever it takes.
We did this for you, Senator.

923
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,576
No, it's not for me. Get your boss
on the phone. I need to talk to him.

924
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,830
He's not here.
Angel, listen to me.

925
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,035
You call him.

926
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,830
You tell him he does this and
the Minister becomes a martyr.

927
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,037
I cannot have my presidency
built on murder. You see that.

928
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,549
He will not leave
this to the voters.

929
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,676
He does not believe
in the American system.

930
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,296
Angel, believe in me.
I can make this happen.

931
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,096
We do. That's why we're
trying to pave a way for you

932
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,696
to the White House
so you can make changes.

933
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,056
You're gonna
cost me the White House.

934
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,640
It's Laney. She says there's
trucks approaching us.

935
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,720
What?

936
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,229
Who is that?

937
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,913
Government soldiers.

938
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,356
That's the NFFA eliminating
all their enemies this year.

939
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,352
They're here for Bishop,
but they will kill you.

940
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,776
You need to evacuate your people.
We can't move the injured.

941
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,792
I need to get her out of here now.
There's a way out back.

942
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,074
Where does it
come out?

943
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,878
The alleyway down to
Third and Thompson.

944
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,640
Third and Thompson.
Give me the phone.

945
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,634
Laney, I need you
at Third and Thompson now.

946
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,312
Yeah, we'll meet
you there.

947
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,475
So, we're driving right
back into that war zone?

948
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,153
Stupid!

949
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,314
All these people.

950
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,879
We'll protect them.

951
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,837
Please, stop
the assassination.

952
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,394
It's too late. Now go.
Stay safe. Go!

953
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,713
So what we supposed to be, like
some superheroes or something?

954
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,915
That ain't what I do.

955
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,674
I hate this night!

956
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,832
Ah, shit. Hell with it.
Come on. Shit.

957
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,678
Let's do it.
Let's go get 'em.

958
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,916
I can't believe
we're outside again.

959
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,359
I'm gonna get
you through this.

960
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,756
My God, it's so close!

961
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,120
At your own risk now!

962
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,398
Are you fucking
kidding me?

963
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,629
Ready?
Yeah.

964
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,358
- One.
- Go for it!

965
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,714
- Two.
- Try your luck!

966
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,315
Go!

967
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,389
Good luck out there!

968
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,189
Let me
hear you whisper

969
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,637
That you love me too

970
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,670
Keep the love-light glowing
in your eyes so true

971
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,909
Let's go, let's go!

972
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,229
Come on, I got you.

973
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,474
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

974
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,835
Thank you. Again.

975
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,309
Where we headed?

976
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,391
Drive. Out of this city.
Get us out of here.

977
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,720
You okay, Senator?

978
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,874
No, Marcos. I'm not.

979
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,876
This night
corrupts everyone.

980
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,196
Senator.
I can't win like this.

981
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,350
It goes against everything
that I believe in.

982
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:50,677
We need to focus on one thing
right now and that's survival.

983
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,910
I need to make sure you
get through this night.

984
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,713
I have to stop them
from killing the Minister.

985
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,800
What?

986
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,475
If they assassinate him,
he becomes a martyr. We lose.

987
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,228
Yeah. And how
do we do that?

988
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,958
I don't know.
We have to do something.

989
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:12,074
Do what? Do what? You're willing to
risk your life to save an assassin...

990
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,748
Everybody all right?

991
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,472
Joe, you okay?

992
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,114
I'll be okay.

993
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,514
Leo!

994
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,068
Gun!

995
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,876
I know where they're taking her.
I know why she's still alive.

996
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,960
Where?

997
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,713
You find a safe place
to hide and you stay there.

998
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,711
No. No way.

999
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,473
Whatever it is you plan on doing,
we're coming with you.

1000
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,835
Let's go.

1001
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,116
May the Purge
protect us. Keep us pure.

1002
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,197
Purge and purify.

1003
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,792
May the Purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

1004
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,839
Purge and purify.

1005
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,513
May the Purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

1006
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,674
Purge and purify.

1007
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,796
Come on, guys,
that's enough.

1008
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,197
We're getting paid to deliver
the package, not gift-wrap it.

1009
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,199
Come on, let's go find a place to wait
out the rest of this fucking night, huh.

1010
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,470
As we always do.

1011
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,231
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

1012
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,155
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

1013
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,633
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

1014
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,271
Well, it's been
a long journey

1015
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,955
to get away from the lies
and the self-deception

1016
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,640
to this place of knowledge and
awareness of who we really are.

1017
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,029
People of flesh,
immensely flawed.

1018
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,195
It's hard to see
the ugly truth.

1019
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,829
But change can only
come from acceptance.

1020
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,476
And change we must,
as it is our godly duty

1021
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,399
to get rid of the fury
and the hatred

1022
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,995
that poisons our souls,
makes us sick.

1023
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,151
Makes us ugly.

1024
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,755
Tonight,

1025
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,876
we, the leaders of
this great country,

1026
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:43,268
will sin, scour, sanitize
and sterilize our souls

1027
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,309
until we are free again, and this
country will be better for it.

1028
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,595
We are not hypocrites!

1029
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,919
We practice what we preach.

1030
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,429
Purge and purify!
Say it with me.

1031
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,152
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

1032
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,836
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

1033
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,230
Purge and purify!

1034
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,311
Let us begin.

1035
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,154
All right, look, it's after midnight.
We need to move.

1036
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,798
I need a four-man
team in there.

1037
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,110
I need three with me.
Got it? Go!

1038
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,872
Bishop!

1039
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,789
Bishop!

1040
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,360
Bishop!

1041
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,555
Bishop!

1042
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,359
I'm unarmed.

1043
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,636
How well do you
know this Dante?

1044
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,075
Not well. So keep
your eye on him.

1045
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,075
Our boy is gonna
get himself killed.

1046
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,829
I'm unarmed.

1047
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,591
You know this
lunatic, Dante?

1048
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,677
Yeah. I do.

1049
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,394
Guns down.

1050
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,152
What the hell
are you doing here?

1051
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,196
Trying to get
yourself killed?

1052
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,397
Is that the tunnel
for the cathedral?

1053
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,590
How the fuck do you
know about the tunnel?

1054
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,872
I asked you a question.

1055
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,879
This is no longer an assassination.
This is a rescue mission.

1056
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,677
Jesus died for their sins.

1057
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,790
And now,
our modern-day martyrs

1058
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,235
will die for our trespasses.

1059
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,118
Our martyr's name
is Lawrence.

1060
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,677
A lifelong drug addict.
He wants to make amends.

1061
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,953
He wants to serve his God
and his government.

1062
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,950
Let's thank Lawrence
for his gift.

1063
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,792
Thank you, Lawrence.

1064
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,913
Thank you for your gift, Lawrence.
Thank you very much, Lawrence.

1065
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,238
We love you,
Lawrence.

1066
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,475
These weapons have been
cleansed with holy water,

1067
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:38,476
and they are now
instruments of destruction.

1068
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Fuck!

1069
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,715
You all know
the loyal Harmon James.

1070
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,630
Worked with the NFFA
tirelessly for many years.

1071
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,070
Harmon will be the first
Purger of the evening.

1072
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,516
I'm sorry. No, no, no. Please,
please, please, please. No, no, no.

1073
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,272
Please, no, no!
I'm sorry! No, please!

1074
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,433
No! I'm sorry!
Please, no, no!

1075
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,559
Please, no!

1076
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,035
Please! No!
Please, please!

1077
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,758
I'm sorry!
Release, Harmon.

1078
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,040
No!

1079
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,560
No!

1080
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,510
Release the violence
from your darkened heart!

1081
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,637
Scour your soul.
Let the light in.

1082
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,075
You are blood-baptized.

1083
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,715
And you are born again!

1084
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,593
His light entered
your heart, Harmon.

1085
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,920
Yeah.

1086
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,550
The power of Purging!

1087
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,671
Purge and purify!

1088
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,230
Purge and purify!

1089
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,154
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

1090
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,793
Purge and purify!

1091
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,160
Psst.

1092
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,519
No matter what happens,
we stay together.

1093
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,148
All right, this takes us
to the mechanical room.

1094
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,470
From there, we can
access the cathedral.

1095
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,478
Stay there.
Where do we go?

1096
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,797
The church is above us.
So are 50 Secret Service agents.

1097
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,189
You're gonna take the
staircase to the balcony.

1098
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,272
Me and my guys, we're gonna enter from
behind the altar and this side here.

1099
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,960
Okay, good. Let's go
get our girl, yeah?

1100
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,792
Before we get to our communal Purge,
the Holy Horde of Many Martyrs,

1101
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,474
I'd like to introduce
a guest

1102
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,393
who's going to be the centerpiece of a
very special Purge ceremony tonight.

1103
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,394
This person

1104
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,475
has threatened to
dismantle everything

1105
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,592
that we, New Founding
Fathers, have done.

1106
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,955
We must rid ourselves

1107
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:49,875
of the negative emotions
that she has stirred inside.

1108
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:56,274
We must stop her from
poisoning our great country

1109
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,957
by taking away
our freedoms.

1110
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,360
Yes!

1111
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,034
I would like all the Founding
Fathers to come to the altar.

1112
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,033
Join me, brothers,

1113
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,712
as we eliminate evil

1114
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,557
and Purge as one.

1115
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,878
There is a fountain
filled with blood

1116
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:40,352
Drawn from Immanuel's veins

1117
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:46,911
And sinners,
plunged beneath that flood

1118
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,395
Lose all their
guilty stains

1119
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,599
Lord of Air,

1120
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,832
Lord of Earth,

1121
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,357
we ask that you receive this
child into your loving arms.

1122
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,389
We are sinners.

1123
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,238
Let us release.

1124
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,228
Caleb, our leader,

1125
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,597
I invite you, sir,
to lead us in this Purging

1126
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,709
as you have
and as you will.

1127
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:47,752
Blessed be our New Founding
Fathers for letting us Purge.

1128
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,716
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

1129
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,389
Rifle!

1130
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,678
She's alive.

1131
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:11,989
Down!

1132
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,958
Where you all at?

1133
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,071
The hell are you
all doing up there?

1134
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,591
Bring your asses
down here.

1135
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,794
My negro.

1136
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,035
Let's go.

1137
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,952
- Thank you.
- I got you. I got you.

1138
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,720
Hi.

1139
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,276
You okay?
Yeah.

1140
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,116
Thank you. Again.

1141
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,360
What was that?

1142
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,954
My men taking care of business.
Go cover me.

1143
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:41,112
We're headed out.
Back exit. We have her.

1144
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,877
And we have him.

1145
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,760
Move.

1146
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,040
Hey!

1147
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,456
- Listen to me.
- Get off of me.

1148
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,550
- Mr. Bishop. Please.
- Watch our backs.

1149
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,358
Just take a second
and listen to me.

1150
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,074
It's on our way to the exit.
I can win without this.

1151
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,536
Please!
Cover our backs.

1152
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,755
You will win.
I'm gonna make sure that happens.

1153
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,159
Open up!
Stop.

1154
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,240
This is murder.
If you do this,

1155
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,231
you will be no
different than them.

1156
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,320
Get her.

1157
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,998
Nope! Don't.

1158
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,519
Listen to her.

1159
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,999
She knows
what she's doing.

1160
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,591
We don't need to do this.

1161
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,432
Hang on, Dante.

1162
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,192
Get the fuck
out of my way.

1163
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,719
Wait, please!

1164
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,998
Don't do this.

1165
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,790
If you do this, you will
be no different than them.

1166
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,872
We can't be like them.

1167
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,634
Look at me.

1168
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,275
Purge,

1169
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,439
my son.

1170
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,071
Purge.

1171
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:12,710
It's your right
as an American.

1172
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,549
Kill me. Kill me.

1173
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,389
Purge.

1174
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,717
You're a son of God.

1175
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,552
God wants you to Purge.
Shut the fuck up!

1176
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,275
Coward.

1177
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,074
Purge!

1178
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,832
Do it! Do it! Yes! Yes!

1179
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,753
Kill me!

1180
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,510
Now, I'm gonna tell you right
now, I like black people,

1181
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,994
but I ain't gonna let you all
shoot these white folks.

1182
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,513
These are our white people.

1183
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,600
Okay?

1184
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,915
So, let's put 'em down.

1185
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,872
You better fucking win.

1186
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,231
Go. Go.

1187
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,475
Move!

1188
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,473
Oh, my God.

1189
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,674
You murderous pig.

1190
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,909
I am gonna beat the shit out
of you on election day.

1191
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,235
I'm not as politically
correct as the Senator.

1192
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,958
Good night,
blue cheese.

1193
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,438
Well played, Leo.

1194
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,714
Thanks, Joe.

1195
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,508
Come on, man.

1196
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,268
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1197
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,032
We have to get
you out of there.

1198
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,872
Stay here,
we'll find a vehicle.

1199
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,440
What about these people?

1200
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,551
Back, back, back!
Get back!

1201
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,835
You got this.
You know I got this.

1202
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,913
How bad is it?
Not good.

1203
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,752
Look, I got one more move in me.
Cover me. Go!

1204
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,389
Shh! Be quiet!

1205
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,914
Shut him up before he draws
the wrong kind of attention.

1206
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,717
You motherfucker!

1207
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,840
Get up.

1208
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,879
Motherfucker.

1209
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,873
Okay. No, it's okay. You're safe.
Thank you.

1210
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,111
I gotta get the fuck outta here!
Let me out! Let me out!

1211
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,200
Stop him!

1212
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,280
Joe!

1213
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,600
Joe?

1214
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,835
You're gonna be okay,
Joe. Come on.

1215
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,200
We gotta get you
somewhere, okay?

1216
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,037
You're gonna be okay.
I promise you.

1217
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,315
There's nowhere
to take me.

1218
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,753
You're gonna be fine.
That's what's important.

1219
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,119
She's gonna make sure of it.
Right, Senator?

1220
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,028
Yeah.

1221
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,953
You got this.

1222
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,394
I got this.

1223
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,315
Marcos...

1224
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,711
Joe, Joe, Joe.

1225
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,680
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

1226
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
No.

1227
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,478
Wake up, Joe.
Wake up!

1228
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,160
Joe!

1229
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,440
That was
Senator Roan this morning,

1230
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,511
casting the first
vote of the day.

1231
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,636
It's been a great day
for the senator so far,

1232
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,149
having already won New York,
California, and...

1233
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,438
Wait, hold on, I am
getting word, right now,

1234
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,159
that the Senator has
also taken Florida,

1235
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,552
which puts her well over the 270
electoral votes for the win.

1236
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,640
So that is it.

1237
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:19,032
It is now official, the next President of
the United States will be Charlie Roan.

1238
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,954
And President-elect Roan has already
stated that her first order of business

1239
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,794
will be taking executive action
to put an end to the Purge.

1240
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:27,880
Updates?

1241
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,468
It's a landslide.

1242
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:41,317
All right, I'll come by tomorrow.
We can get started on the ceiling.

1243
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,628
Sounds good.

1244
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,229
This place is really
coming along, Marcos.

1245
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,038
Joe would be
really happy.

1246
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,157
I'll catch you
later, kid.

1247
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,877
We're just
now hearing reports

1248
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,235
about a few scattered
incidents around the country

1249
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:31,438
where NFFA supporters are reacting
violently to this defeat.

1250
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,674
They are burning cars, breaking windows,
looting, attacking police officers...
