1
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:02,133
(Muslim call to prayer)

2
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,313
(Pink Panther theme)

3
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,911
(wolf whistle)

4
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,996
He's going in.

5
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,165
(Italian opera)

6
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,772
Ah, Inspector!

7
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,149
Chief Inspector.

8
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,652
Chief Inspector. Hail to the chief!

9
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:43,948
Good to see you. Your disguise
is ready for the final fitting.

10
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,116
- I'm sure you will be pleased.
- Good.

11
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,787
- Inspector Clouseau is here!
- Chief Inspector Clouseau.

12
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,955
Chief!

13
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,375
I saw some very interesting noses there.

14
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:59,505
Those noses over there are for amateurs.
I have some in my private stuff.

15
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:04,134
Yes! You always did have
a nose for noses.

16
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:09,848
Our Valentine's Day stuff isn't ready yet,
but we have some beauties here for you.

17
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:13,352
Let's try this one first.
Here's a marvellous one.

18
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,521
Inspector?

19
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,483
Shall we just get that on there?

20
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,652
What do you think of this?

21
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:28,325
I call this one "The Way We Were". Do
you like it? It's from our Streisand line.

22
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,744
- Do you like it?
- Mm...

23
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:36,541
No, I don't like it either.
Sorry, I almost took your nose with that.

24
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:44,299
Let's try this one now.
I think you will like this one very much.

25
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:47,636
It's very suitable for your face.
It fits in with your lines.

26
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:50,013
What do you think of that?

27
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,266
We call this one "Wino and Roses".

28
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,438
The veins are quite lifelike.
Don't you agree?

29
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:04,319
I am particularly proud of
the enlarged pores. Look at this one here.

30
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:08,865
I wasn't crazy about it either.
We'll try something else.

31
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,868
Something's missing? How about that?

32
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:18,333
- That's very nice, isn't it?
- That is a nose.

33
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,002
You have a nose for noses.

34
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:23,588
I always can tell
immediately I see the nose.

35
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:27,509
- We call this one our "Inky Dinky Doo".
- "Inky Dinky Doo"?

36
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:30,553
What do you have to go with this?

37
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,557
This will keep you very warm.
This has a nice effect with that nose.

38
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,227
- That is too legal.
- Too legal?

39
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,396
I want something that is... how can I say?

40
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,358
Leave it to Dr Balls.

41
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,986
Auguste! Look what you have done.

42
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,114
You're a genius.

43
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,784
Wait. Something is missing.

44
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:58,456
Yes. I know what's missing.
Here are some teeth... on the house.

45
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,625
Let me see how they look.

46
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,586
- Perfect!
- Look at this.

47
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:08,925
You are a genius at your art.
My dear boy.

48
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:14,180
He's still inside. What do you want
us to do when he comes out?

49
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,806
(man) Follow him.

50
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,896
Martha! Come and wrap
the chief inspector's purchase, please.

51
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,065
(woman coughs)

52
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,903
I've recently been doing
something very daring in a stump.

53
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:32,490
Arm and leg.
Only 900 francs for the complete kit.

54
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:40,080
Yes. It has been my experience that, in an
emergency, a stump can get in the way.

55
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:43,959
Martha, you remember
Chief Inspector Clouseau?

56
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:51,884
I never set eyes on zis gentleman before.

57
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:00,142
Good evening, Martha.

58
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,480
I cannot believe my eyes!

59
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:08,359
That is because your husband
is a genius, madame. A genius!

60
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:13,697
Wrap these up, if you would, please.
And I want that nose to go with it.

61
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,952
- Impossible.
- Money is no object.

62
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:23,207
That is absolutely the ugliest nose
I have ever seen in my life.

63
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,669
It is so revolting. It is a masterpiece.

64
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,757
It is also Martha's own nose.

65
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:38,013
My compliments, madame. It suits you.

66
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:42,059
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

67
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:44,227
Thank you!

68
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,355
I will get your bill.

69
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,987
(blows raspberry)

70
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,620
(fanfare)

71
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,212
(Martha sighs)

72
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,259
My God, Auguste, what have you done?

73
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:22,432
The left heel, cleverly built up,
which gives added height and authority.

74
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:26,144
Ja? But the real secret
is in the right heel.

75
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:30,523
The lifelike club-foot look
is caused by a built-in spring

76
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:35,320
which digs into the ankle,
causing excruciating pain.

77
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:39,532
- Very realistic, don't you think?
- How soon can I have a pair?

78
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,244
I can have them ready for you
by Wednesday.

79
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:47,915
Again, Auguste, my sincere thanks.
And to you, madame.

80
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,462
Do you like the hand?
I'll pack them up with the shoes.

81
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:56,758
It will come in handy for scratching,
in case you have any hand jobs.

82
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:01,012
- We will see you soon, Inspector.
- Chief Inspector.

83
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:03,181
Goodbye. We'll see you soon.

84
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,018
Oh, my God!

85
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:10,938
I can't stand!

86
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,149
I've never been in such pain.

87
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:16,777
Shall I kiss it and make it better?

88
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,946
It's not that bad.

89
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:22,992
For the third time
in the memory of modern man,

90
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:28,122
the world's largest cut diamond,
the famous Pink Panther, has been stolen.

91
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:32,376
Since the reign of Akbar the Magnificent
in the early 12th century,

92
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,587
until the recent bloodless coup

93
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,257
of the former Colonel,
now President Sandover Haleesh,

94
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,887
the Pink Panther has been
the symbol of continuity of the Kurfilli,

95
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,474
the ruling family of the tiny
Middle East nation of Lugash.

96
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:49,101
(buzzer)

97
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,520
- Yes?
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

98
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,689
Send him right in.

99
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,614
I came when I got your message,
Commissioner.

100
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,782
I commend your promptness.

101
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:07,453
- You have heard of the theft in Lugash?
- The Pink Panther?

102
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:11,165
Yes, of course. It is in all the papers.

103
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:14,001
Soon, I imagine, they will be
sending us a request

104
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,420
for assistance in catching the criminals.

105
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:21,467
I have already received such a request
from the president of Lugash personally.

106
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,803
I see. How many men
did the president ask for?

107
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:28,307
Only one. Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

108
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,351
Clouseau?

109
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,730
- See that he's on the next plane.
- Of course.

110
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,107
But, um... Commissioner.

111
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,737
Don't you think that someone more...
conventional would, uh...

112
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,407
Not to take anything away
from Clouseau, you understand,

113
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,036
but in view of the tense
situation in the Middle East...

114
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,914
I am aware of the tense situation
between you and Clouseau.

115
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:57,627
However, Lugash has requested
Clouseau, and Clouseau they will have.

116
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,796
Your finger is in my ink.

117
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,008
Hm!

118
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,724
Mm-hm.

119
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,402
Merde!

120
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,578
(coughing)

121
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:45,401
(Clouseau) Ow!

122
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,653
What's he doing in there?

123
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,374
Hello.

124
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,918
Nice weather we're having.

125
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:13,595
I had hoped we'd finally laid to rest
your obsession with Inspector Clouseau.

126
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,348
So had I, Doctor. So had I.

127
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:21,395
And something has happened
to bring on this relapse?

128
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,564
No, not something.

129
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:26,483
Someone. The one.

130
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,028
No. No, perhaps you're right.

131
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:33,740
Some thing. He is a thing.

132
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:37,536
- Clouseau?
- Yes! Clouseau!

133
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,999
And your compulsion to kill Clouseau,
is it also back?

134
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:45,002
Oh, yes. Right back.

135
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:49,047
The thought of a world without Clouseau
fills me with delight.

136
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:52,759
Like a summer with a thousand Julys.

137
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:56,638
It intoxicates my soul with, uh...

138
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:59,224
- Your eyes.
- What?

139
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:03,103
"Intoxicates my soul with your eyes."

140
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:07,065
You've just lapsed into the lyrics
of "You Go to My Head".

141
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:11,653
- I did? I apologise.
- Never apologise for Cole Porter.

142
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:17,325
Besides, your subconscious has just
confirmed what we already know.

143
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:21,413
- That Clouseau has got into my head.
- Precisely.

144
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:27,460
Now, how do you suppose
you are going to get him out of there?

145
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:29,629
I don't know. I don't suppose.

146
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:33,049
You are supposed to suppose
and give me all the answers.

147
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:37,137
The commissioner wants him in Lugash.
Let the commissioner handle it!

148
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,806
I don't want to know.
I don't want to be there.

149
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:43,101
I want to be here with you.
(whimpers)

150
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:51,693
What are you thinking, Doctor?

151
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:54,362
It wasn't Cole Porter.

152
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:56,948
It was Gillespie and Coots.

153
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,117
(whimpers)

154
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,937
(phone rings)

155
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:32,984
- Yes?
- The deputy commissioner to see you.

156
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,196
The commissioner?
Send him in immediately.

157
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:42,284
Come in, Commissioner.

158
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:44,704
I want to discuss
the Pink Panther robbery.

159
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:50,835
I am at your service, Commissioner.
Allow me to offer you a small cigar.

160
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,715
Pay no attention to them whatsoever.
Let them just roll.

161
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,301
Read this carefully
and give me your opinion.

162
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:04,223
I will read my opinion
and give you yours most carefully.

163
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:06,392
Yes.

164
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:13,440
- Do you have a light?
- Yes, in the top left-hand drawer.

165
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:14,817
Aagh!

166
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,706
Agh!

167
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:08,221
Agh!

168
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:18,374
I'm dancing in the rice

169
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:21,293
Just dancing in the rice

170
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,798
What a wonderful feeling

171
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:29,301
I'm... happy in the rice

172
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:32,471
Always happy...

173
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,849
Oh, allow me.

174
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,947
(pumping)

175
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,282
(clears throat)

176
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,868
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

177
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:58,288
Clouseau called.
He wants me to take him to the airport.

178
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:04,002
Then take him. Let the president of
Lugash worry about his blood pressure.

179
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:07,005
- He's not going to Lugash.
- What?

180
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:10,258
- He's taking the 12.15 flight to London.
- To London?

181
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:13,595
He suspects the Phantom to be
responsible for the robbery.

182
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:16,348
He said that since Sir Charles
lives in England...

183
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:21,436
- Sir Charles lives in the South of France.
- Yes, sir. Shall I tell him?

184
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:27,192
Don't bother.
He would just say "I know that."

185
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:29,986
Trying to talk sense to Clouseau

186
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,158
is like Einstein trying
to explain relativity to a "minkey".

187
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,949
Does Sir Charles know you're coming?

188
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,287
No, I want it to remain a surprise.

189
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:25,541
- Merde.
- What's wrong?

190
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,754
Your pop-out lighter
is refusing to pop out.

191
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:34,634
It's supposed to pop out
when it reaches a specific temperature.

192
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:38,971
What exactly is this specific temperature?

193
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,473
I don't know.

194
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:45,186
You should have checked with the factory.
It is obvious that this pop-out lighter

195
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:51,859
has reached its specific pop-out
temperature and is refusing to pop out.

196
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:55,488
The first rule for the car-owner -
know your automobile.

197
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:59,158
- But it is your automobile.
- I know that!

198
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,577
But it is not my pop-out lighter.

199
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:08,542
If it were my pop-out lighter, I would
know the specific pop-out temperature.

200
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,473
Clouseau was trying to fix the lighter.

201
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:25,142
He is sure that someone
planted a bomb in the car.

202
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:29,730
Yes. Someone should have...
I mean, could have done that.

203
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:33,525
He wired Scotland Yard
and said he was arriving in disguise.

204
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,694
Disguise?

205
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,865
What kind of disguise?
Disguised as what?

206
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,038
He didn't say.

207
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:49,541
How are we gonna tell
how to look for him?

208
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:21,698
Grazie.

209
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:37,607
This is your captain speaking.

210
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,485
Please return to your seat
and fasten your seat belt

211
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:43,196
as there is turbulence ahead.
Thank you.

212
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:08,947
Whoa!

213
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:29,801
- Morning, sir. Good trip?
- Yes. Thank you.

214
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,059
Can I help you?

215
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:54,617
Idiot!

216
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,128
Inspector Clouseau.
I'm Drummond from Scotland Yard.

217
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:10,091
I am André Botot,
mustard salesman from Dijon.

218
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,512
Oh...

219
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:18,892
- Can I give you a lift, Monsieur Botot?
- That would be very kind of you, Mr Yard.

220
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:21,936
- Drummond.
- Yes. How is Scotland these days?

221
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,980
- Pardon?
- Scotland.

222
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:28,443
I've some relations
who are from Scotland.

223
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:32,905
My grandmother on my father's side.
I'm quite fluent in the Gaelic, you know.

224
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:34,198
Rrrrrrrrrr.

225
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:38,119
It is the night of braw bricht moons
on the night of gladess.

226
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,039
Yes.

227
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:45,376
Inspector McClaren,
this is Monsieur Botot...

228
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,922
From Dijon. How do you do?
I was just telling Sergeant Yard

229
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:55,303
about my father-in-law's sister
on my sergeant's side.

230
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:59,557
Go round the back.

231
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:23,706
Ah...

232
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:28,168
At last. My own house.
My own swimming pool.

233
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,885
My own 38-23-38.

234
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,972
- Telegram.
- Read it to me.

235
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:43,142
"Dear Chief Commissioner.
Happy birthday."

236
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:47,479
"Hope you enjoy the 3,000lb of Jell-O."

237
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:51,316
3,000lb of Jell-O?

238
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,777
There must be some mistake.

239
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:57,030
Where would I put 3,000lb of Jell-O?

240
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:05,581
Besides, only Clouseau would be stupid
enough to send me 3,000lb of Jell-O.

241
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:13,088
Argh!

242
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,257
(phone rings)

243
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:21,680
Hello?

244
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,015
Argh!

245
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:26,351
This is Inspector Drummond
of Scotland Yard.

246
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:28,603
I hope I didn't wake you up.

247
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:32,065
It's quite all right.
As a matter of fact, you did me a favour.

248
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,234
Who is it?

249
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:40,365
- What can I do for you, Inspector?
- It's about Inspector Clouseau.

250
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:45,954
Ml5 called and reported
that Libyan agents heard a rumour

251
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:50,166
that there might be an assassination
attempt against Clouseau.

252
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,670
Really? Who else wants to kill him?

253
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:56,589
I mean, who is behind it?

254
00:33:56,673 --> 00:34:01,302
We don't know.
But it comes from a reliable source.

255
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:05,557
We've told Clouseau
but he just laughed and said

256
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:11,020
"The moving fingair writes."

257
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:13,648
"Fingair."

258
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,151
When it's Clouseau,
he could mean anything.

259
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:20,363
- Do you know what time it is?
- Will you shut up?!

260
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,828
No, not you. Tell me, where is he now?

261
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:31,499
At his hotel. I think you should
call him and order him back to Paris.

262
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:37,797
Until we verify this rumour, under no
circumstances allow him to go to Lugash.

263
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:56,482
- Yes?
- Do you have for me the "massage"?

264
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,192
Oh.

265
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:01,612
- You want a massage?
- If you have one for me, yes.

266
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,657
Why don't you try Tokyo Lil
at the end of the block?

267
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,037
Ask for Passionflower Shirley,
the Yokohama Butterfly.

268
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:12,748
- Why should I do that?
- You want a massage.

269
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:15,793
Yes, but I want it from you.

270
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,170
Sir, I don't give massages.

271
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:21,632
- You gave me one this morning.
- You're mistaken.

272
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:25,261
Don't you try the tricks anglais
with me, monsieur.

273
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:30,558
I received a "massage" this morning from
Inspector Quinlan of the Yard of Scotland.

274
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,853
- The massage!
- It was you that gave it to me.

275
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:38,148
- Message. You mean message.
- I know what I mean, you lunatic.

276
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:41,068
Do you or do you not
have for me the "massage"?

277
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,493
No, sir. For you, there is no massage.

278
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,455
(phone rings)

279
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,087
- Grouse-Moor Hotel.
- Inspector Clouseau.

280
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,256
Oh.

281
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:07,469
He just went up to his room. I'll ring.

282
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,638
Thank you.

283
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:15,060
(phone rings)

284
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:34,704
- Yes. This is Chief Inspector Clouseau.
- (knocking)

285
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:36,873
Turn your bed down, sir.

286
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:39,835
(maid coughs)

287
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:43,004
Agh!

288
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:04,192
Yes? You were saying?

289
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:06,986
(Clouseau) Agh!

290
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,120
Aagh!

291
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:36,265
Now then.
What was that you were saying?

292
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:39,268
(Clouseau) Aaagh!

293
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,998
Your massage!

294
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:06,128
Your phone.

295
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:20,226
To the airport, my good man,
and drive like the wind.

296
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:22,395
Right, sir.

297
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:34,573
I knew that.

298
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,452
I don't want to hear another word about it.

299
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:41,705
Don't get involved!
When you get mixed up with Clouseau...

300
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,874
- That's enough!
- What are you doing?

301
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:49,213
What does it look like? I'm doing what
I've done every morning for two years.

302
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:52,675
- But you can't!
- I'm sick and tired of you telling me

303
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:56,804
- what I can do and what I can't.
- Suit yourself.

304
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:04,436
I hope you like
the new pool cover you ordered.

305
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,481
(Muslim call to prayer)

306
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:11,819
- I think you made a mistake, Colonel.
- Wrong.

307
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:16,907
Never call me Colonel, Colonel Bufoni. I
am now your president and I am infallible.

308
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,243
It says so in the new constitution.

309
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:21,870
Which you wrote
when you were still a colonel.

310
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:25,582
And you were a captain, Colonel,
which you could soon become again.

311
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:30,295
Yes, Mr President.
It's just that sending for Clouseau...

312
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:35,050
Was a stroke of genius. He found the Pink
Panther before, he will find it again.

313
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,677
Possibly. And then?

314
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:42,766
Then... the grateful people of Lugash
will shower me, President Haleesh,

315
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:46,603
with praise and honour...
and their daughters.

316
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:50,148
And the insurance companies,

317
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:54,569
the ones which have already paid our
government's claim of 12 million dollars

318
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,364
for the theft of the Pink Panther,

319
00:39:57,447 --> 00:40:00,158
what will they shower you with?

320
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:04,245
Why didn't you mention this
before I sent for Clouseau?

321
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:07,374
You've only just told me
that you'd requested assistance

322
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:09,542
from somebody else's police force.

323
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:13,922
- Maybe we can withdraw the request.
- Not "we", Mr President. "You."

324
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:21,262
Only you can't. Clouseau's plane at this
very minute is winging its way to Lugash.

325
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:26,434
Well, perhaps he won't
find the Pink Panther.

326
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,728
Perhaps he won't reach Lugash.

327
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:33,483
- Colonel, you wouldn't...
- To save my president.

328
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:35,860
Do what you must, Colonel.

329
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,071
Just don't tell me about it.

330
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:42,325
A president's conscience
must be unblemished.

331
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:47,205
You understand my meaning, General?

332
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:50,083
As the hand understands the glove.

333
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,377
Oh, great one.

334
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,589
(whimpering)

335
00:40:56,672 --> 00:41:00,218
(doctor) Try to get control
of yourself, my friend.

336
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,887
Giving in in this way is not healthy.

337
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,265
If I were healthy,
why would I be here, Doctor?

338
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:09,518
I was referring to your blood pressure.

339
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:14,065
I see. He's such a maniac,
such an idiot, such a fool.

340
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:17,485
And such a lucky fool.

341
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,571
He would fall backwards down a manhole

342
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:24,033
and wind up
in the arms of Brooke Shields.

343
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:27,244
And now London, half in ruins.

344
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,997
Lugash, a helpless little desert country,

345
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:33,834
- about to be devastated.
- You must get hold of yourself.

346
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:35,669
Yes, I'm trying.

347
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:38,839
You don't want to end up
at Happy Acres again.

348
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:43,677
No. But, Doctor,
until Clouseau is out of my hair,

349
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:47,973
out of my life for ever, I'm doomed.

350
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:50,267
I'll never smile again.

351
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:55,439
Frank Sinatra with
the Pied Pipers and Tommy Dorsey.

352
00:41:55,522 --> 00:42:01,028
I'm falling apart and you go down
memory lane with your silly jazz!

353
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:02,613
(phone rings)

354
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:08,327
They know not to interrupt me when I'm
with a patient, unless it is an emergency.

355
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,164
- Allô?
- Emergency call for the inspector.

356
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:18,045
It would seem the emergency
is not mine... but yours.

357
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,092
Yes, Dreyfus.

358
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:27,304
- I have terrible news for you.
- What?

359
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,973
Inspector Clouseau's plane is missing.

360
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,519
- You are sure?
- Yes, positive. I'm sorry.

361
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:36,688
- I'll be right there.
- OK, Inspector.

362
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:38,106
Thank you.

363
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,776
Doctor Longet... goodbye!

364
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:47,157
You see before you a man reborn!

365
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,619
Cured. Sane. Sound as a Swiss franc.

366
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:54,080
- The phone call was good news?
- Wonderful news.

367
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:58,835
Clouseau's plane is overdue
and presumed lost, into the sea.

368
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:01,338
Lost into the sea
and out of my life for ever!

369
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:04,549
I'm going to wash that man
right out of my hair.

370
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:09,095
I know. Mary Martin, South Pacific.

371
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:09,971
(laughs)

372
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:12,557
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

373
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:16,853
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

374
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:18,480
Agh!

375
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,315
(crash)

376
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,251
She's here. Come in.

377
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,802
I think this is a mistake.
Tell her I'm out of town on a case.

378
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,805
- Do you think that's wise?
- Is talking to her wise?

379
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:55,141
You were his immediate superior.

380
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:59,395
"Were." You really
think he's... past tense?

381
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:02,190
- It seems possible.
- It would be wonderful.

382
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,735
Sooner or later,
a persistent reporter, like Marie Jouvet...

383
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:08,404
But what can I say? What can I tell her?

384
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:10,698
- That I thought him an imbecile?
- No.

385
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:15,661
That I thought him the luckiest man in the
world with the brain of a retarded clam?

386
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:17,705
Of course not.

387
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,416
You know he was an idiot,
I know he was an idiot,

388
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:24,587
but to everyone else he was the greatest
detective since Sherlock Holmes.

389
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,299
- If I tell the truth...
- Then don't. He's gone.

390
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:31,802
Give them the hero they want.
It's no skin off your nose.

391
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:34,847
But is he really gone?

392
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,435
I've got this ghastly feeling that one
of these days - next week or tomorrow -

393
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:44,023
I'll open the trunk of my car
or my closet and "Peekaboo!"

394
00:44:44,106 --> 00:44:47,610
But even so,
I really don't think you have a choice.

395
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:51,780
What if I don't bring it off? You know me
where Clouseau is concerned.

396
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:56,493
My emotions are just lurking
below the surface like a floating mine.

397
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:59,496
- Oh, God. I can't do it.
- You can do it.

398
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,499
I can do it? Yes, I can do it.

399
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,461
No, you do it.

400
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:19,475
Miss Jouvet.

401
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,896
Ah, Miss Jouvet. How nice of you to come.

402
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:27,608
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a clam.

403
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,820
How would you describe
Inspector Clouseau?

404
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:36,867
Well... I've never known a man like him.

405
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,203
He was... He was unique.

406
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:44,207
- (Marie) Could you be more specific?
- (Dreyfus) I could be, but...

407
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,919
To start with, he was...

408
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:49,755
unorthodox.

409
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,884
- In what way?
- In every way.

410
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:57,762
- Can you give me an example?
- An example.

411
00:45:57,846 --> 00:46:03,810
For instance, to keep himself
constantly alert to any attack,

412
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:08,607
he instructed his Chinese manservant
to attack him

413
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,984
wherever and whenever he could.

414
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:14,029
That's not only unorthodox, it's bizarre.

415
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:16,865
- He sounds like a real nut.
- Shut up!

416
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,327
There were rumours
that you and he didn't get along.

417
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,412
Well...

418
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:26,875
I suppose we occasionally
had our little disagreements,

419
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:31,963
but when you work
with somebody for 20 years

420
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:35,800
you can't always be expected to see...

421
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:39,304
to see... I mean, to see eye to eye.

422
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:44,142
Then you think he was a good detective?

423
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:47,854
He was... I think he was...

424
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:52,650
You can't just say he was...

425
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:58,823
There are no words
to describe what he really was.

426
00:46:58,906 --> 00:47:00,992
How about "genius"?

427
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:05,913
That is a word.

428
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,541
- Courageous?
- Courageous?

429
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:11,502
Oh, courageous.

430
00:47:11,586 --> 00:47:14,464
The president twice
decorated him for bravery.

431
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:15,715
Right.

432
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:20,845
- That sounds like a courageous man.
- It certainly sounds that way.

433
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:23,848
He was reputed to be a great athlete.

434
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:26,017
(Dreyfus sniggers)

435
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:31,397
You have no idea what an athlete he was.

436
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,566
A karate black belt?

437
00:47:35,901 --> 00:47:41,031
- A black belt?
- Expert marksman. A born leader.

438
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:45,161
Inspector, I'm so sorry.

439
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:48,581
Gee, he's crying.

440
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,462
- Hello?
- This is Bruno. I want a meeting.

441
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:57,631
- Who with?
- Everybody.

442
00:47:57,715 --> 00:48:00,134
OK, boss.

443
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:01,594
(ripping)

444
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,597
Aagh!

445
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:07,641
Aaagh!

446
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:21,423
You mean it was part of your job
to attack him like that?

447
00:49:21,506 --> 00:49:22,716
Oh, yes.

448
00:49:23,425 --> 00:49:25,844
Well, Cato. I'm back on the case.

449
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:28,013
Ah-ha!

450
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:35,145
Now to set the trap, catch the killer

451
00:49:35,228 --> 00:49:40,191
and prove to the world that
Maria Gambrelli is innocent... of murder.

452
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:43,862
We must accelerate our training.

453
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:48,825
Attack me whenever and wherever
I least expect it. Give no quarter.

454
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:54,038
- Didn't anyone ever get hurt?
- Oh, yes. Mostly me.

455
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:59,669
There was one time, however,
when the Mafia imported a ninja.

456
00:49:59,752 --> 00:50:03,172
The inspector thought the ninja was me.

457
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,696
- (Marie) Poor ninja.
- I know just how he felt.

458
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:30,366
Now, with your boss gone,
no more sneak attacks.

459
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:32,535
You must be very relieved.

460
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:35,413
Not entirely.

461
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:40,918
Sometimes, when you do something long
enough, you miss it even if it was painful.

462
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,046
What do you think
happened to the inspector?

463
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,674
- Beats me.
- (phone rings)

464
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:52,054
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

465
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:54,223
One moment, please.

466
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:56,392
It's for you.

467
00:50:57,977 --> 00:51:01,063
- Allô?
- This is Sergeant Duval speaking.

468
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:03,858
I have that information for you.

469
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:07,236
Clouseau's former assistant,
Hercule Lajoy,

470
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:10,948
is living on a river barge called The Moth.

471
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,841
- Hello?
- Hello.

472
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:32,261
- Hercule Lajoy?
- Who wants to know?

473
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:36,723
- Marie Jouvet. I'm a television reporter.
- I know what you are.

474
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,560
Can I come aboard? I want to talk to you.

475
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,979
- You want answers?
- Of course.

476
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:45,566
How can I give you answers?
I am taking a nap.

477
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:48,819
I'll wait until you wake up.

478
00:51:48,902 --> 00:51:50,988
All right.

479
00:52:01,123 --> 00:52:04,334
You're even better-looking
than you are on television.

480
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,003
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

481
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:12,259
I don't know why, but I have the distinct
impression that I was expected.

482
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:15,095
Clouseau has disappeared.
You're a reporter.

483
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:18,014
- Elementary.
- Spoken like a true policeman.

484
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:20,058
A retired policeman.

485
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:22,435
- May I sit?
- As you choose.

486
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,564
You worked with Clouseau.

487
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,733
Yes. He was unique.

488
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:32,195
Intuitive?
A man who followed his hunches?

489
00:52:32,278 --> 00:52:37,283
Who can tell what he followed? But he
was the most successful man in the force.

490
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:43,706
Everything I thought made up a proper
investigation, he did the opposite.

491
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:46,709
Facts, Hercule. Facts.

492
00:52:47,585 --> 00:52:49,963
Nothing matters but the facts.

493
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:53,174
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

494
00:52:53,258 --> 00:52:56,469
is nothing more than a guessing game.

495
00:52:57,762 --> 00:53:01,474
Listen to me, Hercule,
and you will learn something.

496
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,810
The facts in this case are:

497
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:08,940
The body of the chauffeur was found
in the bedroom of the second maid. Fact!

498
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:13,945
Cause of death:
Four bullets in the chest. Fact!

499
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:20,243
The bullets were fired at close range
from a.25 Beretta automatic. Fact!

500
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:25,414
Maria Gambrelli was discovered
with the murder weapon in her hand. Fact!

501
00:53:25,498 --> 00:53:30,169
The murder weapon was registered in
the name of the deceased, Miguel Ostos,

502
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:35,007
and was kept in the glove compartment
of the Ballon Rolls-Royce.

503
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:36,467
Fact!

504
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:43,391
Members of the household staff
have testified that Miguel Ostos beat...

505
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:49,021
You fool, you've broken my pointing stick.
I've got nothing to point with now.

506
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:54,985
Have testified that Miguel Ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

507
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:59,281
And finally comes this sworn statement
of Monsieur and Madame Ballon,

508
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:05,621
as well as all the members of the staff,
each of them with perfect alibis.

509
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:11,961
Now then, Hercule.
What is the inescapable conclusion?

510
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,463
Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.

511
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:18,342
What? You idiot! Lmpossible.
She's protecting someone.

512
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,844
- How do you know that?
- Instinct!

513
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:21,971
But the facts...

514
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:25,099
You are forgetting
the most important fact - motive.

515
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:27,434
- He beat her.
- He was Spanish.

516
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:30,020
- He tore her dress off.
- Don't be ridiculous!

517
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:33,440
Would you kill somebody
who tore your dress off?

518
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:36,527
- No, I suppose not.
- Of course not.

519
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:42,032
No. There is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

520
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:45,702
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

521
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:48,622
Find that somebody
and you have found the murderer.

522
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:53,126
And I shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

523
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,589
Maria Gambrelli will tell me who he is.

524
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,843
Yet Clouseau was proved right.
Maria Gambrelli was innocent.

525
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:05,764
Clouseau was always proved right
at the end of the case.

526
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:09,851
But on the way
even he made a few miscalculations.

527
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:21,488
(operatic singing)

528
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:29,829
Agh!

529
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:35,919
(Marie) And now he is lost in the sea.

530
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,922
I admired his successes,
but his methods...

531
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:43,301
They made a mockery of everything
I knew of police work, so I quit.

532
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:47,263
But I have a good life.
I carry a few cargoes.

533
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:52,852
I charter to a group of tourists in August
when it gets too hot to stay in Paris.

534
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:57,106
Don't you miss it sometimes,
the excitement?

535
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:03,655
Young lady, if I missed the excitement
don't you think I would bait my hook?

536
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:09,452
Thank you, Hercule Lajoy. I like you.

537
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:13,122
I don't think you're the hard case
you make yourself out to be.

538
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:17,543
I like Hercule too, just because
he is the hard case he seems to be.

539
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:21,339
But if you really want to get
to the bottom of this Clouseau thing,

540
00:56:21,422 --> 00:56:23,966
forget about us,
the ones on his side of the law.

541
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:28,763
Dig up some of the crooks
he caught, or didn't catch.

542
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:32,266
Goodbye.

543
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:39,106
- Call again when you're in the area!
- Thank you. I may do that.

544
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:42,610
They only show the top half
of you on television.

545
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:46,530
- I'm glad the bottom is just as good.
- Me too.

546
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:03,923
- How's business?
- Better.

547
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:05,716
Pickin' up.

548
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,677
Clouseau disappears.
Business gets better.

549
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:10,846
Sure thing, yeah.

550
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:16,268
- This Marie Jouvet is snoopin' around.
- So what?

551
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:20,397
Who knows? But I think
it's better we put a tail on her.

552
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:24,360
Luis, she's no dummy.
You pick a couple of good boys?

553
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,613
Done.

554
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,914
(man) When I first met Inspector
Clouseau, about 20 years ago, in Cortina,

555
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:39,083
I had a nasty ski accident

556
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:43,712
and unfortunately Clouseau happened
to be staying at the same hotel.

557
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:45,672
Ow!

558
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:49,801
- Ow!
- Excuse me. My leg is caught.

559
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:53,513
- You were married to the inspector?
- Yes.

560
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:57,184
Had you known Sir Charles
before Cortina?

561
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,269
Only casually.

562
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:02,564
I am willing to bet you 10,000 francs

563
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:07,444
that the Phantom is in Cortina at this very
moment. Even, perhaps, in this room.

564
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,155
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr Tucker?

565
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:15,368
I agree. Ten of his last 15 victims have
been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

566
00:58:15,452 --> 00:58:17,996
What are we all talking about?

567
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,666
- The notorious Phantom.
- I'm afraid I've never heard of him.

568
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,127
He seems to be quite a fellow.

569
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:27,672
There are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

570
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:32,469
Each theft is completely different
and unique, classic in its conception.

571
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,931
I thought your theory is
that he does repeat himself.

572
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:38,683
Only with regard to
Angela Dunning's parties.

573
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:41,269
However, there is one other duplication,

574
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:46,566
but that is his... trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

575
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:51,571
- He leaves a white monogrammed glove.
- Sounds terribly theatrical.

576
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:55,700
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

577
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:58,203
Really? And who would that be?

578
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:01,289
Who owns the most fabulous
diamond in the world?

579
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,250
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

580
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:07,128
Such a prize he could never resist.

581
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:10,798
He'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at...

582
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,593
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

583
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:19,140
Your Highness, I read there was a dispute
over the ownership of the Pink Panther.

584
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,477
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

585
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,480
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

586
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:30,401
When this government seized power,
they claimed it belonged to the people.

587
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:34,280
There's talk of the international court
deciding the issue.

588
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:38,034
Why don't I steal the diamond,
leave that old glove behind,

589
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:41,454
- and you and I can split the insurance?
- All right.

590
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,123
I feel like dancing. Your Highness?

591
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:46,292
I'd love to.

592
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:51,130
- How about you, madame?
- Yes, of course.

593
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,050
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles?
- What?

594
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:58,054
- I say your leg is better.
- Yes. Much better. Thank you.

595
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,266
You know, Mr Tucker... Argh!

596
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:05,895
That's my beer.

597
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:11,442
In May 1964 you divorced
Inspector Clouseau and a year later...

598
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,694
I married the man of my dreams.

599
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,197
- Who was that, darling?
- You know.

600
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,575
That fellow Clouseau accused
of being the notorious Phantom.

601
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:23,495
You have to forgive her.
She's not very good on names.

602
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,291
- He's terribly attractive.
- But she has impeccable taste.

603
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:31,837
- Why did Clouseau think it was you?
- An anonymous phone call.

604
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,006
I see. Come up immediately.

605
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,467
Sir Charles. The Phantom.

606
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,927
I've really got him this time.

607
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:42,598
- But of course he was wrong.
- About what?

608
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,893
- About you being the Phantom.
- Of course. He was wrong.

609
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,521
- Wrong, but persistent.
- Persistent he was.

610
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:54,943
(Sir Charles) He was convinced that
I was planning to steal the Pink Panther.

611
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:59,531
And when Princess Dala gave
a costume ball at a villa in Rome,

612
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:02,034
Clouseau was there with his men.

613
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:05,495
- Warm.
- Yes, must be hell in there.

614
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,457
Bet it's not so good in there.

615
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,879
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

616
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:19,176
My men are everywhere. Mingling here,
mingling there, watching all the time.

617
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,601
How dare you drink on duty?
Who is inside there?

618
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,769
- Sergeant Walter.
- Sergeant Coff.

619
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,230
Stop that or I'll have your stripes!

620
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:35,984
- The Pink Panther was stolen that night?
- By a gorilla.

621
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,136
Come back! It's me!

622
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,912
(Sir Charles) To my dying day,

623
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:34,375
I'll never forget that old man
trying to cross the street.

624
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,836
(tyres squeal)

625
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,256
(horn)

626
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,221
(horn)

627
01:02:55,187 --> 01:02:57,064
(horn)

628
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,279
- (Clouseau) Come on, faster!
- (horn)

629
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,909
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

630
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,705
(horn)

631
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,008
(Clouseau) This is the road
they have gone up.

632
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,843
(horn)

633
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:29,346
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

634
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:33,350
(horn)

635
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,107
(horn)

636
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:47,197
- George, how do we get out of here?
- I don't know. I've been all over this place.

637
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,159
- How do we get out?
- You try the high road.

638
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:53,245
I'll take the high road,
you take the low road. So long.

639
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:54,371
Ciao, George.

640
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:23,358
(horn)

641
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,546
- That's them!
- No, it isn't.

642
01:04:44,629 --> 01:04:46,965
(tyres screech)

643
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:49,134
(crash)

644
01:04:52,012 --> 01:04:54,097
(continuous horn)

645
01:05:01,312 --> 01:05:07,026
For a while, it looked as though
Clouseau himself was the Phantom.

646
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:12,240
He was actually arrested for having stolen
the Pink Panther and sent to prison.

647
01:05:13,324 --> 01:05:16,286
Tucker!

648
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,790
- But he was innocent.
- Inept, but innocent.

649
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:23,459
- Inept?
- Wouldn't you say so, darling?

650
01:05:23,543 --> 01:05:26,754
Not in everything, darling.
He was a terrific sleeper.

651
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:29,257
- It's hard to believe.
- It's true.

652
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:33,136
He almost never made a serious
mistake while he was sleeping.

653
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,763
I mean, inept! France's greatest detective!

654
01:05:35,847 --> 01:05:38,141
It does test one's reality.

655
01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:40,393
- Do you think he's dead?
- I hope not.

656
01:05:40,476 --> 01:05:44,397
- What do you think, Sir Charles?
- No. Men like Clouseau never die.

657
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,483
They're indestructible.
That's how it should be.

658
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,153
- Why?
- We need them.

659
01:05:50,236 --> 01:05:52,655
They help us preserve
our sense of humour.

660
01:05:52,738 --> 01:05:56,033
And they're living proof
that, however bad things get,

661
01:05:56,117 --> 01:06:00,788
if you persevere you survive
and sometimes even win.

662
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:04,041
So you think determination
was the key to his success?

663
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,168
No question about it.

664
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:10,256
He was a fool but he epitomised
the 11th commandment.

665
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:13,843
- The 11th commandment?
- "Thou shalt not give up."

666
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:17,972
- I like that.
- I thought you might.

667
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:24,728
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

668
01:06:24,812 --> 01:06:27,690
- Come and see us again.
- I may do that.

669
01:06:27,773 --> 01:06:31,527
The man of your dreams
is also a Machiavellian charmer.

670
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,571
I know that. Thank you.

671
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:36,156
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

672
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:01,431
- You've just passed the hotel.
- Yes, ma'am.

673
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:06,562
- But that's where I wanted to go.
- You see that car following us?

674
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:08,105
What about it?

675
01:07:08,188 --> 01:07:13,026
The two men in that car suggested
I drop you off at another address.

676
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:17,823
- What are you talking about?
- Actually, it was more like a threat.

677
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:22,786
- They threatened you?
- One of them showed me his new gun.

678
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,997
Who are they?

679
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:32,045
I know you'll think I'm not on the ball,
but I neglected to get their names.

680
01:07:32,129 --> 01:07:34,798
- You realise this is kidnapping?
- Yeah.

681
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:37,717
I have to be honest with you.

682
01:07:37,801 --> 01:07:40,637
I couldn't come up with an alternative.

683
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,139
You can go to prison for life
for kidnapping.

684
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:46,851
Lady, the gun he showed me
was a.38 Magnum.

685
01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:49,104
I don't know anything about guns.

686
01:07:49,187 --> 01:07:53,066
That gun makes enormous holes
in things.

687
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:57,237
I had a choice between kidnapping you
and getting shot with that gun.

688
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:02,033
To be perfectly frank,
I would look terrible and feel worse

689
01:08:02,117 --> 01:08:04,244
with an enormous hole in me.

690
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:41,406
- Miss Jouvet, how nice of you to come.
- Did I have a choice?

691
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:44,283
Actually, no.
Let's go where we can be private.

692
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:47,912
- Do I have a choice?
- I just wanna have a talk with you.

693
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:50,706
- Watch your step.
- I always do.

694
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:57,755
- Why the drama? You could have phoned.
- Would you have come?

695
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,716
To see the French godfather?
Bruno, I'm a reporter.

696
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,845
And a terrific-lookin' one at that.
Take a swim.

697
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:13,396
Come on.
Let's make ourselves comfortable.

698
01:09:15,022 --> 01:09:18,526
- Have a seat.
- Can I have a drink?

699
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:21,320
- Do I have a choice?
- Actually, no.

700
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:25,866
- How about some champagne?
- Terrific. And put a fresh peach in it.

701
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:29,370
- Champagne and put a peach in it.
- Peach?

702
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,080
Yes, sir.

703
01:09:31,163 --> 01:09:35,376
- I never heard of a peach in champagne.
- Very sexy.

704
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:37,920
- Make that two.
- Yes, sir.

705
01:09:40,172 --> 01:09:44,718
- What happens if he has no peaches?
- Something very melodramatic.

706
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:49,723
If it gets to that,
I'll settle for plain champagne.

707
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:54,770
Marie, you really are
some kinda sensational lady.

708
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,773
Bruno, there is an old saying.

709
01:09:57,856 --> 01:10:00,859
- What's that?
- Never bullshit a bullshitter.

710
01:10:00,943 --> 01:10:01,985
(laughs)

711
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:05,656
I want you to lay off
on this Clouseau thing.

712
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,326
- Take off your glasses.
- What for?

713
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:12,287
Then I can see what you're thinking.

714
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:15,040
I doubt that.

715
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:19,336
- Why do you want me to lay off him?
- Cos I asked you to.

716
01:10:19,419 --> 01:10:22,422
- It's not a good enough reason.
- It should be.

717
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:24,591
What if I don't?

718
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:30,180
You know, Marie, when I was your age,

719
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:33,767
I used to sometimes wonder
what it would be like

720
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,937
if I suddenly found a whole lot of money.

721
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,523
- Have you ever imagined that?
- Oh, yes.

722
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,570
I even imagined that some day someone
might try to bribe me with a small fortune.

723
01:10:45,654 --> 01:10:48,156
- What did you do?
- I was tempted.

724
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,201
- That's a good start.
- But I said no.

725
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:53,453
- Not very bright.
- I'm a reporter.

726
01:10:53,537 --> 01:10:56,623
For better or for worse, an honest one.

727
01:10:57,332 --> 01:10:59,876
Tell me why you want me
to lay off Clouseau.

728
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,421
Cos I prefer things the way they are.

729
01:11:03,505 --> 01:11:05,715
Clouseau created a lot of problems.

730
01:11:05,799 --> 01:11:09,052
A smart lady like you
could find out he's still alive.

731
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:13,890
Or dead. I might even find out
that someone killed him.

732
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:21,856
You've got a beautiful face. Why do you
want to stick it in where it doesn't belong?

733
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,400
Because it's my job.

734
01:11:24,484 --> 01:11:30,615
What good's your job if you've gotta
do your TV show from a hospital bed?

735
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:35,745
I knew you were going to threaten me,
but I didn't know how I would react.

736
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:38,331
- I've surprised myself.
- Is that right?

737
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:41,459
Yes. Instead of scaring me,
you have made me angry.

738
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,045
I can't remember when I've been so angry.

739
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:49,175
I am a member of the press and I will not
be intimidated by you or by anybody else.

740
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:53,429
- Now who's being melodramatic?
- Melodramatic? Wait till I get home!

741
01:11:53,513 --> 01:11:57,475
- What are you gonna do?
- Faint or throw up. Maybe both.

742
01:11:57,558 --> 01:12:01,395
- Eight to five it's throw up.
- You've got a bet.

743
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:03,773
Sir?

744
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:07,944
- Gutsy lady.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

745
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:12,198
- Great ass.
- I didn't notice, sir.

746
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,743
Arthur, there's an old saying.

747
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:19,330
- "Never bullshit a bullshitter."
- Of course, sir.

748
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:23,334
Yes, great arse indeed.

749
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:25,461
(woman) Bruno!

750
01:12:25,544 --> 01:12:27,922
Can I get out now?

751
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:33,886
Yeah.

752
01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:38,766
I don't think she has such a great ass.

753
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:43,854
- What do you expect me to do?
- Arrest him.

754
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:46,190
- On what charge?
- He had me kidnapped.

755
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:48,400
- Can you prove it?
- Ask the taxi driver!

756
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:50,778
You said the taxi driver kidnapped you.

757
01:12:50,861 --> 01:12:53,572
Bruno's men forced him to.
They had guns.

758
01:12:53,656 --> 01:12:57,409
- Did you see the guns?
- No, but the taxi driver told me...

759
01:12:57,493 --> 01:13:00,662
I'm certain that everything
you've told me is true.

760
01:13:00,746 --> 01:13:04,166
But... I'm equally certain
Monsieur Langlois will deny it.

761
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:05,417
Monsieur Langlois?

762
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:08,962
- It boils down to...
- It boils down to his word against mine.

763
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:10,172
Exactly!

764
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:14,760
In certain circles, Monsieur Langlois' word
carries a lot of weight.

765
01:13:14,843 --> 01:13:17,137
You are upset
so I will ignore the innuendo.

766
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:19,973
Upset or not, the innuendo stands.

767
01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:24,478
Miss Jouvet, may I suggest that
you go home and forget all about this.

768
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:26,146
Excuse me.

769
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:29,733
I shall tell you exactly where I am going -
directly to my office,

770
01:13:29,816 --> 01:13:33,195
to write my next broadcast
about the Mafia boss who kidnapped me

771
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:36,782
and the chief inspector
who refused to do anything about it.

772
01:13:36,865 --> 01:13:39,993
In my opinion, that would be most unwise.

773
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:44,456
What it boils down to, Inspector, is,
I don't trust your opinion.

774
01:13:56,885 --> 01:13:59,137
Miss Jouvet seemed a bit upset.

775
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:02,599
Miss Jouvet is turning out
to be a real pain in the a...

776
01:14:02,682 --> 01:14:03,892
Aagh!

777
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:07,354
So far the incident hasn't
even been investigated.

778
01:14:07,437 --> 01:14:10,649
If Bruno Langlois is in the mood
to deny the allegation,

779
01:14:10,732 --> 01:14:13,443
I will be happy to repeat it
on the witness stand.

780
01:14:13,526 --> 01:14:16,988
- She's talking about you.
- Yes.

781
01:14:17,947 --> 01:14:20,241
Lot of guts.

782
01:14:21,076 --> 01:14:26,372
I believe even the French godfather would
think twice about challenging me in court.

783
01:14:26,456 --> 01:14:29,584
As for Chief Inspector Dreyfus,

784
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:33,796
if he really is the paragon of
police virtue that he purports to be,

785
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,717
why hasn't he found the taxi driver
and interrogated him?

786
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,137
- She's talking about you.
- Yes.

787
01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:45,892
It's intriguing, but the more
I find out about Clouseau,

788
01:14:45,975 --> 01:14:51,272
the more certain interested parties
would prefer me to drop my investigation.

789
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:54,650
So far, I haven't turned up
anything incriminating,

790
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:59,113
but obviously I'm rocking the boat
and people are getting nervous.

791
01:14:59,197 --> 01:15:03,951
One thing's sure. I intend to keep on
rocking until I have an answer for you.

792
01:15:04,035 --> 01:15:06,120
Good night.

793
01:15:14,837 --> 01:15:17,048
(phone rings)

794
01:15:17,131 --> 01:15:19,634
Clouseau's residence. Cato speaking.

795
01:15:19,717 --> 01:15:24,013
I've gone to Miami Beach to spend
Chinese New Year with my grandmother.

796
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:26,182
Leave a message after the bleep.

797
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:01,342
Allô?

798
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,855
Avon calling!

799
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:43,818
(screams)

800
01:17:56,748 --> 01:17:58,332
(yelling)

801
01:18:26,694 --> 01:18:28,821
(yelling)

802
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:44,170
You!

803
01:18:45,337 --> 01:18:47,423
(groans)

804
01:18:49,675 --> 01:18:51,760
Regrettably.

805
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,847
(phone rings)

806
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,978
Clouseau's residence. Cato speaking.

807
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:05,482
I've gone to Miami Beach to spend
Chinese New Year with my grandmother.

808
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:07,318
Leave a message after the bleep.

809
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:10,654
- I'm sorry.
- I'm used to it.

810
01:19:11,488 --> 01:19:14,158
This is Professor Auguste Balls of Paris.

811
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:16,243
You Oriental picaroon!

812
01:19:16,326 --> 01:19:20,956
You can't fool me about a plane crash.
He is hiding to avoid payment.

813
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:25,210
Unless I receive 4,000 francs
by Friday, I'm suing.

814
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:30,591
You can put that in your opium pipe
and smoke it, you conniving Cantonese!

815
01:19:30,674 --> 01:19:33,427
Who the hell is Professor Auguste Balls?

816
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:37,389
Inspector Clouseau's
official disguise-maker.

817
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,349
- What's a picaroon?
- A cheat.

818
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:42,436
- That's great.
- Being called a cheat?

819
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:46,064
Some of my best friends are picaroons.

820
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:50,652
- I'm sorry I broke in.
- That's OK. Keeps me in practice.

821
01:19:50,736 --> 01:19:53,822
- Can I get you a cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

822
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:57,242
- I could use an aspirin.
- I telephoned before.

823
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,912
I really thought you'd gone
to visit your grandmother in Miami.

824
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:05,500
Miami Beach. She runs a bingo parlour.
She's a real picaroon.

825
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:11,006
I thought maybe I'd find something.

826
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:16,469
- Like what?
- Like this.

827
01:20:16,553 --> 01:20:18,138
Oh, that!

828
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:22,225
- Do you know who these people are?
- His parents.

829
01:20:22,309 --> 01:20:25,520
- Are they still alive?
- His father is.

830
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:28,273
He lives in the Château Clouseau
à Lamarque.

831
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,442
He's a winemaker.

832
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:43,621
Swine rabbit!

833
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:57,677
Mes chéries.

834
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,846
(giggling)

835
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,478
Beaujolais!

836
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:18,865
What are you doing?

837
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,830
Bon, bon, bon, bon.

838
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:28,833
- Au revoir, mes chéries.
- Au revoir, Papa.

839
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:35,673
It doesn't taste the same
since we lost Fifi.

840
01:21:35,756 --> 01:21:37,967
I'm missing the great Fifi.

841
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,969
Fifi!

842
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:44,515
Could you tell me something
about your son?

843
01:21:46,559 --> 01:21:49,770
No. After four o'clock,

844
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:54,817
I can't tell you anything about my son.

845
01:21:54,900 --> 01:22:01,031
- Why not after four o'clock?
- Because, after tasting the wine all day,

846
01:22:01,949 --> 01:22:07,621
after four o'clock
I can't remember my son -

847
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:11,250
let alone tell you anything about him.

848
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:17,756
It is a miracle that I remember
it is after four o'clock.

849
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:29,351
(laughs)

850
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:34,731
That felt good!

851
01:22:34,815 --> 01:22:38,360
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am all right.

852
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:44,825
I was just checking that Nanna
vacuumed the rug.

853
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:49,037
Speaking of Nanna...

854
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:51,206
(whistles)

855
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:57,003
Fetch Nanna.

856
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:05,220
Nanna has been with me 61 years.

857
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:08,056
She was Jacques' nurse.

858
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,810
- Really?
- What?

859
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:15,063
- I said "Really?"
- I know that.

860
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:18,066
Because you said Nanna
was your son's nurse.

861
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:22,320
Mademoiselle, you don't have
to repeat what I said.

862
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:24,906
I know what I said.

863
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:31,079
Fortunately I am not too old
to have lost my memory yet.

864
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:33,206
K-nock wood.

865
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:39,754
Come in!

866
01:23:39,838 --> 01:23:41,923
(laughs)

867
01:23:47,887 --> 01:23:50,557
What am I laughing about?

868
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,142
I'm not sure I can explain it.

869
01:23:58,523 --> 01:24:00,900
Nanna approaches.

870
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:02,151
(whistles)

871
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:04,320
Allez!

872
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:06,948
Apportez-moi Nanna.

873
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,537
Continuez.

874
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:15,123
Bon, ça va bien.

875
01:24:15,206 --> 01:24:17,125
A gauche!

876
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:20,628
A gauche!

877
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,797
Sit.

878
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:29,720
Allez, à droite.

879
01:24:32,056 --> 01:24:34,141
A droite, dog.

880
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:36,811
En bas!

881
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,898
A gauche!

882
01:24:44,235 --> 01:24:46,320
(whistles)

883
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:54,286
(whistles)

884
01:24:55,913 --> 01:24:57,998
Merci, Nanna.

885
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,168
(whistles)

886
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,797
En bas.

887
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:10,344
En bas.

888
01:25:15,349 --> 01:25:17,434
- Santé.
- Santé.

889
01:25:18,102 --> 01:25:20,187
(whistles)

890
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:32,616
She loves that dog.

891
01:25:50,217 --> 01:25:52,302
Assis.

892
01:26:00,977 --> 01:26:02,729
Regardez.

893
01:26:03,688 --> 01:26:05,774
Regardez, dog.

894
01:26:06,566 --> 01:26:09,611
No, Nanna.

895
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:15,700
Fifi.

896
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:24,167
(Clouseau Senior) My son Jacques
Clouseau was born September 8th 1920.

897
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:29,297
He had his mother's eyes
and his father's kidneys.

898
01:26:52,362 --> 01:26:54,531
From the very beginning,

899
01:26:54,614 --> 01:26:58,576
Jacques wanted to be a policeman.

900
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,795
He had many setbacks,

901
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:12,173
but he was always resourceful.

902
01:27:17,428 --> 01:27:21,599
He was 18 when he entered the university

903
01:27:21,682 --> 01:27:24,185
and fell in love.

904
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:30,733
The girl of his dreams married another.

905
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:38,115
Jacques decided
that life was not worth living.

906
01:27:58,594 --> 01:28:00,679
To whom it may concern.

907
01:28:03,599 --> 01:28:06,602
I find life no longer worth living.

908
01:28:08,646 --> 01:28:13,108
Fortunately, there was a power failure.

909
01:28:13,192 --> 01:28:15,903
Swine lights.

910
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:33,295
When the Germans invaded France,

911
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:38,092
Jacques joined the underground.

912
01:29:52,248 --> 01:29:54,334
Swine plunger.

913
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:10,350
After the war, he joined the police force
and the rest is history.

914
01:30:10,433 --> 01:30:13,311
Thank you.
It's been most interesting.

915
01:30:13,394 --> 01:30:17,690
- It has?
- Yes. It helps to round out my tribute.

916
01:30:17,774 --> 01:30:19,859
What do you mean?

917
01:30:21,652 --> 01:30:25,198
Your tribute doesn't need rounding.

918
01:30:25,281 --> 01:30:28,284
You have a great-looking tribute.

919
01:30:30,703 --> 01:30:34,207
- He's alive, you know.
- How do you know that?

920
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:38,336
He has his mother's eyes,
but his father's fortitude.

921
01:30:38,419 --> 01:30:41,255
- I thought it was his kidneys.
- That too.

922
01:30:41,339 --> 01:30:46,552
A man with such fortitude and kidneys
must be alive someplace.

923
01:30:46,636 --> 01:30:49,138
- I hope so.
- I knew that.

924
01:30:56,437 --> 01:30:58,731
- Goodbye.
- Au revoir.

925
01:31:05,613 --> 01:31:08,657
And so, after leaving
that delightful old man,

926
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:12,161
who is convinced
that his famous son is still alive,

927
01:31:12,244 --> 01:31:14,747
I began to wonder "Is it possible?"

928
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:18,125
Mafia boss Bruno Langlois
seems to think it is.

929
01:31:18,209 --> 01:31:21,629
Sir Charles Litton feels
that such men are indispensable

930
01:31:21,712 --> 01:31:23,797
and therefore indestructible.

931
01:31:23,881 --> 01:31:27,760
And Chief Inspector Dreyfus
is so obsessed with the possibility

932
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:31,055
that he's on the verge
of another nervous breakdown.

933
01:31:31,138 --> 01:31:35,601
Did Inspector Clouseau really
perish in the sea, as reported?

934
01:31:36,018 --> 01:31:40,647
Or, for reasons as yet unknown,
is he out there someplace,

935
01:31:40,731 --> 01:31:45,652
plotting his next move, waiting
to reveal himself when the time is right?

936
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:51,366
I am reluctant to believe that misfortune
has really struck down such a great man.

937
01:31:56,788 --> 01:31:58,790
Swine seagull.

938
01:31:58,874 --> 01:32:00,959
(Pink Panther theme)

939
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:21,480
We must find that woman.

940
01:32:25,567 --> 01:32:27,777
Here's the report.

941
01:32:27,861 --> 01:32:31,615
I will apprehend this culprit
within 24 hours. Agh!

942
01:32:31,698 --> 01:32:32,866
Ah!

943
01:32:32,949 --> 01:32:35,660
Now we are getting somewhere.

944
01:32:35,744 --> 01:32:37,537
You!

945
01:32:42,459 --> 01:32:46,129
- But that's a priceless Steinway.
- Not any more.

946
01:32:52,635 --> 01:32:54,721
Agh!

947
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:17,327
(phone rings)

948
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:19,579
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

949
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:22,373
- Clouseau.
- One moment, please.

950
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:25,460
For you.

951
01:33:44,103 --> 01:33:46,856
He's Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton.

952
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:49,734
- The Phantom?
- Yes. One and the same.

953
01:33:49,817 --> 01:33:51,944
My greedy little yellow pimp.

954
01:33:52,028 --> 01:33:53,070
Ow!

955
01:33:53,154 --> 01:33:57,658
There is something that I am
very interested to know. It's rumoured...

956
01:34:13,466 --> 01:34:15,551
Back to town.

957
01:34:19,096 --> 01:34:21,182
Follow that car.

958
01:34:34,611 --> 01:34:36,488
Does your dog bite?

959
01:34:38,282 --> 01:34:39,408
No.

960
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:43,370
Nice doggy.

961
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:49,126
I thought you said your dog did not bite.

962
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:51,753
That is not my dog.

963
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:56,967
Do you know the way to the Palace Hotel?

964
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:59,136
Yes.

965
01:35:00,012 --> 01:35:04,182
Special delivery. A beum.
Were you expecting one?

966
01:35:04,975 --> 01:35:06,518
A beum?!

967
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:24,411
You fool!
You raving Oriental idiot!

968
01:35:24,494 --> 01:35:28,290
There is a time and a place
for everything, Cato.

969
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:30,917
And this is it.

970
01:35:40,093 --> 01:35:42,178
And another thing.

971
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:47,392
I was known as
the Pavlova of the parallels.

972
01:35:48,018 --> 01:35:49,519
Oh, yes.

973
01:35:52,147 --> 01:35:54,733
Yes, it's all coming back now.

974
01:35:54,983 --> 01:35:57,819
Ah, yes, I remember it...

975
01:35:57,902 --> 01:36:00,363
Aagh!

976
01:36:06,828 --> 01:36:09,873
Well, that felt good.

977
01:36:21,926 --> 01:36:25,054
