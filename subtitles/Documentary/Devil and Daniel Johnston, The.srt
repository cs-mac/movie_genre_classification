1
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,300
Dae Shik!

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Dae Shik, are you okay?

3
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,600
Hey, Dae Shik!

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,610
Dae Shik! Snap out of it!

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,780
What are you doing?

6
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,310
Please send an ambulance immediately.

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,010
Snap out of it!

8
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,880
Wait a moment. The address is-

9
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,510
Dae Shik! Hey!

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,090
What happened to you?

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,960
The address is the city of Seoul, Seo-cho, 18-19.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,560
Hold on. The ambulance will be here soon.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,170
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.

14
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,310
Dae Shik?

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,540
Dae Shik!

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,820
Wake up! Dae Shik!

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,090
Wake up!

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,160
Dae Shik!

19
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,150
<i>A tarot card you drew was found at a crime scene.</i>

20
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,660
<i>I think the person who sent the tarot card knows you very well.</i>

21
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,730
<i>It feels like he is giving you clues to solve the mystery.</i>

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,100
<i>That in turn also means that you know the answer.</i>

23
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,770
<i>I don't believe in coincidence.</i>

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,070
<i>Stop the bullshit and tell me the truth!</i>

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Episode 5

26
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,740
Please, have some.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Thank you.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,070
Should I get you a newspaper?

29
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,110
No, that's okay. I'm fine. Don't pay any attention to me.

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,910
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,710
What happened?

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,880
Something's happened.

33
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,990
Did Senior Kang head butt Seong Jun Pyo?

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,330
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,830
I'm not quite sure what's going on myself.

36
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,770
Anyway, Senior Kang says it's related to the tarot card case.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,900
Where are you?

38
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Hold on a sec.

39
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,140
Sorry. Did you wait long?

40
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,050
Got it.

41
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,940
No.

42
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm sorry to interrupt, but another case came up.

43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,340
A case?

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,330
Is this where you live?

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,870
You really are a smart Dorothy, Sora.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,320
*a famous children's song called "The Island House Child"*

48

<i>"When Mother goes to pick oysters"</i>
*a famous children's song called "The Island House Child"*

49
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,520
*a famous children's song called "The Island House Child"*

*a famous children's song called "The Island House Child"*

51
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,070
What are you doing?

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,740
Patient Yoon Dae Shik has passed away at 8:30 in the evening.

53
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,070
<i>"Hearing the lullaby"</i>

54
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,250

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,860
<i>"falls asleep. "</i>

57
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,360
What are you saying?

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,330
His heart had already stopped before reaching the hospital.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,340
That's impossible. Impossible!

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,310
Why are you just standing there? Do something. Aren't you a doctor?

61
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,570
Dae Shik!

62
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,310
Try to stay with me. Try a bit harder, Dae Shik.

63
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,480
Dae Shik, can you hear me?

64
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,080
Do something!

65
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm sorry. There's nothing more we can do.

66
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,560
He wouldn't just die like that.

67
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,220
I tell you, he wouldn't!

68
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,470
Listen to me!

69
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,980
Senior Kang!

70
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,510
Do something!

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,230
Calm down!

72
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,490
Do something!

73
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,740
Please don't do this. Snap out of it.

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,550
You're the only one who worries about me.

75
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,720
After I've collected all the small debts, I'm considering opening an o-deng bar.

76
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,260
Dae Shik.

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,520
Your mother will be here soon.

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,040
Mom's always late because she has to earn money.

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,670
Do you want a surprise?

80
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,420
Now, which hand?

81
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
This one.

82
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,690
Tada!

83
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,950
An airway closure?

84
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,530
Since the patient had asthma, there's a possibility that an airway closed up due to the asthma.

85
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Then are you saying the cause of death was asthma?

86
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,390
It's merely a conjecture.

87
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,100
Only an autopsy will tell you the true cause of death.

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,710
Thank you.

89
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,340
Are you okay?

90
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,490
Give me the car keys.

91
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,550
Where are you going?

92
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,580
Give me the keys!

93
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,250
Mom!

94
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,550
Sora!

95
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,020
Mom!

96
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,490
Sora! Are you okay? Huh?

97
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,630
Mister Wizard brought me home.

98
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,970
Over there.

99
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm not certain, but it seems that card arrived by Quikservice.

100
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,010
With this doll.

101
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,290
I'm not sure how to thank you.

102
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,020
Thank you. Thank you so much.

103
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,960
Don't mention it.

104
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:55,100
I'm not quite in the right mind now, but if you leave me your contact information, I will say my thanks properly later.

105
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,270
Don't worry about it.

106
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,540
But-

107
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,240
I had a lot of fun with Sora.

108
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,150
Next time don't follow strangers, okay?

109
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,920
You don't want to lose your way again. Understand?

110
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,050
Please go in.

111
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,120
Thank you so much.

112
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,200
Mom?

113
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,830
Here.

114
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,400
The Wizard of Oz gave it to me.

115
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,820
He did?

116
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,870
And...

117
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,640
This, too.

118
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh Seung Ha Law Offices

119
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,150
Mister Wizard said to call him if I ever don't know where I am again.

120
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,050
I see.

121
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,490
This isn't right, Senior.

122
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,990
He's psycho. We can't leave him be.

123
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,900
You're jumping into this situation blindly!

124
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,000
The guy killed Dae Shik.

125
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,140
It could have been because of the asthma.

126
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,100
It was definitely murder.

127
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,000
We don't have any evidence.

128
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
We don't need any more evidence to deal with a psycho.

129
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,180
Let's come back after we've found the evidence.

130
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,030
Seong Jun Pyo.

131
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,110
Senior Kang!

132
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,410
Seong Jun Pyo, come out!

133
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,820
Why are you acting like this?

134
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,490
Hear me? Seong Jun Pyo!

135
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,390
Come out!

136
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,560
You need to pull yourself together.

137
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,090
Fine. Let's assume it was murder.

138
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,130
All the more reason to find the evidence first.

139
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,140
If we're not prepared, we're going to lose to him.

140
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,140
Do you want to defile the death of your friend?

141
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,610
Why in the world...

142
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,390
Why Dae Shik?

143
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,990
He was just starting to get his life together.

144
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,360
So why in the world...

145
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,900
So let's find the evidence.

146
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,470
Let's get the evidence and put the psycho behind bars.

147
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,870
Okay, Senior?

148
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,110
What are you two doing?

149
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,420
Didn't you hear me ask you what you're doing in front of my house?

150
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,220
We're police officers.

151
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,660
I know.

152
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,400
What I want to know is, what the police is doing in front of my house-

153
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,460
Where are you coming from?

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,790
Why do you ask?

155
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,530
Where are you coming from?

156
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,400
Why do I have to tell you where I'm coming from?
*Jun Pyo drops formal polite speech between strangers or when speaking to someone older or of higher status.*

157
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,440
Why do I have to tell you where I'm coming from?

158
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Why are you speaking ban-mal* to me?
(*informal speech)

159
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,530
What did you say?

160
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,810
We just have something we want to confirm.

161
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,620
Don't you realize this is a violation of my civil rights?

162
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,190
I'll apologize if that's how you felt.

163
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,390
If you have something to confirm, present the proper grounds,

164
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,430
follow through with the proper procedure,

165
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,860
and then come back to see me.

166
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,070
Don't go anywhere far.

167
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,370
I'll follow the proper procedure and be back real soon.

168
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,460
He told me you'd come to pick me up if I waited in front of the police station.

169
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,490
Do you know who the man was?

170
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Mister Wizard?

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,730
No, the man who took you to the zoo and told you to wait at the police station.

172
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,400
Was it the man who came to our house last time?

173
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,070
You know, the one you said was scary.

174
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,610
Nope. It was the nice man who gave me this doll.

175
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,780
The man who gave you the doll?

176
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,080
Yup.

177
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,660
I've already looked. There's not much to find.

178
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,430
Why isn't the forensics team here?

179
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,040
The thing is, the situation hasn't been officially declared a case.

180
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,440
It's a murder case!

181
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,990
There's nothing here.

182
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,360
Move it.

183
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,030
Did you contact the immediate family?

184
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,300
Hey, hand me the flashlight.

185
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,910
It's a woman's.

186
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,420
I saw a little girl.

187
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,420
Around the age of five.

188
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,990
A little girl.

189
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,890
What?

190
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,770
I cannot stop myself

191
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,880
There's nothing I can do now

192
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh Soo?

193
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,850
You know I really like you, right?

194
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,560
Fine, let's just date!

195
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,320
Please leave like the wind

196
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,160
Before we fall in love

197
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,790
I have things I must find

198
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:43,830
The lost dreams and truths

199
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,170
I was in so much pain

200
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,850
I could not hold onto your hand

201
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,520
I love you, I love you

202
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,560
I've hidden behind you and confessed countless times

203
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,000
I ask of you, please avoid me

204
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,470
I cannot make you happy right now

205
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,300
Did something happen?

206
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,540
Don't wait for me

207
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,700
Don't turn around

208
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,110
Please don't love this undeserving man

209
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,580
I was... just in the area...
Please don't love this undeserving man

210
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:29,610
I was... just in the area...

211
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,090
How did you know I was here?

212
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,060
I woke up because of the rain and saw you outside.

213
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,160
Did something bad happen?

214
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,330
Don't love me
Did something bad happen?

215
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,070
Don't love me

216
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,490
Go on in. You might catch a cold.
Don't love me

217
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:49,530
Go on in. You might catch a cold.

218
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,140
I have no right to receive your love
Go on in. You might catch a cold.

219
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,310
I have no right to receive your love

220
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,040
Just leave after seeing only the good things

221
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,850
Before there is sadness in the end

222
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,660
There is another world

223
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:17,630
Even with the same sky, the same land

224
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,350
The world does not recognize

225
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,470
My pained heart

226
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,510
I ask of you, please avoid me

227
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,420
I cannot make you happy right now

228
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,870
Don't wait for me

229
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,550
Don't turn around

230
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,960
Please don't love this undeserving man

231
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,330
Oh my goodness!

232
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,600
You surprised me, Mom.

233
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm the surprised one here.

234
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,110
Do you know what time it is?

235
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,250
The sound of the rain was just so nice.

236
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,980
You're quite good at lying.

237
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,350
Who is he, the guy that was just outside?

238
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,690
Do you have a boyfriend?

239
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,660
I would've introduced him to you already if I did.

240
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,400
Why did he come to see you so late then?

241
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,440
What does he do for a living?

242
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,810
I'd better go back to sleep. After all, I have work tomorrow.

243
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,980
Mom, you should go back to bed, too.

244
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,480
Everyone has a secret they want to hide.

245
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,780
I'm disappointed in you.

246
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,120
Mom?

247
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll tell you all about it later.

248
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,620
I will.

249
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,730
Are you mad at me?

250
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,500
Oh Soo?

251
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,970
Where's Soon Ki?

252
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,700
In the bedroom. Why?

253
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,710
Hey.

254
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,070
Today-

255
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,510
no, yesterday did you go to Dae Shik's office?

256
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,610
No.

257
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,480
You were supposed to meet him.

258
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,460
What's going on?

259
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,350
Tell me the truth. Did you meet with him?

260
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,850
What happened was

261
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,120
I did go to meet him, but-

262
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,020
But?

263
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,430
There was a police car up front, so I just came home.

264
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,420
What?

265
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,270
Dae Shik's been arrested by the police, right?

266
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,440
I saw this coming a mile away.

267
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,810
He's always ripping off the weak-

268
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,940
Shut up. Shut the hell up!

269
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,680
Oh Soo, what are you doing?

270
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,380
You told me the truth, right? You didn't go to his office?

271
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,150
I told you, I didn't go.

272
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,090
What in the world is going on?

273
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,230
Oh Soo?

274
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,710
Dae Shik is...

275
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,110
dead.

276
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,320
What the hell did he just say?

277
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,650
Sorry about yesterday.

278
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,450
Don't worry about it.

279
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,530
What was it you wanted to talk to me about?

280
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,730
I'll tell you in person next time.

281
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,910
When are you free?

282
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,440
I have no idea. Another case just came up.

283
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,930
Then please give me a call when you're free.

284
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,340
Will do.

285
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,640
Chief!

286
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,080
The immediate family has agreed to allow the autopsy.

287
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,910
Are you certain this is a murder case?

288
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,950
What do you mean?

289
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm sorry about what happened to your friend

290
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,150
but we have to consider the doctor's opinion.

291
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,350
But-

292
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,590
Hear me out.

293
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,920
We can't assume it's a murder case on the
mere fact that a tarot card was sent.

294
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,820
I'm sure it was murder.

295
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,500
It's not just the package. Yesterday, when I went into his office, there was a strange smoky gas smell.

296
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,600
A gas smell?

297
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,830
Yes.

298
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,970
I can't tell you what smell it was exactly, but I'm certain it had something to do with Dae Shik's death.

299
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,570
Found it!

300
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,220
You went through a lot of trouble last night, right?

301
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,960
I had fun with that intelligent child.

302
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,760
So how did the mother manage to lose her child like that?

303
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,100
I forgot to ask.

304
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Oh, has the date been set for Jo Dong Sub's first public hearing?

305
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,640
Not yet.

306
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,610
By the way, how did you happen to meet Jo Dong Sub?

307
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,010
Just... coincidentally.

308
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I see.

309
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,620
Why do you ask?

310
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,920
Something about Lawyer Kwon's case disturbs me.

311
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,690
Which is?

312
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,030
It's entirely of personal interest, so I shouldn't even bother you with it.

313
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,330
That makes me even more curious.

314
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,330
Shadowed Journey

315
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,650
Listen. To the call of the trumpets of judgment.
Look. For a new world will come after the darkness is cleared.

316
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,910
The tarot cards are placed in the order they were sent to Senior Kang

317
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,640
and the content fits perfectly.

318
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,550
This guy really is a psycho.

319
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,950
After the Justice card, there's no mention of any other cards-

320
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,390
Wait up.

321
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,920
I figured out what the sculpture was.

322
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,060
It's something called the Gates of Hell.

323
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,230
It's this guy, without a doubt.

324
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,100
Contact the information team and find out who's the blog owner, his real name,

325
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,140
how many times he logged in, the
location from where he logged in, all of it.

326
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,010
Yes, sir.

327
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,860
I was meaning to come to see you earlier. I'm sorry I came so late.

328
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,030
Ah, here.

329
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,430
Here you go.

330
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,900
What is this?

331
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,520
I didn't thank you properly.

332
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,870
It's not much. Please accept it.

333
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,410
I've already received a recompense.

334
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,570
Please just take it.

335
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,110
And I heard you paid the tab at the bar.

336
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,620
I assume your friends are doing well?

337
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,220
Not really.

338
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,290
Do you remember Dae Shik from that night?

339
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,290
Of course.

340
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,760
He died last night.

341
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,500
How did that happen?

342
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm not sure myself.

343
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,740
The funeral's been postponed because of the autopsy...

344
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,010
What a dreadfully unlucky guy.

345
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,250
I'm not sure what I can say in consolation.

346
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,150
I knew a person's life couldn't be controlled

347
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,850
but he wasn't even thirty yet.

348
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,760
What a pitifully young age.

349
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,190
That's what I'm saying.

350
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,830
Please inform me when the funeral date is set.

351
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,970
Why? Are you going to come?

352
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,330
Of course I will.

353
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,370
We have some connections, after all.

354
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
You don't have to bother.

355
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,290
Detective Kang?

356
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,360
The daffodil has brightly bloomed.

357
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,300
Huh?

358
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,030
The plant you gave to me as a present before.

359
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,100
That flower was a daffodil.

360
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,000
It's even more radiant today than usual.

361
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,280
I didn't even know what kind of flower it was.

362
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,180
I hope you got home all right last night.

363
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,490
My friend died.

364
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:17,400
The Justice tarot card that came to me was also sent to his office.

365
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,060
Then...

366
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,770
My friend was the next sacrifice that the card gave notice for.

367
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,870
Though I don't know the motive yet

368
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,450
it has become absolutely certain that the murderer is somehow connected to me.

369
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,520
So...

370
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,120
Dae Shik died.

371
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,360
Because of me.

372
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,730
He died because of me.

373
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,110
Here.

374
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,720
This is the doll you saw in the afterimage, right?

375
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,360
Yes.

376
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,300
Was this sent with the tarot card?

377
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,630
Yes.

378
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,720
A knife was sent to Lawyer Kwon, and that became the murder weapon.

379
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,210
This time it's this doll, but I can't figure out why it was sent.

380
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,010
Was the cause of death a gunshot wound?

381
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,850
No, but an autopsy is scheduled, so we should find out soon.

382
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,830
Have you ever seen this man in your afterimages?

383
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,670
No.

384
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,570
Is that so?

385
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,170
Excuse me.

386
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,570
Yeah?

387
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,040
We found out the blog owner's identity.

388
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,310
Who is it?

389
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,280
Him, Seong Jun Pyo.

390
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,580
Got it.

391
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,280
I have to get going.

392
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,890
The tarot card found at the crime scene is also in here. The other evidence is being held right now at the station.

393
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,890
Please help us out.

394
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,330
Of course.

395
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,400
Thank you.

396
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,200
Detective Kang?

397
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,870
It's not your fault.

398
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,140
Whatever the reason, what's right is right, and what's wrong is wrong.

399
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,680
There are no exceptions to that rule.

400
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,750
Whatever the reason, the bad person is the criminal who took the victims' lives.

401
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,150
It's definitely not you.

402
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,190
So please do not blame yourself like that.

403
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm sure your friend wouldn't want to see you do that.

404
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,300
What is it this time?

405
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,370
It's a search warrant.

406
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
What?

407
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,550
Wait, what's the charge?

408
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,880
Aiding and abetting murder.

409
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,800
I expect full cooperation.

410
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,420
Journalist Seong Jun Pyo.

411
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,190
Aiding and abetting murder?

412
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,160
That's right.

413
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,890
This is preposterous.

414
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,070
Being under suspicion means that there's some sort of reason behind it.

415
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,070
Go ahead and search.

416
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,870
The talking can come later.

417
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,940
I think it's a very meticulous person.

418
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,890
The scissor’s handles were wrapped in red string.

419
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,040
Senior Kang?

420
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,340
These look like the shoes on the security camera tapes.

421
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,510
I'm certain they are.

422
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,850
I watched that scene over 20 times.

423
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,620
I don't know who sent me the package.

424
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,430
Why were you holding onto items sent by a stranger?

425
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,600
Since it was from a stranger, I couldn't return it, could I?

426
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,070
What happened to the box it was sent in?

427
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,140
I put it into the recycling bin during separate garbage collection.

428
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,110
Yet you kept the items that were sent in that box?

429
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,850
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

430
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,620
And this is a matter of simple common sense.

431
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,350
If I had evidence from a crime scene

432
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,570
why would I leave it at my home?

433
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,720
You couldn't throw them away.

434
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,590
You needed them for your next crime.

435
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,360
What a bunch of crock.

436
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,200
Then why do you suppose a package was sent to you when you have nothing to do with all this?

437
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,370
For what possible reason?

438
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,800
That's exactly what I wanted to ask.

439
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,740
You wrote this stuff on your web-blog, right?

440
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,840
Nope.

441
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,310
The blog was created in your name.

442
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,270
I have no clue about that.

443
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,620
Do you think it makes sense that you have no clue when you created the blog?

444
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,750
You think that's the only thing that doesn't make sense here?

445
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,560
The fact that you have me here, questioning me about this, doesn't make any sense to begin with. And-

446
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,100
can you prove that just because it was made in my name, I'm the one to actually make it?

447
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,370
Why did you write that article sympathizing with Jo Dong Sub?

448
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,600
Does a journalist need a reason to write an article?

449
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,400
You want me to tell you the reason?

450
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,330
A few years ago, you wrote an article exposing the
corruption of Congressman Kang Dong Hyeon

451
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,680
and ended up getting sued for libel.

452
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,200
In addition to that, you were fired from the editor's position and divorced by your wife.

453
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,910
And so you bore a grudge against Congressman Kang and Lawyer Kwon

454
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,950
and decided to eliminate the people around Congressman
Kang, one by one, using a third party.

455
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,780
Your first target was Lawyer Kwon.

456
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,860
That'll make quite an interesting article.

457
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,720
It's the truth.

458
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,060
After murdering Lawyer Kwon, you wrote that article,
almost as if you had been waiting for the moment.

459
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,970
The article sympathizing with Jo Dong Sub.

460
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,530
It actually does make logical sense

461
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,840
but if it were me, I would have started with
Kang Dong Hyeon, not Kwon Hyeon Tae.

462
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,880
Or perhaps Kang Dong Hyeon's son.
Doesn't that make more sense?

463
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,710
You little-

464
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,410
Detective Kang!

465
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,550
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

466
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,970
Where were you between 7:00 and 8:30 last night?

467
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,900
I had dinner with the editor of "Issue & Issue. "

468
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,270
And let me get one thing straight.

469
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm not reckless enough to do something foolish out of personal spite.

470
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,820
I have enough self-control to sit back
and watch a rotten and corrupt politician

471
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,950
swagger around shamelessly.

472
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,940
I checked the IP address of the blog entries

473
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,320
and unlike Seong Jun Pyo's other entries

474
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,810
*Shin-chon is a popular area in Seoul, especially
since it's where Yonsei University is located

475
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,600
it was posted from a PC room in Shin-chon.
*Shin-chon is a popular area in Seoul, especially
since it's where Yonsei University is located

476
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,100
and it's a great place to hang out for young people*
it was posted from a PC room in Shin-chon.

477
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,580
it was posted from a PC room in Shin-chon.

478
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,620
Please look at the picture carefully.

479
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,560
Is this the man who asked you to send the package?

480
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,020
I don't think it is.

481
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,970
Take a closer look. Maybe try imagining that
he was wearing a wig and sunglasses.

482
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,970
Is it him?

483
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,160
No.

484
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,040
Take a closer look!

485
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,390
This man...

486
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,010
is not the guy.

487
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,180
It was verified that Seong Jun Pyo did receive a package.

488
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,680
And his alibi's airtight.

489
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,320
But there are so many dissatisfactory points.

490
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,120
My instinct tells me he's hiding something.

491
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,420
I don't think he's lying.

492
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,030
How can you be sure?

493
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,930
I can tell by his eyes.

494
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,560
His eyes were completely calm and pulled together.

495
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,100
But that's still just your opinion.

496
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,600
Let's organize our thoughts.

497
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,400
If Seong Jun Pyo did use Jo Dong Sub to murder Kwon Hyeon Tae

498
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,900
it does make sense.

499
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,840
His motive would be revenge against Congressman Kang Dong Hyeon.

500
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,410
But he has no motive to kill Yoon Dae Shik.

501
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,850
Then maybe the criminal used Seong Jun Pyo
just like Lee Bong Gyu was used.

502
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,890
That's a different case.

503
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,050
How so?

504
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,930
If Lee Bong Gyu was chosen at random,
Seong Jun Pyo was intentionally picked.

505
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,200
That's why the letter to Jo Dong Sub was sent in the name of Pyo Jun Seong.

506
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,230
And the afterimage of the row house-

507
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,470
Afterimage?

508
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,870
Let's talk outside.

509
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,910
Chief!

510
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,810
I already know.

511
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,450
Senior Kang didn't tell me. I found out by accident.

512
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
About what?

513
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,360
What are we talking about?

514
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,220
I'll explain later.

515
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,990
Let's finish listening to Detective Kang.

516
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,850
What are you guys talking about?

517
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
He already said he'd explain later.

518
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,860
Continue with your thoughts, Senior.

519
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,330
If Seong Jun Pyo has nothing to do with this case

520
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,390
there's no way the afterimage of the row house
would be embedded in the letter sent to Jo Dong Sub.

521
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,410
You're saying that even if Seong Jun Pyo isn't
the criminal, he's connected to the case somehow.

522
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,310
Right.

523
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,890
If Seong Jun Pyo was used simply to create
confusion in the case, then the row house afterimage-

524
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,390
What is it?

525
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,060
We need to speak privately outside.

526
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,460
What if...

527
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,010
someone intentionally put the afterimage
of the row house into the letter to Jo Dong Sub?

528
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,680
What does that imply?

529
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,710
It implies that the criminal wanted us to find Seong Jun Pyo.

530
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,980
And we moved according to his plan.

531
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,590
More importantly, it means that the criminal
knew about Hae In's ability from the start.

532
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,690
If that's possible, then...

533
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,260
We can't entirely trust any of the afterimages
that Hae In reads out of things.

534
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,590
Then kill me.

535
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,400
If you have the self-confidence, then do it. Don't just stand there.

536
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,450
Please take a step back.

537
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,380
Then kill me. Kill me.

538
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,530
Hae In?

539
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,030
What are you doing here?

540
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,300
My office is in this area.

541
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,470
What are you doing here?

542
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,310
Is there an emergency or something?

543
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,480
No.

544
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,820
You're sweating quite a bit.

545
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,790
I'm fine.

546
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,530
Use this.

547
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,600
Please get in.

548
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,830
I'm fine.

549
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,140
Is it your habit to say "I'm fine"?

550
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,610
Yes.

551
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,510
Please do get in even if you are fine by yourself.

552
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,850
You're headed to Galanthus, right?
*Galanthus is the name of the cafe that Hae In's friend
Ju Hee owns as well as the tarot cards that Hae In drew. *

553
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,550
My place is also in that direction.

554
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,990
Thank you.

555
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,600
Why were you running a race so late in the evening?

556
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,340
I had my reasons.

557
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,510
Did you eat yet?

558
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,510
Not yet.

559
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,080
I didn't eat either.

560
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,060
Want to eat together?

561
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,990
Let's eat dinner together.

562
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,270
I have an appointment at the cafe.

563
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,570
I see.

564
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,560
Thank you.

565
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,820
Go on in.

566
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,730
When did you get here?

567
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,560
Just now.

568
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,070
I heard about your friend.

569
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,340
Today, Kim Soon Ki came by my office.

570
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,380
He was a friend who seemed unusually close with you.

571
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,350
Your sadness must be great.

572
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,120
Thank you for your concern.

573
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,160
Then, goodbye.

574
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,390
Let's have dinner sometime.

575
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,330
Sure.

576
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,570
Aren't you going in?

577
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,310
Do you have something to say to me?

578
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,450
No. Let's go in.

579
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,660
I've got it.

580
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:39,960
Who-

581
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,700
Who is it?

582
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,110
I'm not sure.

583
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,920
Open the gate.

584
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,640
Who is it?

585
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,120
Oh Soo's friend.

586
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,690
I have to take care of him before Father shows up, so open the gate.

587
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,400
Why don't you go out and send him away?

588
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
He won't leave just because I tell him to.

589
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,700
You go out to him.

590
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:26,380
I don't like strangers coming into our home.

591
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,520
Che, what's going on?

592
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,430
You were home?

593
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,330
What brings you all the way here?

594
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,240
I was just so upset by what happened to Dae Shik.

595
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,530
I wanted to have a drink with you.

596
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,390
I would but I have an early meeting tomorrow morning.

597
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,280
And my wife isn't feeling very well, either.

598
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,370
Is that so? Then I'd better go say hello.

599
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,580
I never even got to see her face
since I was always at "school."
"school" is a euphemism for prison*

600
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,660
You can say hello some other time.

601
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,730
Take this.

602
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,230
What are you doing?

603
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,010
I didn't come here for this.

604
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,270
Take it.

605
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,780
Man, you shouldn't do this kind of thing.

606
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,690
Welcome home, Father.

607
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,150
Yeah.

608
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,030
Have you been well, Father?
*In Korean culture, you call close friends' parents "Father" and "Mother. "*

609
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,130
I'm out like this, thanks to you.

610
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,670
Where's Oh Soo?

611
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,100
He's terribly busy these days with Dae Shik's case.

612
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:03,840
I was planning to stop by sometime and discuss some matters with you.

613
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:09,650
You're the only source of strength I have, after all.

614
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,490
No matter how I try to lead a decent life,
society just won't allow it.

615
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,020
What did you say your name was?

616
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,690
Who are you speaking about?

617
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,030
Oh, right.

618
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,230
It was something like Kim Soon Ki, right?

619
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,330
Yes.

620
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:35,270
In my opinion, a man who knows his proper
place in life is the wisest kind of man.

621
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:41,050
The law of the world doesn't allow men to try to act
above one's lot in life. That just calls for disaster.

622
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,350
I'm not sure what you mean.

623
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,750
A person who makes the hairs on the back of my
neck stand despite the fact that I helped them,

624
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,020
I don't particularly like that kind of person.

625
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,770
Come to my office sometime.

626
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,900
Let's talk then.

627
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,800
Yes, sir.

628
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,550
You followed him? Have you no fear?

629
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,380
You're not Angelina Jolie.

630
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,050
Who knows what the horrible man might have done to you!

631
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,620
Did you see the man's face?

632
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,920
No. I only saw him from behind.

633
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,690
Did he have any distinctive features?

634
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,290
He looked like a common man.

635
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,560
He was average height and was wearing a suit.

636
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,060
Which subway station was it?

637
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,470
Kyo-dae Station.
*station where the Seoul National University of Education is located*

638
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,500
Oh, and this.

639
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,810
It was found in Dae Shik's office.

640
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,770
That's enough for today.

641
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,610
If all of this makes Hae In sick, are you
going to take responsibility for that?

642
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,570
Ju Hee.

643
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,580
Do you know how nervous you make me?

644
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,550
I'm afraid you'll become ill again.

645
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,390
Hae In once said that she wouldn't ever do this kind of thing again.

646
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,120
It's that difficult.

647
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,320
Aren't you overworking her?

648
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,420
I'm fine.

649
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,590
It's not fine!

650
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,260
I'm sorry. I was so anxious I didn't think that far ahead.

651
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,630
I want to know as well.

652
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,410
Why he's using the tarot cards I drew
to give an advance notice of murder,

653
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,510
how this is all related to me,

654
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,910
I want to know all that.

655
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,550
And I have to find out.

656
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:33,000
(She's in a jjim-jil-bang: steam room you go to with your clothes on. Popular hangout place to chat in Korea, Some even go here instead of motels when they need somewhere to spend the night)

657
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,990
What have you done with Sora, you bastard?

658
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,640
Where's my daughter? Where is she? Where is Sora?

659
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,250
What do you plan to do?

660
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,130
Sora.

661
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,700
She was looking for a child named Sora.

662
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,870
Who was?

663
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,970
I think it was the mother.

664
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,240
And she pulled the trigger.

665
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,410
Are you talking about a gun?

666
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,810
Yes.

667
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,850
She pulled the trigger several times.

668
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,860
But he didn't die by gunshot wounds.

669
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,500
Hello?

670
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,470
Hello?

671
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,300
Hello?

672
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,130
Um...

673
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,980
Isn't this Yoon Dae Shik's cell phone?

674
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,910
It is.

675
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,720
Can I please speak with Yoon Dae Shik?

676
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,630
He can't come to the phone right now. Who is this?

677
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,560
Is he okay?

678
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,740
If you tell me who you are-

679
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,170
Hello?

680
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,140
She hung up.

681
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,210
Who was it?

682
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,180
Seeing how she asked if the victim was
okay, she knows about his accident.

683
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,150
But she doesn't know about his death.

684
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,320
Trace that number immediately.

685
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,050
Yes, sir!

686
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,730
When is Yoon Dae Shik's autopsy?

687
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:21,990
Tomorrow, sir.

688
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,100
Yeah?

689
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,200
A gas gun?

690
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,960
It's highly probable.

691
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,430
There was a smoky smell in Dae Shik's office

692
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,410
and the fact that Hae In saw a gun can be explained if it's a gas gun.

693
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,410
I'm heading in now.

694
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,580
Detective Kang?

695
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,520
Please be careful.

696
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:56,360
I saw you and your friend in the afterimages of the crime
evidence, and that means the criminal is watching you.

697
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,160
Don't worry.

698
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,040
By any chance, is there anyone else who knows about your ability?

699
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,310
Why do you ask?

700
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,070
I'll explain later.

701
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,180
And go home early. Staying out late is dangerous.

702
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,120
You definitely don't have to worry about me.

703
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,610
Sorry. Did you wait long?

704
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,850
Don't worry about it.

705
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,580
What's the new case about?

706
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,790
Something that's a total pain.

707
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,820
What did you want to talk to me about?

708
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,830
I heard there's a Detective Kang Oh Soo on your team?

709
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,730
There is. What about him?

710
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,840
Is his father by any chance Congressman Kang Dong Hyeon?

711
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:11,970
That's right.

712
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,470
Is this about Oh Soo?

713
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,050
Hae In. There's a package for you.

714
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,150
A package?

715
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,270
It's virtually impossible to find the person with only the name Sora.

716
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,700
The kid's not even old enough to have a registration card.
*All Koreans receive their cards at age 19, Korean age. *

717
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,640
We haven't found Dae Shik's employees yet?

718
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah.

719
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,340
I think we have to release Seong Jun Pyo for now.

720
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,420
We don't have enough evidence to hold onto him any longer.

721
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,930
We traced the call made to Yoon Dae Shik's phone. It was made from a jjim-jil-bang.
*jjim-jil-bang = steam sauna*

722
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:08,990
Where's it located?

723
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,030
Package delivery.
