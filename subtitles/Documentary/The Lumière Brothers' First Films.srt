2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,530
Just getting in from your date?

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,360
Rebecca is my father's daughter.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,530
She's not.

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,960
Then why did adding her initials to ours 
unlock the accounts I have been trying to open for months?

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,260
If he knew I was having his child, 
he would be compelled to leave you all,

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,600
and I couldn't have that.  
So I told him it was someone else's.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,620
Kevin, I just got a 
registered letter from the army.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,970
What does it say, Justin?

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,810
- They want me back. 
- Not going back is a felony.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,420
I don't care. I'm going to Mexico.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,640
Justin!

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,140
- What do you need? 
- Uh, the usual.

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,910
- Justin, wake up! 
- This is all my fault.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,930
- It's his own fault. 
- We need an ambulance right away.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,690
No, Justin. Justin. Oh, Justin, please.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,560
We're in your hands, Lord.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,511
Look after us.

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Amen.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,870
Here, will you pass that?

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,690
Hold your plate.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,840
Justin, what's the matter?

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,450
Uh, nothing's the matter.

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,930
You want to say something?

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,490
I, uh...

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,030
I enlisted today.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,210
Enlisted in what?

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,710
In the military.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,000
Is this like that time you wanted to be a roadie for Linkin Park?

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,930
- Yeah, or open the brewery? 
- or the karate school?

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,600
- Oh, dude, it's called a dojo. 
- Guys, I'm serious.

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,570
I went to the recruitment office today, and I joined the army.

33
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,860
As in the army, the actual army -- the guys with missiles and tanks?

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,100
- Yeah, look, it's--it's too soon to be making jokes. 
- Yeah, it is.

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,590
He's not joking.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
- Look, the recruiter says we're getting a lot of volunteers, and, you know, we can--
- No.

37
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,560
No, I'm sorry, but no.

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,260
No what, Mom?

39
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,900
You're not going.

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,180
- Dad, will you just explain to her-- 
- I understand wanting to serve your country.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,360
It's a noble instinct.

42
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,340
Look, it's not an instinct. I'm doing this, okay?  No one's gonna stop me.

43
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
The hell I'm not.

44
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,280
I will not have a child of mine putting themselves in harm's way 

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,270
just because they're caught up in some nationalistic fever.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,550
Look, I may be your son, but I'm not your child anymore.

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
I mean, I'm an adult, and I can make my own decisions.

48
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,770
Come on, Justin.  You don't even carry your own credit cards.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,290
You really think you're old enough to carry a gun?

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,270
Look, I'm three years older than Dad was when he joined the army.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,870
Justin, that was a completely different time.

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,260
You know what, Kitty?  We talked about this.

53
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,980
I mean, you said yourself that we need to do something and that we're not safe.

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,150
Justin, she's a radio personality. Half of what she says she doesn't mean.

55
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,300
You're serious about this?

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,080
Yeah, I bought a plane ticket, and I'm reporting to Fort Bragg next Friday. 

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,020
Then godspeed.

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,340
What? Dad!

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,260
- You can't --
- What?

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,310
Mom?

61
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,540
What?

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,820
Are you okay?

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes.  I'm just making my market list for Thanksgiving.

64
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,030
Thanksgiving's a week away.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Yes, I know. But when I'm nervous, I like to make lists.

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,740
Oh, Mom, he's-- he's gonna be fine.

67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,240
I know.

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Doctor's here.

69
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,750
- He'll be okay. 
- Really?

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,680
We pumped his stomach, gave him some medicine called naloxone.

71
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,470
It's gonna keep him pretty out of it for the next 24 to 48 hours,

72
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,460
but, uh, he should make a full recovery.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,380
Thank you, doctor.  You-- you are a doctor, aren't you?  You look so young.

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,400
- Well,he looks-- 
- I'll discharge him tomorrow.

75
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,980
Uh, what's his living situation like?

76
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,690
- Uh, he's gonna come home with us. 
- Good, good.

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,380
You're gonna want to keep a close watch on him for the next few days.

78
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,210
Also, I'm recommending the following rehab facilities.

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,050
Thank you very much.

80
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,190
"New Horizons"?

81
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,960
"Sunset Acres"...

82
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,750
"Bradley Ridge Detox & Spa"...

83
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,820
Maybe we can get a family rate.

84
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,290
Using the password, we discovered your father's account at Ricklean & Cabot contains 50 shares of a holding company.

85
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,370
Holding what?

86
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,110
A 60-acre parcel of land near Furth, Nevada.

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,790
Basically, it's in the middle of the desert.

88
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,840
We're estimating its market value at less than $1.2 million.

89
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,610
If the land's only worth a million, where's the other $14 million my father borrowed?

90
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,790
The land is worth $1.2 million, but it looks like your father paid someone $15 for it.

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Great.  So he'd have been better off buying swampland in Florida or a bridge in Brooklyn.

92
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,950
Thank you, Jordan, for your diligence.

93
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,440
Why don't you step into my office, and I'll give you a check for your services?

94
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,080
With any luck, it won't bounce.

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,350
Thank you.

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Yeah, thanks.

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,930
Well, I know a firm in Nevada.  Maybe they could recommend a good realtor.

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,420
- Give them a call. 
- No.

99
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,900
I don't want to sell it, not yet.

100
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,740
Look, whatever Dad might have been, he wasn't stupid.

101
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,560
He knew land.

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,530
He bought the orchards up and down the west coast.

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,120
Well, maybe his judgment failed him when he moved his investments inland.

104
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,190
Right.

105
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,450
I'm not signing off on any sale until I see it.  I'm sorry.

106
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,740
As V.P., he does have to consent the conveyance of any corporate asset valued over a million.

107
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,110
Well, I'm a mother of two, and I'm responsible for the candied yams at Thanksgiving.

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,270
I don't have time to road trip to Nevada.

109
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,030
Sarah, it's five hours each way.  We'll leave early tomorrow.  We'll be back by dinner.

110
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,290
And as company president, you do have a fiduciary obligation to make an informed decision.

111
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,770
- No, I don't. 
- Yeah, you do.

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,370
Stop saying legal things just to piss me off.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,140
Okay.  If I'm going, you're going.

114
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,480
Fine.  I love road trips.

115
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,360
- And you're driving. 
- Still love 'em.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,940
- Both ways. 
- I hate road trips.

117
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,150
You gotta box him in.  You gotta ask him about U.N. sanctions for North Korea.

118
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,230
Stem cell research.

119
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,870
- You gotta ask him about--  
- You guys know that this is only a 15-minute interview?

120
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,770
You better ask the senator about his divorce.

121
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,780
What is this, interview by committee?

122
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,270
It's McCallister's first interview since splitting from his wife,

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,810
and he shouldn't get a free pass just because he's being interviewed by a fellow California Republican.

124
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,550
Divorce is not news.

125
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,530
Messy divorces are news, and this one was messy.

126
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,070
I mean, the guy's the best-looking man in a 20-square-mile radius of D.C.,

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,990
and his wife left him for his chief of staff.

128
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,960
After she found him in bed with the nanny.

129
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,610
Yeah, so she says.  The nanny denies it.

130
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,220
See?  News.

131
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,750
He's a decorated vet of the first gulf war, 2-term senator

132
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,240
and, not to mention, front-runner for vice presidency.
 
133
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,310
Yes, of course, I'm going to ask him about his divorce.

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,560
Knock 'em dead.

135
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,440
You okay?

136
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,010
There's been some talk around these parts of you finally acting like a Republican.

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,830
Oh, you mean bitchy?

138
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,510
You said it, not me.

139
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,570
It's my brother, Justin.

140
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,970
They called him up, and they're sending him to Iraq this time.

141
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,950
Oh, God, Kitty.  I'm sorry.

142
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,210
Is there anything I can do for you?

143
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,890
Yeah, you can find a way to withdraw from Iraq.

144
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,870
- Come here. 
- Oh, thanks.

145
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,870
Kitty, Whit wants you to ask Senator McCallister about his...

146
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,630
I can wait.

147
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,640
- Amber, it's-- 

148
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go to your loft and get you some clothes.

149
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,810
Matter of fact, I think I'll take everything.

150
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,380
From the looks of things, they haven't seen the inside of a washer or dryer in months.

151
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,640
I could stop by the video store.  You want me to pick you up anything?

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,060
Yeah, "Black Hawk Down."

153
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,840
Nice to see attempting suicide has not hurt your sense of humor.

154
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,640
Look, I didn't "attempt" anything, Mom.

155
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,400
It's called an overdose because I overdid it.

156
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,640
Why don't you just tear my head off and get it over with?

157
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,990
Go upstairs.  Lay down.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,030
When you feel better, then I'll tear your head off. I promise.

159
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,130
Mom?

160
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,810
Nora...

161
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,040
I hate it when you do that.

162
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,610
You're not the final say in this house, not when it comes to my children.

163
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,400
- His mind is made up. 
- No, it's not!

164
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,950
You have to talk to him.  He's not ready for this.

165
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,290
- Neither was I! 
- William, he is not you.

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
He doesn't have your strengths.  He doesn't have your capability.

167
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm doing this.

168
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,840
I'm going, Mom, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

169

172
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,640
When did Ojai Foods get into the pie-making business?

173
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,110
What do you think, these pies bake themselves every year?

174
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,570
No, I do the baking today, and then the cooking, stuffing and potato mashing on the day of.

175
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,330
Besides that, I just wanted this to be a special Thanksgiving.

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,700
It's the first one without your father and the last one before Justin...

177
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,330
I just wanted to bring my "a"...

178
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,600
- something. 
- Game.

179
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,760
So I have an interview with Senator McCallister,

180
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,520
but then when I come back, I'd--I'd love to help.

181
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,940
Oh, Kitty, Sweetie Pie, I don't know how to say this delicately, but I'm not cremating anything.

182
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,720
You know, I am an excellent cook.

183
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,710
In fact, some people even call me a chef.

184
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,480
Some with a really good sense of humor.

185
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,020
So...

186
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,210
You're okay?  We're okay?

187
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm okay, and we're...

188
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,410
more than okay.

189
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,210
Just go do your McCallister interview,

190
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,360
and don't forget to ask him if he slept with the nanny.

191
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,060
Oh, Mother, not you.

192
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,520
It's not news.

193
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,120
No, no, no, but it's very interesting.

194
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,260
"Interesting"?

195
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,440
Aw, Mom...

196
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,140
You don't always have to be strong.

197
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,180
I'm not.

198
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,850
They're gonna take my-- my boy.  They're gonna take my boy.

199
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,940
No, no.  We're gonna do something.

200
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,730
Kevin's gonna-- Kevin's gonna do something.

201
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,910
No, he came by earlier this morning,

202
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,240
about four pies ago, and there's nothing he can do to keep Justin out of it.

203
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,550
Are you sure?

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,350
Yes.  He has to report in--in two weeks, or they're going to arrest him.

205
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,150
I don't know how I can do this again.

206
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,820
I was afraid to answer the phone.

207
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,800
I was afraid they were calling to say that...

208
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,650
I don't know...

209
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,710
God, how many times will I have to lose my boy?

210
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,340
Oh, this is ridiculous-- country, light country...and static.

211
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,270
- Pick the static. 
- What CDs do you have?

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,680
Kevin, you are such a cliche.

213
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,570
What did you expect-- Ludacris?

214
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,610
Okay, "Apocalypse Now."

215
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,280
Is that a band?

216
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,680
Cinema.  Last man standing gets to control the dial for the whole trip.

217
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,270
Uh, "Whale Rider."

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,810
"Apocalypse now" ends with a "w," so "Whale Rider."

219
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,860
A movie that starts with "r,"  Kev, go.

220
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,340
- I know the rules, Einstein. 
- Oh, just go.

221
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,030
"Rambo: First Blood Part II."

222
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,690
No sequels.  How am I gonna come up with a movie that begins with a "2"?

223
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,640
- "2 Fast 2 Furious"
- "2001: A Space Odyssey"

224
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,080
- What's that smoke? 
- I don't think that's a movie, and it certainly doesn't start with a "2."

225
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,330
No, there is smoke pouring out the front of your hood.

226
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,520
It's okay. I have this under control...

227
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,660
If only to prove to you two I'm not a cliche.

228
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,470
No one panic.

229
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,250
I'll stretch my legs.

230
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,760
He's gonna get himself killed.

231
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,480
He's pouring water into the radiator.  He'll be fine.

232
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,920
I'm talking about Justin.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,290
He can handle himself.  He's not a baby.

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,390
- I didn't say he was. 
- But you treat him like one.

235
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,480
You all do.  You all complain, and you worry,

236
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,420
and you don't see that you're responsible.

237
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,720
- How am I responsible? 
- We all are.

238
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,890
I mean, every self-destructive thing he's ever done, including enlisting in the military,

239
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,340
he did to prove that he's not the baby of the family.

240
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,930
Cliche that.

241
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,170
You were saying?

242
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,130
Excuse me. Um, Senator McCallister, hi.

243
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,160
- I'm Kitty Walker. 
- Call me Robert.

244
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,050
- Really? 
- Hell, no.

245
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,280
I campaigned through a primary and a runoff so people would call me "senator."

246
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,780
Guys, could you give me the room?

247
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,150
I just came in to introduce myself before the interview, and is there anything else we can get you?

248
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,200
Three more votes on my bill to stop federal funding of stem cell research.

249
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,320
Oh, well, it's already been stopped for the last six years, except the existing cell lines.

250
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,870
You're one of those Republicans.

251
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,230
Why?  Because I happen to support federal funding for stem cell research?

252
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,710
Because you support federal funding of issues which are not federal.

253
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,660
You know, there's a reason the other guys keep saying our spending habits are out of control.

254
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,050
- Why is that? 
- They're right.

255
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,230
I mean, why can't the states who are in favor of it fund it themselves?  It's what we did in California.

256
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,730
Well, I'm not sure that America is ready for us to run the country like we run California, not even Californians.

257
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,920
See?  Isn't this much more fun than asking me about my divorce?

258
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,710
I don't know.  I haven't asked you about your divorce yet.

259
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,980
Okay.

260
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,780
I have an idea.

261
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,580
How about instead of grilling me on my private, 

262
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,380
and intensely painful, public divorce on national television, I take you out for an espresso?

263
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,770
An espresso?

264
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,490
Look, this is my first on-camera since Courtney and I split.

265 
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,650
If I can get by here, it allows me to establish myself as a senator and not an ex-husband.

266
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,380
Right, but you are a senator and an ex-husband.

267
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,730
- You should talk about both. 
- And I will.

268
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,750
But I promise you my thoughts on immigration won't be the pull-quote from the A.P.

269
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,520
Or the clip downloaded on youtube.

270
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,490
It'll be whatever you get me to say about Bridgette.

271
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,010
I'm assuming Bridgette is the nanny?

272
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,130
You've never been divorced, have you?

273
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,270
No.

274
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,560
Believe me, there are days when you wake up 

275
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:07,760
feeling like a failure at the one thing you've worked your hardest at in your whole life,

276
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,850
and today's one of those days.

277
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,600
Sorry.

278
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,400
Come on, isn't there anything I can say to persuade you?

279
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,240
It's the weirdest thing.  It--it just died.

280
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,040
It didn't just die.  It overheated.

281
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,660
You did something to it, and then it died.

282
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,540
You guys drive this thing into a lake or something?

283
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,990
Engine's flooded...

284
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,930
- with water.  
- With evian.

285
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,230
Must have put it in the fill hole.

286
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,410
- No gay jokes. 
- You poured water into the oil pan?

287
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,390
How long is this gonna take to fix?

288
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,440
Three, four hours, tops.

289
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,770
Gonna have to flush the engine.

290
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,480
There's a sandwich shop nearby.

291
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,740
They make a mean patty melt.

292
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,610
Oh, come on.  That was an innocent mistake.

293
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,590
You still love road trips?

294
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
Hey, Joe.  It's me.

295
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm gonna be a little longer than I thought.

296
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,250
Will do.

297
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,750
Thank you very much.  That's all we have time for.

298
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,890
... and we're out.

299
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,820
- So when does this air? 
- Tomorrow night.

300
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,150
Don't worry.  You were great.

301
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,200
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you.

302
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,950
- Take care. 
- You, too.

303
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,880
Good luck to your brother.

304
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,810
Thank you.

305
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,130
What was that?

306
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,190
What was what?  I thought it was great.

307
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,420
Yeah, for him.  Did you completely forget about the divorce?

308
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,670
And "good luck to your brother"?  How does he even know about your brother?

309
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,350
Oh, Kitty.  Tell me you didn't.

310
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,500
Didn't what?

311
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,940
Tell me you didn't ask the senator for a favor concerning your brother.

312
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,980
Tell me you didn't jeopardize your integrity and the integrity of this program all in one fell swoop.

313
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,150
- Warren, that is-- 
- Just tell me you didn't.

314
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,810
I didn't.

315
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,410
What is this?

316
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,420
It's a letter I downloaded off the internet.

317
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,910
"After much consideration, I have decided to withdraw my choice of enlisting."

318
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,230
Justin has decided to withdraw his enlistment?

319
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,960
All he needs to do is send that letter in before reporting for active duty.

320
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,870
But he actually hasn't sent it in yet.

321
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,860
He won't do it if I ask him, Kitty.  But he will if you ask him.

322
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,150
- No.  No, Mom. 
--Please.

323
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,530
- No, I- I won't do it. 
- Please, please, please.

324
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,040
He's making a terrible mistake.

325
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,680
Well, I actually don't think that he is making a mistake.

326
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,260
I--and if he is, well, then it's his mistake to make.

327
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,270
You can't actually agree with him going off to war where he might get himself killed--

328
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,180
Oh, Mom, we are not at war yet.

329
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,020
Oh, please.  We were attacked.

330
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,060
This country's gonna bomb something.  It's the American way.

331
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,430
That's right, we were attacked.

332
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,190
And now it's time to strike back,

333
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,580
and I, for one, am very proud of Justin for being so patriotic that he wants to be a part of that.

334
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,400
Kitty, this isn't your radio show.

335
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,330
This is your brother we're talking about.

336
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,630
How do you know that enlisting isn't actually going to be what he needs, Mom?

337
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,950
Dad is always talking about how the army taught him discipline.

338
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,870
And what good is discipline if you're not alive to have it?

339
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,400
Mom, this might just be what Justin needs to turn his life around.

340
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,520
There's a reason the greatest generation was a generation of veterans.

341
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,490
It was different, Kitty.  You said so yourself.

342
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,850
How is it different?

343
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,340
Our way of life is being attacked.

344
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,010
Justin is just trying to protect and defend all of those rights that you taught us to value in the first place.

345
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,850
I know what's right for my son.

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,710
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't see it that way, and more importantly, neither does Justin.

347
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,500
He just wants to be a part of something, Mom.

348
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
He is a part of something.

349
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,910
He is a part of this family, and even if you don't appreciate that, he does.

350
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,660
Right.

351
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,530
Is it hopeless?

352
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,130
Justin or the car?

353
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,550
- Both. 
- There's a fix for the car.

354
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,260
What about one of those rehab resorts?

355
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,180
I thought we were taking him there.  Isn't that the plan?

356
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,920
Well, yeah, it was, until I found out the military insists on treating Justin themselves.

357
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,980
While angry insurgents fire at him.  That's how he got into trouble in the first place.

358
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,430
It doesn't make sense.

359
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,380
Oh, and when this war starts making sense, be sure to let me know.

360
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,860
Good as new.  I even changed your spark plugs for you, free of charge.

361
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,610
Okay.

362
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,210
$400, right?

363
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,540
Oh, cash.  We're--we're cash only here.

364
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,330
Oh, God.

365
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,080
Why didn't you tell us this four hours ago?

366
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,170
Well, you weren't paying four hours ago.

367
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,740
Besides, the signs--the signs have been here the whole time.

368
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,010
Do you have an A.T.M?

369
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,720
Nearest one's in Ruby Valley, but I wouldn't recommend walkin'.

370
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,920
The car rental place down the road takes credit.

371
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,280
Wait a second.  You can use a credit card to rent a car,

372
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,470
but not to get back the car that you own?

373
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,660
They take credit.

374
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,020
- You know what you should-- 
- Shut up!

375
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,090
Hey, Whit, I really don't want to do a piece on what Thanksgiving means to Republicans.

376
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,260
That's not what I want to talk to you about.

377
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,270
Amber has brought a matter of some concern to my attention.

378
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,630
Okay.  What's the concern?

379
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,750
That you went easy on the senator in return for a personal favor.

380
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,600
Okay, well, Amber, can you tell me where and from whom you got that idea?

381
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,860
Are you saying you did?

382
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,170
No, I'm saying that it's not professional and it's not responsible to make accusations without any proof.

383
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,240
But you didn't ask the senator about his divorce.

384
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,310
When you conduct the interviews, Amber, you can decide what gets asked, but--

385
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,120
I mean, do you have any knowledge of McCallister throwing me any favors?

386
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,610
- No, but I know that-- 
- No, no.

387
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Then I'm a little confused as to what we're doing here then.

388
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,560
Sorry, Kitty.

389
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,900
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

390
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,970
Two hours?

391
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,140
Two hours, and you have to go tattle to your little girlfriend?

392
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,280
- What are you talking about?   
- Whit called me on the carpet.

393
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,830
He's accusing me of bribing McCallister to help Justin.

394
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,230
Kitty, I didn't tell Whit anything.

395
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,990
You told Amber.

396
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,560
I told her what I thought.

397
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,420
- I didn't think she'd say anything.   
- Oh, oh, really?

398
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,610
"Little Miss Blonde Ambition?"

399
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,380
Besides, you denied it.

400
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,510
You told me you didn't do anything.

401
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,780
Are you telling me something different now?

402
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,070
All right.

403
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,490
When Justin went away, I went away.

404
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,080
I went back to New York, and I missed all the holidays without him.

405
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,830
I missed all the meals without him.

406
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,980
I missed all the fights that my mother and my father must have had when they were worried sick,

407
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,590
and that was when we were winning the war.

408
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,430
That was when the...

409
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,140
when we knew what we were fighting for.

410
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,250
But now it's more dangerous than ever over there,

411
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,000
and he's going back, and I'm here, and my mother--

412
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,980
my mother, who is so strong-- she is so heartbroken...

413
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,270
So, yes.

414
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,010
Yes, of course, I asked McCallister to help me, and he said no.

415
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,180
So I thought that if I did him a favor and didn't ask him about the divorce that maybe he could help me.

416
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,920
I thought maybe he would change his mind.

417
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,770
And you know what? I don't care if it was wrong.

418
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,360
I did it for my brother.  I did it for my family.

419
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,770
And you know what? I would do it again in a heartbeat.

420
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm just--I'm...

421
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,980
- We got a problem.    
- What?

422
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,790
No motels in this town.

423
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,380
No motels, no hotels.

424
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,970
The closest thing is 60 miles away.

425
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,760
That island on "Lost" has more civilization than this place.

426
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,410
Where are you going?

427
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,670
Well, if I'm gonna sleep in a rental car, I'm not gonna do it sober.

428
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,000
No. Whoa, Sarah!

429
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,000
Now is not the time to get your buzz on.

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh, wow. This is straight out of "A Few Good Men."

431
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,640
More than a few.  Three beers, please.

432
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,180
I thought you wante d to get wasted.

433
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,760
Three bourbons, too. Thanks.

434
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,370
- To William's folly.  
- Oh, come on.

435
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,430
Could you show some respect?

436
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm sorry, Tommy, but parentage isn't a free pass to cheat and steal.

437
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,050
- Look, I know, but-- 
- He was also our dad.

438
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,500
To William.

439
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,190
Cheers.

440
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,040
Excuse me, ma'am.

441
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,110
We don't get too many civilians in here.

442
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Are you lost?

443
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,730
- I might be.  
- She's not.

444
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,850
Sorry, man. You her boyfriend?

445
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,690
No, her brother. Plus she's married.

446
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,930
Uh, Tommy, in case you hadn't noticed, there's, like,

447
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,670
the entire 82nd Airborne in here.

448
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,250
So--um, I'm sorry, he gets a little protective of her. Has done since puberty.

449
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,090
I just wanted to see if the lady might be interested in shooting a little pool.

450
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,190
Actually, the lady would.

451
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,120
Don't worry, Tommy.

452
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,690
It's only a game of pool.  My virtue will remain intact.

453
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,760
Don't worry about that, man.

454
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,750
Dan's just happy to see a woman out of uniform, you know?

455
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,270
Life on the base is pretty much a 24/7 sausage fest.

456
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
That sounds pretty...

457
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,360
... horrible. That-- that sounds pretty horrible.

458
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,400
- You're alive.  
- Are you?

459
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,740
Oh, this. I-I had a run-in with some siding.

460
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,860
The siding won.

461
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,500
David, please come in.

462
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,810
This is a surprise--

463
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,630
a very nice one, but unexpected.

464
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,580
Well, I'm sorry to just drop by like this,

465
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,160
but things were left a... a little unresolved.

466
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,430
I know. I'm so sorry, David.

467
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,690
I am so sorry. It was a lovely, lovely evening,

468
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,230
but things happened with-- life happened,

469
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,290
and I got distracted.

470
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,310
Yeah, I get that.

471
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,020
Life happens.

472
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,170
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

473
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,540
I've got five grown children and two grandchildren

474
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,830
and a house full of problems I can't quit thinking about.

475
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,340
Well, then maybe you're not supposed to.

476
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,160
You're so sweet, David.

477
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,020
I really think you should run screaming from me as if you were on fire.

478
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,730
No, no, no. You're not gonna get off that easy.

479
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,230
I don't ditch my friends just because they're going through a rough patch.

480
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,430
"Friends"?

481
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,700
That's what you want, isn't it?

482
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,110
Yes.  Yes, I truly do.

483
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,160
Great.

484
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,000
So we're okay now?

485
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,810
Yes. Yes, we're great.

486
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,960
David, please don't be a stranger.

487
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,380
I don't want you to feel like every time you come here you're always required to nail something.

488
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,450
I didn't say that right, did I?

489
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,060
Sure you did.

490
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,750
- I'll be around, Nora.   
- I hope so.

491
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,170
Hey, you're back.

492
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,910
So, uh, where'd you put the letter?

493
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,520
What letter?

494
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,970
The form letter.

495
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,430
You know, the one you were trying to get Kitty to get me to sign.

496
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,060
Yeah, you're busted, Mom. She told me.

497
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,480
I'm sorry, Justin.

498
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,300
Look, it's cool. I just want to see it, that's all.

499
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,750
Been doing some rethinking.

500
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,660
That's great. I threw it out.

501
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,240
Kitty told me you wouldn't be interested, so I went and threw it out.

502
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,530
You sent it in already.

503
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,500
I knew you would eventually change your mind.

504
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,770
What are you doing?

505
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,590
I'm gonna call the recruiter and tell him to ignore that letter.

506
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,040
- Justin...     
- I shoulda done this a long time ago.

507
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,510
I mean, Kitty knew. She knew that was the only way

508
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,820
she was gonna have a life was to get as far away from you as possible.

509
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,600
I want you to have a life.  That's the whole point. Please.

510
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,700
I don't want you to do something I know you will regret!

511
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,240
That's right. You know, right?

512
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,820
You know what I should do and how I should do it, Mom.

513
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,230
Because you're my whole life.

514
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,770
No, Mom, I'm your son. I've got my own life.

515
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,050
Where'd you learn to break like that?

516
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,210
Three brothers and a dad.

517
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,380
Uh, are you done having...

518
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,280
Fun yet?

519
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,510
I love this song.

520
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,060
- Dance, Tommy.  
- Couldn't you just kill me instead?

521
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,720
Your sister has how many kids?

522
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,120
I honestly don't know anymore.

523
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,490
How about you?

524
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,860
No, I-I don't have any kids.

525
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,610
And I don't envision that happening anytime soon

526
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,570
'cause for one thing, I'm gay.

527
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,290
So an unplanned pregnancy isn't really a risk for me.

528
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,090
For another, you kinda need to be in a long-term relationship,

529
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,990
and my--my boyfriend just broke up with me so...

530
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,010
So you're single.

531
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,190
I was hoping you'd say that.

532
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,890
Good news. No, great news.

533
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,640
I've got a line on a place for us to crash tonight.

534
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,100
You're incredible.

535
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,110
We come to an army bar, and he gets laid.

536
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,280
Well, not yet, but I am working on it.

537
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,980
You're either about to do something very naughty,

538
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,130
or you already have.

539
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,110
What gave me away?

540
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,940
The night before you cheated on Mrs. Worthington's spelling test, you ate a whole pint.

541
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,680
You remember every bad thing I've ever done, don't you?

542
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,300
I remember every bad thing we've both ever done.

543
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,990
We, I've got a new one, one for the record books.

544
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,680
I tried to bribe the senator to help Justin.

545
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,730
To get him out of the military?

546
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,060
Yeah, I thought that he'd be able to help Justin and get him off the hook.

547
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,970
And me, too, I guess.

548
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,410
It wasn't your fault that Justin enlisted.

549
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,390
It was mine.

550
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,840
- What are you talking about?   
- I pushed him.

551
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,510
He was about to change his mind, and I pushed him the other way.

552
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,100
And I blamed it on you.

553
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,060
I was too angry and scared to blame it on myself.

554
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,800
No. Justin would have never enlisted if I hadn't--

555
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,050
You're both crazy.

556
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,080
I enlisted because I wanted to.

557
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,050
I went back and forth about a thousand times in my head before I went,

558
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,330
and nothing anyone said or did was gonna change my mind.

559
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,150
It was the best and worst decision I've made in my entire life,

560
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,810
but you know what?  It was my choice.

561
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,600
So I'm not going to fight the recall.

562
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,020
I'm going back.

563
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,020
I feel like Nick Nolte's mug shot.

564
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,600
That's what happens when you do jell-o shots with enlisted men.

565
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,620
If we're not as chipper as you are, Kev,

566
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,300
it's because you didn't sleep on the floor.

567
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,870
Oh, that's right, Tommy.

568
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,740
I certainly did not.

569
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,240
One day, son, this will all be yours.

570
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,290
Okay, Tommy, 500 miles, two cars later, you happy now?

571
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,670
Yeah, come on, Tommy, let's go.

572
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,270
We've got a long trip ahead of us.

573
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,390
I don't get it. How could he be this stupid?

574
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,430
- No, how could you be?  
- Oh, screw you.

575
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,680
- Okay, let's calm down.  
- I'm sick of her cracks about him.

576
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,010
I don't care about the mistakes that he made.

577
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,290
- I don't care.  
- Fine.

578
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,520
All right? He was our dad.

579
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,910
Not just ours.

580
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,930
Excuse me?

581
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,080
What--what ex-exactly does that mean?

582 
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,850
You just said, "not just ours"?  What...

583
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,880
He had another kid...

584
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,960
with Holly.

585
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,210
Remember that photo we found up at the ranch?

586
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,780
That was her.

587
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,950
Her name's Rebecca.

588
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,980
Dad kept her photo.

589
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,260
Of course.

590
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,010
And, um...

591
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,320
So does, uh, does--does Mom know about this?

592
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,230
No! And, Kevin, she never will, OK?

593
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,410
Oh, and-- and have you met her?

594
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,650
- I mean are we gonna meet her?   
- No and no.

595
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,210
Well, we are talking about another sister.

596
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,630
No, actually, we're not talking about her anymore ever again.

597
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,300
Okay? Can we please just go home?

598
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,620
- I don't think we should leave until we --
- Kev, Kev, Kev,

599
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,720
just let it go, okay?

600
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,280
There's a bank in town.

601
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,180
We'll get cash there.

602
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,290
Yeah, sure.  Yeah. Let's-- yeah, let's let it go. Of course.

603
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,250
Uh, hey, Jack, if it's okay with you,

604
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,240
I'd like to introduce the McCallister segment.

605
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,540
Yeah, sure. It's your interview.

606
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,190
- and we're on in three...    
- Thanks.

607
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,450
Two...

608
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,070
Welcome. Obama mulls an '08 run, election day fallout,

609
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,210
and we go toe-to-toe on gay marriage, but first,

610
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,410
an exclusive interview with Senator Robert McCallister,

611
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,120
who sat down yesterday with our own Kitty Walker.

612
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,370
- Kitty.  
- Thank you, Jack.

613
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,170
In the interview that you are about to see,

614
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,990
I asked Senator McCallister about his stem cell bill,

615
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,290
his position on Iraq and his aspiration towards higher executive office.

616
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,290
What I didn't ask him about was his recent divorce.

617
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,390
Now I wish I could I say I didn't ask the senator about his divorce

618
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,320
because of some high-minded notion of journalistic integrity, but...

619
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,610
it was just the opposite.

620
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,490
I have a brother who served in Afghanistan and was recently called back to serve in Iraq.

621
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,330
And I did the senator a favor in the hope that he would do me one

622
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,230
and use his influence to keep my brother home...

623
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:20,230
to keep him from fighting in a war that I have defended on this very program.

624
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,450
Senator McCallister rightly refused to help me.

625
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,040
His integrity remains intact.

626
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,010
But mine, however, less so.

627
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,780
Mistakes were made.

628
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,700
President Ronald Reagan said those words 20 years ago at a time

629
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,200
when admitting a mistake was perceived as a sign of strength,

630
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,080
not weakness.

631
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,000
I made a mistake.

632
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,480
I made a mistake in compromising the interview that you're about to see,

633
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,880
and I made a mistake in continuing to defend a war that is in desperate need of reexamination,

634
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:02,620
reexamination which cannot come until we acknowledge that the war itself was a mistake.

635
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,520
None of this is meant to serve as an excuse for my own conduct,

636
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:12,260
but I do hope that you will find in your hearts to accept my apology.

637
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,530
Thank you, Kitty.

638
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,970
And now our interview with Senator Robert McCallister.

639
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,600
... and back in 15.

640
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,340
Kitty.

641
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,670
You were right to say something.

642
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,080
Do you realize with gas, food and the car,

643
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,420
this trip actually cost us money?

644
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,950
It's just, I never remember Dad coming out here.

645
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,170
Well, he must have at some point.

646
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,630
What?

647
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,950
- This is the only bank.   
- Yeah.

648
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,480
Maybe this is where Dad got the mortgage.

649
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,460
Excuse me.

650
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,610
Hey, uh, my father passed away recently,

651
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,610
and I think he might have had a loan through your bank. William Walker.

652
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,450
Oh, uh, let me check the records.

653
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,550
Look, Dad bought that land for a reason.

654
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,210
I mean, he must have had a reason.

655
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,900
Maybe the reason's in the loan docs.

656
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,560
I agree.

657
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,210
I'm sorry. There's no loans to a William Walker.

658
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,150
But, uh, he did maintain a safe deposit box with us.

659
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,330
Uh, I'm--I'm the executor of Mr. Walker's estate,

660
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,440
and I'd like to see that box, please.

661
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,510
Well, I'll need a death certificate and a copy of the will.

662
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,220
Of course. What's your fax number?

663
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,170
No, they're just papers.

664
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,350
It's a letter for Mom.

665
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,260
What's that?

666
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,420
Oh, it's an easement.

667
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,520
It's, uh, it's kind of a free pass to use someone else's land.

668
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,680
Look, Dad gave permission to the army to drive over the land he bought.

669
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,630
Oh, my God.

670
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,070
Don't tell me.  Dad used to be a woman.

671
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,820
No, no. There's a survivorship clause.

672
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,870
Upon Dad's death, we can sell the land to the army.

673
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,020
The sale price...

674
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,790
of the land is, uh, is--is--is liquidated.

675
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,470
It's a set amount.

676
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,880
It is it enough to pay back the money Dad stole?

677
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,950
Yeah, and--and-- and then some.

678
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,850
William's Folly is worth...

679
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,280
over $30 million.

680
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,360
- No.  
- Yeah.

681
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,050
- Really?  
- Yeah.

682
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,280
It's your brother.

683
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,070
I'm hungry.

684
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,410
Uh, please warn me in advance which entrees were prepared with Kitty's loving hands.

685
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,440
Uh, you guys know that I'm standing right here, right?

686
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,310
- Good morning. 
- Morning.

687
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,570
Wait, you're cooking?

688
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,550
Under the proper supervision.

689
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,820
I can see your appetite's returned.

690
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,830
Kitty, phone call.

691
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,950
Uh, take a message, please.

692
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,130
Sure. What should I tell the senator?

693
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,650
Hello?

694
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,750
Happy Thanksgiving, and good interview.

695
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,400
I thought it came off particularly well.

696
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,600
Oh, well, that's probably because I didn't ask if you slept with the nanny.

697
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,400
If that's regret that I'm sensing, then for the record, no, I didn't.

698
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,960
So how fast did they fire you?

699
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,980
Well, they haven't fired me yet.

700
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,200
Really? That's too bad.

701
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,170
I was hoping you'd be back on the market.

702
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,340
Excuse me?

703
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,650
I could use somebody like you on my communications staff.

704
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,410
Y-you're offering me a job on your staff?

705
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,220
No, as my nanny.

706
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,230
You don't have to say yes right away.

707
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,120
Just tell me you'll think about it.

708
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,480
Yeah, I'll think about it.

709
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,640
Happy Thanksgiving, Senator.

710
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,360
You, too.

711
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,710
That's incredible news.

712
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,490
Yeah, it is incredible.

713
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,150
So we're gonna be all right, then?

714
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,720
You could put it that way.

715
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,930
We're not going into bankruptcy, Nora. That's the main thing.

716
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,000
We were looking through Dad's stuff,

717
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,270
and we found this, addressed to you.

718
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,740
We didn't open it.

719
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,540
That's Dad's handwriting.

720
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,970
I know he wasn't perfect, but...

721
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:42,130
still, he was a lot more than what we've been giving him credit for lately.

722
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,420
Yeah, he was.

723
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,670
"My dearest Nora,"

724
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,640
"There's a part of me that hopes you never read this."

725
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,480
"Because if you are, it means that you've discovered some of the mistakes I've made in my life."

726
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,730
"And while I've tried to set those mistakes right,"

727
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,180
"I know that I'll never be able to completely repair your trust."

728
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,080
"It tortures me to think that I've ever caused you a moment's pain."

729
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,160
"But I know I have."

730
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,290
"I only hope that you can find it in your heart-- "

731
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,980
"a heart which is far better and purer than mine-- to forgive me my sins."

732
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,750
"Because despite my mistakes and errors in judgment,"

733
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,320
"I have always loved you."

734
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,980
"I have always treasured your love and the love of our children."

735
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,820
"Each of one of them is a little piece of you."

736
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,310
"Each one is so lucky to have gotten your kind heart."

737
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,830
"And no matter what mistakes I've made or to the extent of the pain those mistakes may have caused,"

738
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,480
"I know I've done at least one right thing in this life..."

739
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,780
"and that was to fall in love and make a family with you."

740
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,400
Thank you.

741
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,310
Thank you.

742
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,400
Thank you all so much for being here.

743
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,320
It means so much to me...

744
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,390
especially after these past few months.

745
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,730
We have all been through so much.

746
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,180
And I'm--I'm so grateful to all of you.

747
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,480
Cheers.

748
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,100
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

749
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,820
Happy Thanksgiving!

750
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,200
Cheers.

751
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,690
Go ahead.

752
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,660
It's the right time.

753
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,070
Wait, wait, "right time" for what?

754
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,790
We're having a baby.

755
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:02,540
"Because our family means so much more to me than my mistakes suggest."

756
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:08,080
"Our family is everything, the best thing I ever did in my entire life."

757
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,030
"With love and remorse, William."
