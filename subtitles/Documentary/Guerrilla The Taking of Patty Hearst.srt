1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
And so?

2
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,880
And so, I'm sitting there
staring at him, right?

3
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,120
He tells me to get my fucking crunchy
fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,680
You believe that shit?

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,120
You know what I said, right?
No, what did you say?

6
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,720
Shit. "Okay. "
You fucking said, "Okay. "

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,320
I'm sure you did.
Ha, ha, ha.

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,040
Control Center,
this is Stillwell 1215.

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,840
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm about four cars
out of 57th Street station

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
being delayed
by a red signal light.

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
Should be green,
Stillwell 1215.

13
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,760
All right, roll through it slow,
extreme caution, per the rulebook.

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,080
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet
from the east end of the platform.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,640
It's the goddamn cold. Metal
contracts, you know that.

17
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,880
I got it, I got it.
How long it take to fix it?

18
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Gotta put a plate on it.
Two hours.

19
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
Thank you. Make it an hour and
a half, I'll buy you a beer.

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,640
Shit, G.B.

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,720
I hate to see you down
here on the floor, man.

22
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.

23
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay, I'm gonna need
the R train

24
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,960
to switch over to the
express tracks at 34th.

25
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,040
Which express tracks?
The one that Q uses.

26
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Once they exit the 57th Street,
they can switch over to the F Line.

27
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Boom, straight shot
into Queens.

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Once they get to Queens, they switch
back at 36th Street to the R Line.

29
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,960
All you gotta do is suspend the W, N
and R will pick up the slack, all right?

30
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
Excuse me, I can't
see where I gotta look.

31
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,240
Unlock the door. Do it now or
I'll fucking kill you. Do it.

32
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
All right, all right.

33
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
Shut up and walk.

34
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
First car, go.

35
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,960
See?
I told you I could do this.

36
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Big fucking deal, you did
what you said you'd do.

37
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
All right.

38
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Five minutes of peace.

39
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Yeah!
Nice!

40
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Nice.
All right.

41
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,920
There you go.

42
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm on the train
and I still got you.

43
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,720
You still got me?

44
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,160
I got you.
What are you doing?

45
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,240
You still got me?

46
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Oh, my God.

47
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
Baby? Baby?

48
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,880
Give me the cutting key.

49
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,280
Cutting key.

50
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,320
Control Center calling Pelham
123. Come in, Pelham 123.

51
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
Why did you stop?
You're all green ahead.

52
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,240
Control Center calling Pelham 123.

53
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,440
Control Center calling Pelham 123.

54
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,760
yhy did you stop, 123?
You got green ahead.

55
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
It's okay.

56
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,760
Life is simple now.

57
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,120
You just gotta do what I say.

58
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,440
Not now, okay?

59
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
Where are you from?

60
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Brooklyn.
You Irish?

61
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Yeah.

62
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I thought so.

63
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Who's driving Pelham 123?

64
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Maybe something fell on the tracks.

65
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Wait. Are we going backwards?

66
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,120
42nd Street tower,
I got a train wrong-railing

67
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,040
on the southbound Lexington
Avenue Line just north of you.

68
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,320
Listen up,
we need to stop and stay in-station.

69
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,440
All southbound locals
just north of the 51 st Street station.

70
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,240
The operator on 123
is Jerry Pollard.

71
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Jerry Pollard. I know Jerry Pollard. I
went to motorman school with Jerry Pollard.

72
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,840
Pelham 123,
come in to me, Pelham 123.

73
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard,
what's going on down there?

74
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,720
This is Control Center.
yhat's going on, 123?

75
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,440
Let's get an express train to go up, pull
alongside them, see what we see in the cab.

76
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah, this is South Ferry 105.

77
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,880
I can't get my windshield wiper
to turn on.

78
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,360
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit
breaker right behind you for that.

79
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,800
What's going on?

80
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Maestro, what's going on?

81
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Cop.
Excuse me.

82
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Fuck.

83
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
Watch your backs.
Watch your backs.

84
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,520
When I say stop, stop it hard.

85
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,920
Transit Police.
Stop.

86
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,960
Everybody sit the fuck down!

87
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,160
Down!
Aah!

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
Sit the fuck down!

89
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,920
MAN Jesus! We're getting reports
of gunshots down the tunnel.

90
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
Sergeant Moran.

91
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,960
Delgado, let's call off that express.
Got it.

92
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,440
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna fucking die, man.

93
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Come on! Hey.

94
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,440
Everybody up! By the
window! Come on, up, up, up!

95
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,160
Stand up! Stand up! Come on!

96
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,120
Move it!
Against the window!

97
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
What the fuck is going on?

98
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,600
RAMOS There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.

99
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,400
I think- I think he's dead.

100
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,920
Put Bashkin on and
find your fucking guts!

101
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Do it!
Fuck.

102
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,400
What happened?
A cop. He's dead.

103
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,920
Put the conductor on.

104
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
yhat's your name, conductor?
Regina.

105
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,120
Regina, baby, listen,
you got a job to do, honey.

106
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
A job?

107
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,240
Yeah, God put you on this Earth
for one thing and one thing only.

108
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,280
You're gonna conduct
those people off the train

109
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,880
and up to the platform station.
You got that? Let me hear it.

110
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
Let me hear you do that.

111
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,520
Listen up,
everybody.

112
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,360
We're gonna go back to the
platform. I need everybody to-

113
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,680
Regina. Let's do it again.

114
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Conduct those people.

115
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,120
Listen up, everybody. Now, we're
gonna head back towards the platform.

116
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,040
I want everybody
to slowly get up.

117
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm gonna get you off this train.
Good.

118
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,280
Now, we're gonna be on the tracks,
so if you don't need it, leave it.

119
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
WOMAN
Have been put on alert regarding-

120
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,160
OFFICER: Right here, right
here. Right here, right here.

121
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,960
Cross right here, right here.

122
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Go.

123
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,520
OFFICER: Cross over
right here, right here.

124
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Let's go.

125
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
Up the stairs, up the stairs.
OFFICER: Here you go.

126
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,040
Every cop in the city is on the way.
Maybe it wasn't even gunshots.

127
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,560
I mean, a train could be blowing the
breakers, right? Or the motor blew?

128
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,840
No, this is on purpose.

129
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,960
Fuck you.

130
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,160
Yeah, I'm coming.
Get the fuck off the walls.

131
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Shut the fuck up and come on.

132
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,920
Shit. Come on.

133
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,440
Ramos. Turn the power
off from there down.

134
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
What?

135
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
Turn the power off
from there down!

136
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay, I got it!

137
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,560
BASHKIN:
My fucking lucky day.

138
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,640
Shit. What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

139
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,480
Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center.
Do you read me?

140
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,360
Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.

141
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,120
This is Control Center.
Who is this?

142
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,000
Heh, heh, heh.
It's me, man.

143
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,880
I didn't wanna call
till everything was ready.

144
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,520
WHISPERING] It's not Jerry.
I don't know who it is.

145
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
I understand, I understand,
Pelham 123.

146
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Who the hell is this?

147
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,760
This is the man
who's gonna rock this city.

148
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,680
This is the man who's gonna give
the city a run for the money.

149
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,720
Look up. Look up at your screen
and you tell me what you see.

150
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,800
You see what I've done?

151
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,920
I see it.

152
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,000
One car is much more manageable
than 10 with the manpower I got.

153
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,840
Mr. Motorman's gonna tell you all
about it. Tell him what we got here.

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
They got hostages,
lots of them.

155
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
And, uh, they got machine guns.
WHISPERING] That's Jerry.

156
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,080
WHISPERING] Yeah. That's Jerry.
Yeah, that's right.

157
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
You check me,
do you understand that?

158
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,600
I check, I understand.

159
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,400
Didn't I tell you
to knock first?

160
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Good, because this is what
we call a cash transaction.

161
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,880
Now, you understand
commodities, don't you?

162
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,880
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

163
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,200
Listen.
Listen, no disrespect,

164
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,320
but maybe
- Maybe I'm not the guy you should be talking to.

165
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, no, you are exactly
the guy I wanna talk to.

166
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,360
Now, I want you to look at
the ticker and you tell me

167
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,800
what is the going rate for a
New York City hostage today?

168
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
You think a million dollars is
too much? I do. I think it's corny.

169
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,920
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

170
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,000
Uh...

171
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
Do you haνe a calculator?
Yeah, we got one. I got one.

172
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,520
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,315 and 79 cents.

173
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,720
That's 526,315.79.

174
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,080
Now, times that by 19.

175
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,360
What do you got?

176
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,720
What is he,
a goddamn accountant?

177
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,640
That's 10 million?
What do you got?

178
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,960
That comes out to 10 million
plus one cent.

179
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
Oh. That is a deal.

180
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,160
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

181
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,120
And then you tell him I want it in
100,000 $100 bills, you got that?

182
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,040
I got it.
What about the one cent?

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,840
Oh, you keep that one cent,
that's your broker fee.

184
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,960
the kind with the wheels and
the portable handle, okay?

186
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,120
Now, this is not a futures
contract. This is a spot trade.

187
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,200
That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?

188
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,520
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

189
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,200
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy-

190
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
Come on,
give me a time limit.

191
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,200
Give me a
fair time limit.

192
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Thursday.

193
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,640
I was thinking more like an hour.
Now, what's your watch say?

194
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
Two-thirteen.

195
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Oh, that's exactly what my watch says.

196
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,840
So at 3:13, I want that
money here, motherfucker.

197
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,240
And after that, there is a late fee.

198
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,720
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

199
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,640
Come on, tell me what it'll be.

200
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,040
You're gonna kill
the passengers?

201
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,080
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

202
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,960
One for every minute past the
deadline I am forced to wait.

203
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,760
Now, they become more valuable
this way

204
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,400
and still at the same price.

205
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,200
He's underground in the tunnel.
He's never gonna pull this off.

206
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,880
Don't tell me, tell him.
Who the hell is this guy?

207
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
I don't know who it is!

208
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Garber, Garber,
just stay with it.

209
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,080
Now, what's your name?
I didn't get your name.

210
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,000
What's your name, my man?
My name?

211
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,120
What's your name?

212
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,520
Tell him?

213
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,200
Garber.
Garber, okay.

214
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes,

215
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm gonna start
killing passengers.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,160
So my advice to you is to get on the
phone, get the mayor notified now.

217
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,960
Listen, I mean...

218
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

219
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,560
Well, that's your problem,
man, that's not mine.

220
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,960
It's like, who's responsible for
who lives and who dies in New York?

221
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
That's New York City's problem.

222
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,520
Get the fuck off the radio and
notify the mayor, motherfucker!

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,120
Okay.

224
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Nine months of this,
and I'm free.

225
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,320
Next mayor gets inaugurated,

226
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm gonna be sitting in Saint-Tropez
on the beach with a piña colada.

227
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,480
I will never have to ride
the subway ever again.

228
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
Never say never, sir.
Never.

229
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,760
All right, what's
next for the afternoon?

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,440
East Harlem Elementary
at 2:30.

231
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
You're supposed to read The Cat
In The Hat to the third grade.

232
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,360
Every time I go to the schools, I
get sick. They all have runny noses.

233
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,000
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him
waiting at the school, with a fu shot.

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,240
Mayor's office.

235
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,800
He's in Car 3.
Yeah.

236
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
What happened?

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,840
Somebody just hijacked
a 6 train.

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,320
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

239
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,080
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,760
It's unclear, but I have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

241
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,440
Subway will get us there faster.

242
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
All right. Let the doors close.

243
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,000
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

244
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,880
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,120
We're skipping the next five stops.
What?

246
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,600
I gotta get to work.
Hold on, hold on.

247
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,720
Everybody will get where they need
to go, we'll make all the stops.

248
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,280
Maybe he's not such a
douche bag after all, huh?

249
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,680
Funny.

250
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

251
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,640
Hostage negotiation team is here in five
minutes, and the mayor's been notified.

252
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,880
You gonna tell him?
Get the fuck out of here.

253
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,120
My shift's over in 10 minutes.

254
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,960
What are you staring at?
Your face.

255
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm trying to remember for
when it's not here anymore.

256
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
You gonna start in
on me now?

257
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,160
Damn right,
I'm gonna start in on you.

258
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Don't fuck this up, Garber.
You wanna do it?

259
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
It's your station, it's your call.

260
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, it's my call now?
That's right. Your call.

261
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Come on.

262
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
GARBER Pelham 123, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?

263
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,560
Gerber Baby boy.
What's up?

264
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,920
Garber. Just wanted to let you
know the mayor's been notified.

265
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,480
Are they gonna pay?

266
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
I don't know. I'm just the, uh,
what'd you call me? The, uh, broker.

267
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,240
No, no. No, you represent the
city of New York right now, buddy.

268
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,840
Well, I can tell you you're dealing with one
of the all-time bureaucracies, I know that.

269
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,880
I mean, it takes time.
You'd better fix the bureaucracy,

270
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
because when the time comes,
these motherfuckers, these hostages

271
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,320
are gonna go real quick.

272
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,400
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

273
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Yeah, well, no fucking
pizza for them, either, man.

274
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

276
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,720
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

277
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
So-

278
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,600
So, what,
this is just about money?

279
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,320
Oh, is there anything else?

280
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
There's not dying.

281
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,120
Yeah, well, you know, you live, you die. You
either go with the current or you fight it,

282
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
you all end up
in the same place.

283
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,200
Where's that, Jersey?

284
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,240
Yeah, you watch it.
I was born there, man.

285
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm just saying, you're
up in the motorman's cab.

286
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,120
That means you're on the radio, which
means that you're an easy target.

287
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
You gotta know the drill.

288
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,960
I know that soon
I won't be alone,

289
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.

290
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,840
That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.

291
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,720
Dead is an improvement on a lot of
things I can think of, buddy boy.

292
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,320
Sounds like he slept
with my ex.

293
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,040
You know,
we all owe God a death.

294
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,920
And I'm a man
who pays his debts.

295
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
Are you a man who pays his debts?

296
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.

297
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
That's a little like dying
once a month.

298
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,360
Oh, you're married,
you're a married man.

299
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Maybe.

300
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,000
No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.

301
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
What about you?
You got a mortgage?

302
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,040
Well, I don't know, Garber. Why don't
you tell me, then we'll both know?

303
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know. I mean, you... I'm sure
someone out there loves you dearly and, uh,

304
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,920
you know,
would be worried about you.

305
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,840
Like I said,
you're in the motorman's cab,

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,160
you got no cover,
sniper on the way.

307
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Well, you know, circumstances
are my protection

308
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.

309
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,480
By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.

310
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,960
You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.

311
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,840
Are you Catholic?

312
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm married, you're Catholic.

313
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,800
Maybe. I don't know.
No, you're Catholic.

314
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,120
And a Catholic-
A good Catholic

315
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,680
would know that he's got a
trainload of innocent people.

316
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,920
I mean, you don't wanna
kill innocent people, do you?

317
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,400
A good Catholic knows
that nobody is innocent.

318
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,200
And I'm not gonna kill all these
hostages. I'd give up my leverage.

319
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,320
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing.

320
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,520
Yeah, well, it's running like
a fucking Swiss watch down here,

321
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,480
so don't worry
about it.

322
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
So, what do I call you anyway?

323
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Call me Ryder.

324
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
As in "train rider"?

325
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Call me Ryder,
with a Y.

326
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,360
Ryder.

327
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,560
I like you, Garber.

328
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,280
Ha, ha. I do like you, man.

329
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,360
You may be the last friend I ever make.

330
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr.
Ryder. But, you know, I'm just a guy.

331
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm just a guy
on the other end of the mic.

332
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh, you don't think
this was meant to be?

333
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,000
You don't think this was fate,
you and me?

334
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,320
I don't know. You know, things
happen that lead to other things.

335
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,720
And maybe this was one of them,
but that's it.

336
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,320
I never get excited
about coincidence.

337
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,120
Well, you got 50 fucking
minutes, so check me.

338
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,560
All right. 50 minutes, check.

339
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,760
And don't call me
unless you got news.

340
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,640
- You got it.
- Motherfucker.

341
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,400
G.B.

342
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
You're fucking good, man.

343
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Okay. Move it the other way.

344
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,680
All right, come on,
move it. The other way.

345
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,480
Okay, now move it back
a little less.

346
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,960
Bingo. Got it.

347
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
All right, we got it.

348
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.

349
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
Yeah, under my supervision. Who are you?

350
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,520
Vincent Camonetti, N.Y.P.D.
Hostage Negotiation Team.

351
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,720
John Johnson,
Chief Transportation Officer.

352
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,920
Walter Garber. I'm Console
Dispatch, right now.

353
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,440
What can you tell me, Walter?

354
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,600
Uh, his name is Ryder, with a Y.

355
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,240
And he's asking
for $10 million by 3:13.

356
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
CAMONETTl:
Good. He's looking toward the future.

357
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,360
He say what he'd do if
he doesn't get the money?

358
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah. He said he'd kill a
passenger every minute we go over.

359
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,440
- Starting at 3:13 p. m.?
- 3-1-3, yes, sir.

360
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,320
- Anything else?
- He's smart.

361
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,120
If he's so smart, why is he doing
something so fucking stupid?

362
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Is he on the train radio?

363
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Yeah, yeah, we can
get him right here.

364
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Any chance that we can
get a signal down there?

365
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
We'd like to get him
on one of our cell phones.

366
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,600
No, there's no chance,
not where he is. Uh-uh.

367
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,800
What's this?
"Leverage, spot trade"?

368
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,720
Yeah, it's weird. He's like a
money guy, like a Wall Street.

369
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,480
He talked about the passengers
like they were commodities.

370
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
"Catholic"?
Yeah, I think he's Catholic.

371
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,200
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna
tell us what his zodiac sign is now?

372
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,200
No, I'm just saying, in my
opinion, I think he's Catholic.

373
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,480
Man asked me
about "Catholic. "

374
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,480
I wrote it down.
I'm giving him my opinion.

375
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,320
Unlike other people, around
here, I actually have an opinion.

376
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,240
Fellas, can we settle this
domestic dispute later?

377
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,360
Absolutely.

378
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,800
CAMONETTl:
Why do you think he's Catholic?

379
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,720
Well, I think he's Catholic because he
talked about original sin and confessions.

380
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,120
I don't know, I wrote it down.
I didn't know what else to do.

381
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,480
Did he ask for a priest?
No.

382
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,120
Good. Anything else?

383
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,800
Uh, yeah, he sounded like, you
know, the way he was talking,

384
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,760
he sounded
like he's not afraid to die.

385
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,120
Yeah, well, it's early yet.
Hm.

386
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
The calls are coming through...?
Yes, sir. Right here.

387
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
You hit the blue button here,
you can reach him.

388
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
And then he'll come back to you.

389
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,760
You mind if I take your seat?

390
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,200
No, no, go right ahead.
CAMONETTl: Thank you, Walter.

391
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
You're welcome.

392
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,160
And then this one here, this is the six
wire. You don't have to touch that one.

393
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,800
All right. Okay.
That goes around the whole room.

394
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
Six wire.
Listen, why don't you, uh-

395
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Just hit the talk here,
and then that mutes it.

396
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,520
Take the rest of the day off.
Get out of here.

397
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,080
I thought I'd stick around,
just make sure that...

398
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,560
Well, that wasn't a suggestion.
So why don't you go home?

399
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,800
All right.

400
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,880
This is it. You got all the
information over here about the 313.

401
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Wait for his call.

402
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
You want me to work it up right now?

403
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
CAMONETTl: You call headquarters,
let them know that I'm here,

404
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
and I'm on the job. Okay.

405
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
I gotta take a piss.

406
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,360
So who's stopping you?

407
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,120
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up
on any Amnesty International lists,

408
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,760
so step up to the door,
face out.

409
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,720
Open the middle door.

410
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,200
Do what you gotta do.

411
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
Can I jump down there?

412
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,360
You gotta go or don't you?
I do, I gotta go.

413
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,520
Step up, my man.
Let's go, let's go.

414
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,640
That kid's going places.
All right, close the doors.

415
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,120
CAMONETTl
Pelham 123, come in.

416
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,800
Pelham 123, please come in.
All right, everybody, sit down!

417
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,600
Who is this?

418
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,560
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with
the N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team.

419
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,280
I'd like to talk to you about
the situation that we're in.

420
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,880
Where the fuck is Garber?

421
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,560
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.

422
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,640
This is now a police matter.
Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.

423
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder, but Mr.
Garber is no longer involved.

424
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
Motorman, up!

425
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,440
Put Garber on the line.
To be honest,

426
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Mr. Garber has gone home.

427
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,680
Put Garber on the fucking
line or I kill the motorman.

428
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,400
I guarantee you, Mr. Ryder, that I am the
best person for you to be talking to right now.

429
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,200
Just give me a moment
and I'll explain why.

430
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,240
You were always gonna
be the first one to go.

431
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
Oh, Jesus!

432
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,160
Jesus.

433
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Mr. Camonetti,

434
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,600
you got 60 fucking seconds
before I kill another.

435
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57...

436
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,160
CAMONETTl: Get him.
Just get Garber, huh?

437
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,840
Fifty-six, 55, 54...
We're trying to locate Mr. Garber

438
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,920
ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that?

439
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,480
Mr. Camonetti or whatever
fucking greaseball name you got,

440
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,000
the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

441
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Fifty-three, 52, 51...

442
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,000
Garber. Garber!

443
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,480
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.

444
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,120
Come on, he wants to
talk to you right now.

445
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,840
He's here. He's on the way.

446
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,240
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven...

447
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,680
CAMONETTl:
He's approaching the desk.

448
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,920
Six, five, four, three, two, one...

449
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.

450
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,080
Garber!
You didn't say goodbye.

451
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
You killed Jerry?

452
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
No, the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

453
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,080
The biggest rat hole
in the world fucking killed Jerry.

454
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay? Now you can chalk
another victim up to NYC.

455
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
Now, can everybody hear me?

456
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,160
Yeah, we hear you,
loud and clear.

457
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,080
Well, good, because now you
don't have to tell the cops

458
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,400
that they don't tell me how
to do it or how it's gonna be.

459
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,080
I fucking tell them.

460
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't you ever, ever
leave me again.

461
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,680
Or I'll just have to hunt
you down and I'll kill you.

462
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,360
Now, you got 39-

463
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,320
Thirty-nine minutes.
Check me.

464
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,240
Thirty-nine, check.

465
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,040
This is Staley to ESU 2.
What's your position?

466
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,640
OFFICER 1: ESU 2 approaching
hostage car from south tunnel.

467
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,280
OFFICER 2:
Go, go, go.

468
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,200
Ten-million dollars. I'll just write
him a check and get it over with.

469
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,640
He wants it in cash.
I was joking, LaSalle.

470
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,760
But we've been given one hour
to get the money together.

471
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
Ten-million dollars. Where
do they get these numbers?

472
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,480
Oh, actually, 10 is the limit, sir.

473
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,600
Why is that?

474
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,560
You just sign a request
to the City Controller,

475
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,920
he forwards it
to one of our lenders,

476
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,960
cash gets released to the Federal Reserve.
Limit at any one time is 10 million.

477
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,680
Well, some idiot with a gun wouldn't
know that. I didn't know that.

478
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,560
Well, you're very busy, sir.
How do you know that?

479
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Here he is.

480
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
Henry, what's the situation?

481
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,120
They just killed a hostage.
Bitch of a way to find out,

482
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
but these guys
may be the real deal.

483
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Guys? I thought there was one
idiot with a gun. Who are they?

484
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,320
Multiple gunmen. We don't
know. They're not sure.

485
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
They've got 18 hostages,
they say.

486
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,600
They'll kill more in an hour. That's
the time limit. They want you to know.

487
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Well, what do we know about them?
They're not amateurs.

488
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,360
They cut out a car, stopped
on a rise in the tunnel.

489
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,320
They can see us coming
100 yards either way.

490
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,880
All right. How long to
get the money together?

491
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,160
I don't know.
Find out.

492
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
You're not thinking of
paying these pricks, are you?

493
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm thinking of buying time
and being ready.

494
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,720
Call the Controller.
Tell them we'll pay.

495
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,280
What's with you and Garber,
huh? Tell me about him.

496
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,680
Was he scheduled
to work today?

497
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,960
Yeah, absolutely. But, uh...
But what?

498
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,840
Well, he's only had this particular
job for a couple weeks now.

499
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,520
Well, why is that?
Well, he's under investigation.

500
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,920
What?

501
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,520
We were gonna suspend him,
with pay-

502
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,960
CAMONETTl:
What's he being investigated for?

503
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,160
He went to Japan. He had to
take a look at some new trains,

504
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,880
and the allegation
is that he took a bribe.

505
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,640
Took a bribe? Does he
have a previous record?

506
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,160
No. Not that I know.
You sure of that?

507
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,640
Yeah, yeah. I don't think
so. I gotta take this.

508
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,920
The identity of the hijackers
is stilI unclear.

509
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,000
The Hostage Negotiation Team has
just arriνed at MTA headquarters

510
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,960
to determine
if this is a terrorist enterprise.

511
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,560
Is that what we are?
An enterprise?

512
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,240
We're an enterprise.

513
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,320
Well, pilot reports that the
aircraft has begun its descent.

514
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,040
This is Staley to ESU 4.
What's your ETA?

515
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,880
OFFICER: Approximately two
minutes south of target.

516
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,520
Why is the train called
Pelham 123?

517
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,520
Comes out of Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.

518
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,400
How did you end up with this call?

519
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,440
Uh, it's a Lexington Avenue train.

520
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,000
I got the Lexington Avenue desk.
Came through my desk.

521
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,240
Can you think of any reason
why you'd be targeted?

522
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,320
Someone wanna hurt you? Something
against you or something?

523
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
No.

524
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,480
You recognize his voice?

525
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,800
Uh, no. No, as I said, it was a
coincidence it came through my desk.

526
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,360
Did you pick this desk?
Or was it assigned to you?

527
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
Did I...?

528
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,240
I said, did you pick this desk
or was it assigned to you?

529
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,680
Can I take my coat off?

530
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Doesn't make any sense.

531
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,080
What doesn't?
The guy you're talking to.

532
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,440
He ain't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.

533
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,520
He's a big shot.
Big shot at what?

534
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,760
Rail Control. I mean,
he runs things up there.

535
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,440
At least he did before I went up.
His name is Walter?

536
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,920
Yeah.

537
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,040
Dude like that shouldn't
be answering the phone.

538
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,000
Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
Right.

539
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,960
Are you sure you don't have some
sort of relationship with him?

540
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,360
I assure you, whatever relationship
I have with him is better than yours.

541
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,320
Jerry, my friend, was killed
while you were talking to Ryder.

542
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,800
So maybe that's a question you should
ask yourself instead of asking me.

543
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,560
I mean, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

544
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,760
I didn't say that.
Well, I'm sure.

545
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,760
But what I have in you, Mr.
Garber, is an unknown variable.

546
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
An unknown variable?
That's right.

547
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
And people's lives
are at stake.

548
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,840
I understand that.
So please excuse me

549
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,240
if I try to get more
comfortable with you, okay?

550
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,040
It ain't working, but okay.

551
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,080
All right.
Now, with that in mind,

552
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,640
would you agree to a
consensual search of your house?

553
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,720
Take me 40, 45 minutes
to get a warrant.

554
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,080
What...

555
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,360
Yes, okay.

556
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,240
Got him.

557
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,280
Walter Garber, right there.
Whoa.

558
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,840
No shit, look at this.

559
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,240
Guy took a bribe, man.
Yeah.

560
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
Woo-hoo, baby!

561
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
ESU 2, this is Staley.
What's your overall status?

562
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,560
OFFICER:
All positions secured.

563
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,160
All right,
hold your fire until instructed.

564
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,600
Pelham 123,
can you hear me?

565
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,760
Yeah, loud and clear,
back at you.

566
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
All right, uh,
the mayor has agreed to pay,

567
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
and, uh, they're getting
the money together right now.

568
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,920
Good.

569
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,600
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I advise him to make haste.

570
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm sure he will.

571
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,640
So is your first name
Walter?

572
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,760
Excuse me?
Your name, is it Walter?

573
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes, it is.
Good.

574
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,280
What are you doing
dispatching trains?

575
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,160
I thought you were some
sort of MTA big shot.

576
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,080
I work for the MTA.
Today they put me at dispatch,

577
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
and my bad luck.

578
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh. I thought you didn't
believe in bad luck.

579
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,840
I said I didn't believe in fate.

580
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Do you believe in rigged
contracts for new trains?

581
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,920
Look, I
- What are we talking about this for?

582
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Look, I need to know
who I'm dealing with.

583
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
You need to know who-?

584
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing
with. I mean, are you a bad penny?

585
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,560
Let me explain something to you.

586
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,360
Being accused of something
is one thing.

587
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,040
Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.

588
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,480
Well, agreed. But you gotta
take me through this, my man.

589
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,240
You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.

590
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
All right,
I started out in maintenance.

591
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,560
Platform maintenance,
track maintenance, flagman,

592
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
conductor.
Conductor, really?

593
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah. And then motorman.

594
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,680
A motorman. How long
did you do that for?

595
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,680
I drove them
over six years.

596
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,720
I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.

597
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
I finally ended up-

598
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,520
Yeah, you're assistant chief
transportation officer or something.

599
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,360
Right?

600
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,960
That's right.

601
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,360
And part of my job is to go out
to the manufacturers, you know,

602
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,920
the people who build the trains
and bid on contracts for the trains.

603
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
Is that where you took the bribe?

604
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,360
The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?

605
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,560
I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.

606
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,080
I have not been proven guilty yet.

607
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,520
Well, they haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.

608
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,160
Well, they got no proof.
I don't care what they decide.

609
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,920
It- What- They don't
need- It doesn't matter-

610
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,680
And then is this when
they demoted you?

611
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,720
That's correct. They demoted
me, pending the outcome.

612
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,520
And now they're trying to
humiliate you, is that right?

613
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,280
Motherfuckers.

614
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,480
Look, I know how these
things work, man, okay?

615
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
Everything doesn't seem
to appear like what it is.

616
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
But you've gotta be
completely honest with me, man.

617
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,600
I don't know what
you're talking about.

618
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,960
How did you do it?

619
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,200
I didn't. I'm innocent.

620
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Oh, you're innocent.

621
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,320
No, you're talking
to a Catholic, man.

622
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,960
We've been over innocent before. Okay?

623
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,000
Look, man, I've been
through all this, man.

624
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
So just tell me,
how did you do it?

625
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,840
I didn't do it.

626
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Okay, that's it!
That's fucking it!

627
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
Damn it.

628
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,600
Kid. You.
Me?

629
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,400
No, no, you. Up.
Get the fuck over there.

630
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
I don't know what you did
to piss him off but you did.

631
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,560
Garber.
You know what I'm looking at?

632
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,360
Do you know what I'm looking at?
No, I do not.

633
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,600
First there's my gun, and at the end of my gun
- What's your name, man?

634
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,760
George. Everyone calls me Geo.
George. His friends call him Geo.

635
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,600
Got this '80s skateboard thing
going.

636
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,040
He makes it work, but it's not
gonna look too good in his casket.

637
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,320
Listen, Ryder, just slow down.
We haven't reached the deadline.

638
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,400
No, there's no fucking deadline,
man.

639
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,080
You just gotta tell me
the truth.

640
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,960
About what?
The bribe!

641
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,280
Did you take it?
I didn't take a bribe.

642
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,880
Okay, you got five seconds
to save this kid's life.

643
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,800
I didn't do anything.

644
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,600
Five...
Just wait a second.

645
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,960
Four, three...
Wait a second!

646
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,600
Two...

647
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Fucking tell him
how you did it.

648
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,400
All- All right, okay.

649
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,320
Say it.
I took the bribe.

650
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,600
How much?

651
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,520
Thirty- Uh...

652
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,120
How fucking much?

653
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,160
Thirty-five thousand dollars.

654
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,680
How did you do it?

655
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,040
I went to Japan
to look at these trains.

656
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,880
It's part of my job.

657
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,400
I...

658
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,360
I don't get to vote, okay?
I just recommend.

659
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,560
I- I chose what I thought
was the best train,

660
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,600
and the Japanese had the best train,
and I made my recommendation.

661
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,360
That's before you took
the bribe.

662
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
Yes.

663
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
That was the train you
were gonna pick anyway, huh?

664
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,560
Yes.

665
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,840
And now you're fighting for your job and
they're trying to humiliate you aren't they?

666
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,120
No, no, no.
I did what I did.

667
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,040
And, um...

668
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,920
And it's not, you know,
it's not the MTA's fault.

669
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
What did you spend it on?

670
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,720
Look, what does this got
to do with anything, huh?

671
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,360
What did you
fucking spend it on?

672
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I used the money for my kids,
all right?

673
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,280
To pay my children's tuition.

674
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,080
I have a 17-year-old.
I have a 19-year-old daughter.

675
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,080
And I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, all right?

676
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,720
You know what, Garber?

677
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,000
You're my goddamn hero,
you know that?

678
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,560
You got a kid here, you don't
even know him, you saved his life.

679
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,400
That's brave, man.
That's fucking heroic.

680
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,080
Tell Garber thank you.
Thank you, Garber.

681
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,120
"Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life. "

682
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,200
Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.

683
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,680
You're welcome.

684
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,320
Sit down.

685
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,840
You're just like me,
Garber. I fueled this city.

686
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
I fed it breakfast every morning,
and now we're the bad guys.

687
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,160
I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so!

688
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Hello, Therese.

689
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,000
Honey, look.

690
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,840
There are police here, Walt.
They wanna search the house.

691
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,680
They said you said
it was okay.

692
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,640
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
It's- Just let them in.

693
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
We got nothing to hide.

694
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,560
Is this about the investigation?

695
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,280
No, no. You watching TV?

696
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,760
This hostage thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.

697
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,240
Well, it's just that, um...

698
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,200
Well, I'll tell you about it
when I get home,

699
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,720
but I'm in the middle of it here right now
and they just wanna do background checks

700
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,800
on everybody that's involved here
from the MTA.

701
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,400
That's why they're at the house.
All right, okay. But you're okay?

702
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them
in. I'll see you when I get home.

703
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
All right. Okay, bye.

704
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm sorry, Walter.

705
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,680
I am.

706
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,880
Listen, don't let this guy bring
you into his reality, all right?

707
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,720
That's what he wants to do. He
hurts you, you gonna get angry.

708
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
He's got the advantage.

709
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Understand?
Yeah.

710
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,120
Just deflect, if you can.

711
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay? All right.
All right.

712
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,240
I hope they don't get
fucking lost.

713
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,040
Fuck me!
Ten-million bucks.

714
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,680
The joke is, say we
dipped in, took some?

715
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,640
Bad guys would count it,
come up short, probably kill us.

716
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,320
No shit.

717
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,000
Geo,
what the fuck's happening?

718
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,680
Geo. Geo, what's going on?

719
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
Geo.

720
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm a fucking hostage.

721
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,280
Listen to me. Stream it
on our site. Call the news.

722
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,240
Shit.

723
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,360
WHISPERING]
Hey.

724
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,480
We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill us.

725
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,120
You got a plan?

726
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,080
I thought you'd have one.

727
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,880
Because I'm some
tough-looking black guy?

728
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,400
I saw that ring
on your finger.

729
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,400
That was a long time ago.

730
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,120
Okay?
My husband had one just like it.

731
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,000
A severe selI-off underway,

732
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,280
the Dow is down 450 points
in very heavy trading

733
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,720
as yall Street reacts
to the terrorist attack

734
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,680
of the New York City
subway system.

735
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,520
How's my hair look?

736
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,520
It looks fine. You ready
to make a statement?

737
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,600
I'll make a statement when
I have something to tell them.

738
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,360
It's a leadership moment, sir.

739
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm not running
for re-election,

740
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,240
I'm not running for
fucking president.

741
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,520
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit
at home.

742
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,880
You're being selfish. It'll
take 30 seconds to reassure them.

743
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,280
Over there!
Mr. Mayor!

744
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,920
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

745
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,360
Will you be making a statement?

746
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,400
We're doing everything
the situation demands.

747
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,360
I'm not gonna speculate
right now. All right?

748
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,600
Mayor, is it terrorism?
No.

749
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,560
Hey.

750
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,520
Mayor! Are they terrorists?

751
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,920
All right, all right, all right!

752
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,120
Listen, nobody said
anything about terrorism,

753
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,480
or a bomb, anything like that.
Let's stop that right now, all right?

754
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,240
How about your divorce? Care to
speculate about how that's going?

755
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,520
Your divorce, sir.

756
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,480
Been a lot of talk
in the news lately

757
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,480
that you have extramarital
problems. Your divorce, sir!

758
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,640
Put it on
channel 15.

759
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,960
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching
it on her boyfriend's computer.

760
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,040
It's on the damn Internet.
What?

761
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,000
Hold on.

762
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,760
Son of a bitch.
That's Ramos, isn't it?

763
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,960
That's motherfucking
Phil Ramos.

764
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,520
Yes, it is.
Who's Phil Ramos?

765
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,240
He was a motorman. He killed a couple
of passengers, what, 10 years ago?

766
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,040
Right. He was high on cough syrup, ran into
the platform, went to jail for manslaughter.

767
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,760
Phil Ramos, five minutes,
I want everything.

768
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,200
Prison time, known associates, the
works. Looks like it's from the floor.

769
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,760
Should the Internet
be working down there?

770
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
No. No way.

771
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,440
Maybe that's how he knows
about you. Maybe he Googled you.

772
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
Or maybe Ramos told him,
who knows?

773
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,200
CAMONETTl: Goddamn, it's
the mayor. Hello, Your Honor.

774
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,440
Do me a favor, forget about those guys.

775
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,680
Easy for you to say.

776
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,440
Would you rather be
one of those hostages?

777
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,680
No.

778
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,760
Listen up, I'll give you a crash
course on hostage negotiating.

779
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,560
We're like rodeo clowns.

780
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,320
We keep the bull from focusing
on what he'd like to do.

781
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,840
Which is what?
Kill a cowboy.

782
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,080
Exactly. Now, he's got his
deadline. You slow things down.

783
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,360
Preservation of life.
That's our mission.

784
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,960
Guy's already proven
he's serious.

785
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,120
Next deadline's gonna give
him a chance to prove it again.

786
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,600
How do we deal with that?

787
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,920
Hopefully, get the money there on time.

788
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,360
And if we don't, we pretend
the deadline doesn't exist,

789
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,640
we talk through it, we buy
time, we get a little movement.

790
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,080
Movement?
That's right.

791
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,880
Contradicts himself, inconsistency
in his demand, you got some movement.

792
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,520
Right.
All right, let's go out there.

793
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,520
This was the scene
moments ago

794
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,840
outside the Rail Control Center
in Midtown.

795
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,160
I'm not gonna speculate right now.

796
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,480
That is a beautiful suit
he's got there.

797
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,240
Can't get it out of my head.
I'm gonna die today.

798
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,200
Visualization's
a very powerful thing.

799
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,000
You keep thinking it,
you never know.

800
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,080
Please let it be me
who drops this motherfucker.

801
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,480
Hey, Garber.
You there, buddy?

802
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,920
Yeah, I'm here.

803
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,160
A little birdie told me
the mayor just walked in.

804
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,600
Can I talk to him?

805
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
Can he hear me?
How does he know I'm here?

806
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,280
Does he have a camera in here?
Can he hear me?

807
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,360
Uh, we can, we can, we can-
We can all hear you here. Yes.

808
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,000
Okay, good. So tell him
- Tell him I wanna make him a deal.

809
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,920
Tell him I'II make him a deal
right now.

810
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,640
Okay, all right.

811
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,320
Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.

812
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,200
You're talking to
your constituents.

813
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,720
We got a train full of
registered voters. Don't you care?

814
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,400
Don't you care about your voters?

815
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,880
This is not a good idea. Your Honor,
don't talk. Don't engage with him.

816
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,600
I know what I'm doing, I've been
doing this for a long time now.

817
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,920
Come on, buddy, speak up.

818
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,680
You gotta hit the blue
button there, Your Honor.

819
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,560
Yes, this is the mayor.

820
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,120
Heh, heh, hey.
Good to meet you, man.

821
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,560
Hey, listen, tell me this, is this true?

822
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,040
I read that you make,
like,

823
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,680
one dollar a year to be a mayor
of New York, is that true?

824
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,040
Yes, but at least
it's honest work.

825
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,640
After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?

826
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,760
Uh, yes.

827
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,280
Don't bullshit me, man.

828
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,360
It would take, like, 3000 years to
pay off that suit that you're wearing.

829
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,360
What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?

830
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,280
You don't get that without
screwing someone, screwing everyone.

831
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,520
I'm sure your wife knows
something about that, huh?

832
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,600
You said you had a deal
for me.

833
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,600
Yeah, I do have a deal.
I wanna make you a deal.

834
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
I wanna tell you
you could come down here,

835
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,760
and I will trade you for all these
passengers in the train, how's that?

836
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,320
Okay, you could save the lives
of 17 New Yorkers.

837
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,360
Now, that's a good deal.

838
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,040
yhat do you think?

839
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,800
Give us a moment.

840
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,640
Okay.

841
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,960
I'll give you a moment.

842
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,720
You turn this into a circus, you're
gonna get someone else killed, all right?

843
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,320
Now, you entered his world, exit it.

844
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,920
Okay, time's up.
What's the deal?

845
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,840
It's a very nice offer, but I'm
afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

846
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,920
Oh, good. Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.

847
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,760
You think anyone cares about a
philandering asshole like you?

848
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,800
The city of New York would love me to
pull the fucking trigger on you, brother.

849
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,400
Hey, Garber. This is the dude. This is the
guy that's trying to get rid of you, my man.

850
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,400
Keep talking.
Do you believe this shit?

851
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,200
You gotta calm-
You don't think he

852
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,760
broke the same rules
that we broke?

853
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,640
He knows it, I know it.
Calm him down.

854
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,320
All right, hey-
He can eat shit.

855
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,880
CAMONETTl: Calm him down.
You're- Speak-

856
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,800
You're breaking up.
Tell him he can fucking kiss my ass!

857
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,920
I like the deal.
I think it's a good deal, but-

858
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,360
Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!

859
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,000
Now, I want my fucking money now!
You understand me? Now!

860
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,600
Just tell him the
money's on the way.

861
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,000
The money's on the way.

862
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,600
Yeah, yeah. Because he's, like,
a used-car salesman, this asshole.

863
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,000
He can lick my bunghole,
motherfucker!

864
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,240
One mistake and everyone
has something to say.

865
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,120
Was she worth it?

866
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,720
Yes.

867
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,240
You have nine minutes. How are
you gonna get the money here?

868
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,120
They're shutting down every
intersection from here to Brooklyn.

869
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,800
Phil Ramos, male,
Hispanic, 39.

870
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,040
Sentenced two to four years
for manslaughter,

871
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,080
paroled last month
from Clinton Correctional.

872
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,280
Now, his PO, Justafarro, says he's
living in a halfway house in Queens.

873
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,720
He's not an absconder, he made his all
his appearances, his piss has been clean.

874
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,760
But he was a no-show at work
today. He didn't call in, nothing.

875
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,680
He knows the system.

876
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,000
The perfect place in the
subway to stop the train.

877
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,800
He's only been out a month. This
wasn't planned in the last three weeks.

878
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,880
Find out who Ramos's cellmates were,
who worked in the laundry with him.

879
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,240
Call lists, visitors lists, ASAP.

880
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,960
WOMAN
105 North Avenue.

881
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,200
Oh, shit! Look out!
Shit!

882
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,400
The market has tumbled
nearly 7 percent

883
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,560
as investors continue
to react to events...

884
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,040
They just came off
the bridge.

885
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,080
Why didn't we send
a helicopter for the money?

886
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,680
Walter, now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines, right?

887
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,360
We better have a plan B in case
the money isn't there on the dot.

888
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,240
Put him back on his heels.
He knows things.

889
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,200
We know things too, right?
Right.

890
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,240
Ask him about Phil Ramos.
All right? Just get him talking.

891
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
You can do it.

892
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,280
Hey, Ryder.
The money here yet?

893
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,400
GARBER
On the way.

894
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,640
Then what the fuck
are you calling me for?

895
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,640
Actually, I just called to talk.

896
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,800
Oh, yeah?
yhat do you wanna talk about?

897
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,680
You said that being
in the motorman's cab,

898
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,160
that was a little like being
in a confessional, right?

899
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,280
Yeah?

900
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,160
I was thinking maybe it's like
being in a prison cell too.

901
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,680
What are you trying to say? That if I
get caught, I'd better get used to it?

902
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,440
No, I'm just wondering.
Maybe you're already used to it.

903
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm wondering maybe that's how
you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?

904
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,720
How the fuck
he know that?

905
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,840
Well, why don't you tell me,
Garber? Then we'll both know.

906
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,480
I mean,
after today's confession,

907
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,320
you're gonna find your ass
in prison too.

908
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,040
Which is my point. I want you
to hook me up on the inside.

909
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,200
I know you know everybody. This way,
when I come up with my own heist plan,

910
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,240
you know, I'll cut you in.

911
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,960
I can see I've inspired you.
Okay, I got a story for you.

912
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,960
It might help you in prison. You
wanna hear it? We got a minute.

913
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,520
Yeah, I'd like to hear a little story.

914
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,160
All righty. So back in the day,
when I was a high roller...

915
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,760
When were you ever a high roller?

916
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,280
Well, you know, I told you I fed
this city breakfast every morning.

917
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
Grits and eggs?

918
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,640
Oh, something like that.
Anyway, back in the day,

919
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,120
I took this chick to Iceland.

920
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,760
Iceland? Is that where all
the high rollers go? Iceland?

921
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,880
Six hours from Kennedy and
the nightclub scene is, uh,

922
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,240
you know, is intense.

923
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,160
I thought I'd take this chick
to Iceland.

924
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,680
What's her name?
Ludvika.

925
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,680
She was Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.

926
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,480
She asked you what?

927
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,320
You heard of hand models,
right?

928
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,760
Advertisement?
Right, she was an ass model.

929
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,160
She did jeans and, you know,
magazines and shit.

930
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,400
Anyway, it was Fashion Week in New York,

931
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,440
and I took her to Iceland.

932
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,640
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model,
Iceland, you took her to the ice.

933
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,200
So what?
Well, for 500 bucks,

934
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,720
they'll take you on a dogsled ride
on a glacier.

935
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,000
Dogsled?
Yeah.

936
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,320
And you know the old saying:

937
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,800
If you're not the lead dog,

938
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,560
the view never changes?
Right.

939
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,120
Otherwise, you're always looking at
the asshole of the dog in front of you.

940
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,720
That'Il be funny in a minute
when I get to that part.

941
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
It's funny now.

942
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,920
And it's 8 in the morning,
we haven't been to bed yet,

943
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,960
and we're tooling across
this glacier,

944
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,280
and I got this hangover that's
creeping up the back of my neck,

945
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,400
and guess
what I'm looking at?

946
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,800
Obviously you're staring at the
ass of the dog in front of you.

947
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,960
You got it.

948
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,880
So this dog, out of nowhere,
just lifts its hind legs up,

949
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,080
and puts them in
the harness there

950
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,360
and just takes a shit while
he's running on his front paws.

951
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,720
So he's dumping and running
all at the same time.

952
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,080
Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking
if you ask me.

953
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,920
Get out of here.
Did it hit you?

954
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,640
Shit always hits you, man.

955
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,600
I didn't know it at the time,
but it was profound.

956
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,720
Profound? You lost me.
Yeah.

957
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,680
Well, you know, when I went to
prison later on, which you called,

958
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,360
uh, I had trouble
going to the toilet.

959
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,880
You know, a privacy thing.

960
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,400
And I couldn't take a shit.
I was scared shitless, literally.

961
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,560
So you know
what I thought of?

962
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,040
You thought of the dog.
That's right.

963
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,920
I thought if that dog could do
what it needed to do, so could I.

964
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,800
Saved my fucking life.

965
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,640
Wow, that is profound.

966
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,120
WHISPERING]
Keep going.

967
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,800
And, you know, it's-
It's- It's-

968
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,760
People adapt. It's like
you and I, like today.

969
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,320
We didn't know how
the day was gonna start.

970
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,920
Wrong.
Wrong what?

971
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,840
I knew exactly
how it was gonna start.

972
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,480
Yeah, but do you know
how it's gonna end?

973
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,760
I'm tired of talking to you, Garber.
Now, wait a minute.

974
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,840
Call me when the money comes in.
You got four minutes.

975
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,760
I don't know what he looks
like, but he sounds good.

976
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,920
Fucking talk shit,
what are you fucking doing?

977
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,560
He's got a sexy voice though,
man. He'd be my bitch in prison.

978
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,080
Where are we?

979
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,840
Less than 10 blocks away.
We'll make it.

980
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,760
Fuck, look out!

981
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,240
Jesus.

982
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,640
Shit. The goddamn money
car crashed on 1 st Avenue.

983
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,520
Get a radio car, put it on
the motorcycles, get it there.

984
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,440
Watch it. Easy.

985
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,320
Here, lean up here.

986
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,000
Hey, get that last bag.

987
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,520
You got 22 seconds, Garber.
All right, we just had

988
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,280
a little problem over here, that's all.
I don't care.

989
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,840
Two minutes.
Just tell him it's here.

990
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,360
How the hell's he gonna know?
I don't think we should lie.

991
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,560
CAMONETTl: Tell him the truth.
No, tell him it's there. Do it.

992
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
Tell him the truth?

993
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,800
He's gonna make me do it.

994
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,360
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
Tell him the truth or lie?

995
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,480
Tell him the truth.
No. Tell him it's there.

996
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,600
Four, three...
Tell him it's here.

997
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,200
It's here.
Two, one.

998
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,840
The money's there,
it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.

999
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,920
Liar!
Motherfucking liar!

1000
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,240
Seven.

1001
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Ryder. All right, listen.

1002
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,280
Lucky lady, up. Come on, up.
We made a mistake.

1003
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,680
Shit. I think that's him. That's Ryder.
RYDER Lucky lady, up.

1004
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,440
Ryder, listen to me.
Listen, listen. It was an accident.

1005
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,680
Keep talking.
Ryder, we made a mistake. I'm-

1006
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,040
It's my fault. The car crashed.
Tell him something!

1007
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,240
That's why the money's not there.

1008
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,640
Up!

1009
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,400
Up!
Wait.

1010
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,360
Fuck, no.
Get up!

1011
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,920
No. Get back in line!

1012
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,840
Ryder, like one minute it's gonna take.

1013
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,880
Ryder, don't do this, for
God's sake. It was an accident.

1014
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,160
Come on.
Wait.

1015
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,520
It's the only plan I got.

1016
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,200
Ryder, listen,
it was an accident.

1017
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,240
It was an accident, Ryder.
We made a mistake.

1018
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,800
It was an accident, Ryder!
It was an accident!

1019
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,320
Come on, motherfucker!

1020
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,480
Oh, shit.
Aah!

1021
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,280
God!

1022
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,520
Oh, my God.

1023
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,440
ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1,
do you have a shot?

1024
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,520
That's your fault.

1025
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,280
SNIPER: I got an easy
shot. Please advise.

1026
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,960
OFFICER: Stand by.
Roger that.

1027
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,040
SNIPER:
Aah!

1028
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,520
Shit!

1029
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,160
What the fuck happened?

1030
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Accidental discharge.
I just got bit by a fucking rat.

1031
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,080
It's accidental discharge.

1032
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,520
Who? Who got shot?
Was it Ryder?

1033
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,880
No, it was Ramos.

1034
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,440
Sergeant? The money there yet?
What? Yes, yes.

1035
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,280
GARBER
Ryder, are you there? Ryder?

1036
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,400
Get in here.
Shoot any motherfucker that moves.

1037
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,760
That's an order!
Shit on your orders.

1038
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,040
Can you hear me, Ryder?

1039
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,720
Okay, now somebody else has to die.

1040
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,160
Two people,
maybe all of us.

1041
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Did you hear me?

1042
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,640
I heard you, but you gotta
understand, the circumstances,

1043
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,360
they're different now for you.

1044
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,560
You gotta rethink this.
No.

1045
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,840
You got to adapt.

1046
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,840
No, I gave you instructions,
and you know the consequences!

1047
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,480
I mean, don't you have a plan B?

1048
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,560
No, plan B is enforcing plan A!

1049
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,760
And the minute you stop believing
me, motherfucker, that's it!

1050
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,600
I believe you, but you gotta believe
and understand that those cops

1051
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,000
are gonna be down that tunnel
and next to you any second-

1052
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,760
Bring it, man! Let them unload
their guns, I don't care!

1053
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,080
And what's the point of that?
Huh? What's the point?

1054
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,520
I told you we all
owe God a death.

1055
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,520
And now it's two minutes past
the deadline, two minutes.

1056
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,800
Which means two people,
almost three, have to go.

1057
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,240
They have to die.

1058
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,920
The money's there, Ryder.
Nobody else has to die.

1059
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,080
The money's there.

1060
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,280
I don't know what you owe God, but I
can tell you, you can't pay him in cash.

1061
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,520
You never see a U-Haul
behind a hearse, Ryder.

1062
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,080
The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't
work. You can't take the money with you.

1063
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,040
Ryder?

1064
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,280
You can't take the money with you.

1065
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,760
All this talk of God,
I think I need to pray.

1066
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,560
Give me a minute.

1067
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,680
I can do that.

1068
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,880
You did good, Walter.

1069
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,800
What's the reality of getting
in there and ending this?

1070
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,240
We'd have to be willing to accept
heavy casualties on all sides.

1071
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,240
It's a hard choice,
but I say make it.

1072
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,360
New York City does not have
an acceptable casualty rate.

1073
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,360
Now, this is your area of
expertise, what do you suggest?

1074
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,600
I say we should buy time. So far this son
of a bitch hasn't allowed us to do that.

1075
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
But this might be the first
time we got through to him.

1076
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,440
Trust your man here? He confessed
to a felony 20 minutes ago.

1077
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,560
In my opinion, there are people down
there who are alive because of him.

1078
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Until we change the rules
or hope runs out,

1079
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,520
we should stick with the
situation we have now.

1080
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,240
Do what you need to do.

1081
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,720
Hey, Garber, you there?

1082
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,280
Yeah, I'm here.
Speak up.

1083
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,040
I'm here.

1084
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,240
I talked to God.
That's good. yhat did he say?

1085
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,000
He said I should trust in him.
All others, pay cash.

1086
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,360
How soon can you get it down here?

1087
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,880
Uh, from that station, it would take
them about five minutes to walk it down.

1088
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,240
No can do.
About 10 minutes to walk it down.

1089
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,600
No, no, no,
I mean you, man.

1090
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,840
How long would it take you
to come down here?

1091
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,400
I don't understand.
What do you mean me?

1092
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,080
I mean you.
I wanna meet you, Garber.

1093
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,200
And if you bring it, I know
the cops aren't bringing it.

1094
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,800
Well, you know, I don't know
how I'm gonna carry that money.

1095
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,280
I mean, it must weigh...
Two-hundred and twenty pounds.

1096
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,120
Stick it in a wheelbarrow
or something.

1097
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,480
Why are we discussing weight?
Shouldn't you be thinking:

1098
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,720
"Get the fuck out of there"?
Okay, get the fuck out of there.

1099
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,640
Good, that's progress.
Now, look, plan B. Your idea.

1100
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,960
And part of plan B is you,
Garber, deliver that money,

1101
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,840
or I kill another hostage,
you got that?

1102
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,520
You got seven minutes,
buddy boy.

1103
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,040
You got six minutes and
55 seconds, check me.

1104
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,920
Do it!

1105
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,680
I check.

1106
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,600
And tell that sleazebag negotiator
to call me when you've got the money.

1107
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,880
You don't have to do this.

1108
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,920
Finally somebody got their
head out of their ass, huh?

1109
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,840
Hello?

1110
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,240
Hey, how you doing, baby?
What are you doing?

1111
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,360
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1112
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,560
I'm watching the thing,
the hostages.

1113
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,920
They mentioned you, I think. They said a
dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.

1114
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,880
Yeah, yeah,
they're not terrorists.

1115
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
They are if they're down
there waving guns at people.

1116
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,760
Right, right. Listen,
Therese, are you listening?

1117
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,320
I'm listening.
Look, I'm the one that-

1118
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,040
You're right. I was the one
that's been talking to them.

1119
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,800
I knew it.
I am so proud of you.

1120
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,320
After everything, all this,
them trying to fire you.

1121
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,520
Them sticking you
in a dispatch job and you-

1122
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,680
Where are you?

1123
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,920
I'm at a heliport.

1124
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,960
I'm getting ready
to get on a helicopter

1125
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,160
because they want me to take
the money down to the tunnel.

1126
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,440
What? Are they crazy?

1127
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,160
It's real simple. There's nothing to it.
CAMONETTl: Over there.

1128
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,840
What it is, is he knows I'm not a
cop, so he wants me to come down-

1129
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,120
Is it all right if I wait here?
Can I wait here?

1130
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,480
They need me to take the money down
there because they know I'm not a cop,

1131
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,320
and, uh, you know, they're saying
that he might kill somebody, honey.

1132
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,320
Well, then somebody has to die,
because you can't.

1133
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,920
He's talking to his wife.

1134
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,160
I understand, baby.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1135
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,240
Just tell Angela at the meet-
CAMONETTl: Let's go!

1136
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,880
When she runs over the hurdles
tomorrow.

1137
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,000
Tell her to run straight through
the hurdles tomorrow.

1138
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,960
Just like, you know,
I always tell her, okay?

1139
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,440
Come on,
we gotta go.

1140
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
You tell her yourself.

1141
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Now, you listen to me.
Yeah, I'm listening.

1142
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,200
Now, you do what you have to do,
but we need milk.

1143
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,600
So on your way home,
I want you to bring a gallon.

1144
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,960
Of milk? Okay.

1145
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,520
You promise.

1146
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,080
Why do we-? Why a gallon?
Why not a half a gallon?

1147
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,800
Just bring a gallon. A gallon.

1148
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,160
Okay. Okay.

1149
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,520
I can get a half a gallon,
I'll get a half a gallon.

1150
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,320
I gotta go.

1151
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,440
All right, thanks, guys.

1152
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,800
Put your- Put your headset on.

1153
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,760
You ever do anything like this
before? You know, go in unarmed?

1154
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,920
Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.

1155
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,600
Flatbush Avenue.
I got the hostages out.

1156
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,560
Oh.

1157
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,440
And the guy with the gun?

1158
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,680
The guy with the gun,
didn't end well for him.

1159
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,560
For the guy with the gun?
Yeah.

1160
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,720
It's nice seeing it from
this perspective, huh?

1161
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,640
You can see what you're fighting for.

1162
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,560
I love you so much.

1163
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,720
Did you hear me?

1164
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,120
Yeah.

1165
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,240
yell, do you love me back?

1166
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,920
Can't really talk right now.

1167
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,440
All you have to say is "Yes. "

1168
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,000
That's a lot less words than saying,
"I can't talk. "

1169
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,120
I'm having a really weird
fucking day.

1170
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920
Oh, God.

1171
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,320
If we'd anticipated this, we
could have made a lot of money.

1172
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,760
What kind of guy
would you expect

1173
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,000
to take a model to Iceland
for the weekend?

1174
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,960
An ass model.
An ass model.

1175
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,320
A Wall Street guy.
A Wall Street guy.

1176
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,280
He's here!

1177
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,040
The one-hour time limit
reported earlier has expired.

1178
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,520
We're not sure who this is entering. It could
be hostage negotiators or police detectives.

1179
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,920
Once we have any updates,
we'll be back to you live.

1180
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,400
Camonetti.
How are you? Hey.

1181
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,160
Mr. Garber.
Lieutenant Staley.

1182
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,160
Pleasure.
You got a radio set up to the train?

1183
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,520
Set up right back there, okay?

1184
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,640
You can talk directly to
the train or to Rail Control.

1185
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,080
Okay. Just do what he says,
and remember everything you see.

1186
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,680
Let's go.

1187
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,760
So who the hell did you fuck
to get this job?

1188
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,360
Myself. It was easier than it looked.

1189
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,160
Yeah, fucking yourself
always is.

1190
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,720
CAMONETTl Pelham 123, come
in. Pelham 123, come in.

1191
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,920
Who am I talking to?

1192
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,120
This is Lieutenant Camonetti.
We spoke earlier.

1193
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,240
Yeah, you're the greaseball.
What'd you do, go out for a pizza?

1194
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,160
yhat's my money doing, man?
Where is it?

1195
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,960
CAMONETTl: Mr. Garber is in the
tunnel. The money is two minutes away.

1196
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,120
Oh, Garber, man.
That is a dependable man.

1197
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,760
He's a good man too.

1198
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,640
CAMONETTl: Absolutely.
How about you, Ryder?

1199
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,120
Everybody's got some good in them,
don't you think?

1200
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,280
Oh, is this the part where
you try to get through to me?

1201
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,520
I don't think so, motherfucker.
Now I got three instructions for you.

1202
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,720
Number one, when
this conversation is over,

1203
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,640
I want you to restore the power
to the whole sector.

1204
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,120
Number two,
I want you to clear the local tracks

1205
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,520
from 68th Street
down to Coney Island.

1206
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,960
And when I say, "Clear,"
I don't wanna see no cops.

1207
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,440
I want all the lights green.

1208
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,400
And don't trip me up with a red one,
got that?

1209
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,680
Absolutely.

1210
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,920
And number three,
don't play games with me,

1211
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,040
or I'll track you down and I'll fuck
you in your greaseball ass, motherfucker!

1212
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,080
Over and out.

1213
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,080
Let's go.

1214
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,760
All right.

1215
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,280
Know how to use one of these?
No.

1216
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,200
It's really simple.
Okay?

1217
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,640
Safety's on, safety's off.

1218
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,000
On, off.

1219
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,760
Just aim at anything you don't like,
and you pull the trigger, you got that?

1220
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,520
What if they frisk me?
We got that covered.

1221
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,200
That's it?
That's it.

1222
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,920
It's got a false bottom.

1223
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,720
It's gonna be this one.
You got that?

1224
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,560
I got it.
Good.

1225
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,360
Don't worry about it.

1226
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,320
Just don't fuck it up.

1227
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,400
Okay.

1228
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,520
We got an ID on Ryder.

1229
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,480
Dennis Ford. He was released from
Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.

1230
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,960
Did a nine-year stretch.

1231
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,560
The last four on the same
cell block as Phil Ramos.

1232
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,160
His name shows up on an
Icelandic Air passenger list

1233
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,120
in September of 1998,
right after Fashion Week.

1234
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,960
Dennis Ford. You remember?

1235
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,600
We used his case when he
was running as an example of-

1236
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,160
The kind of nonsense that we would
clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.

1237
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,600
He ran a private equity firm.

1238
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,560
His biggest client was
the city pension fund.

1239
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,720
He siphoned off...
Try twenty-million dollars.

1240
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,480
He did a plea bargain for three.
The judge gave him 10.

1241
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,600
Maybe that's why
he's so pissed off.

1242
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,160
Judge gave him 10 years because we
didn't recover all of the city's money.

1243
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,200
There was a couple of million
unaccounted for. It was seed money.

1244
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,480
Seed money? For what?

1245
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,320
For today. You play the terrorist
card, you panic the market into a drop.

1246
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,120
And if you know it's coming, you make
a great deal of money with $2 million.

1247
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,920
What about the hostage money?
Are you kidding?

1248
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,880
That's nothing compared to the
money you could make in the market.

1249
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,960
Let's get downtown,
get to the SEC.

1250
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,240
Check the trades,
especially the put options.

1251
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,800
Good luck, Garber.
See you when you get back.

1252
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,480
We got company.

1253
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,600
Garber.

1254
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,680
When you put your socks on this
morning, did you ever think...?

1255
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,360
Turn around,
let him frisk you.

1256
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,120
I was worried about you.
I thought maybe you'd get lost,

1257
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,640
but then I remembered
you were a motorman, so...

1258
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,240
These tunnels don't change much,
do they?

1259
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,000
Just the people in them.

1260
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,160
Are we good?
It's here. We're good.

1261
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,600
All right, come on up.

1262
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,160
Let's go.

1263
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,160
Damn. You're taller
than I thought you'd be.

1264
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,880
You're good-looking too.
Come on, sit down.

1265
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,800
It's nice to meet you.

1266
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,320
What do you weigh,
about, what, 220?

1267
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,560
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
220 on a good day.

1268
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,640
Oh, that's Ramos.

1269
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,520
He's what you would have called
the brains in the operation.

1270
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,960
Heh, heh. Pow.

1271
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,760
Dumb fuck.

1272
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,840
So how long has it been
since you've driven one of these?

1273
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,280
Uh...

1274
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,680
That's why you brought me
down here?

1275
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,080
Well, you're a motorman, right?

1276
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,040
Once a motorman,
always a motorman.

1277
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,760
You play your cards right,
you might get a part of the cut.

1278
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,480
Well, this is, uh-

1279
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,440
It's a new train. I'm not
certified on the new trains.

1280
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,760
Well, I got faith in you, man. But
I'm going to ask you one question.

1281
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,720
You know, that thing when you
told your wife about the 35 K,

1282
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,880
how did she react?

1283
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
Look, we gotta talk about-?
Don't be sensitive.

1284
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,840
I'm not being-
Did she freak out or what?

1285
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,200
She wasn't happy,
but she understood.

1286
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,560
Well, that's love, right?

1287
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,240
No, that's marriage.
That's another thing.

1288
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,960
All right, so what's the deal? You
think they're gonna move that train?

1289
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,320
Seems like a possibility. How are we covered
with street-level exits, emergency exits?

1290
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,720
I got a blanket on the fuckers.

1291
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,040
I got radio cars and a man at
every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.

1292
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,080
We gotta go.

1293
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,200
Hey, Camonetti.

1294
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,840
Fucking greaseball, man.

1295
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,680
Hey, greaseball,
speak up.

1296
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,040
I see red. I don't see green.

1297
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,080
What's taking so fucking long?

1298
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,560
Blanket is not tucked in yet.

1299
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,040
You have to stall him. I need
two minutes, buy me two minutes.

1300
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,640
Still haven't
cleared the tracks yet.

1301
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,840
Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready
in less than two minutes.

1302
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,760
Okay, let me tell you. We're
gonna move forward here, okay?

1303
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,600
We're gonna move forward,
and if we get onto a red signal,

1304
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,000
and the brakes trip up

1305
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,800
your friend Walter Garber's
getting it in the head.

1306
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,560
You got it?
Yes, sir. I got it.

1307
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,960
Let's roll, let's roll.

1308
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,680
Hope you were bluffing.

1309
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,800
Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.
You gotta say what you gotta say.

1310
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,640
You thought by coming down here,
you'd be redeemed, didn't you?

1311
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,720
God bless you, Garber.

1312
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,680
You're more fucked up
than I am. Heh, heh, heh.

1313
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,160
At least the same
fucked up. Ha, ha.

1314
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,040
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1315
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,120
Let's go.

1316
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,840
She's on the move.

1317
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,800
Put some speed on it.

1318
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,720
He's by me, headed south.
Male, black, at the controls.

1319
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,240
Motherfuckers.

1320
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,000
You're playing with fire, my man.
I wanna see them green.

1321
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,920
Turn to green or I'll put a hole
in Garber's head right now.

1322
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,600
Do it!
CAMONETTl: We believe you.

1323
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,400
We're moving as fast as we can.

1324
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,080
What happens if they run a red light?
It'll trip the brakes.

1325
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,560
Coming up on the first one.

1326
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,760
There, that's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.

1327
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,360
Here he comes, right now.

1328
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,800
Whoa.

1329
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,240
That man Garber's driving the
train. Sniper confirmed it.

1330
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah, so what are you saying, that he's
in on it? There ain't no fucking way.

1331
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,080
Sniper killed Ramos,
he was their driver,

1332
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,960
they probably need Garber
to drive.

1333
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:14,080
When they get to Coney Island, they're gonna
hit the trippers and the brakes will come on.

1334
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,720
Is that 33rd?
Yes, sir.

1335
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,080
How far to the signal?

1336
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,320
About a tenth of a mile.

1337
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,320
All right. You stop when we get
there. We're moving out. You got that?

1338
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,800
I'm slowing down now.

1339
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,080
Are they slowing down?

1340
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,440
They have to. They're
coming up to a signal point.

1341
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,840
What is that?

1342
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,920
You're the old motorman,
you tell me.

1343
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,440
She stopped just below 33rd Street.
What the hell are they doing?

1344
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,040
Oh, jeez.

1345
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,280
Why that little stop?

1346
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,240
Train has to stop
at signal points.

1347
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,600
Some kind of an override?

1348
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,640
Yep, some kind of an override,
that's right.

1349
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,520
There we go. Okay, let's
move out. Let's go, let's go.

1350
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,200
Roosevelt tunnel,
which way?

1351
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,080
Which way?

1352
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,720
She's moving again.
Next stop, 28th Street.

1353
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,520
CAMONETTl:
Why that little stop, huh?

1354
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,160
I told you, the signal points.

1355
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,280
Yeah. How do you know they didn't
set the throttle and jump out?

1356
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,040
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
We got every exit covered.

1357
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,520
There's nowhere to go.

1358
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,960
Listen, the throttle can't be set.
It has to be held.

1359
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,200
It's the failsafe,
it's a dead-man's switch.

1360
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,320
If it doesn't have a man's hand
pressing down on it,

1361
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,880
the train stops cold. Believe
me, they're still aboard.

1362
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,600
It's going faster.

1363
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,640
Emri, off the track.
Come on.

1364
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,960
Let's go!

1365
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,400
Garber, come on.

1366
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,840
Come on!

1367
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,800
It's gonna derail
before it gets to Coney Island.

1368
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,720
That's it. That's it right
there. Roosevelt tunnel.

1369
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,960
It's a fucking train crossover.
Come on. Cross over now!

1370
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,400
What?
Come on, move!

1371
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,360
Hey!

1372
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,680
Fuck it, let's go!
BASHKIN: We gotta find him!

1373
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,200
We don't have time!
Let's go!

1374
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,480
I love you. I fucking love you.

1375
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,680
Geo, I fucking love you too.

1376
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,520
WHISPERING]
Hello? Hello?

1377
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,040
We're getting calls.

1378
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,520
Cops on the platform are
seeing passengers on the train,

1379
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,160
nobody in the motorman's booth.
Believe me, they're still aboard.

1380
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,000
It's okay, it's all right!
As soon as we hit a red light

1381
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,920
the brakes will stop it
automatically.

1382
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,600
Yeah, but they're all green!

1383
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,800
Four stops away.

1384
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,120
Two stops.

1385
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,160
Oh, Jesus.
The train just stopped.

1386
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,240
Oh.
I really gotta take that piss.

1387
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,920
There's no hijackers
onboard, just passengers.

1388
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,840
Where was that stop, that
first stop that they made?

1389
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,160
Near 34th.

1390
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,680
That's by the Roosevelt spur.
CAMONETTl: The what?

1391
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,800
A derelict tunnel
built under the Waldorf Hotel.

1392
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,440
Converge everything on that area.
Throw a goddamn dragnet over it!

1393
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,160
Hey!

1394
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,760
OFFICER 1:
Freeze!

1395
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,440
OFFICER 2:
Put your hands in the air!

1396
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,360
Hey!

1397
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,080
Hey. Get out,
get out, get out.

1398
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1399
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,760
I'm sorry.

1400
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,680
Out of the- Get out of the way!

1401
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,840
Just go, go, go.

1402
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,960
911 operator.

1403
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,080
Hello? Hello?
This is Walter Garber, MTA.

1404
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,440
How do you spell that?

1405
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,280
Gar-
Don't worry about how to spell it.

1406
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,200
Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti

1407
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,720
that Ryder is headed
to the Manhattan Bridge!

1408
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,960
Cars everywhere. Nobody's
going anywhere for a long time.

1409
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,600
Hey. Hey!

1410
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,000
Is he in there?
No, no, no.

1411
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,400
No.
Where did he go?

1412
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,880
Brooklyn. He said he couldn't
wait, he started walking.

1413
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,560
This fucking city!

1414
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,200
Come on, you guys. Move out!

1415
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,320
Ryder!

1416
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,880
Don't move.

1417
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,800
So is this how you thought
the day was going to end, huh?

1418
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,840
When you put your socks
on this morning? Huh?

1419
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,880
This make you feel better,
Garber?

1420
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,920
That make everything okay now?

1421
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,240
No! But it's a start.

1422
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,120
Don't move.

1423
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,600
Don't move!

1424
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,440
Hey!

1425
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,320
Garber Baby boy,
I ain't going back to prison.

1426
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:42,680
I don't- I don't think you got any-
Any options now or leverage.

1427
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,000
Hey!

1428
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,640
We all owe God a death,
I told you that.

1429
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,680
You're wrong, Ryder.
We owe God life.

1430
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,360
Life. And that's the life
I gave you back today.

1431
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,600
And now you have to
give me something back.

1432
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,200
What are you talking about?

1433
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,600
You got a gun in your hand,
I want you to use it. Shoot me.

1434
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,440
No, shoot me before
they shoot me,

1435
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,640
or I'm gonna kill you.

1436
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,120
I will shoot you.
I don't want to, but I will.

1437
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,520
Hey!
I thought you cared.

1438
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,720
No!
You said:

1439
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,720
"Ryder. Ryder, don't you
have anyone who cares?"

1440
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,920
I thought that was you.

1441
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,560
Come on, man, pay it back.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1442
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,480
All right, I'm gonna give
you 10, then the deal's off.

1443
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,840
I got a gun, I'm gonna use it.
I'm gonna take your life back.

1444
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,560
Hey!
Come on, man!

1445
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:38,000
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five-

1446
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,840
You gonna take this
down to zero?

1447
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,280
Come on, motherfucker,
shoot me!

1448
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,480
I am not going to shoot you!

1449
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,240
Five, four. Come on.

1450
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,400
Hey!
Three.

1451
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,920
Police, drop your weapon!

1452
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,480
I'm disappointed in you.
Two.

1453
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,120
You're my goddamn hero.

1454
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,640
OFFICER:
Drop your weapon!

1455
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,600
Mr. Garber.

1456
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,880
Interesting day, huh?
Yes, sir.

1457
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,480
You know, just about
every day I make a speech,

1458
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,720
and it starts with:

1459
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,360
"I'd like to thank you on behalf of
the city of New York," blah, blah, blah.

1460
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,120
And I never know
who I'm thanking or why.

1461
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,600
But you

1462
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,280
did a hell of a thing today.

1463
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,680
You went to bat
for the city of New York.

1464
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,600
And on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.

1465
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,520
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, it's been an amazing day.

1466
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,920
Everybody's thanking me all day,
but I appreciate it. You're welcome.

1467
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,440
And I want you to know

1468
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,160
that tomorrow, the city of New
York is going to go to bat for you.

1469
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,200
In a big way.
You understand?

1470
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,320
Yes, sir.

1471
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,480
And this city has
a very good batting average.

1472
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,920
I appreciate it.
All right.

1473
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I'm gonna get home.

1474
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,760
Oh, take my car.

1475
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,720
No, no, I'll take-
Put the siren on and everything.

1476
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,520
There's a siren on there?
Yes.

1477
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,720
No, I'll take the subway.
But I appreciate it.

1478
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:04,880
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

1479
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,280
You know, me, subway all my life.
I get home faster than you anyway.

1480
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,320
I mean, not you, but,
you know, everybody else.

1481
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,960
But thank you, sir.

1482
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,320
You a Yankee fan?

1483
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,400
No. Well, uh, yes.
Yes, of course.

1484
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,120
Ha. Yeah, right.

1485
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:11,160
Stand clear of the closing doors.
