We agreed to push

to get to the location.

You're supposed to be

Yes, l understand that.

and l'll tell you why.

136

of a map.

00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,935
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

140
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,135
A place that was
thought to exist
only in myth.

to fund a wild goose chase.

l'm talking about
a primitive world
never before seen by man.

of an entire civilization.

you've ever seen.

of the native girls.

if he would waste his time
on nudie shots?

No! They respected

what that means,

[phone ringing]

161
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,540
(receptionist)
Zelman and Associates.

162
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,781
Give me that, quick.

163
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,480
You won't like it.
lt's non-alcoholic.

164
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:41,687
Preston, you have
a lot to learn about
the motion picture business.

165
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,225
(Zelman)
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

166
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,269
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

167
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,634
He's had a lot of
near-success.

168
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,140
He's a preening self-promoter.

169
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,507
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got ''loser''
written all over him.

170
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,068
(Zelman)
l understand
your disappointment--

171
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,273
(investor #1)
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

172
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:05,146
(investor #2)
He's washed up.
lt's all over town.

173
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,647
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

174
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,552
The animal footage has value.

175
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,057
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

176
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,526
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

177
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,960
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

178
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,461
Get him back in.

179
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,096
Mr. Denham.

180
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,307
l want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

181
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,504
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

182
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,740
Tell them the studio
pressured us into
an early departure.

183
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,840
lt's not ethical!
What are they gonna do,
sue me?

184
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,009
They can get in line.

185
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,518
l'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

186
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:44,022
You realize that none of
the camera equipment
is on board?

187
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,888
We have no permits,
no visas.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,587
That's why l have you,
Preston.

189
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,754
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

190
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,764
ln fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

191
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:53,821
He's there.

192
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,731
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay
for the ship?

193
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:56,894
Get in.

194
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:03,369
You get out of there!
Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

195
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,503
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

196
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,036
[gasping]

197
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,714
Don't worry, Preston.
l've had a lot of practice
at this.

198
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,348
l'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

199
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,783
(Preston)
Red Label, 80% proof...

200
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,690
to be packed in a crate
marked ''lemonade.''

201
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,819
(Carl)
You got it.

202
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,261
Tell Maureen
she doesn't have six hours
to put on her face.

203
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,629
lf she wants to be
in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

204
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,328
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

205
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,098
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

206
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,266
Yesterday. l told you.

207
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,975
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

208
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,036
That's what you told her.

209
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,108
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

210
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:48,483
God damn it, Preston,
all you had to do was
look her in the eye and lie.

211
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,280
l got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

212
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:52,790
She's unavailable.

213
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,692
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

214
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,054
[scoffing]
You'll never get her
into a size four.

215
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:01,692
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into
Maureen's costumes.

216
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,263
Fay's a size four.

217
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:08,830
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

218
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,909
Cooper, huh?

219
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,442
l might have known.

220
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,217
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

221
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,752
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

222
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,253
Not an option.
Carl.

223
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,788
l said l'd find a girl.

224
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,120
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

225
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:29,025
Call Jack. l need that
goddamn screenplay!

226
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,956
Defeat is always momentary.

227
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:07,991
What?

228
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,765
[people chattering]

229
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:05,587
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

230
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,190
Excuse me.

231
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:12,728
Ma'am,
l think you dropped this.

232
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,969
Vaudeville, huh?

233
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,069
l worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

234
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:28,943
lf you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

235
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:30,482
Mr. Denham...

236
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:32,506
l want you to know...

237
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,383
that l'm not in the habit
of accepting charity
from strangers.

238
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,319
Or, for that matter...

239
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,948
taking things
that don't belong to me.

240
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,926
lt was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

241
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,962
lt's just that
l haven't been paid
in a while.

242
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,431
That's awful. Anyway, Ann....
May l call you Ann?

243
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,903
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

244
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,466
No, no. Oh, God, no.

245
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:01,069
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

246
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,240
l'm not that type
of person at all.

247
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,011
What type of person are you?

248
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,053
l'm someone
you can trust, Ann.
l'm a movie producer.

249
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,181
Believe me, l am on
the level. No funny business.
Please sit down.

250
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,824
Please. Please.

251
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:19,823
Okay.

252
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,359
Ann, l want you to imagine...

253
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:26,098
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

254
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,470
You're filming
in the Far East?

255
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,039
Singapore.

256
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,876
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

257
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,776
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

258
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:42,548
And she can't
escape the feeling that
forces beyond her control...

259
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,524
are compelling her
down a road from which
she cannot draw back.

260
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:50,785
lt's as if her whole life
has been a prelude
to this moment...

261
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:56,534
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

262
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:01,164
And sure enough, against
her better judgment....

263
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,930
She falls in love.

264
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:04,701
Yes.

265
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,835
But she doesn't trust it.

266
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,980
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

267
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,441
Uh...

268
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,712
really?

269
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,252
lf she loves someone,
it's doomed.

270
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:17,721
Why is that?

271
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,715
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

272
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,798
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

273
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:31,393
Now, l don't wanna rush you,
but we are under
some time pressure.

274
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,904
Well, l really--
Ann, l'm telling you...

275
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,304
you're perfect. Look at you.

276
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,365
You're the saddest girl
l've ever met.

277
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:41,539
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna
break their hearts.

278
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,907
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

279
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,578
l make people laugh,
that's what l do.

280
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,214
Good luck with your picture.

281
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,621
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

282
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,094
l'm offering you money.

283
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,826
Adventure, fame,
the thrill of a lifetime,
and a long sea voyage.

284
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,992
You want to read a script?

285
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:05,128
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

286
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,506
Jack Driscoll?

287
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,905
Sure. Why?

288
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,966
Wait. You know him?

289
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,606
No, not personally.
l've seen his plays.

290
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,684
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

291
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,777
Jack Driscoll does not
want just anyone
starring in this picture.

292
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,219
He said to me, ''Carl...

293
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,656
''somewhere out there
is a woman
born to play this role.''

294
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:29,126
And as soon as l saw you,
l knew.

295
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,761
Knew what?

296
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,031
lt was always
going to be you.

297
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,105
[ship horn blowing]

298
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,548
(Jack)
How much do l owe you?
(driver)
Make it a quarter.

299
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,209
Keep the change.

300

301
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,056
Not exactly.

lt's actually
this one over here.

303
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:16,234
Don't let appearances
deceive you. lt's much more
spacious on board.

304
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,171
ls this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

305
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,337
This is all of it?
Yeah.

306
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,005
We're taking
the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

307
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,777
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

308

Carl!
Yes!

Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

lt's bad, it's bad.

311
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,626
They're on their way.

You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

Can we talk about this later?

and an end. l gotta have
something to shoot.

what a lovely dress?

470
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:57,514
Oh, this old thing?
l just threw it on.

471
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,541
lsn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

472
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,650
Now, what does a girl
have to do around here
to get some breakfast?

473
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,748
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

474
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:10,283
Fancy my porridge
à la walnuts?

475
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,027
Oh, Ann, l don't believe
you've met....

476
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:20,496
Ann?

477
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:24,135
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
l know who this is.

478
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:33,043
Thrilled to meet you.
lt's an honor to be
a part of this.

479
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:35,685
Gee, thanks.

480
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:39,189
Actually, l'm quite familiar
with your work.

481
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:40,818
Really?

482
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:43,685
Yes,
and what l most admire...

483
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:47,391
is the way
you've captured the voice
of the common people.

484
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,430
Well, that's my job.

485
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,670
l'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

486
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,207
if you don't mind me
saying...

487
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:00,335
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

488
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:07,179
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann--

489
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:10,050
He's so much
younger in person.
And much better-looking.

490
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:11,749
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

491
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:13,984
You see, l was just afraid
that you might be...

492
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,857
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

493
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:18,761
l'm sorry, l'm not--
You know...

494
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,561
the tweedy twerp
with his nose in his book
and his head up his a--

495
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,467
lt's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

496
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,754
Good Christ!

497
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,217
(Carl)
She's standing
at the railing.

498
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,809
She doesn't know it yet...

499
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:15,978
[typewriter clacking]

500
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:19,546
but they are sailing
towards disaster.
You got that?

501
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,453
(Jack)
Okay, so she turns...

502
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,661
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

503
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:28,591
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

504
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,602
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

505
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:34,332
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

506
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,239
Come on, Jack.
lt was an honest mistake.

507
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,869
Ann is nearsighted.
lt could have happened
to anyone.

508
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,537
l was joking, Carl.

509
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:44,912
The point is,
she's horrified.
She has to look away.

510
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,746
And that's when she sees it.

511
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,288
Sees what?

512
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,651
What?

513
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,564
The island.

514
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:10,674
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

515
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,843
[shushing]
Jack, keep your voice down.

516
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,906
l don't want the crew
getting spooked.

517
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:20,508
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

518
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,610
All right.
lt has a local name...

519
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,212
but l'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

520
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,986
[whispers]
They call it Skull lsland.

521
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,787
Did you get that?

522
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:31,926
What's wrong
with this place?

523
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:34,727
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

524
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:38,300
Because, technically,
it hasn't been
discovered yet.

525
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,673
Okay. All right.

526
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,139
So we arrive at this place.

527
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:48,940
S...

528
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:50,775
K...

529
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,181
U...

530
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:55,379
L...

531
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,150
L...

532
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:04,993
lsland.

533
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:12,395
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

534
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:17,635
l think this is
awfully exciting! l've never
been on a ship before.

535
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,303
And l've never been on one
with a woman before.

536
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,836
l guess you don't think
much of women
on ships, do you?

537
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:25,876
No, they're a nuisance.

538
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,613
Well, l'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

539
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:38,954
Cut!

540
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,430
lt's great.

541
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:45,798
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

542
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,771
That was very natural.
l felt moved.

543
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:52,399
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some
flow now, huh?

544
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:54,308
lt was pure effluence.

545
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,142
l beefed up the banter.

546
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,341
Try to resist that impulse.

547
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,645
lt's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

548
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,187
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

549
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,448
Actors.

550
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,889
Travel the world,
but all they ever see
is a mirror.

551
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:22,704
Good legs.

552
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,970
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

553
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:30,571
Yeah.

554
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:34,277
Not that you don't
have good legs.
Just making conversation.

555
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,650
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

556
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,148
About the scene today
with you and Bruce--

557
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,057
l know it wasn't
what you wrote...

558
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:47,155
but Mr. Baxter
felt very strongly that
when a man likes a woman...

559
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,460
he must ignore her.

560
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:52,401
And if things turn
really hostile, then....

561
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:54,465
No?

562
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:56,268
lnteresting theory.

563
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,000
l know. l should have....

564
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,374
lt wasn't
what l had intended, but--

565
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:02,970
l'm sorry. l was....

566
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:05,038
And you made it your own.

567
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:07,507
l was nervous.

568
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,347
lt was funny, actually.
You were funny.

569
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,587
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

570
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:15,057
Miss Darrow.

571
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:22,893
You don't have to be nervous.

572
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:34,769
Thank you.

573
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,300
Let's take it....

574
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,706
Would you please....
We're trying to
shoot a scene.

575
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,404
Okay.
Thank you.

576
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:42,939
Okay, again.

577
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:59,690
(Carl)
We're close. Turn southwest.

578
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:03,327
(Englehorn)
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

579
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,795
lt takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

580
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,363
l won't sail blind
in these waters.

581
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,639
l'll make it
worth your while.

582
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:16,971
There's nothing out there.

583
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,116
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

584
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:36,122
lf someone were to tell you
this ship was headed
for Singapore...

585
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,331
what would you say?

586
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:42,201
l would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

587
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:46,700
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

588
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:48,572
Gentlemen, please.

589
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,505
We're not looking
for trouble.
No.

590
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:56,251
You're looking
for something else.

591
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:01,023
Yes, we are.

592
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,060
We're going to find
Skull lsland.

593
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:08,496
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

594
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,266
For 25 cents,
you get to see the last
blank space on the map.

595
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,866
l wouldn't be
so sure of that.

596
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,803
What do you mean?

597
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,139
Seven years ago,
me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

598
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:24,772
on a Norwegian bark.

599
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,682
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

600
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,783
He'd been drifting for days.

601
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:33,255
His ship had run aground
on an island
way west of Sumatra.

602
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:36,782
An island hidden in fog.

603
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:40,827
He spoke of a huge wall...

604
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,863
built so long ago...

605
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,394
no one knew who'd made it.

606
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,539
A wall 100 foot high...

607
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,640
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

608
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,403
Why'd they build the wall?

609
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:04,515
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

610
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,049
neither beast nor man...

611
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:10,823
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

612
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,223
A lion or a tiger.

613
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,496
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

614
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,364
What else did he say?

615
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:19,829
Nothing.

616
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:22,668
We found him
the next morning. He'd stuck
a knife through his heart.

617
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,002
[laughing]
Mmm-hmm.

618
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:27,235
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do
better than that.

619
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,743
Monsters belong in B movies.

620
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,840
lf you find this place...

621
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:36,787
if you go ashore
with your friends
and your cameras...

622
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:39,650
you won't come back.

623
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,150
Just as long as
you understand that.

624
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,550
[shattering]

625
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,874
How long do you expect us

Yes.

Englehorn, you can't just--
Outside.

00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,459
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

Did you know that?

No, Denham.
You risked everything l have.

Check our position.
Use the stars.

that wants to, Jimmy.
