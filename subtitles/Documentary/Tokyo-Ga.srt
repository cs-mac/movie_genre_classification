1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,310
Naoki!

2
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,410
Blow out the candles, Kotoko.

3
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,990
Okay.

4
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
Hm?

5
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,750
What?

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,250
That? s not right.

7
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,330
Good morning.

8
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,490
Oh...? morning.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,290
Doing facial exercises in your sleep?

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
What?

11
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,470
First you were smiling.
Then you puckered up like a fish.

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,300
You were blowing, too.

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,810
A fish?

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,210
Oh...

15
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,620
It was a dream!

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,730
Sigh...

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,020
Why the exaggerated sigh?

18
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,950
I know you are all aware

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,330
that the 28th of this month
is my birthday.

20
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,990
We had no clue.

21
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,870
Neither does Naoki. Probably.

22
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,700
What?!

23
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,040
Why not?

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,140
He' s your husband!

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,449
He has 200 on IQ test,
but not when it comes to birthdays...

26
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,909
Not even in one corner
of his brilliant mind?

27
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,450
No room for trivia?

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,989
His mom throws me a party every year

29
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,039
and he's forced to attend.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,539
But I want him to
want to celebrate my birthday!

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,750
But he has no interest...

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,690
That' s not love...

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,270
I wouldn' t stand for it.

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,329
I' d be fine with a super
expensive present.

35
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,989
You' re so materialistic.

36
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,329
Why don' t you ask for a present?

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,539
A super expensive one!

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,050
It' s not the price!
A gift should be heartfelt.

39
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,990
What has he given you so far?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,039
What has he given me? Well...

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,459
Tell us! Tell us!

42
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,630
Tell us what he gave you!

43
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,640
Hm? Huh?

44
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,220
Wait a minute. he' s never...

45
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,449
He' s never given me a present.

46
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,990
No way!

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,040
How many years
have you been married?

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,989
I can' t believe it.

49
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,929
Poor Kotoko.

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,989
This calls for a divorce!

51
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,270
He doesn' t love you at all!

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,949
That' s not true! He' s
just a little shy...

53
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,109
I know he loves me...

54
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,419
Here is a problem.

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,950
Is there another woman?

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,080
Fine!

57
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,249
This year, it will be roses
and champagne and...

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,120
a heartfelt present.
I will make it come true!

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,579
1,000 yen that it doesn? t.

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,119
Me, too. 1,000yen.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,789
Count me in. 1,000yen.

62
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,130
Doesn' t anyone have faith?

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,990
Final Episode
Best Birthday Gift Ever

64
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,490
The 28th?

65
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Yes!

66
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,390
I have surgery and night duty.

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
Was there something else?

68
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,610
He doesn' t remember...

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,630
Never mind.

70
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,110
I won' t give up! This calls for...

71
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,000
There you are, Mr. Irie!

72
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,810
What' s with you?

73
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,760
Oh, it' s you, Funatsu.

74
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,520
I' ll take your shift on the 28th.

75
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,610
Huh?

76
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,479
On the 28th...

77
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,510
I don' t need to switch shifts.

78
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Huh?

79
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,369
 But you have to!
- Huh?

80
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,379
You have to switch with me!

81
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,810
Or else Kotoko... Oops.

82
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,680
Why do I have to?

83
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,400
No...

84
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,629
What did Kotoko tell you?

85
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,060
No... nothing...

86
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Funatsu!

87
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,290
Kotoko said if I switch shifts
with you on the 28th

88
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,530
she' ll arrange a date for me
with Miss Marina.

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,290
A date?

90
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,380
So please let me
take your shift on the 28th!

91
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,500
That' s a promise!

92
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,250
What' s with Funatsu?

93
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,169
Just you and Naoki?

94
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,919
I' m sorry...

95
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,289
I' m so sad!

96
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,499
I was looking forward to this event!

97
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,299
The banner is almost finished.

98
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,689
Banner?

99
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,690
See?

100
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,040
I' m sorry...

101
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,089
We can have a party...

102
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,280
No!

103
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,130
You' re absolutely right!

104
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,339
Naoki hates our parties.

105
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,420
He acts like he' s forced to be there!

106
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,670
I' ve never seen him give you a present.

107
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,290
All right, Kotoko!

108
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,250
You and Naoki should spend some
quality time together this year.

109
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,420
I' ll swallow my tears this time...

110
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,970
Mom...

111
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,629
Let' s put up a plan for this, Kotoko!

112
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
Okay!

113
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,920
How can we drop subtle hints

114
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,780
so Naoki will remember your birthday?

115
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,290
Yes...

116
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,670
Subtle hints won' t work.

117
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
What?

118
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,000
You were scheming with Funatsu today.

119
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,420
Funatsu... that big mouth!

120
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,290
So, your birthday is coming up.

121
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,870
Mom gets excited every year.

122
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,040
But I have no interest in birthdays.

123
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,959
Naoki, you' re terrible!

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,360
You have no interest in
your beloved wife' s birthday?

125
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,720
Do you want to celebrate
your birthday that badly?

126
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,300
It was my lifelong dream...

127
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
I see...

128
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,600
What kind of birthday
is your lifelong dream?

129
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,170
Tell him, Kotoko!

130
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,129
It' s embarrassing...

131
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,610
I just...

132
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,120
I would get all dressed up.

133
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,520
Naoki would give me
a huge bouquet of roses.

134
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
We' d have dinner...

135
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,840
The chef would bring us a cake.

136
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,380
Everyone would sing
Happy birthday to me.

137
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,290
We would sip champagne...

138
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,960
And spend the evening together...

139
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,880
I see how important this is to you.

140
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,970
Huh?

141
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,280
I' ll switch shifts with Funatsu
on the 28th.

142
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,350
Rea... really?

143
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,160
Are you sure?

144
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,590
Yeah. He can be a pest, too.

145
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,930
Yay!

146
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,350
You did it, Kotoko!

147
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,850
Yay! Naoki!

148
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,429
From the day I met Naoki...

149
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,050
I dreamed of a birthday like this...

150
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,730
My birthday finally came.

151
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,370
Don' t forget, Naoki!

152
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,270
7:00pm at the Royal Hotel lobby!

153
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,510
Yeah.

154
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,590
Remember, Naoki.

155
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,600
I gave up my party plan for Kotoko

156
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah.

157
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,639
I don' t need a bouquet of roses...
It's ok...

158
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,590
Yeah!

159
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,049
I really don' t! Not at all.

160
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,130
Give me a break! Enough already!

161
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,100
Poor Naoki.

162
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,460
A little...

163
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,590
See you.

164
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,530
Hair Salon at 15:30pm

165
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:44,081
I' d better get ready, too.

166
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,282
Put on my beautiful dress...

167
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,355
and get my hair done

168
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,384
into a beautiful hair style.

169
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:52,463
And my make-up, too...

170
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,233
This is a special day.

171
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,347
I' m going all out!

172
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:05,213
He may fall in love with me
all over again!

173
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,944
Mom, her hair looks like a cockatoo.

174
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,239


175
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:32,859
This is terrible!

176
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:37,443
What is this hair style?

177
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:43,575
Maybe I should do it over!
But I don' t have time.

178
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:48,285
Maybe it' s not as bad as I think...

179
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:58,988
Why couldn' t I tell him
I didn' t like it?

180
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:01,417
I' m so stupid...

181
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:04,545
What' s wrong?

182
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:05,513
Are you okay?

183
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,548
What' s wrong?

184
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:15,005
She started wavering and
she doubled over.

185
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:18,132
She collapsed and hit her head!

186
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,511
Are you okay?

187
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,469
Let' s put your head up a little, ok?

188
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,487
Okay.

189
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:34,251
Does anyone have a handkerchief?

190
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,702
Here, use this.

191
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,963
Thank you.

192
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,751
Can you call an ambulance?

193
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:42,432
Sure!

194
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,457
Okay.

195
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,760
Can I borrow your bag?

196
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:48,625
Sure.

197
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,429
Place it under her head.

198
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,410
Is she a nurse?

199
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,826
I thought she was a barmaid.

200
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:01,267
The ambulance will be here soon.

201
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,967
Can you say your name?

202
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,669
Does it hurt anywhere else?

203
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,838
She' s lucky you were a nurse.

204
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:17,267
I think it' s anemia,
but she was also bleeding...

205
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,087
Thank you very much.

206
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,776
You did a great job.

207
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,180
Good job, lady.

208
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,593
Terrific.

209
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,420
Very cool.

210
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,521
Not really...

211
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,496


212
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,103
Just leave it there.

213
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:39,373


214
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,079
I was just passing by.

215
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,113
She' s not my friend...

216
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,869
Let me out!

217
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:57,719
What should I do?
I' m over two hours late.

218
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,929
Naoki may have already left.

219
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,730
Why today...

220
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,397
Sorry, Naoki!

221
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,807
Please wait...

222
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,902
a little longer!

223
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,159
Ma' am.

224
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:38,659
What happened to your dress?

225
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,248
What do you mean?

226
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:43,023
Are you hurt?

227
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:47,032
This is... oh no!

228
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,712
What should I do?

229
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:51,650
Ma' am?

230
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:55,126
I can' t see Naoki like this...

231
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:58,437
I was supposed
to meet someone here...

232
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:01,911
But I' m already 3 hours late...

233
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,458
Shall I call him?

234
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,514
It' s my birthday...

235
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:11,559
I can' t see Naoki like this...

236
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,831
Ma' am...

237
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:19,276
It's my first birthday with him...

238
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,686
I can' t see him like this!

239
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,775
Why not wait over there?

240
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,526
Did he go home already?

241
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:34,781
I have no idea, ma' am.

242
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:43,882
Naoki?

243
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,540
I thought you were hurt...

244
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,599
You scared me.

245
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,432
Naoki!

246
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:02,217
I' m sorry... I m so late...

247
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:08,085
A lot happened and
I couldn' t get here...

248
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:15,439
I was going crazy...

249
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:22,061
I thought you' d already left...

250
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,917
But I couldn' t give up

251
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:33,311
I knew you' d get here today,

252
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,381
even if you had to crawl all the way...

253
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,436
How could I leave?

254
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,622
But you look a mess.

255
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:46,588
I know...

256
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,043
You can tell me about it later...

257
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:53,658
I' m hungry.

258
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:59,039
The restaurant is closed...

259
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,066
And the way you look...

260
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,662
Hey, guy!

261
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:07,683
Hi!

262
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:13,251
You dropped your package.

263
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:16,461
Someone will steal it
if you leave it there.

264
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:19,466
Here you go. Hold it.

265
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,095
Oh, no!

266
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:26,006
I have to catch a plane
back to my home country.

267
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,938
Good luck, you two!

268
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,779
See you!

269
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:50,292
How pretty.

270
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:53,576
A rose for every year.

271
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:59,043
And there' s cake. Let' s eat it.

272
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,683
What was my mom thinking?

273
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:09,284
What am I going to do with this?

274
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,763
Mom...

275
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:15,458
I wonder if she was
secretly waiting for me?

276
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,340
Probably. With her video camera.

277
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:24,134
She has so much time on her hands.

278
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:27,939
But I' m so happy.

279
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,130
I' m the luckiest wife in the world.

280
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:38,064
Happy birthday, Kotoko.

281
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,263
Naoki...

282
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,438
What do you want for a present?

283
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,791
Rea.. really?

284
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:49,363
What should I ask for?

285
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,808
Um... well...

286
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,610
I get it!

287
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:59,937
I want to hear you say, I love you.?

288
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,748
I love you.?

289
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,784
I take it back! Let me think again!

290
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:11,616
Um... well... let me see...

291
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:21,392
I love you, Kotoko.

292
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:27,633
Me too...

293
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:30,132
I love you...

294
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:06,465
It' s been a while since I met Naoki...

295
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,687
but my heart still pounds.

296
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,489
Why do I...

297
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:33,431
Why do I love him so much?

298
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:52,347
Oh...

299
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:55,125
I forgot.

300
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:36,825
Does Naoki...

301
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,150
love me just as much as I do?

302
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:46,933
He makes my heart pound every day.

303
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,085
Do I...

304
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:53,993
make his heart pound sometimes?

305
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,583
I hope I do...

306
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,561
What' s with the creepy smile?

307
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:19,558
I never get tired of looking at it!

308
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:22,204
That was over 2 months ago!

309
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:24,443
I know.

310
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:28,167
But I could stare at it forever.

311
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,839
I guess it was worth it.

312
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:33,162
It brings you so much joy.

313
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,101
You have letters, Kotoko.

314
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,991
Thank you.

315
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,889
It' s from Chris.

316
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:55,341
Oh my god! Look at this!

317
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,995
How lovely!

318
00:26:59,157 --> 00:26:59,713
What is it?

319
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,272
Look!

320
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,836
Dear Naoki and Kotoko,

321
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:13,128
We held our wedding
at a castle resort.

322
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:18,009
We' ve been on honeymoon
in England for a while.

323
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:23,615
We' ll be a couple
to rival the two of you!

324
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,170
I' m so happy right now. Chris.

325
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:34,682
Chris must come from a rich family...

326
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,329
I guess...

327
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,710
It' s beautiful.

328
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:45,115
Kinnosuke looks pretty good, too.

329
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:47,767
They both look so happy...

330
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:51,966
Yuki?

331
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,911
I feel kind of feverish.

332
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:58,406
What?

333
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:03,595
He does.

334
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:08,984
Maybe I got it from Konomi.
She' s not well, either.

335
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:12,914
Why would you catch her cold?

336
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,569
What are you saying?

337
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,323
All right. Wait a minute.

338
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:22,591
Here.

339
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:32,938
We were still okay at this time...

340
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,567
Next Morning

341
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:51,822
Now everyone's...

342
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,649
Breathe in.

343
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,690
Breathe out.

344
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:01,226
Open your mouth.

345
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,543
Your throat is all red.

346
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,550
Dad, you' re next.

347
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,051
Thanks.

348
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:24,264
At the time,
the hospital was in a state of chaos...

349
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,042
Even more than yesterday,

350
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:33,385
we were inundated
with influenza patients...

351
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:38,877
So many people...

352
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:46,595
Excuse me.

353
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:48,754
Are you from the Surgical Unit?

354
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,618
Yes! I' m Kotoko Irie!

355
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:53,543
I' m here to support you.

356
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,687
Naoki!

357
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,457
Kotoko.

358
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,673
What are you doing here?

359
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,652
The same thing as you.

360
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:05,468
What a coincidence!

361
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:09,213
I guess they see us as
the dynamic duo.

362
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,710
Us??

363
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:13,744
You' re the equivalent of 100 doctors!
We can do it!

364
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,324
I guess.

365
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:23,943
I get to work with Naoki...

366
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:27,838
I' m so lucky!

367
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:29,773
Ms. Irie?

368
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,005
Stop daydreaming. Come here.

369
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,534
Yes...

370
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:41,347
The days that followed
were like a nightmare.

371
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,460
Makiko Yamada.
Please wait outside Room 2.

372
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:47,476
Yes.

373
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:50,633
Are you Mrs. Yamada?

374
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:52,374
Please wait over here.

375
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,912
I' m prescribing an inhalant.

376
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,242
Please start using it immediately.

377
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:06,194
Thank you.

378
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,556
Take care.

379
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:18,548
Yum!

380
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,636
Coming!

381
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,960
Hello? Irie residence.

382
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:33,351
Oh, Kotoko.

383
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,670
You still can' t come home?

384
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:43,011
Oh, my! How are you holding up?

385
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:48,667
For both us and your patients,
you' ve hardly gotten any sleep.

386
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:53,252
We' re fine over here.

387
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:58,017
My fever is almost gone,
thanks to you.

388
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,405
Yes.

389
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:05,104
Don' t work too hard.

390
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:07,390
Okay.

391
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,790
All right.

392
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:17,012
I hope she' s okay.

393
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:24,561
So you can't go home too?

394
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:26,141
Naoki!

395
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,113
You' re still here, too?

396
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:31,616
There' s too much going on.

397
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:35,293
I' m so happy!

398
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,067
Our shifts rarely overlap.

399
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:41,205
How can you be happy?

400
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:46,913
I' ve always dreamed about this.

401
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:51,307
What?

402
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:55,897
I' ve been wanting to ask you...

403
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:58,665
Are you feeling ok?

404
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,323
What? Uh...

405
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,912
I' m a little tired.

406
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:08,822
Maybe a little feverish. But I' m fine.

407
00:33:08,948 --> 00:33:10,357
Are you eating?

408
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,420
I don' t have much of an appetite.
We' ve been so busy.

409
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:17,902


410
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:20,872
I see.

411
00:33:21,786 --> 00:33:26,718
Naoki!
Were you super worried about me?

412
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,093
Were you worried your
beloved wife had influenza?

413
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,245
No...

414
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,955
Oh, Naoki!

415
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,739
I' m so happy.

416
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:40,922
I see you' re fine.

417
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:49,563
There you are, Dr. Irie, Kotoko.

418
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:50,754
What' s wrong?

419
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,857
An emergency.

420
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,197
It hurts!

421
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:57,984
You' ll be fine!

422
00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:01,387
Doctor! My son is...

423
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,158
What' s wrong?

424
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,078
His bike ran through a glass door .

425
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,976
The bleeding doesn't stop...

426
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,590
I' ve been applying pressure...

427
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,745
You should have called an ambulance.

428
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,610
But if I let go...

429
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:14,573
of the blood. I couldn' t
even make a phone call.

430
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,544
Come sit over here.

431
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:19,897
Let go. Let me see the wound.

432
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:21,094
I need light.

433
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:25,332
Let me have the towel, mom.

434
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,910
It' ll be fine.

435
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,037
It' s fine.

436
00:34:30,182 --> 00:34:32,882
We have to remove the glass.

437
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:36,402
This may hurt a bit,
but hang in there.

438
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,547
- Ow... it hurts...
- Takashi!

439
00:34:39,572 --> 00:34:42,942
I' m sorry, Takashi!
I wish I could help you...

440
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,280
Calm down, mom!

441
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,502
Your son will get scared
if you? re not calm!

442
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,719
Let' s encourage him together!

443
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:52,340
Nurse...

444
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:55,860
Don' t worry. When it comes
to removing glass,

445
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,615
Dr. Irie is #1!

446
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,177
Right?

447
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:01,271
Yes.

448
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:03,764
Takashi...

449
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:06,005
Be brave, Takashi!

450
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:10,812
You can do it, Takashi.

451
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:14,338
Ow... It hurts!

452
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,632
Come on, Takashi!

453
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,277
Just a little more, Takashi.

454
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,117
I' m sorry.

455
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:25,644
I panicked. I' m so embarrassed.

456
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:28,792
That' s natural.
It must've been shocking.

457
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,425
When you told me...

458
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:35,100
I had to calm down for him,
it really woke me up.

459
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:39,667
I realized I had to be strong for him.

460
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:41,476
Well...

461
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:45,725
I' m glad the cuts weren' t
as deep as we thought.

462
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:49,129
You did great, Takashi. Good job!

463
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:54,025
Thank you so much.

464
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:57,762
I' m so glad we had the #1
glass-removing doctor in Japan

465
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,798
and a very nice nurse
to take care of us.

466
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:04,533
Excuse us.

467
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:06,233
Take care.

468
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:07,891
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

469
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,039
Let' s go.

470
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:13,789
Ow...

471
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:16,081
You must be happy.

472
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:21,411
Someone finally recognized
your value as a nurse.

473
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:24,822
What? That' s not true.

474
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:28,307
The #1 glass-removing doctor
in Japan, huh?

475
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,106
What an honor.

476
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,068
But...

477
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,207
I' m happy, Naoki.

478
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,134
Mothers are amazing.

479
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:48,476
She carried Takashi all the way here.

480
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:50,141
She' s so tiny herself.

481
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:51,966
Yeah.

482
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,758
They' re amazing...

483
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:58,058
The protective instinct
of a mother is so powerful!

484
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:00,144
It sure is.

485
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,550
Dr. Irie!

486
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,797
I' m sorry. We have another patient...

487
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:10,004
What a crazy night.

488
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:14,735
Kotoko, go home.
Another nurse is coming.

489
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:15,411
Huh?

490
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:18,952
Miss Yamamura is coming soon.

491
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:21,433
No, I can still work.

492
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:25,282
Naoki is still working. So can I...

493
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:29,382
What...?

494
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,570
This is weird... I can't stand...

495
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:40,096
- Kotoko!
- Kotoko?

496
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:40,927
Kotoko !

497
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:42,701
Naoki...

498
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:54,632
She' s awake!

499
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,431
It' s true! Kotoko is awake!

500
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,752
Naoki! Kotoko is up!

501
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:03,210
Kotoko...

502
00:38:03,235 --> 00:38:04,944
Mom, calm down.

503
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,450
What...? I...

504
00:38:10,864 --> 00:38:15,283
Kotoko, you collapsed at the hospital.

505
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,722
Naoki carried you home.

506
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:21,282
You' ve been sleeping until now.

507
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:25,219
We were so worried!
Thank god you' re up...

508
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:28,982
I' m sorry I made you worry.

509
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,143
That' s right.

510
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,391
You really had us worried...

511
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:37,114
All is well! Kotoko' s fine.

512
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,099
I' m sorry, Kotoko!

513
00:38:42,124 --> 00:38:45,424
You caught our influenza!

514
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:51,110
You had to work at the hospital...

515
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:53,655
and take care of us as well.

516
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:59,122
We pushed you too hard.

517
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:02,086
This is not it, mom.

518
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,199
I slept well, so I feel totally fine.

519
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:09,961
If I take some medicine now,
I' ll be totally ok tomorrow.

520
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,350
Really? Kotoko?

521
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,565
Yes! I' m fine!

522
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:21,551
I' ll bring you some water, then.

523
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,556
Thank you.

524
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:28,026
Naoki! Look, Kotoko is up.

525
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,148
Don' t drink it.

526
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,237
What?

527
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:36,593
Not now.

528
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,205
Sorry to worry you, Naoki...

529
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,413
But I' m totally fine now.

530
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,872
I don' t know why
I totally blacked out...

531
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:47,917
Kotoko...

532
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:50,241
When...

533
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,701
was your last period?

534
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:59,017
W... W... What...?

535
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,042
Why... do... you ask?

536
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:05,021
What are you saying?

537
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:07,648
Are you...

538
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,755
Naoki?

539
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:12,753
Pregnant?

540
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,333
Ready?

541
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,893
Jump!

542
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,206
Naoki.

543
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:44,857
Nothing.

544
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:50,875
Kotoko.

545
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,670
Nothing.
