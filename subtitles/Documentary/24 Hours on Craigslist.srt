1
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:20,925
We believe that by the end of the day an
attempt will be made on David Palmer's life.

2
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:25,404
If Palmer gets hit, the first African-American
with a real shot at the White House,

3
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,211
it'll tear this country apart.

4
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:32,248
- CTU, this is Myers.
- It's Jack. What exactly did Walsh say?

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,212
There may be an element, inside the agency,
involved with the hit on Palmer.

6
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:39,524
- What?
- The next 24 hours, I want you all over this.

7
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:42,286
Don't trust anybody -
not even your own people.

8
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,489
- I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.
- Me too.

9
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,041
- She snuck out.
- She's grounded for two months.

10
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,484
Turn here. I live on Tenth.

11
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,211
- Dan, I just told you that I...
- Why don't you just relax?

12
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,488
Night's just getting started.

13
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:09,890
My name is Alan York.
Do you have a son or...?

14
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:13,488
Daughter. Kimberly. She snuck out
of the house. Is Janet gone too?

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,484
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

16
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:19,407
Kim got an email from Janet York.
We think they might be together.

17
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:24,123
You're going to the valley with this guy
Alan York? What if she's not there?

18
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:30,725
- So, you know David Palmer?
- I'm gonna be taking some pictures of him.

19
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,205
A 747 just blew up over the Mojave Desert.

20
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:52,568
Preliminary reports make it
sound like it was a bomb.

21
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:01,966
- Walsh isn't answering.
- As soon as you reach him, you find me.

22
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,808
- Is this the crew list from the 747?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,088
Want a maintenance history on the plane?

24
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:12,643
- No. Let's assume this was not an accident.
- Why?

25
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,567
The flight originated out of Berlin, where
Walsh said the shooter was coming from.

26
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,962
I need a breakdown
of crew and passenger lists:

27
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:23,046
political affiliation, criminal record,
country of origin and residence.

28
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,169
- Jack.
- What?

29
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,370
- You wanna tell me what's goin' on tonight?
- What's going on?

30
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:33,412
Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and
a threat on a presidential candidate's life?

31
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,927
Yeah, that's right. Besides that.

32
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:40,052
George Mason comes in here,
disappears up in your office for half an hour,

33
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,283
then he limps out.

34
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,967
What's that all about?

35
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,968
Tell him, Jack.

36
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,932
- Fine. I will.
- Nina...

37
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:56,803
The agents Jack brought down on bribery
charges last year were friends of Mason.

38
00:03:56,893 --> 00:04:01,921
Mason's looked for payback ever since.
Tonight he made accusations about Jack,

39
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:04,732
as well as some other people in this office.

40
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:11,609
Now, in case you haven't noticed, Jack
doesn't have a lot of tolerance for criticism.

41
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,763
I need that right away.

42
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:18,292
All right, look, I'll get you
that list within the hour.

43
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,364
Thank you.

44
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,683
That was quite a story.

45
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,923
Better than the truth.

46
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,084
Did you get the ID?

47
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,530
Yes.

48
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,126
When you came to Jack's rescue
back there with your little performance,

49
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,522
it reminded me of something.

50
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,522
Yeah? What?

51
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:42,290
When we came into work together, about
a month ago, Lisa made some wisecrack.

52
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:48,812
You came up with this great BS story,
early breakfast meeting with District Three.

53
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:54,322
I was really impressed with
how convincing a liar you were.

54
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:58,443
What's your point, Tony?

55
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,693
I still wanna know what happened
with Jack and Mason.

56
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:05,083
- I already told you.
- And I don't believe you.

57
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:10,444
- Maybe I should ask Mason.
- A presidential candidate's life's at stake.

58
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,001
Maybe you should get back to work.

59
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,202
I think we need to turn right here.

60
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,524
There it is.

61
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,165
Janet!

62
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,605
Janet!

63
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,204
- Hello?
- Hey, sweetheart.

64
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:02,410
- So, have you found the girls yet?
- No, we just got here.

65
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,212
Janet's car's out front.
I just got into the store.

66
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,683
- I'll wait till you check it out.
- No, let me call you back.

67
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,491
- Teri, I'll hold.
- Kim!

68
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,245
- Teri?
- Kim!

69
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,925
Teri?

70
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,284
Kim!

71
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,364
They were here.

72
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,888
It's OK.

73
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:44,170
- What did you give her?
- Nothing she didn't want.

74
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,252
Look, my dad is a government agent.

75
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:52,162
I thought you said your dad was dead.

76
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:56,724
Well, he's not. And if I'm not home in the
next half hour, he's going to be all over this.

77
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:00,772
- I told you you should've given her a roofie.
- I'm serious. You two are toast.

78
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:03,686
- She's giving me a headache, dude.
- Just chill, OK?

79
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,764
You chill.

80
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,245
Walsh.

81
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,082
- Did anyone see you come in?
- No.

82
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,050
- You weren't followed?
- Take it easy.

83
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:41,810
No, I'm not gonna take it easy. I'm not.
I should never have called you.

84
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:45,329
If you have evidence that someone
in the agency's involved in a plot

85
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:48,405
against David Palmer,
then you had no choice.

86
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,808
Here. It's all yours. I'm outta this.

87
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,532
Wait. Wait. Wait. A key card?

88
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:05,243
Yeah, it's just a simple key card. The kind
we use to get in and out of the building.

89
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,688
- I don't get it.
- Normally, the magnetic stripe

90
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,686
has just an access code on it,
but the stripe can hold a ton of data.

91
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:15,322
On this one, I found a file
filled with references to Palmer.

92
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:19,247
- But what's the point?
- To smuggle confidential information.

93
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,643
These get in and out of
restricted areas without any scrutiny.

94
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:30,526
- I need you to be reachable through the day.
- You said after tonight I'm done.

95
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:35,926
I can't help it, Scott. Until we diffuse
this situation, I need to be able to find you.

96
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,846
I find out there's an agency
conspiracy to kill Palmer,

97
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:43,768
and the moment I realised what I'd stumbled
onto, I put my wife and kid on a plane.

98
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:48,928
I couldn't even say why. I've been with
the agency long enough to know what this is.

99
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:54,645
- This is your thing now. I'm out.
- Scott, what you did took a lot of courage.

100
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,803
I'm just asking you to hang
in there with me a little longer.

101
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,453
I did my part. Get someone else.

102
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,524
There is no one else.

103
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:23,241
You got me for another 24 hours,
then I'm joining my family.

104
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,849
I know Palmer gets a lot of death threats,
but this one has weight.

105
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:40,812
- We'll have to deal with it later.
- No. Make adjustments in your schedule.

106
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:44,090
Notify his advance team
and tighten up security on your end.

107
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,164
At this point...

108
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:49,404
- I've gotta go. I'll update you in an hour.
- One hour?

109
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,484
Yes. Fine.

110
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,853
- Teri.
- Jack, I need you.

111
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,924
- Richard?
- Yeah.

112
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,008
I'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza. I got two shooters
tryin' to hit me, and an agent down.

113
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:05,412
What's going on?

114
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:08,610
I got hard information about
who's behind the Palmer hit.

115
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:11,253
Isley can get there before me.
He's in the area.

116
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,212
No! Don't call anyone. We still
don't know who we can trust, Jack.

117
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:19,172
- Just... get me outta here.
- I'll be there in ten minutes.

118
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:21,448
I'll be on the roof.

119
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,248
Richard? Richard?

120
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:45,005
- Hello.
- Hey, what's goin' on? Is Kim at the store?

121
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:48,130
- No. She's not here.
- I thought you said you saw their car.

122
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:54,448
- Yeah, well, we think she left with the boys.
- This York, does he know either of the boys?

123
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,206
No, but one of them, Dan, works here.

124
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,330
Jack, I'm starting to worry.
Can't you get over here?

125
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,691
Not right now. I don't have time to explain,
but some very bad things are happening.

126
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,162
Our daughter is missing. That's pretty bad.

127
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,451
Teri, she's not missing. She's partying.
Kim's smart enough to know her limits.

128
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:16,971
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you should come
over here and see what those limits are, Jack.

129
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,692
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

130
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:22,685
We're gonna wait here for them
to come back for the car.

131
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:25,606
Just call me when you're done
with your emergency, OK?

132
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,604
I will. I'm sorry, OK?

133
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,765
- I'll call you as soon as I can.
- Bye.

134
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:44,446
Look, I know it seems like we're these
really bad guys, but we're cool. I swear.

135
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,492
There's just some stuff we gotta do. Just go
along with it and you guys won't get hurt.

136
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:53,249
I don't even know what you want me to
go along with. Is this some fraternity stunt?

137
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,933
- Yeah. Somethin' like that.
- Fine. Whatever.

138
00:13:57,013 --> 00:14:00,767
I will tell your friends whatever
you want me to. Just let us go.

139
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:05,290
- It's not that simple. These people expect...
- What people?

140
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,647
Dan, pull over. She's choking.

141
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,842
- She's not breathing, you idiot!
- I don't care.

142
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:27,412
- Pull over!
- Get back!

143
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,364
Don't be a moron!

144
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,727
Don't be a bitch.

145
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:00,332
Brush fires set off by the wreckage
are making the prospect of locating

146
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:04,770
possible survivors of Flight 221
even more improbable.

147
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:09,051
Debris from the jumbojet appears
to be spread over a wide area...

148
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,847
- Has Carl called yet?
- No, not yet.

149
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,322
- Let me know as soon as he does.
- OK.

150
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,768
It's 20 after one. Weren't the kids
supposed to be back by now?

151
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,845
They stopped to get pizza after the rally.

152
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,928
- Have you seen this?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,484
It's horrible.

154
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,406
Look... I'm sorry I walked away before.

155
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:53,724
What did Maureen Kingsley
say to you on the phone?

156
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:58,530
It's nothing serious.
I'm overreacting to everything right now.

157
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:04,762
Today's gonna be the second
most important day of my life.

158
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,009
And what would the first one be?

159
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:12,007
Well, I think you know.

160
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:14,243
Well, I still like to hear you say it.

161
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,044
All right.

162
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,001
The most important day of my life...

163
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,645
was when I hit the game-winning three
against DePaul at the Final Four.

164
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,928
You just lost my vote, Senator.

165
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,611
Good night. Don't let this get to you.

166
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,208
- Thanks, honey.
- Good night.

167
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:07,603
We already know about that.
We got another way around security.

168
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,813
No. I don't want an explanation,
I just want him in place. Hold on.

169
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:16,848
Gaines. Yeah,
I'm finishing up with him now.

170
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,527
- All right. Get back to me.
- Mm-hm.

171
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,843
Hey, Mandy.

172
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,163
- Is everything put together there?
- Yeah.

173
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,244
I'll get back to you.

174
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,847
- You want somethin' to drink?
- Nuh-uh.

175
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,926
So, they'll be ready to go
by the time you get there. Leave now.

176
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,724
It's all there.

177
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,643
- What are you doing this summer?
- Not interested.

178
00:17:54,733 --> 00:18:00,410
- You haven't even heard what I have to offer.
- I don't care. I'm gonna disappear for a while.

179
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,648
So, when do I get the ID?

180
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:09,924
Soon.

181
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,648
- Myers.
- Nina, it's Jack.

182
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,531
- Is this a secure line?
- No. You want me to transfer it?

183
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,604
No time. I need an entry code.

184
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:32,049
- Entry code? Where are you?
- I had to take care of somethin'.

185
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:36,684
- Why didn't you check out with me?
- Nina, just give me the entry code, OK?

186
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:39,606
I'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza, north garage.

187
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,330
Dunlop. Got it.

188
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,563
9-1-3-6-7-star.

189
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,244
- I'm in.
- Jack...

190
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,925
Jack?

191
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,368
- Richard, you OK?
- I'm fine.

192
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,447
- You said there were two shooters?
- At least.

193
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,252
- They look like they were ours?
- I couldn't tell.

194
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,643
- How high does this conspiracy go?
- I don't know yet, Jack.

195
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,372
- Did you see anyone downstairs?
- No one.

196
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,489
- Is this the only way out?
- This is it.

197
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,165
OK.

198
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:05,571
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no. Come here.

199
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:08,364
Come here.

200
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,405
Wow.

201
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,561
You look just like Martin Belkin.

202
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:21,123
How'd they do that?

203
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,204
Plastic surgery.

204
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,884
That's amazing.

205
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:29,891
So, you're gonna kill David Palmer, huh?

206
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,841
- Hey, where's Jack?
- I don't know.

207
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,648
- I thought you were on the phone with him.
- No, that was Division.

208
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,086
Really?

209
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:47,802
This is a military organisation. There's
a chain of command. I'm your superior.

210
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:51,568
I tell you what I want
and you don't question it. Got it?

211
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:54,850
- All right. I can accept that.
- Good.

212
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:58,164
- There's somethin' you gotta deal with too.
- Yeah, what?

213
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:00,892
You can boss me around all you want here,

214
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,567
but when you and I punch out,

215
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:06,292
we're somethin' else... OK?

216
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:10,412
OK, Tony.

217
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,282
OK.

218
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,963
OK, we're clear.
Give me your tie. I wanna fix this.

219
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:04,202
- I should've been more careful.
- They could've followed Baylor.

220
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:07,603
This was my fault. I set it up wrong.

221
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,604
We were sitting ducks.

222
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:18,445
- I'm sorry to put you through this, Jack.
- Don't you ever say that to me.

223
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:22,329
You of all people. I owe you my life.

224
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:29,452
Across the mezzanine there's a corridor
that leads to a service exit.

225
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:34,004
We're gonna take that straight to the street.
My car is right there. You OK?

226
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,808
Good. Let's get outta here.

227
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,004
Take the wall.

228
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,848
Jack!

229
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,647
We gotta find out who sent these guys.

230
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,564
I'm gonna go ID 'em.

231
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,606
Hey.

232
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,401
OK.

233
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,201
What the hell is this supposed to be?

234
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:52,684
Give him the ID.

235
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:59,287
It's OK. This is gonna work out better
for both of us. I figured it all out.

236
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:03,605
No, you don't figure anything out. This is
not your play. Now, where is the damn ID?

237
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:09,245
It is my play, since I'm the only one
who knows where "the damn ID" is.

238
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,084
Go ahead.

239
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:52,370
I didn't find anything useful in the back.

240
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:55,570
Work schedule. Look.
Dan: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.

241
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:59,362
- Great. Is there a contact number?
- No. And the office is locked.

242
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:03,332
- My husband might be able to help with this.
- How would he be able to do that?

243
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:07,008
- This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.
- He turned his cellphone off.

244
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:09,482
How would your husband be able to help us?

245
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:13,612
He works for the government. He has
access to those things. Hang on a second.

246
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:18,044
- CTU. Nina Myers.
- Hi. Nina, it's Teri Bauer.

247
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:22,092
- Is Jack there?
- Teri, Jack's not here.

248
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:24,971
He turned his phone off.
I wonder if you could help me.

249
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,566
Sure. What do you need?

250
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:30,692
I need the name and number of the owner
of a furniture store in the valley, Van Nuys.

251
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,650
Uh, Paladio's Furniture.

252
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:36,123
That's not really something I should do.
Can it wait till I talk to Jack?

253
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:41,606
No, not really. Um... Nina, it's Kim.
She took off with some kids I don't know.

254
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:45,242
One of the boys, Dan, works here.
I was hoping to contact the owner.

255
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:52,163
All right, give me a couple minutes. I'll see
what I can do. What's your cell number?

256
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,652
- Hey!
- Hey.

257
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:02,648
- There you are! You had quite a turnout.
- Oh, yeah, it was pretty insane.

258
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:06,248
I thought I heard the sound
of the young and the reckless generation.

259
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,369
- Dad, what are you doin' up?
- Hey, Dad.

260
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:09,647
- How you doin'?
- Good.

261
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:12,452
- Not enough hours in the day.
- How did it go?

262
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,842
Mom, it was huge.
I wish you could've been there.

263
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:19,006
- I wish I could've been there, too.
- I'm dead. I'll see you guys in the morning.

264
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:23,883
OK. Good night, sweetie. Get some good rest,
because they're gonna wake you up early.

265
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:26,726
- I will. Good night.
- I love you, honey.

266
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,973
- So, how was it?
- Aw, Dad, it was unbelievable.

267
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:35,204
The chancellor introduces me,
and I'm totally killin'.

268
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:40,048
And just as I'm finishin', Green Day starts
to play "Time of Your Life". It was huge!

269
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,124
Hold on.

270
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,568
- Carl.
- What's the problem?

271
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,929
- I got a call tonight from Maureen Kingsley.
- Yeah. So what?

272
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:54,289
- I don't wanna talk over the phone.
- OK, I'll come by in the morning.

273
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,365
No. We need to take care of this now.

274
00:30:58,053 --> 00:30:59,247
Fine.

275
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:05,563
It's hard to know with teenage girls
whether they're angry at you or just angry.

276
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,405
I know.

277
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:11,281
I did feel guilty, though,
when Jack and I separated.

278
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,364
Separated? I didn't know.

279
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,646
We're back together.

280
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:20,045
I admire that, tryin' to
work through the problems together.

281
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,921
My ex left and never looked back,
went home to Australia.

282
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:29,132
She hasn't spoken with Janet
or me for almost ten years.

283
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,208
I'm really sorry, Alan.

284
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:44,406
- Hello.
- Teri, I got it.

285
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:47,724
Oh, great. Um, hang on a second.
All right, go ahead.

286
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:50,122
555-2937.

287
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:53,728
Nina, that's great. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

288
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,804
OK. Bye.

289
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,528
Owner's name and phone number.

290
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,727
Please leave a message.

291
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:06,852
Is anybody home? Mr. Nowrasteh,
if you're there, please pick up.

292
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:10,130
My daughter is with one of the boys
who works at your store, Dan.

293
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:15,765
I need to talk to you. I'm in your store. Please
call me. My name is Teri and my number is...

294
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,641
Then he said "Tell your dad to reserve
the Lincoln bedroom for us when we tour. "

295
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,008
I bet he did.

296
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:25,722
Hello, Mrs. Palmer.
I'm Aaron Pierce, Secret Service.

297
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:31,169
- Is there a problem?
- I need to speak with the senator.

298
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:35,121
All right, I'll go get him for you.

299
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,485
David?

300
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,889
- Where is he, Patty?
- I don't know. I thought he was in there.

301
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:51,886
- Palmer has left. He is exposed. Find him.
- Would you tell me what's going on?

302
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:54,771
If he left in one of the vehicles,
it'll show up on our GPS.

303
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:59,688
- Would you tell me what's going on?
- We're adding another layer of security.

304
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,411
Why?

305
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:06,886
We have a very high confidence that there
will be an attempt on his life sometime today.

306
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:36,852
- You know who I think that was?
- I think it was the senator, wasn't it?

307
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:17,285
- Stay close, Richard!
- I'm right behind you.

308
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,528
I'm gonna get you outta here.

309
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,804
Jack.

310
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,523
Jack, listen to me.

311
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:40,453
Take this card and give it to Jamey.
Baylor said that we could trust her.

312
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:44,845
- Richard, don't move. You'll draw fire.
- Take the card. Give it to Jamey.

313
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,208
She'll match it to a computer.

314
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,490
Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent.

315
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:53,211
Richard!

316
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:01,250
Farrell.

317
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,563
- Jamey, it's me.
- What do you need?

318
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:06,645
Two agency personnel
were killed at 2350 Dunlop Plaza.

319
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:09,201
Phone Division and get
their bodies picked up.

320
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,523
- OK.
- That's not all.

321
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:14,605
You know the key cards we use
to get in and out of Division?

322
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:19,608
I've got one. I need you to pull some data off
of it. Do you have anything that can read it?

323
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,685
Yeah. But if you're in your car,
just send it to me now.

324
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,367
- How?
- Use your mobile scanner.

325
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:27,887
Switch it from optical to magnetic.

326
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:29,964
Hold on.

327
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:49,968
I'm sending this directly. Walsh said you can
trace the person whose computer encoded it.

328
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:53,728
- Yeah. I can match the electronic signature.
- Good. Do it.

329
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,202
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do to me?

330
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:13,204
Take you to the prom.

331
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,162
- Come on. Get out!
- It's gonna be OK.

332
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:21,041
Just tell her what you want her to do,
and then she'll do it.

333
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,484
I said get out!

334
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:39,603
It's time to call Mommy. You tell her that
you're OK, you're at a party, you're sorry,

335
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:42,765
- and you'll see her in a couple hours.
- Go to hell!

336
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:46,087
Gaines said not to hurt her, remember?

337
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,325
Yeah.

338
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,725
Fine.

339
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,972
Call your mom!

340
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,369
- Hello?
- Mom?

341
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:18,603
Kim, is that you?

342
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:20,684
- Hello?
- Mom...

343
00:38:21,213 --> 00:38:23,773
- Honey, where are you?
- I'm at a party.

344
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:26,162
- What?
- I'm at a party.

345
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:30,049
- With Janet York, right?
- Yeah. How did you know that?

346
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:34,763
I'm standing here with her dad. Do you have
any idea how worried we were about you?

347
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:38,243
- Can I talk to Janet?
- Honey, Janet's dad wants to talk to her.

348
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,405
- She went for a walk. I'll tell her to call.
- She went for a walk.

349
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:45,884
Listen, we're OK
and I'm really sorry I did this. I mean it.

350
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,248
I'll be home as soon as I can get a ride.

351
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:52,121
You're not waiting for a ride.
We'll come pick you up. Where are you?

352
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:55,808
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Kim?

353
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:59,408
Kim, honey, this is not the night
you wanna shine me on, I promise you.

354
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,926
- I gotta go.
- Kim!

355
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:03,243
Mom, I love you.

356
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,004
"I love you. "

357
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:12,004
Nice touch. In the van.

358
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,687
- What happened?
- I can't believe it.

359
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:19,488
She's at this party, she said
she was sorry and she'd be back.

360
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:21,723
- What about Janet?
- She's fine.

361
00:39:25,893 --> 00:39:27,884
What's wrong?

362
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,404
She said "I love you".

363
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:33,602
She never says that.

364
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:43,248
I got a match on the card.
Do you need a confidence on this?

365
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,722
Yes. My eyes only. Send it.

366
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,208
- Thanks, Jamey.
- You got it.
