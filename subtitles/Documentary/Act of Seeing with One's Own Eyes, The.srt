3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Your wish will not come true .

Why do you say things that do not make sense?

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,430
There is nothing like it.

8
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:13,428
That's right. This is so well known to students of other schools came to the school.

9
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:19,428
What? although I was ghosts, scary remains scary

10
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:24,514
's always talk that does not make sense!

11
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,571
I better go tomorrow and pray a desire...

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,257
So I do not need to listen to the mouth again.

13
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:34,342
Wow. it would have been terrible.

14
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,914
If there are the same person's face with you.

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,730
You do this ..!

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,142
Everything you prepare lessons for school tomorrow

17
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,657
And return quickly. so it does not interfere with our work.

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Ajussi, I may to school too right?

19
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,180

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,590
No problem! I will not go!

21
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,000

Do not you sense the energy?

26
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,630
It's like the phone and you feel like you're in charge.

27
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,560
They say the cost of going to school is about 5 million won.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,870
And if you add the cost for special classes and dormitories
This all totals 16 million won.

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,630
What? 16 million won?

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,880
This is not a university, right?

31
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,070
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,250
What are they doing there?

33
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,010

Let's go.

39
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,800
You know the rumors?
That said there are ghosts wandering around the school?

40
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,620

Why are you doing this?

45
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,830
You? You are spreading rumors that!

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Think you are smart enough to protect you and your parents ..

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,900
Hey, hey. someone came.

54
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Unnie is a police officer, can you tell me ..

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,020
Relax .

56
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,110
No nothing. We were just chatting.

57
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,450
Well if any of the front catch criminals.

58
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,720
Grab arm can you take with ..

59
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,570

Detectives are trying to teach ..

64
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,250

66
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,650

He died, how can we hear his voice?

70
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,560
And this is a song that is requested by Kang Nayi.

71
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,430
Hey, hey, hey, calm quiet.

72
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,150

Everyone says they also hear music at night last week ..

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,990
not that the songs are often played JaHee at lunch.

82
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,970
So JaHee, who did this ..?

83
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,910
Radio room was not locked after the incident?

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,380
Hey, it's a ghost!

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,580
Ghosts what?

86
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,420
Let's all get in kemobil fast.

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,190
Fortunately, the other just a little galling,
keliatannya nothing severe.

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,370
How do you care for school children?

89
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, ma'am.

90
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,570
If you did not catch the person who did this to SeulGi.

91
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,580
You'll face the consequences.

92
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,170
Yes, do not worry.

93
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,480
Whatever happens I will be responsible.

94
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,090

95
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,860

SMS?

98
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,020
What are you talking about? of JaHee?

99
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,660
JaHee.? Who JaHee?

100
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,410
A friend ..

101
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,080
The month ago .. died falling down the stairs.

102
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,710
I want to tell you something.

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,620
Coming now to the staircase made of stone.

104
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,010
I went to the stairs in my spare time.

105
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,950
But after that, I can not remember anything.

106
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,310
Silence!

107
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,120
Who's driving that stupid and cruel?

108
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,460
What are you've heard all you need?

109
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,430
Why are you sitting here so glum?

110
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,520
Do not worry.

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,890
What? you pout because I'm not taking you to school?

112
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,830
What? I do not sit here and pout.

113
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,010
Detective. Ha.

114
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,510
How the students?

115
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,880
Fortunately, no injuries were severe.

116
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,980
But there is something odd in retrospect of the incident.

117
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,190
What?

118
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,020
A month ago there was a similar incident.

119
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,950
And student named Kang JaHee died.

120
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,420
So?

121
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,560
Incident that happened when we came in which a student was injured.

122
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,130
If we do not do anything,
opportunity for other attacks ..

123
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,400
Police Ha!

124
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,810
Do not live so boring.

125
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,740
I'll do it. You do not have to intervene.

126
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,420
Ja Kang Hee? Why did he suddenly asked?

127
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,890
I want to know the relationship of events yesterday

128
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,410
incident has been classified as an accident.

129
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,220
's Student SAT test was on the horizon.

130
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,530
So I want you to not make them anxious.

131
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,200
I have to go because there is work that I can not snooze.

132
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,270
I do not want to talk about a painful death.

133
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,290
But the students had a lot of problems.

134
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,070
Problem?

135
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,290
Yes. At the beginning of the school year is very good value and he is an example of exemplary

136
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,500
good for other students.

137
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,430
But slowly he ibergabung with other kids weird

138
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,900
and started to become chaotic.

139
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,570
Hyun Ji. Let me merekammu,

140
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,010
Do not. go there.

141
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,270
Friends. I can record you for a minute?

142
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,590
Many times he asked students to interview
laindan moral harassing them all.

143
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,840
Cheers!

144
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,350
Ah .. this spill

145
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,000
Children's. what did you do in school?

146
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,620
Out!

147
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,000
He persuaded a naive girl to drink with him

148
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,742
in class and often unnoticed by me.

149
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,270
Is there violence or peloncoan between pupils?

150
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,110
There is nothing like it. we set mutid students.

151
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,410
So that could be a good school  here

152
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,190
What cop Ha go to school again?

153
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,780
What happened to the chairman to go look for it?

154
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,790
Only worry to your partner alone.

155
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,850
There are many cases to be resolved.
And he was busy doing something useless.

156
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,520
Wait, I heard Detective Ha exposed some cases

157
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,190
When he was in high school and investigated by the police.

158
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,660
It why?

159
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,860
Where the reseh it go?

160
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,850
I'm a cop. calm.

161
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,150
Ajussi. My friend is in danger.

162
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,190
For me .. what should I do?

163
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,220
Search friend .. please!

164
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,690
Do not worry

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,740
Ahjussi. The school children who died. what happened?

166
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,510
Do not talk to me.

167
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,020
I'm just curious why he died at a very young age.

168
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,850
Wondered who hate it.

169
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,790
We still do not know.

170
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,830
I ask you to take me

171
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
I really want to go

172
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,860
Anyway ..

173
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,810
why do you want to go to school?

174
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,130
Maybe if I go to school, I'll remember.

175
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,510
When I watch TV how a student commit suicide

176
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,800
I really want to talk with them.

177
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,560
I mean I'm not the type pembully or so.

178
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,950
Probably a bad lesson,

179
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,990
I have no problem in learning with my brilliant pikirian.

180
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,090
Stop!

181
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,760
I wonder why I'm dead? What happened to me?

182
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,590
I said stop it!

183
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,000
Do you want me to worry about you anymore?

184
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,600
Who asked you worried about? I just...

185
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,260
I do not want to bother you, just ignore me. understand?

186
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Do not sympathetic.

187
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,910
Police returned.

188
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,750
I think there is something going on

189
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,090
Did I tell you? JaaHee that someone pushed him to death ..

190
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,470
So JaHee become a ghost and want revenge.

191
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,430
Hey.

192
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,200
It does not make sense

193
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,500
boy, let me ask you something.

194
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,000
You know JaHee close to anyone?

195
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,940
Huh? JaHee?

196
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,780
SeulGi, MiHee, and HyunJae. They are always together.

197
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,910
True. they told me they made a movie
documentation and always talk together.

198
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,220
After JaaHee died, they act like
no nothing.

199
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,520
True, but they are the type that do not fit together

200
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,990
What do you mean?

201
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,660
Kang and Lee Hyun Jae Jahee sign up here for a scholarship social programs.

202
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,130
This school is like that.

203
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,920
We often never eat with them

204
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,100
Can you tell me what happened between them?

205
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,570
I do not know for sure . but I heard the reason they split because of her mother MiHee

206
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,000
Just ask him.

207
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,460
JaHee The day of the dead,
do you know what happened?

208
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,600
I do not know. I'm not feeling well.

209
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,600
So I came home early.

210
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,230
I know.

211
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,680
I hear you're close to them. So what happened yesterday?

212
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,990
There is something badly of you?

213
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,280
Other kids say you record something.

214
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,160
Initially, we made a documentary together.

215
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,300
We want to make something before graduation.

216
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,310
Yes, What is the dream of Hong Jang Hyun?

217
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
I want to be a psychology advisor.

218
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,640
I want to help the pain in my abilities.

219
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,350
Cut ~

220
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,450
Good!

221
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,110
I'm really good to be a reporter.

222
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,950
're Still stutter.

223
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,990
What is this?

224
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,720
That's good, that's good.

225
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,390
is in store we can get 1 winner at film festivals.

226
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,890
Course.

227
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,350
We're really pleased.

228
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,370
It was the first time I could feel so good
with anyone from this school.

229
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,010
Before that happens ..

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,540
Stop it!

231
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,590
I do not understand.

232
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,050
We are not doing anything wrong,

233
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,440
but suddenly he stopped us.

234
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,590
After that day, parents and SeulGi MiHee come.

235
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,060
To school and become a big problem.

236
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,460
Saying we create something strange and disturbing our lesson.

237
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,130
Omma, what are you doing?

238
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,330
And where do you think you're acting like you did?

239
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,000
You make our children go to school with the children of poor and ..

240
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
orphan like this and things like this happen.

241
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,240
Finally JaHee blamed for everything

242
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,810
And this group dissolved.

243
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,480
Then why you all away from each other?

244
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,790
No. .. Not like that.

245
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,370
Ginger says he's fine.

246
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,610
Because that JaHee.

247
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,540
Always concerned with others than himself.

248
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,870
Like a fool.

249
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,570
I have to go. I have to go to class.

250
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,020
It.

251
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,470
Notes JaHee Kang calls and SMS in the accident.

252
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,020
But why all the sudden.

253
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,530
What do you think?

254
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,350
After the lesson, meet me on the stairs with a stone floor.

255
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,540
That means someone could have been there with him.

256
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,990
<i>-Founder of assistant-
I need to talk to you, meet me on the stairs with a stone floor. </ I>

257
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,570
Assistant head.

258
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,880
Assistant head.

259
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,550
<i> Hello, this is your DJ, Kang JaHee. </ I>

260
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,350
<i> 30 October, too late at night studying hard untu is right. </ I>

261
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,950
What is this?
<i> 30 October, too late at night to study hard is not it. </ I>

262
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,950
<i> 30 October, too late at night studying hard untu is right. </ I>

263
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,990
<i> Let me plays music that will make you comfortable. </ i>

264
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,650
Who is playing this play?
<i> Let me play the music that will make you comfortable. </ I>

265
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,990
<i> Let me play the music that will make you comfortable. </ I>

266
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,460
Assistant head.

267
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,070
Yes. The investigators krimilnsl.

268
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,171
What?

269
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:41,257
Again?

270
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,950
Yes, I understand.

271
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,880
What is it?

272
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,820
From SMA female Hakll.

273
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,020
There are other accidents.

274
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,960
This time, head teachers were injured.

275
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,990
What did I say? I say it was a real ghost story!

276
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,300
Calm down .. and do you still
speed-yourself detective?

277
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,390
I do not know what the ghost is doing.
Do not talk like that.

278
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,860
Ghosts might not like him because he's useless.

279
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,000
Everything, be unattractive.

280
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,780
This should be reported to the department of children ..

281
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,220
-Chairman, I do not feel this was a simple accident.

282
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
Then what is this?

283
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,790
Did you say this act of real ghost or what?

284
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,560
A month ago, a student named Kang ginger

285
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,500
He was moved by the school but before he fell off a ladder and died.

286
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,430
But I think he does not stumble but ..

287
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,730
More precisely pushed and killed.

288
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,514
Do you have proof?

289
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:48,228
Do you have any evidence that the student killed?

290
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,380
-It-chairman ..

291
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,290
That day, of course she's with somebody

292
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,860
Chances are no witnesses,

293
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,430
but the school does not want to talk about it.
Plasticity is quite clear to me.

294
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,460
What say the child was hiding something?

295
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,870
So, what will you do next?

296
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,540
We need to find people who play as a ghost.

297
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,430
I think someone who knows what happened that night,

298
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,080
start this rumor was the work of a ghost and play that role.

299
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,950
Do you feel something is not it?
Justify?

300
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,620
Why do not you trust your own feelings alone.

301
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,900
Okay, you two soon settle this case

302
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,940
You too! Went to school with them tomorrow
and investigate around.

303
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,810
You said no nothing and should be reported to the department of child
.

304
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,270
Shut up!

305
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,430
I also parents with children age was

306
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,720
Or if you're not comfortable with this.

307
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,310
You can resolve such cases Cheo Yong Yun did.

308
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,860
Aihh .. not that it.

309
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,660
True true ..

310
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,680
I tell him to find a report of a female student
Immun-Dong 3 years ago

311
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,450
Where detective Yu Go?

312
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,120
Incidence of female students who disappeared?

313
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,960
Maybe ..

314
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,400
Bingo!

315
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,380
I believe that my case died here.

316
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,930
What are you looking for? let's go

317
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,220
You go ahead.
I have some interesting

318
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,390
What is it?

319
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,670
This document lists all new students
Hakll school girls from yesterday until this year.

320
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,280
If you look at it. This all new students who registered from social scholarship.

321
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,680
Ah I know. so why would they leave a great school
like this and choose to move?

322
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,160
So what's wrong with that?

323
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,190
Although Kang JaHee this dead under the auspices ..

324
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,020
social scholarship program and he's moved?

325
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,060
All pupils  still a little vague on the subject vague

326
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,740
There is something there.

327
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,100
There's a secret in school.

328
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,760
What do you mean people who play the role of a ghost could be Joan of arc?

334
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,980

336

You are reporting this yesterday right?

358

Yes.

359
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,210
I hear the music anymore so I came and

360
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,780
I heard no screams so I came here.

361
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,720
And the principal existing floor.

362

I'm here to work. To meet a student.

377
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,320
Ah, you had to call the police.

378
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,150
I heard the story.

379
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,990
I am a teacher here.

380
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,820

389
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,420
You do not need this?

390
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm fine.

391
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,390
But .. how long am I here?

392

00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,010
Yeah, maybe so.

397
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,028
I mean how can you be a cop?
You look so great now.

398
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,000

Huh?

403
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,430
Do you want to zero in your test?

404
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,140
Sun Woo. heart mark.

405
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,610
Stand!

406
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,914
Later after tests come on partying. let's play hot and wild.

Read it until it runs out!

409
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,900
Come buy a lot of beer that you like.

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,020
Like this.

416
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,830
Smile!

417
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,660
Did you photograph?

418
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,130
I think I closed my eyes.

419
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,600
Wait.

420
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,800
This is it!

421
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,740
Wait a minute let me photograph so.

422
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,950
Sun Woo.

423
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,960
Why is it so hard when I moved in there?

424
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,830
I do not want to remember that school anymore.

425
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,810
All right, shut up!

426
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,942
Field trip this time we decided to parts of Europe and Kyung Ju

427
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:11,600
Dae tub.

428
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,485
Kyung Ju would like galandangan. really disgusting.

429
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:18,800
That's good. I'm afraid that there is no money,

430
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,457
will whine to us to ask.

431
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,400
This is disturbing.

432
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,890
Can we get rid of them?

433
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,770
Silence! we decided after discussion later. so as you say.

434
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,840
Aigoo. they act rude.

435
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,660
What good is a great school.

436
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,600
If his judgment is another.

437
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,630
Do not heartless.
He ​​walked away when he saw it.

438
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,670
That's it. Other students who can get out and bother us.

439
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,440
We're out. So they could with rich children.

440
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,480
We were never a student's school.

441
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,620
Just a great system that is needed.

442
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,600
I had a woman tell police everything.

443
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,440
So why do you ..

444
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,180
I'm here to make something.

445
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,860
In the JaHee dead. What do you do when you meet?

446
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,450
What?

447
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,440
I hear you all going to meet,

448
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,160
All deny. Kadi was possible that something happened.

449
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,930
You fight?

450
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,990
Not like that.

451
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,020
Tell me what happened.

452
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,600
If there is no incident ..

453
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,200
Okay, SeulGi park. What are your dreams?

454
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,880
Do not record, I do not wear face makeup

455
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,690
What are you doing here?

456
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,620
Only child of a wealthy family who may enter.

457
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,460
Pose for me.

458
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,600
Get rid of the camera. I do not want to be recorded,

459
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,270
What do you hide here?

460
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,830
Go to your class!

461
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,400
Get out of here now.

462
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,420
I found it. Fortunately
.

463
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,000
Let the record. who is going to be recorded first?

464
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,500
I warn you, if you hang around with the camera once again
,

465
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,020
I will confiscate it.

466
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,914
What? Teachers, you can not. The only thing we were.

467
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,142
Here you go!

468
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:36,171
Give it to me. fast! I've said many times if you ..

469
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,200
Stop it!

470
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,571
Why we should not record? Recording is not a bad thing!

471
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,971
You pathetic fool.

472
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,630
You can be a bad score. understand?

473
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,780
What's up with him?

474
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,730
I mean why a teacher like that?

475
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,670
What are they doing to us?

476
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,920
Simply . This stop up here.

477
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,020
Bagimana can you say that?

478
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,270
What we are going to do something?

479
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,470
There is nothing we can do.

480
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
We have to be quiet while.

481
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,510
This is annoying!

482
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,440
Enough! I'm dizzy with it all. Let's have a beer.

483
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,180
Why beer?

484
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,940
What is your mood? You act like nothing ever drink beer just before.

485
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,150
Why do not act well and wisely?

486
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,080
We should not eliminate stress?

487
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,180
CHEERS!

488
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,390
Ah, this is almost spilled.

489
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,690
This beer tastes.

490
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,630
Okay okay. Let's toast again.

491
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,560

497
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,080
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,260
Omma, what are you doing?

499
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,720
And where do you guys think of doing it

500
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,560
Mistress, calm down.

501
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,130
Calm? You made my son like this

502
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,600
And you want me to calm down?

503
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,000
You make our children go to school with substandard
orphans like this. and things like this happen.

504
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,830
Do you know how much we pay for this school

505
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,340
For scholarship money?

506
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,850
Think wisely what you do

507
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:55,650
After that, school JaHee
rumored move to another school.

508
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,200
But the incident was just an excuse.

509
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,530
JaHee registered to the social care program

510
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,210
So it was not the reason he was expelled.

511
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,310
It?

512
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,780
I just wanted to finish this before before moving on.

513
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,710
We record it.

514
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,920
So we have to finish this before I go.

515
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,620
Are you okay?
I'm sorry JaHee,

516
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,930
What do you mean? I'm fine.

517
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,230
What, for I moved we could not see each other again?

518
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,000
What are you going to go?

519
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,010
If I move. may be quiet.

520
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,320
Do you want to talk?

521
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,750
SeulGi, look at this!

522
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,620
What is this?

523
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,780
What are you doing with my son?

524
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,590
What are you doing, let the people here?

525
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,800
I of the Criminal Investigation and I need to investigate anything.

526
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,360
I've answered all the question proposed school.

527
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,670
I think what you're doing to the sick child.

528
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,060
Soon completed. So please partnership.

529
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,740
Caiklah, tell me. Where's the tape?

530
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,680
I told you not to say anything that is not useful.

531
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,080
See, after that night, she could not sleep because of restless

532
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,920
Do you know how hard it is for him?

533
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,490
He also attacked.

534
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,650
If you're here because the principal incident.

535
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,700
Security schools have already made a statement to the investigation department.

536
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,280
Ah yes. The day of the accident JaHee.

537
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,310
They say you found her first?

538
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,880
119  You call yourself?

539
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,010
Fortunately, I passed the time there was

540
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,120
If there are students who see it,

541
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,690
they will be a great shock.

542
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,990
I passed through the parking lot when there is something odd

543
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,980
So I get there.

544
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,670
So I reported to the paramedics immediately.

545
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,240
119? there are people here ..

546
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,010
There is a suspicious person around or there is something strange going on?

547
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,840
None.

548
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
Wait a minute.

549
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,830
You Mi Hee Han, right?

550
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,670
Yeah, so?

551
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,340
I want to ask you a few things about the accident yesterday.

552
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,640
Do you tell me who pushed her?

553
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,210
No, that's not what I mean.

554
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,410
I do not know who pushed SeulGi.

555
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,980
Danckematian Jahee death was an accident.

556
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,280
I've been told I did not meet that night JaHee Kang

557
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,220
If you do not believe me, ask the school about my statement.

558
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,360
I did not say anything. why still think I accused you?

559
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,290
I just do not want to lose my time studying,

560
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,130
Understand?

561
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,640
So you're going to tell him?

562
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,280
Caution!

563
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,480
What are you going to behave hypocritically until the end?

564
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,800
Do you know what happens to us if we report it huh?

565
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,571
You're strong behind your parents' backs, so it's fine for you.

566
00:43:48,914 --> 00:43:51,257
It's true!

567
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,485
Everyone is afraid to family

568
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:55,657
keliatannya  So you want to be queen here as well.

569
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:56,628
You're done?

570
00:43:56,971 --> 00:44:00,285
You think I do not know why you're acting like this?

571
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:04,500
Simply  friends. Let's just forget it okay?

572
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,490
What is a transfer student to say?

573
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,890
As expected school students accelerate removals.

574
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,930
But, why did you call me here?

575
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,500
We can end this ghost game.

576
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,700
If correct your misconception.

577
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,900
There is something that will happen this prophecy.

578
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,000
What?

579
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,670
Enough already we mess around. They began to groggily

580
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,080
mean .. You know who did it?

581
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,550
Who?

582
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,580

583
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:58,460
Ah yes. It was not a big deal.
Please do not worry.

584
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,470
Yes ma'am. it's late.
Why are you calling?

585
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,770
Ah... it was not a big deal.

586
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:17,485
Do not worry and please set the date to enter your son.

587
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,257
We will open the space for him later.

588
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:22,400
Yes, yes. Bye.

589
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,450
What time is it?

590
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,550
Ready  <i>-prepared,
your ugly secrets will be uncovered! = </ I>

591
00:45:30,285 --> 00:45:31,371
Who is playing this play?

592
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,670
Who are you?

593
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,440
Do you think I believe in ghosts?
What are you doing?

594
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,680
Help me, help me!

595
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,430
You.
You're supposed to be in the hospital, why?

596
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,570
Off me.

597
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,770
He's the reason why JaHee died.

598
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,400
This JaaHee you are recording sound right?

599
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:07,770
This DJ Hakll your school, Kang JaHee, say hello once again

600
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:10,571

603
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:27,028
8 Hours 9 o'clock last night and tonight. Photos of Park SeulGi suspicious out of the hospital wearing full protective clothing.

604
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,200
And we found the fishing twine under the mattress.

605
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,780
Good job.

606
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,780
Tell me, why are you doing this?

607
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
It?

608
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,780
I just wanted to finish this before I moved.

609
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,780
We recorded it, so we had to finish it before I go

610
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,780
Are you okay?

611
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
I'm sorry JaHee.

612
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,780
What do you mean I'm okay?

613
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,780
What for I moved we could not see each other again?

614
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,010
Do you have to go?

615
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,780
If I moved, maybe I'll calm down.

616
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
Do you want to talk?

617
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,880
SeoulGi, let you see it!

618
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,780
What is this?

619
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,780
A student in gym class say nothing of stealing money from the locker?

620
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,780
What is this?

621
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:43,780
I heard you were sick and stayed in class during gym hours.

622
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,800
That's not me. Another child who started the rumor accusing me.

623
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,800
I've said to the teacher.

624
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,942
Is not I do not trust you. but according to the school rules we have to move you

625
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:00,450
Please believe me.
It was not me!

626
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Relax, this can be passed smoothly.

627
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,457
What are you doing?

628
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,085
Can not you hear? YeonJoo be moved?

629
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,371
Why are you thinking about it? with this, the rich students go to school here.

630
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,030
What can students who asked not to be moved?

631
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,530
If you did not hear me,

632
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,485
There is something that could happen to you.

633
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,857
Understand?

634
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:54,760
So just listen to me!

635
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,657
Stop!
It's enough!

636
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,857
So what should we do?

637
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:16,600
I'm going to report this.

638
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,171
This is criminal.

639
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:20,860
You can not. Are you crazy?

640
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:27,860
Think again. It is not our business
do not make trouble.

641
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,730
What do you mean do not create a problem? Is not there a bigger problem than this?

642
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,470
It's true!

643
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
There is no way other than to report it.

644
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,090
You will move another school tomorrow.

645
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,500
But what about us?
What will happen to us next?

646
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,790
True.
Let stand just as we do not know, okay?

647
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,900
True guys...

648
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:52,990
Be careful before thinking, who is going to hurt because you.

649
00:50:58,914 --> 00:51:00,000
But ..

650
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,580
JaHee, he does not want to tell me and it changed all of a sudden.

651
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,180
Changed? why?

652
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,380
I really do not know.

653
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,480
I do not know what happened to him.

654
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,700
What? Let him alone?

655
00:51:18,228 --> 00:51:19,350
Why so suddenly?

656
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,020
I think .. it's better.

657
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,060
What is the reason?

658
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:31,000
What MiHee say something?

659
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,200
Why are you like this?

660
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,485
Is it me?

661
00:51:42,285 --> 00:51:44,800
Do you think I'm going to hurt?

662
00:51:44,857 --> 00:51:47,270
I'll be fine. If this is allowed, you may not be transferred.

663
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,710
Give me the tape.

664
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,028
Seulgi.

665
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:57,371
Do not ask me why but
perminyaanku can you follow?

666
00:51:58,857 --> 00:52:00,914
You, outrageous.

667
00:52:01,028 --> 00:52:05,771
Kang JaHee I do not like this you're not a coward.

668
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:07,600
You're going to report it?

669
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:08,857
Caution!

670
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:10,742
Do you want to act a fool till the end?

671
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:14,171
Do you know what will happen to us if we can be a lot of trouble.

672
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:17,885
Well, you're strong behind your parents' backs so you can be safe.

673
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:18,514
What?

674
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:24,570
Everyone is afraid of your family so you think you can be a queen
here.

675
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:25,600
You're done?

676
00:52:25,828 --> 00:52:30,171
You think I do not know why you're acting like this?

677
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,371
Okay. I bribe to get in this school, so what?

678
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:42,000
Honestly, who would want to leave this school?

679
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:43,485
Give me that!

680
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:44,914
Give!

681
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,885
What are you doing? release!

682
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,457
Choi Hyun Jae, what are you doing, help me!

683
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,028
I'm afraid, as did the others.

684
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:18,628
If the truth came, we thought we were all punished as a murderer.

685
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:24,570
He said he would take care of everything.
So there is no problem.

686
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:27,142
And the tape?

687
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:32,857
I do not know, we all panic and we tried to look but not see
.

688
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,971
Why did not you tell someone?

689
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:41,771
There, I've said.

690
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:47,028
But, no one wants to listen.

691
00:53:47,314 --> 00:53:51,142
Just tell me to shut my mouth separately.

692
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,714
What is Hyun Jae?

693
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,514
What is it? Is she crazy?

694
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,857
HyunJae It was like, what if it falls?

695
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,800
What if he dies?

696
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:18,571
Hyun Jae wait!

697
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:23,028
Hyun Jae, go down and we talked.

698
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,600
DO NOT TELL ME  approaching!

699
00:54:28,857 --> 00:54:30,857
Hyun Jae!

700
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:35,428
Do Hyun Jae, please do!

701
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:38,057
SeulGi.

702
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:40,285
I'm sorry.

703
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:44,971
You're trying our best to JaHee but I...

704
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,571
Even then ..

705
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,828
What are you doing? I take care of it!

706
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:59,828
You guys, shut your mouth.

707
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,457
I killed JaHee, he died for me!

708
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,971
I'm afraid...

709
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,742
Everything should be reported,

710
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:18,457
Choi Hyun Jae.

711
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:28,914
You were caught drinking beer
you know how when you go out?

712
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:32,628
I'll take care of this problem.

713
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,085
Mother expect much.

714
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:44,680
You've worked hard to get in this school.

715
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:48,342
You're also right end of the semester?

716
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,514
It all depends if you listen

717
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,628
Get it?

718
00:56:10,342 --> 00:56:14,914
Why are you out of your room at night?

719
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:19,142
You .. do not tell.

720
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:20,514
JaHee ..

721
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,485
I have to tell everything later.

722
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,257
But I do not want to be moved.

723
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:38,685
I do not want to be separated from my friends!

724
00:56:38,914 --> 00:56:40,171
HyunJae.

725
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:45,714
I think if the tape disappears, everything will return to normal.

726
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,571
I'm sorry JaHee.

727
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:56,057
I'm so sorry.

728
00:56:56,742 --> 00:57:03,142
Yes, it was just an accident,
So do not be like that. right?

729
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,828

00:57:09,257 --> 00:57:12,457
Well, Park SeulGi what your dreams?

731
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:14,450
Do not record me, I do not use make-up.

732
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:17,314
Well, let's ask HyunJae

00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,142
Ayii. I could not do it.

736
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:25,200
Do you record without me?

737
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,600
MiHee, seems to want to stand out.

738
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:28,857
Do you want to go first?

739
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:31,714

776
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:06,057

JaHee real.

783
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,171
What?

784
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:14,628
Member-girls high school administrator arrested for soliciting bribes

785
01:01:14,857 --> 01:01:19,200
From the parents so students can bribe the school entrance.

786
01:01:19,485 --> 01:01:27,142
Members  board students also target some students
no reason to be moved so that they could open up opportunities for children who bribe.

787
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:34,228
Schools to utilize his advantage.

788
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,257
True True cheeky!

789
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:43,028
Aigoo. you solve the case why did not denganbaik

790
01:01:44,171 --> 01:01:45,028
Ha Sunwoo

791
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,314
I think you're just spending time,

792
01:01:49,828 --> 01:01:51,257
But it has entered into a major case.

793
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:53,085
Good job!

794
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:08,057
This is still lucky.

795
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,942
They could split the shared memory.

796
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:14,628
What I could have friends like them.

797
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,228
Do you think you could?

798
01:02:25,885 --> 01:02:26,685
Detective Ha.

799
01:02:30,571 --> 01:02:32,971
Is there something going on today?

800
01:02:33,942 --> 01:02:35,771
No, no.

801
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:42,971
Today. What you really forget?

802
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:46,971
What do you do without me?

803
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,714
You do not know why he's like that?

804
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,542
Today is the birthday of Detective Ha.

805
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:08,114
I do not want to tell you
but I had to do it.

806
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:11,942
Take her to a nice place,

807
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:15,314
And buy her something nice I think.
