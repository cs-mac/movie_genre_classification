{3346}{3426}- Thank you, Jason. On time.|- You bet!
{3463}{3559}Link. Link Appleyard!
{3575}{3649}- Miss Hallie.|- Hello, Marshal.
{3650}{3738}- Howdy, Mr.. Senator.|- No, no. Rance. Rance.
{3739}{3821}Rance. Sure glad you could come.
{3822}{3894}Your wire caught us in St Louis.|Thank you.
{3896}{4005}My buckboard's right over there.|Jason, give me that box.
{4006}{4051}You knew they were coming!
{4053}{4154}That's the first time you ever|kept a secret! Blabbermouth!
{4155}{4216}Was that anybody|worth a line in the paper?
{4218}{4325}A line? You blasted young fool,|that's Senator Stoddard and his wife.
{4326}{4400}You can fill your newspaper|with them!
{4485}{4556}Hi, Lydia. Charlie Hasbrouck.|Emergency!
{4557}{4664}Tell the office Senator Stoddard|and his wife just got here!
{4665}{4761}- That's right! Thanks!|- Hey, that's a nickel!
{4762}{4815}Charge the "Shinbone Star"!
{5111}{5191}Senator! Senator Stoddard, ma'am.
{5193}{5306}Could you give me an interview?|Exclusive-like. A scoop!
{5307}{5451}"Shinbone Star"...|Well, now, son... all right.
{5452}{5534}I'll give the interview,|but only for one reason.
{5535}{5584}One reason. Dutton Peabody, founder,
{5586}{5724}publisher, editor in chief|of the "Shinbone Star" once fired me.
{5726}{5804}I'll be fired|if I don't get this interview.
{5806}{5898}Is it true you're going to...|Here he comes now.
{5991}{6079}Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise|and an honour, sir!
{6081}{6163}- Maxwell Scott, editor.|- How do you do, Mr. Scott?
{6164}{6236}- This is Mrs. Stoddard.|- A pleasure, ma'am.
{6237}{6317}What brings you back to town, sir?|Is it true...?
{6318}{6369}Oh, no. Hold on, Mr. Scott.
{6370}{6472}Who am I giving this interview to,|you or this young fellow?
{6473}{6547}- Who asked first, by the way.|- I sure did.
{6548}{6673}If you're a good reporter invite|them in, out of the sun and dust.
{6675}{6761}He's right. To make a man talk,|make him comfortable.
{6763}{6864}It's back in business again.|Politics.
{6865}{6967}Link, why don't you take Hallie|for a little ride around town?
{6968}{7019}Lot of changes, huh?
{7021}{7118}I'll go with these fellows|and mend a few political fences.
{7320}{7402}I notice|you're not wearing the star.
{7403}{7539}Shucks, Miss Hallie. They haven't|elected me Town Marshal for ages.
{7540}{7684}The only one of us from the old days|still working steady is the senator.
{7736}{7903}Place has sure changed.|Churches, high school, shops.
{7940}{8084}Well, the railroad done that.|Desert's still the same.
{8175}{8300}- The cactus rose is in blossom.|- Maybe...
{8396}{8532}Maybe you' d like to take a ride out|desert way, and maybe look around.
{8596}{8645}Maybe.
{9575}{9647}You knew where I wanted to go,|didn't you?
{9649}{9760}Well, you said you wanted|to see the cactus blossoms.
{9761}{9839}There's his house down there,|what's left of it.
{9841}{9890}Blossoms all around it.
{9976}{10101}He never did finish that room|he started to build on, did he?
{10103}{10218}No...|Well, you know all about that.
{10364}{10415}There's a lovely one there.
{11396}{11515}Gentlemen, I promised myself|this trip I would not talk politics,
{11516}{11623}and look here,|that's about all I've been doing.
{11624}{11718}Surely you're going to Capitol City|and talk to the assembly?
{11719}{11785}Not this trip. It's purely personal.
{11786}{11880}Purely personal? That isn't good|enough for my readers.
{11881}{11955}Why did you come to Shinbone?|No mystery, is there?
{11957}{12122}No. No, there's no mystery.|I'm here to go to a funeral.
{12134}{12228}- Funeral?|- Who 's dead, sir?
{12230}{12351}- No, sir. I...|- A man by the name of Tom Doniphon.
{12388}{12517}There's my good wife. I'll...|I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen.
{12741}{12788}Tom Doniphon?
{13433}{13571}- Hello, Clute.|- Ransom Stoddard! And Miss Hallie!
{13572}{13697}Senator, I didn't think... Why didn't|you let me know they was coming?
{13699}{13766}I' d have had a real bang-up funeral.
{13767}{13849}Folks from all over everywhere|would have come.
{14304}{14427}The county's gonna bury him.|I won't make a nickel out of it.
{14997}{15042}Pompey?
{15387}{15510}- Miss Hallie.|- Pompey, I'm sorry.
{15843}{15898}Maybe you' d like to...
{16118}{16167}Where are his boots?
{16205}{16320}They was an awful nice pair of boots,|almost brand-new, and I thought...
{16321}{16424}Put his boots on, Clute,|and his gun belt and his spurs.
{16426}{16528}He didn't carry no handgun, Rance.|He didn't for years.
{16529}{16576}Yeah, sure.
{17284}{17430}Sir, I don't wish to intrude,|but a United States senator is news.
{17448}{17563}I'm the editor of a newspaper|with a statewide circulation.
{17565}{17614}I've got a responsibility to know
{17615}{17712}why you came all the way down here|to bury a man.
{17713}{17816}You can't say his name was|Tom Doniphon and leave it at that.
{17818}{17873}Who was Tom Doniphon?
{17874}{18006}He was a friend, Mr. Scott,|and we' d like to be left alone.
{18007}{18050}Scott, let's go.
{18052}{18173}I'm sorry. That's not enough.|I have a right to have the story.
{18469}{18536}Yes, I guess maybe you have.
{19006}{19078}This story not only concerns me.
{19089}{19179}Old Pompey in there, Link...|they were part of it.
{19181}{19269}But I suppose I'm the only one|who can tell it through.
{19271}{19380}I read of the old days in the paper's|files. There was no mention...
{19381}{19465}You're a young man! A young man.
{19466}{19535}You only know it|since the railroad came.
{19536}{19664}A lot different then. A lot different|before, Mr. Scott. A lot different.
{19665}{19759}First time I came to Shinbone,|I came by stagecoach.
{19761}{19816}A lot like that one right there.
{19960}{20108}Could be the same one.|Could be the same one.
{20152}{20234}"Overland"...?|Say, I think it is the same one!
{20236}{20283}Well, I declare.
{20336}{20391}Well, I declare.
{20392}{20497}I was just a youngster,|fresh out of law school,
{20498}{20646}bag full of law books and my|father's gold watch, $14.80 in cash.
{20677}{20815}I had taken|Horace Greeley's advice literally:
{20826}{20990}Go west, young man, go west,|and seek fame, fortune, adventure.
{21133}{21186}Stand and deliver!
{21595}{21650}Shotgun, shuck your shells.
{21776}{21854}Throw down the cash box. Now!
{21879}{21965}All right.|Get the passengers out of the coach.
{22610}{22709}Looks like slim pickings,|but lift their wallets anyway.
{22899}{23012}- I'll take that pin, too.|- No. My dead husband gave it to me.
{23013}{23093}- Please!|- A widow? I'll take it...
{23095}{23189}Take your hands off!|What kind of men are you?
{23191}{23240}This kind, dude.
{23339}{23411}Now, what kind of man are you, dude?
{23466}{23597}I am an attorney at law, and I'm|duly licensed by the territory.
{23598}{23690}You may have us now,|but I'll see you in jail for this!
{23691}{23734}Jail?
{23808}{23849}Stop it!
{23851}{23943}Get him out of here!|Get in that coach! Go on, move!
{23944}{24043}Get in there! You, too!|Come on, inside!
{24044}{24120}- He could die!|- We'll send him flowers!
{24149}{24194}Chico, cut the leaders!
{24572}{24615}Get going!
{24826}{24902}Put that in here|and get to your horses. Hurry!
{24903}{24958}A book?
{24976}{25021}Law?
{25526}{25579}Lawyer, huh?
{25656}{25767}I'll teach you law... Western law.
{25911}{26028}Let's get out of here.|Come on! Come on!
{27172}{27241}Hallie! Wake up, gal!
{27396}{27495}Tom Doniphon! 5:30am.|What's the matter with you?
{27496}{27576}We've got a man down here ambushed.|Ambushed!
{27577}{27644}Like to die|if we don't get care for him.
{27902}{27990}- It's the man from the hold up.|- That's right.
{28025}{28074}How did you know?
{28076}{28145}Stagecoach stopped by last night|to notify the marshal.
{28146}{28193}Link Appleyard?
{28194}{28290}Don't stand there gossiping.|Get him inside. Pompey!
{28291}{28390}Think you can make it, pilgrim?|Pick him up, Pompey.
{28766}{28815}Put him on the couch.
{29146}{29240}Tom, he's hurt real bad.
{29831}{29878}Thanks, Pompey.
{29961}{30122}Poor man. Beaten, whipped and kicked,|just for trying to protect a woman.
{30128}{30241}- How's that again?|- Stage driver told us all about it.
{30274}{30401}Well, Pompey, looks like|we got ourselves a ladies' man.
{30520}{30565}Hallie, we...
{30566}{30617}- Get some bandage.|- But...
{30618}{30675}I'll take care of him.
{30828}{30939}Pilgrim, you'll need|a couple of stitches.
{30941}{31048}Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby.|If he's sober, bring him back.
{31229}{31358}Nora, sorry to bust in on you|like this. He's in trouble.
{31359}{31466}- Such a beating.|- This is just simply terrible.
{31468}{31540}By golly,|I'm going to get the marshal.
{31541}{31641}You want coffee?|I make some breakfast. Hallie?
{31766}{31846}Take her easy there, pilgrim.
{31895}{31946}You all right?
{32474}{32573}Here we are. Drink this.
{32860}{32905}Is that coffee?
{32906}{33006}Yah, coffee, and aquavit.|Swedish brandy. Good for you.
{33007}{33074}No, I don't care for that.
{33097}{33173}Here, you must drink.|That make you feel better.
{33202}{33315}It ain't mannerly out west|to let a fellow drink by himself.
{33564}{33667}- All right if I smoke, ain't it?|- Sure. Go right ahead.
{34142}{34241}- Good. Now you will feel stronger.|- Thank you, ma'am.
{34278}{34406}Took my watch. My money's gone,|every cent I had in the world.
{34407}{34470}Don't fret about that, pilgrim.
{34471}{34571}You can eat here|until you get back on your feet.
{34572}{34666}- My credit's still good, Nora?|- Yah, Tom.
{34723}{34846}- Lie down. Please lie down.|- No. No, not now.
{34896}{34993}Not now.|I've got something to do.
{35034}{35101}Got something to do.
{35137}{35221}What did you say his name was?
{35223}{35309}The man with the silver-knobbed whip?
{35310}{35425}I said Liberty Valance,|but if that's what you got to do,
{35427}{35486}you better start packing a handgun.
{35513}{35572}A gun? I don't want a gun.
{35598}{35680}I don't want a gun.|I don't want to kill him.
{35696}{35743}I want to put him in jail.
{35802}{35919}I know those law books mean a lot|to you, but not out here.
{35921}{35997}Out here,|a man settles his own problems.
{36036}{36137}But do you know|what you're saying to me?
{36172}{36320}You're saying just exactly|what Liberty Valance said.
{36346}{36416}What kind of community|have I come to?
{36417}{36486}You all seem to know Liberty Valance.
{36487}{36575}He's a no-good, gun-packing,|murdering thief,
{36576}{36664}but the only advice you give me|is to carry a gun.
{36666}{36775}Well, I'm a lawyer!|Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law.
{36799}{36895}And the law is the only...
{36931}{37025}A little law and order around|Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone.
{37026}{37091}All right, Hallie.
{37220}{37325}Arrest this man! Arrest him!|Nobody seems to want...
{37327}{37442}Well.|Here comes Mr. Law and Order himself.
{37443}{37574}- He's hurt bad.|- What are you dragging me here for?
{37575}{37675}Ain't being up all night on account|of this hold up business...
{37700}{37765}- Who 's this?|- From the hold up.
{37766}{37860}- I knew I shouldn't come over.|- Wait a minute, Marshal.
{37897}{38012}Tom, if he's got a formal complaint|to make, he should make it to me.
{38013}{38111}He just wants you|to put Liberty Valance in jail.
{38144}{38259}Liberty Valance? Do you think|I'm crazy? Tom, let me out of here.
{38260}{38363}Hallie thinks he's right.|You' d better listen. He's a lawyer.
{38365}{38436}Somebody better listen to somebody|about him!
{38487}{38567}Mamma, Liberty Valance|rides into town...
{38568}{38689}If he behaves himself in this town,|I ain't got no...
{38690}{38737}Jurisdiction.
{38739}{38811}What he said.|I ain't got none of it.
{38813}{38877}You all know|I'm only the town marshal.
{38878}{38979}What Liberty does out on the|road ain't no business of mine.
{38980}{39039}Ain't that right, Mr. Lawyer?
{39112}{39210}Technically, I suppose|it is a territorial offence.
{39211}{39314}- You mean I'm right?|- Yes, Marshal, you're right.
{39315}{39443}I knew it! I knew we' d be friends|the minute I stepped in here.
{39444}{39551}You folks all know that,|well, the jail's only got one cell,
{39552}{39626}and the lock's broke,|and I sleep in it.
{39628}{39722}I should have known nothing would|happen when you came in here.
{39724}{39796}Now get out,|you big old fat water buffalo!
{39798}{39888}- We got work to do!|- Hallie, I ain't ate yet.
{39889}{40024}I could sure use a snack|of six or seven of those hen's egg
{40025}{40142}and maybe a side order of bacon,|and is that flapjack batter?
{40143}{40252}On the cuff. Sit down.|Papa, get your pants on!
{40253}{40321}Get out of the way! Sit down!
{40451}{40558}You know, you look mighty pretty|when you get mad.
{40591}{40688}Like I say, you can eat here|till you get back on your feet.
{40689}{40837}- May I have your name?|- Doniphon. Tom Doniphon.
{40877}{40996}Forget what I said about buying|a gun. You're a tenderfoot.
{41008}{41148}Liberty Valance is the toughest man|south of the Picketwire, next to me.
{43350}{43463}- Mr. Peabody!|- Evening, Marshal.
{43701}{43798}Did you know that Liberty Valance|is in town tonight?
{43799}{43866}I' d be a poor newspaperman indeed
{43867}{43941}if I didn't know|what everybody else knows.
{43942}{44026}I don't know what to do,|Mr. Peabody, I swear.
{44027}{44099}Do what you're paid to. Run him out!
{44101}{44146}Run him out... Liberty Val...me?
{44148}{44226}- My advice to you as...|- Coroner.
{44227}{44327}- And your personal pos...|- Physician!
{44328}{44429}Is to get supper and go to bed.|No charge.
{44454}{44542}Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.
{44753}{44845}Hallie, my love, where are you?|I await you, my dear.
{44847}{44918}Good evening.|Saturday night, Mr. Peabody.
{44919}{45013}Better order early before those|drunks come from across the street.
{45014}{45150}Hallie, please. The proprieties|concerning the cutlery.
{45152}{45203}How many times have I told you,
{45205}{45293}the fork goes to the left|of the plate, the knife goes...
{45295}{45410}You superstitious or something?|What are you having to eat?
{45426}{45471}The usual.
{45473}{45576}Steak, beans, potatoes|and deep-dish apple pie.
{45578}{45716}- Three steaks with a lot of black.|- All right.
{45718}{45810}- Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.|- All right, Kaintuck!
{45812}{45888}Three steaks,|burnt black for the Lazy "J" boys.
{45889}{45973}Heavy on the beans.|Usual for Mr. Peabody with fixings.
{45975}{46102}- Steak, beans, potatoes.|- And deep-dish apple pie.
{46103}{46206}Someday, he'll order something|different, and we'll all faint.
{46386}{46445}Goodness, Rance,|aren't you finished yet?
{46447}{46531}No wonder if your mind isn't on it.|Let me help.
{46533}{46617}Hallie, I found it. I'll show...|No, my hands are wet.
{46618}{46687}Get the book.|Come on, take the book a minute.
{46688}{46795}Nora, Peter, come here and hear this.|Now, get the book.
{46797}{46879}That place right here where it says,
{46880}{46993}"Under the law of this territory."|Hallie, you read it out loud.
{46995}{47116}I got Liberty Valance exactly where|I want him. Exactly where I want him.
{47118}{47173}What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it.
{47243}{47393}- I can't.|- What? You... Well, why not?
{47438}{47524}I never had the schooling,|that's why not.
{47720}{47767}You mean you can't read at all?
{47818}{47962}No, I can't read, and I can't write.|Here, take your book.
{47963}{48043}For heaven's sakes,|isn't Mr. Peabody's order ready?
{48074}{48166}- Hallie...|- Not enough beans on it.
{48203}{48252}Hallie, I'm sorry.
{48336}{48389}I could teach you.
{48442}{48543}What for? What good has reading|and writing done you?
{48544}{48603}Look at you. In an apron.
{48707}{48750}Be right with you, boys.
{48752}{48834}I do look funny in this.|I didn't mean to hurt her.
{48835}{48940}She'll get over it. What is|reading and writing for a girl?
{48941}{49038}She'll make a wonderful wife|for any man.
{49039}{49117}And if Tom Doniphon is smart,|he pops the question
{49118}{49227}before some busybody I am married to|upsets his bag of apples.
{49229}{49305}Aw, you!|Eat supper before come the drunks.
{49307}{49395}- But I'm not finished.|- Go sit down! Eat!
{49931}{50019}What you cooking, steak and potatoes?
{50021}{50117}I'm hungry. Could I impose|upon your hospitality?
{50118}{50202}Just a couple of those steaks|and no beans.
{50204}{50278}Marshal.|You're the man I'm looking for.
{50279}{50392}Not so loud.|And double on the potatoes.
{50393}{50475}One steak for one marshal|on the cuff.
{50556}{50622}Marshal, I was wrong the other day,
{50623}{50691}but I've been reading up,|and there it is.
{50692}{50778}I'll draw up the complaint,|take care of the details,
{50780}{50862}but you do have jurisdiction,|it says so right there.
{50864}{50985}The next time he sets foot|in this town, you arrest him.
{50987}{51135}Anything you say, Mr. Stoddard.|I'll be tickled to death to...
{51161}{51263}- What was that? Arrest who?|- Liberty Valance.
{51264}{51397}Arrest Liberty Val...|You mean Liberty Valance?
{51398}{51505}Just when I was starting|to get my appetite back.
{51507}{51572}A lot of black-eyes.
{51573}{51670}Steaks for the Brophy boys|with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.
{51671}{51755}- They're sober tonight, too.|- Burn four.
{51969}{52030}Here's the supper for Rance.
{52122}{52181}- Thank you, Hallie.|- Sit down!
{52182}{52256}You pop up|every time a girl speaks to you.
{52258}{52342}- You get in the habit.|- Rance, do you think I could?
{52344}{52424}I mean, grown-up and all?|Could I learn to read?
{52426}{52547}Sure you can, Hallie.|There's nothing to it.
{52549}{52670}It' d be... Can you learn to read?!|Why, I can teach you.
{52671}{52780}A smart girl like you? Of course|you can. Do you want to try?
{52781}{52923}It's awful worrisome not knowing how.|I know the Bible from preacher talk,
{52924}{53012}but it' d be a soul comfort|to read it myself.
{53013}{53120}I'll teach you how. In no time,|you'll be reading everything.
{53205}{53295}Hallie, can I have|just one more steak?
{53323}{53386}One steak on the cuff!
{53843}{53894}All right, all right.
{53965}{54029}Excuse me.
{54075}{54142}- Nora, did you hear the news?|- No.
{54143}{54221}- Rance'll learn me to read.|- "Teach me to read."
{54222}{54275}Teach me to read.
{54304}{54442}I cannot say my ABC in Swedish.|Maybe you can teach me in English.
{54449}{54510}Sure, Nora.|You'll be my second pupil.
{54512}{54571}Hal's my first. You'll be my second.
{54572}{54633}Peter, you hear that? Peter!
{54697}{54806}Well, pilgrim, I see you're still|protecting the ladies.
{54808}{54884}Tom, look at you.|You're all dressed up.
{54885}{54963}- It's Saturday night.|- Don't you look handsome?
{54987}{55059}I brought you a little present.
{55060}{55138}Prettiest cactus rose|I ever did see.
{55139}{55182}It's a beauty. Look at it, Nora.
{55183}{55284}- Should look nice in your garden.|- But it should go in now...
{55285}{55384}- I'll be pleased to plant that.|- Thank you, Pompey.
{55385}{55461}The Hash outfit just arrived.|Burn eight.
{55499}{55601}- Not too close to the ocotillo bush.|- Yes, ma'am.
{55692}{55784}"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
{55808}{55865}You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.
{55888}{55958}You really aim to hang that up|outside?
{55959}{56074}- That's why I painted it.|- Take some advice, pilgrim.
{56076}{56183}You put that thing up,|you'll have to defend it with a gun,
{56184}{56254}and you ain't exactly the type.
{56318}{56367}Comin' up.
{56395}{56436}Thank you.
{56437}{56562}A girl needs six hands on Saturday|night, and it's so hot. Look at me.
{56564}{56662}Any more colour and you' d be|prettier than that cactus rose.
{56663}{56743}Tom, that's mighty flattering.
{56744}{56845}Burn me a good, thick one, Pete,|meat and potatoes.
{56846}{56928}- Hello, Kaintuck.|- Evening, Tom.
{57045}{57125}- Tom.|- Object to company, Mr. Peabody?
{57127}{57207}Not to yours, Tom.|Sit down, sit down.
{57300}{57371}I suppose you know|who 's across the street?
{57398}{57480}Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.
{57482}{57611}He won't like what the town's been|saying about him and that hold-up.
{57663}{57704}How about you, Kaintuck?
{57705}{57748}- I'd like a st...|- Steak?
{57750}{57793}- Yes, ma'am.|- Well-burnt.
{57795}{57858}- And d-d-dee...|- Deep-dish apple pie.
{57859}{57920}- Yeah.|- Coming up.
{57941}{58041}Mighty nice girl,|that Hallie. Mighty pretty.
{58042}{58139}I agree with you, sir.|Just told her so.
{58140}{58261}What? Do I hear wedding bells?|When can I print the story?
{58262}{58369}Don't rush me,|Mr. Editor. Don't rush me.
{58516}{58586}There's your cactus rose.|Sure is pretty.
{58587}{58665}Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.|Go and get supper.
{58667}{58716}Thank you, ma'am.
{58866}{58958}Look at that. Isn't that|the prettiest thing you ever saw?
{58960}{59011}Very pretty.
{59072}{59187}- Did you ever see a real rose?|- No.
{59239}{59296}But someday if they dam the river,
{59297}{59362}we'll have water|and all kinds of flowers.
{59561}{59635}When you finish the dishes,|will you help wait tables?
{59636}{59708}- Sure.|- Washing dishes is enough for him.
{59710}{59825}- A man waiting on tables?!|- No, I' d be glad to help.
{59827}{59905}- Be glad to.|- I thought we was busy.
{60814}{60892}These steaks look done|just right for us.
{60947}{61035}You cowhands ain't in no hurry|to eat, are you?
{61086}{61137}Well, I am!
{61164}{61256}I guess we could do|with another drink.
{61290}{61364}That's right neighbourly|of you, partner.
{61485}{61536}Especially after all the lies
{61538}{61618}I hear folks been saying|about Liberty Valance.
{61689}{61800}Wait a minute!|One of Mamma's pies for Tom.
{62282}{62343}Lookee at the new waitress.
{62735}{62790}That's my steak, Valance.
{62918}{63014}You heard him, dude. Pick it up.
{63038}{63093}- No!|- Pilgrim, hold it.
{63094}{63186}I said you, Valance. You pick it up.
{63211}{63369}- Three against one, Doniphon.|- My boy Pompey in the kitchen door.
{63569}{63618}I'll get it, Liberty.
{63737}{63839}I said you, Liberty. You pick it up.
{63925}{64042}What's the matter?|Everybody here kill-crazy? Here!
{64121}{64285}There! There!|Now, it's picked up!
{64414}{64512}Why don't you get yourself|a fresh steak on me?
{64628}{64679}Show's over for now.
{64769}{64880}Try it, Liberty. Just try it.
{65011}{65054}Get out!
{66254}{66320}I wonder what scared him off.
{66321}{66407}You know what!|The spectacle of law and order here,
{66408}{66480}rising up from the gravy|and the potatoes.
{66481}{66604}All right, you made your point.|The gun scared him off.
{66605}{66673}Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom.
{66674}{66735}Why did you interfere? He tripped me.
{66736}{66781}It was my steak.
{66782}{66839}And you would have killed him for it,
{66841}{66931}or he would have killed you|over one measly steak!
{66933}{67035}- That's why I picked it up!|- Thanks for saving my life, pilgrim.
{67036}{67168}That isn't why I did it!|Nobody fights my battles.
{67879}{67938}Rance, I'm sorry.
{68295}{68396}I'm not in the habit|of eating my steak off the floor.
{68499}{68622}Well, cool off, pilgrim.|It's all over. Nobody got hurt.
{68623}{68723}It's not all over, and everybody|here knows it. He'll be back.
{68724}{68812}He will, but not after me.|After you, pilgrim.
{68813}{68895}And you can't shoot back|with a law book.
{68897}{68944}What Peabody's saying is,
{68946}{69034}if you want to stay healthy,|there's two ways to do it.
{69036}{69126}Buy a gun or leave the territory,|is that what he meant?
{69127}{69188}- That's it, pilgrim.|- By golly...
{69190}{69278}I' d hate to see you go.|You're news, Mr. Stoddard,
{69280}{69354}and you've been news|ever since you hit town.
{69355}{69427}"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
{69429}{69546}I didn't mean to hurt|your feelings out there.
{69547}{69639}I'll tell you what.|You decide to stick around,
{69640}{69730}and I'll let you hang this|outside the newspaper office
{69732}{69793}rent-free, for as long as it lasts.
{69794}{69909}No. The first time|Liberty rides into town,
{69911}{70007}he'll shoot it to pieces,|and the whole newspaper office.
{70008}{70142}- How about that, Mr. Peabody?|- Well, that' d be news.
{70143}{70198}I accept your offer, Mr. Peabody.
{70199}{70271}How about letting me hang that up|tomorrow?
{70291}{70406}- Tomorrow? Well, of course.|- Thank you.
{70407}{70452}Why not?
{70537}{70625}I'm staying,|and I'm not buying a gun either.
{70651}{70702}Good luck, pilgrim.
{70743}{70821}Hallie,|I'll be out of town for a while,
{70823}{70893}north of the Picketwire,|horse-trading.
{70951}{71008}Goodbye, Tom.
{71061}{71196}And take note of what goes on around|town, because by the time I get back,
{71197}{71273}there won't be no newspaper|to read it in.
{72021}{72132}- Well, any news?|- Hansons had a baby, eight pounds.
{72134}{72204}- But not twins?|- Not twins.
{72205}{72276}I got this list of voters for you.
{72277}{72359}There are 37 new registrations|over last year,
{72361}{72427}and not one needed a lawyer.
{72428}{72576}37? By golly!|lf we can only get them to vote,
{72577}{72700}maybe we can handle those cattle|barons from across the Picketwire.
{73246}{73349}- Did you write this, Mr. Peabody?|- Yeah.
{73412}{73558}- This is great.|- You like it?
{73559}{73606}This thing's just great.
{73709}{73799}As my old boss,|Horace Greeley, used to say,
{73800}{73853}we'll tear their hearts out.
{73920}{73971}I'll be right there.
{74129}{74196}Let me have this.|I'll use it in class.
{74302}{74372}Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.
{74373}{74469}A teacher should never|be late for class. Take your seats.
{74470}{74593}Quite a turnout this morning.|We have more pupils every day.
{74594}{74697}- Morning, Marshal. How you feeling?|- Just fine, fine.
{74699}{74773}- Your head cold?|- No, no. I have a...
{74820}{74919}Excuse me. I just wanted|to see how Julietta was doing.
{74920}{75000}- Julietta's doing fine.|- Gracias, se?or.
{75002}{75078}How's the rest of my family|doing in reading?
{75079}{75151}Hallie's in charge|of the kindergarten.
{75153}{75229}Hallie, why don't you run through|the ABCs?
{75329}{75502}All right, you ready?|One, two, three.
{75504}{75601}A, B, C, D, E, F , G
{75602}{75696}H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
{75697}{75789}Q, R, S and T, U, V
{75790}{75889}W, X and Y and Z
{75890}{75989}Now I know my ABCs
{75990}{76076}Tell me what you think of me
{76078}{76148}That was just fine, just fine.
{76149}{76225}Well, I see a couple more|new pupils back there.
{76226}{76345}Highpockets, Kaintuck, you fellas|really serious about readin'?
{76347}{76414}Go on. Stand up. Tell him.
{76465}{76570}Well, Miss Hallie, she|talked such a right smart argument
{76571}{76694}to the Lazy " J",|the boss of the Lazy " J".
{76695}{76795}He just up and told|all the hands to cut the cards
{76796}{76888}to see who come to school,|and I lost.
{76889}{76983}I see. We'll try.|Good morning, Mr. Carruthers.
{76985}{77084}Good morning. Caught him|playing hookey again, fishing.
{77085}{77132}Catch anything, Herbert?
{77133}{77213}- No, sir. They weren't biting.|- That's too bad.
{77215}{77284}- Ain't you gonna whop him?|- He's too big.
{77285}{77353}For the benefit of those of you|just starting...
{77371}{77492}None of us in here smoke,|Mr. Carruthers. Thank you.
{77519}{77597}For those of you|who have just started,
{77599}{77681}I might explain to you|that we've begun the school
{77682}{77805}by studying about our country,|and how it's governed.
{77832}{77910}Now, let's see. Well, Nora...
{77912}{78027}Would you tell the class what you've|learned about the United States?
{78160}{78275}The United States is a republic,
{78308}{78417}and a republic is a state
{78418}{78539}in which the people are the boss.
{78583}{78721}That means us.|And if the big shots in Washington
{78722}{78855}don't do like we want, we don't vote|for them, by golly, no more.
{78856}{78919}- Any more!|- Any more.
{78920}{79000}That's fine, Nora. That's just fine.
{79001}{79085}Now, I wonder|if anybody in class remembers
{79086}{79166}what the basic law of the land|is called.
{79168}{79285}You remember I told you it had|to be added to and changed sometimes,
{79287}{79336}by things called amendments.
{79338}{79430}Does anybody remember?|Julietta, your hand's always up.
{79432}{79504}Pompey, you try this one.
{79631}{79705}It was writ by Thomas Jefferson|of Virginia.
{79706}{79807}- "Was written", Pompey.|- Written by Thomas Jefferson.
{79808}{79907}- He called it the Constitution.|- Declaration of Independence.
{79908}{80072}It begun with the words...|"We hold these truths to be..."
{80073}{80147}- Self-evident.|- Let him alone, Charlie.
{80148}{80294}- "Self-evident, that..."|- "That all men are created equal."
{80365}{80470}- That's fine, Pompey.|- I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.
{80472}{80573}A lot of people forget that part.|You did just fine, Pompey.
{80574}{80638}- Thank you.|- This law also states
{80639}{80721}that governing power rests|with the electorate.
{80722}{80812}That means you,|that means the people.
{80813}{80930}And you ex ercise this power|through the vote. Yes?
{80931}{80992}Con permiso, los gentlemen's?
{81072}{81144}Well, Hallie?|Go right ahead, Hallie.
{81146}{81292}Here is the best textbook in|the world. It's an honest newspaper.
{81293}{81402}This is the "Shinbone Star,"|Dutton Peabody, Editor in Chief.
{81404}{81480}And reading this ought to bring home|to everybody
{81482}{81589}the importance of using that vote.|Now, the headlines say:
{81590}{81688}"Cattlemen fight statehood.|Small homesteaders in danger."
{81689}{81798}It says clearly that if big ranchers|north of the Picketwire River
{81800}{81888}win their fight to keep this|territory in open reign,
{81889}{82002}then all your truck farms and your|corn, the small shopkeepers
{82004}{82148}and everything, your kids' future,|it will all be all over, be gone!
{82150}{82226}And they call upon you,|in this article,
{82227}{82348}they call upon you to unite|behind a real strong delegate
{82349}{82443}and carry this fight|to Washington if necessary.
{82445}{82545}Hello, Tom.|Welcome back. You want to join us?
{82546}{82595}I'm looking for Pompey.
{82597}{82700}I've been away three weeks, and|there's no sashes or doors in yet.
{82701}{82822}Why have you been wasting time here?|Get to work. Your schooling's over.
{82824}{82914}Don't get rough with Pompey.|He's entitled to a...
{82915}{83017}What I got to say to you|will be a whole lot rougher.
{83018}{83106}The good editor here|has written some noble words,
{83108}{83196}and you read 'em good,|but if you put that paper out,
{83198}{83280}the streets of Shinbone|will be running with blood.
{83282}{83360}Why are you against this,|you of all people?
{83361}{83466}Aren't there more votes|south of the Picketwire than north?
{83467}{83549}That's right, but votes|won't stand up against guns.
{83551}{83612}Guns? What guns, Tom?
{83613}{83715}You think Valance stays away|from here cos he's scared of you?
{83716}{83796}He's recruiting hired guns|for the big ranchers.
{83798}{83880}- Sí, papacito?|- Take the little ones home.
{83908}{83953}Come on.
{83954}{84046}Hallie, it would be a good idea|if you dismissed class.
{84047}{84133}- Dismiss class?|- Go on. Dismiss them, please.
{84165}{84226}Class dismissed! Same time tomorrow.
{84227}{84288}You get to the store.
{84363}{84427}It could get worse|than the sheep wars.
{84428}{84485}You think|they'll start something here?
{84486}{84582}It's already started. Valance and|his men crossed the river yesterday,
{84583}{84673}killed a couple of sodbusters,|old man Holiday and his son.
{84674}{84731}You know that for a fact?
{84732}{84845}I do. They tried to bushwhack me,|unfortunately for one of them.
{84846}{84944}- You putting that in your newspaper?|- It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.
{84945}{85019}Print that,|he'll kill you sure as hell.
{85021}{85095}You think they'll come here, Tom?
{85097}{85169}They'll be here,|tomorrow or the next day
{85171}{85263}according to how much|who-hit-John they consume,
{85265}{85382}but election day, pilgrim, you|can depend on it. They'll be here.
{85383}{85486}Hallie, go where you belong. I don't|want you in no shooting gallery.
{85488}{85545}Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.
{85546}{85665}What I do and where I go isn't|your business. You don't own me.
{85699}{85810}Like I said, Hallie,|you're awful pretty when you get mad.
{86318}{86381}Rance. After all you've taught us,
{86382}{86468}how can you say|we should knuckle under now?
{86470}{86523}You heard what Tom said.
{86524}{86624}When force threatens,|talk's no good any more.
{86837}{86913}Hallie, go find Tom|and make it up to him.
{86952}{87009}He's only trying to protect you.
{88101}{88150}Better let him go, Hallie.
{88232}{88312}Why? Where's he going?
{88313}{88403}He's going to need|all the practice he can get.
{88405}{88491}Practice? What are you talking about?
{88596}{88653}I might as well let you know.
{88655}{88762}When he came in with me,|I let him have a gun of mine.
{88763}{88872}He's been going out in the country|twice a week practising ever since.
{88909}{89053}You mean he's going to face up|to Liberty Valance? Rance?
{89054}{89179}That's the only way I figure it.|He never discussed it.
{89180}{89241}He just keeps on practising.
{89471}{89543}Tom! Tom Doniphon!
{89709}{89766}Hey, professor.
{89800}{89853}Where you going?
{89967}{90061}- I want to talk to you at my place.|- Tom, I'm going...
{90609}{90699}Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.
{90827}{90917}All right, Tom,|what are you trying to tell me?
{90918}{91000}I'm telling you|that Hallie's my girl.
{91024}{91157}I'm building that room and porch|for her for when we get married.
{91158}{91242}Tom, I guess everybody|pretty much takes that for granted.
{91244}{91326}Everybody except Hallie, maybe you.
{91358}{91422}That's a damn lie, and you know it.
{91495}{91573}Why did she come to me|fretting herself sick
{91575}{91667}because you were going to get killed|facing up to Liberty Valance?
{91669}{91755}- I never told her.|- Peabody did.
{91757}{91806}I think you're bluffing.
{91808}{91923}I'm not bluffing about anything.|Wait a minute, Tom. What?
{91925}{92034}Pompey, bring two or three|of those paint cans.
{92234}{92293}- You have a gun, right?|- Yes.
{92294}{92339}Get it.
{92497}{92544}Come on.
{92654}{92711}All right, gunslinger.
{92807}{92856}Hit that can.
{92889}{92940}Pretty far.
{92952}{93080}- Pilgrim, you got to cock it.|- I forgot.
{93253}{93387}Balance it light in your hand|and don't jerk the trigger. Squeeze.
{93388}{93441}You don't have to coach me.
{93650}{93775}Pompey, bring me those cans.|Give me that thing.
{93782}{93835}I'll show you how easy it is.
{93858}{93969}Take these cans.|Put them on those three posts.
{94013}{94058}Go ahead.
{94192}{94249}That's it. That first post.
{94251}{94308}- There?|- That's right.
{94441}{94529}Not there! On the far post.
{94557}{94608}That's right.
{94641}{94696}Now put that last one in the middle.
{94906}{94945}Pilgrim.
{95290}{95349}I hate tricks, pilgrim,
{95351}{95425}but that's what you're up against|with Valance.
{95449}{95513}He's almost as fast as I am.
{95669}{95774}I don't like tricks myself,|so that makes us even.
{95898}{96007}Pilgrim, you forgot your popgun.
{96435}{96591}I got you, Lyde. Ruf McMard.|Highpockets. Kaintuck.
{96593}{96660}Kaintuck! Leave the jug.
{97021}{97074}I am so proud of him.
{97159}{97222}Dutton Peabody|exercising his franchise.
{97223}{97299}- Dutton Peabody.|- Ransom Stoddard.
{97307}{97401}Rance, we'll need you|for some of that legal stuff later.
{97402}{97484}"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."|Check.
{97522}{97629}- Peter Ericson, American citizen.|- Go on in, Pete.
{97631}{97707}- See you for supper, Pete?|- Yeah.
{97813}{97897}- Tom, look, we need a statehood!|- I agree.
{98027}{98125}Herbert? You're too young to vote.|Back to school.
{98615}{98676}Greetings. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.
{98727}{98809}- I'll have the usual.|- Bar's closed.
{98810}{98888}The bar is closed, Mr. Editor,|during voting.
{98890}{98943}You can blame your lawyer friend.
{98945}{99066}He says that's one of the fundamental|laws of democracy, no exception.
{99087}{99227}No exceptions for the working press?|That's carrying democracy too far.
{99258}{99303}A small beer.
{99304}{99370}Bar's closed.|Give me that bung starter.
{99571}{99649}All right. Settle down!|Sit down, everybody!
{99651}{99706}Come on. Settle down.
{99801}{99904}Since our legal authority|closed the bar on us,
{99906}{100027}I propose that Ransom Stoddard,|Attorney at Law,
{100028}{100081}come up here and run this meeting.
{100084}{100158}- I second the motion.|- I third it.
{100519}{100599}Ransom. There he is. There he is.
{100730}{100791}All right. All right. All right.
{100792}{100909}All right, now, if you want,|I can show you the rules.
{100943}{101048}The meeting will come to order.|Settle down please.
{101049}{101131}Mr. Peabody, would you keep|a record of the meeting?
{101133}{101232}Rance, please. There are other men...|Give me a drink.
{101233}{101286}- Bar's closed.|- Just a beer!
{101288}{101347}- Bar's closed.|- A beer's not drinking!
{101348}{101424}- Before we start...|- Sit down, Doctor, please?
{101456}{101542}I have a pencil right here.|Thank you.
{101594}{101678}You all know why we're here.
{101679}{101781}We're here to elect two delegates,|because a growing population
{101782}{101864}south of the Picketwire entitles us|to two.
{101866}{101921}These two delegates will represent us
{101923}{102005}in the territorial convention|for statehood.
{102103}{102150}You know the issue.
{102151}{102251}The cattle interests want to keep|this territory an open range.
{102252}{102309}No!
{102310}{102409}Ruled by their high-handed ideas,|whatever they are.
{102410}{102521}And we - that means everybody|in this room - we're for statehood!
{102609}{102747}We want statehood, because it means|the protection of farms and fences.
{102748}{102847}It means schools for our children|and progress for the future!
{102916}{102969}Just sit down, please.
{102971}{103076}Now we'll proceed|with the nominations.
{103077}{103136}You can nominate as many as you like,
{103137}{103217}and in order to show you|how this procedure works,
{103219}{103270}I'll leave the chair temporarily.
{103271}{103330}That's parliamentary law.|You can do that.
{103331}{103471}I'll step out of the chair,|and I'll make the first nomination.
{103472}{103602}I' d like to nominate a man I think|is the only man in Shinbone
{103603}{103706}who has the right qualifications to|lead us in our fight for statehood.
{103708}{103784}I could stand here|talking about him all day,
{103785}{103852}but I know everybody here|could do the same.
{103853}{103962}I don't think that's necessary.|I nominate Tom Doniphon.
{104283}{104361}Come on, sit down. Sit down.
{104409}{104491}Stop sucking on that cigar|and put that pencil away.
{104492}{104584}- I refuse the nomination.|- You can't refuse now.
{104586}{104716}Yes I can, because I got|other plans, personal plans.
{104717}{104805}Mr. Attorney, go on with your meeting.
{105196}{105276}You don't live south|of the Picketwire. You can't vote.
{105277}{105338}I live where I hang my hat.
{105657}{105728}Come on, move! Out of the way!
{105973}{106074}Hashslinger, why are you|standing there so high and mighty?
{106075}{106163}He's running this here meeting,|or hadn't you heard?
{106165}{106214}The whole shebang.
{106253}{106314}I' d like to nominate the chairman,
{106316}{106431}Mr. Ransom Stoddard, as delegate|to the territorial convention.
{106433}{106468}Wait a minute.
{106469}{106559}And I second that nomination,|not only because he knows law,
{106561}{106612}but because he throws a good punch.
{106614}{106702}Now listen, all you sodbusters,|you hard-rock farmers.
{106704}{106803}- I aim to be the delegate.|- You don't live south.
{106804}{106855}Floyd, say your piece like I said.
{106857}{106906}I nominate|Liberty Valance for delegate.
{106907}{106993}- I second the nomination.|- Move the nominations be closed.
{106995}{107116}Now wait a minute. That ain't|exactly legal, is it, Mr. Attorney?
{107142}{107242}We need two good delegates|to Capitol City, Valance,
{107243}{107342}Two honest men.|We've got one in you, Mr. Stoddard.
{107343}{107454}- You looking for trouble, Doniphon?|- You helping me find some?
{107597}{107706}- You heard my motion, dude!|- All right. Put his name down.
{107728}{107841}- Liberty Valance, address unknown.|- Have I got a right to speak?
{107843}{107915}- Go ahead, Highpockets.|- Then what about Mr. Peabody?
{107916}{107982}He can read and write|and runs the newspaper.
{107983}{108036}Yeah, and when he's drinking,
{108037}{108135}why, he can talk the ears|off of a w-wooden Indian.
{108159}{108212}I second the motion.
{108323}{108384}No, you don't. No!
{108385}{108498}I'm a newspaperman, not a politician.
{108499}{108604}No, politicians are my meat!|I build them up. I tear them down.
{108605}{108693}But I wouldn't be one.|I couldn't be one.
{108695}{108775}- It would destroy me! Give me a...|- Bar's closed.
{108792}{108905}Good people of Shinbone,|I'm your conscience.
{108906}{108988}I'm the still, small voice|that thunders in the night.
{108989}{109083}I'm your watchdog|that howls against the wolves.
{109084}{109137}I'm your Father confessor!
{109206}{109273}- What else am l?|- Town drunk?
{109358}{109456}- Dutton Peabody. Write it down.|- I move the nominations be closed.
{109457}{109514}- I second the motion.|- All in favour?
{109556}{109607}Now we'll proceed with the election.
{109671}{109784}You sodbusters are a brave bunch|when you're together, but don't vote
{109786}{109889}any way now that you'll regret|later when you're alone.
{109986}{110136}Those in favour of Ransom Stoddard|as delegate, raise your hands.
{110212}{110310}All those in favour of Liberty|Valance, raise your hands.
{110611}{110701}All those in favour of Dutton|Peabody, raise your hands.
{110728}{110802}- Let's get you a drink.|- The bar's closed.
{110804}{110855}According to Mr. Stoddard,|the bar's closed.
{110857}{110962}- Anything further on the election?|- Legally, the election's finished.
{110963}{111012}Then the bar is open.
{111222}{111304}That vote don't mean a thing.|Stay out of this.
{111306}{111365}He's been hiding|behind your gun long enough.
{111366}{111413}You got a choice, dishwasher.
{111415}{111505}Either you leave town,|or tonight be on that street alone.
{111507}{111604}You be there,|and don't make us come and get you.
{111966}{112044}Well, he called it plain.
{112086}{112186}Too bad you didn't come|to me sooner with that gun.
{112259}{112374}Pilgrim. Come full dark, Pompey will|be at the Swedes' place
{112375}{112467}with a buckboard.|Why don't you leave town?
{112525}{112578}Thanks.
{113355}{113429}"Liberty Valance defeated."
{113430}{113566}D-E-F-E-E... T-E-D?
{113610}{113706}The unsteady hand betrays.
{113734}{113808}What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?
{113847}{113914}Are you afraid?
{113969}{114100}The answer is indub... yes.
{114258}{114315}No courage left.
{114365}{114501}Well, courage can be purchased|at yon tavern.
{114530}{114684}But have we credit?|That is the question. Have we credit?
{114715}{114824}Well, credit is cheap.
{114896}{115023}Wait for me,|old servant of the public wheel.
{115071}{115165}Our shining hour is yet to come.
{115377}{115436}As for you, Horace Greeley,
{115438}{115576}go west, old man,|and grow young with the country.
{115966}{116075}Don't do that, Mr. Peabody.|Why are you out here?
{116077}{116169}Don't you know that everybody|is supposed to get off the street?
{116170}{116260}My inalienable right,|the pursuit of happiness.
{116261}{116368}Sure, but it don't go to the saloon.|Liberty Valance is back there.
{116370}{116454}You should hear|what he's swearing to do to Rance.
{116456}{116592}And he ain't leaving you out, either.|Go in and let the Mexican fill that.
{116593}{116724}But I doubt if my credit is good with|these Spanish-American gentlemen.
{116725}{116822}Sure, it is. He's my wife's|step-uncle by her sister's marriage.
{116823}{116907}But would you say something nice|about me in your paper?
{116909}{116978}My dear friend, Link Appleyard?
{116979}{117050}The fearless,|fighting marshal of the west?
{117076}{117164}Your name will go down in history|with Buffalo Bill.
{117419}{117513}Mr. Peabody's drunker than a skunk|over in that Mexican joint.
{117514}{117563}He ain't eating tonight.
{117587}{117644}He "isn't" eating tonight, remember?
{117645}{117731}Isn't, ain't,|what difference does it make?
{117733}{117832}Ain't going to be no school anymore|with you leaving tonight.
{117942}{118047}Good evening, folks. Mr. Rance,|I have the buckboard out here.
{118048}{118146}I'll be waiting for you|if you need me.
{118147}{118231}Go, Rance. Go now, while you can.
{118232}{118316}Nora and Hallie|can finish the dishes.
{118395}{118473}Go. Please go.
{118500}{118600}I owe you for|three days' room and board.
{118633}{118746}I want to square my account. I want|to square my account before I go.
{119182}{119305}And those in England now asleep|shall think themselves accursed.
{119307}{119385}They were not here whilst any lives
{119387}{119496}that fought with us|on St Crispin's Day.
{119559}{119668}But when the blast, the blast of war,
{119670}{119779}blows in our ears and we summon up...
{119864}{119967}Liberty Valance. And his vermidons!
{120143}{120274}Liberty Valance taking liberties|with the liberty of the press?
{120283}{120385}- Had your supper yet, Peabody?|- My supper?
{120386}{120441}No. That's a splendid idea.
{120758}{120871}- You can start by eating this.|- That's a poor joke, Liberty.
{120873}{120957}Eat it!
{121043}{121088}Eat it!
{122020}{122069}He's dead.
{124267}{124312}Mr. Peabody.
{124431}{124575}Rance? Rance Stoddard?
{125037}{125111}- Mr. Peabody.|- Let's get him up.
{125236}{125304}- Where's Doc Willoughby?|- Still in the saloon.
{125305}{125350}Go get him.
{125357}{125435}Rance? Rance!
{125673}{125809}I sure told that Liberty Valance
{125810}{125946}about the freedom of the press.
{126241}{126286}Marshal?
{126811}{126854}Marshal...
{126919}{127003}you tell Liberty Valance|I'll be outside.
{128207}{128262}- Pompey!|- Miss Hallie?
{128264}{128319}- Where's Mr. Tom?|- Down the road.
{128320}{128381}Get him!|Rance is out front with a gun!
{128383}{128424}Yes, ma'am.
{128425}{128505}You've heard of Gettysburg. 240...
{128507}{128610}Doc, Mr. Peabody's awful hurt.|He needs you at his office.
{128611}{128670}What's wrong?|Somebody have an accident?
{128720}{128820}So that's it. Another one of your|accidents, Valance?
{128821}{128919}I'm waiting for the day|when they'll call me for you.
{128956}{129001}Paid in advance.
{129177}{129222}$10 into the cans.
{129247}{129368}Liberty, what you did to Mr. Peabody,|ain't that enough?
{129373}{129428}Ain't that enough what, Mr. Marshal?
{129430}{129473}You all know that Rance Stoddard
{129474}{129575}couldn't shoot the hat off his head|with a gun in his hand.
{129576}{129654}You mean, he's got a gun in his hand?
{129659}{129704}I'm calling you, Valance.
{129705}{129758}Kings and threes.
{129761}{129810}Good hand,
{129812}{129947}but not good enough.|An ace is an ace. Thank you.
{129957}{130049}If you gun him down,|it'll just be pure murder.
{132093}{132165}Well, Mr. Professor,|I thought you left town.
{132166}{132215}Why are you out here?
{132234}{132343}I'm waiting for Liberty Valance.|Why doesn't he come out?
{132345}{132416}Well, that's none of our business.
{132474}{132542}You heard him say he had a gun,|right?
{132543}{132606}- I didn't say that!|- That ain't murder.
{132607}{132679}That's a clean-cut case of|self-defence.
{132680}{132766}You heard him call me out,|didn't you?
{132802}{132855}Now get out of my way.
{132937}{132996}Hashslinger, are you out here?
{133032}{133155}I'd say that was Liberty Valance|there now. Wouldn't you?
{133171}{133280}- Yes, I would.|- We be seeing you, Mr. Stoddard.
{133626}{133685}Come closer where I can see you.
{133864}{133925}Get out of that shadow, dude.
{135017}{135101}You got two hands, Hashslinger.|Pick it up!
{135714}{135875}All right, dude...|this time, right between the eyes.
{136256}{136311}Liberty?
{136312}{136383}Liberty? Liberty!
{136814}{136863}Hey, Doc! Doc!
{136909}{136954}Liberty!
{137860}{137965}It's Liberty! He's hurt!|It's Liberty!
{138064}{138160}- Whisky, quick.|- Here, sir.
{138454}{138501}Dead.
{139736}{139874}Rance, if it had been you|instead of Valance, I would...
{139875}{139969}Oh, no, Hallie. Hallie...
{140000}{140130}I can't help it.|This feels so guilty.
{140163}{140276}I didn't want you to run away.|I wanted you to stay.
{140278}{140364}He might... I'm sorry.
{140365}{140455}- Forgive me.|- Hallie.
{140456}{140556}Hallie, please don't.
{140557}{140626}Hallie.
{141035}{141134}I'm sorry I got here too late,|Hallie.
{141135}{141223}You got yourself|out of that fix real handy.
{141285}{141334}I'll be around.
{142175}{142278}- Tom! Liberty...|- I know.
{142616}{142710}He wasn't going to kill him,|just nick him a little.
{142712}{142796}He was just gonna make a pass.|You saw that!
{142798}{142903}- That lawyer shot him in cold blood!|- Now, that ain't the way.
{142905}{142968}It was murder! Pure murder!
{142969}{143051}And I say if the marshal|don't put Stoddard in jail,
{143053}{143117}we ought to|take care of him ourselves!
{143118}{143212}- I say we ought to hang him!|- That's right! Hang him!
{143214}{143263}Give him a rope! Let him swing!
{143265}{143386}Can't a man get a drink|around this town in peace?
{143514}{143612}- No one's bothering you, Doniphon.|- You are!
{143715}{143760}Marshal!
{143864}{143928}Why are you paid? Drag this scum out.
{143929}{143986}You heard him.|Kaintuck and Highpockets,
{143987}{144118}- I deputise you to give a hand.|- Hand me that bung st... That's it.
{144207}{144309}Tell those ranchers north of the|Picketwire that hired you
{144310}{144398}that me, Link Appleyard,|run you out of town,
{144400}{144497}and I'll do it again|if you ever come back!
{144624}{144747}- Now look, Pompey, you know l...|- Who says he can't?
{144749}{144856}- Pour yourself a drink, Pompey.|- I don't drink no drams, Mr. Tom.
{144857}{144902}I said take a drink.
{144903}{145028}No. We got a mare in foal and horses|to feed and water. Come on home.
{145046}{145111}Home...
{145170}{145254}Home sweet home.|You're right, Pompey.
{145256}{145350}We got plenty to do at home.
{145351}{145456}Well, what are they|paying you guys for? Play!
{145458}{145525}Be merry! Sing!
{145670}{145719}Leave me be!
{147743}{147788}Mr. Tom!
{148532}{148614}The horses, Pompey. The horses.
{150300}{150376}Hello! How are you?
{150455}{150570}- You made it on your own feet!|- Yeah! Thanks to Doc Willoughby.
{150572}{150691}- Here. Let me pin this on you.|- That's him.
{150804}{150902}- Well, this must be Ransom Stoddard.|- Rance, this is Handy Strong.
{150903}{150983}How do you do, sir?|It's quite a city here.
{150985}{151049}It's not much according|to your eastern standards,
{151050}{151146}but that railroad station there|leads straight to Washington.
{151226}{151271}Come on, Rance.
{151638}{151784}Order! Order!
{151799}{151883}Order! Order!
{151930}{152084}Order! Order! Quiet!
{152086}{152152}Order! Quiet!
{152201}{152291}The roll call having been completed
{152292}{152393}and the delegates|recognised and seated,
{152394}{152486}this session|of the territorial convention
{152487}{152567}is hereby declared open.
{152639}{152692}Order!
{152695}{152759}Order!
{152792}{152845}Mr. Chairman.
{152905}{153065}The chair recognises the Honourable|Major Cassius Starbuckle...
{153066}{153160}soldier, jurist, and statesman.
{153164}{153320}Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates...
{153321}{153368}ladies...
{153369}{153455}and gentlemen,
{153456}{153596}I came here|with a carefully prepared speech,
{153597}{153706}but this is no time for oratory.
{153848}{153963}Let me speak to you from the heart.
{154002}{154109}I come before you|to place in nomination
{154110}{154241}the name of a man|more qualified than any other
{154242}{154328}to represent you in Washington.
{154354}{154424}You ill-advised.
{154425}{154509}You poorly counselled.
{154510}{154631}Fly not in the face|of heaven's handiwork.
{154632}{154726}Join with us in supporting the man
{154728}{154812}who for five terms in Congress
{154816}{154968}has kept this great territory|inviolate.
{154970}{155105}I nominate|for the territorial delegate
{155106}{155211}to the Congress of the United States
{155213}{155305}the Right Honourable|Custis Buck Langhorne.
{155949}{155990}Order! Order!
{156309}{156414}Now that you got your rope on him,|hang the horse thief!
{157069}{157149}Order! Order!
{157150}{157249}This is a convention,|not a rodeo, Langhorne!
{157342}{157401}Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!
{157405}{157512}The chair recognises|its old friend...
{157514}{157625}that distinguished member|of the fourth estate...
{157626}{157790}founder, owner, publisher and editor|of the "Shinbone Star"...
{157791}{157906}Mr. Dutton Peabody, Esquire.
{158000}{158078}Thank you, Mr. Chairman,|for those kind words,
{158080}{158129}but tell them the whole truth...
{158130}{158232}founder, owner, editor|and I also sweep out the place.
{158302}{158376}Fellow delegates, like all of you,
{158377}{158513}I've listened in awe and admiration|to the magnificent oratory
{158515}{158607}of the Honourable|Major Cassius Starbuckle...
{158609}{158650}the cattlemen's mouthpiece.
{158651}{158723}The lowing herd is still with us.
{158764}{158856}But, seriously,|under the spell of his eloquence,
{158858}{158956}I could see once again|the vast herd of buffalo
{158957}{159031}and savage redskin|roaming our beautiful territory
{159032}{159116}with no law to trammel them|except the law of survival,
{159118}{159196}the law of the tomahawk|and the bow and arrow.
{159197}{159279}And then, with|the westward march of our nation,
{159281}{159394}came the pioneer and the buffalo|hunter, the adventurous and the bold.
{159395}{159475}The boldest of these|were the cattlemen,
{159476}{159581}who seized the wide-open range|for their own personal domain,
{159583}{159717}and their law|was the law of the hired gun.
{159749}{159914}But now, today have come|the railroads and the people.
{159915}{160003}The steady, hard-working citizens,
{160005}{160170}the homesteader, the shopkeeper,|the builder of cities.
{160174}{160237}We need roads to join those cities,
{160238}{160316}dams to store up|the waters of the Picketwire,
{160317}{160389}and we need statehood|to protect the rights
{160390}{160480}of every man and woman,|however humble.
{160515}{160586}How do we get it? I'll tell you how.
{160587}{160661}We get it by placing our votes|behind one man.
{160663}{160760}One man!|And we have that man with us here.
{160761}{160897}He is a man who came to us|not packing a gun,
{160898}{161025}but carrying instead|a bag of law books.
{161029}{161154}Yes. He is a lawyer and a teacher.
{161158}{161258}The first west of the rosy buttes.|But more important,
{161259}{161370}he's a man who has come to be known|throughout this territory
{161372}{161516}in the last few weeks as|a great champion of law and order.
{161529}{161671}Ladies and gentlemen,|I nominate as your delegate and mine,
{161673}{161821}to the Congress at Washington,|the Honourable Ransom Stoddard!
{162242}{162287}Let's have order!
{162323}{162376}Get going, Starbuckle.
{162517}{162630}Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
{162683}{162728}Well...
{162738}{162882}I see this demonstration,|but I can't believe my eyes.
{162884}{162980}Is it possible|that such a representative body
{162981}{163108}of honest, hard-working Americans|can endorse a candidate
{163109}{163175}for the Congress|of our beloved country
{163176}{163285}whose only claim to the office|is that he killed a man.
{163287}{163342}Do you call Liberty Valance a man?!
{163423}{163486}Order! Order!
{163489}{163542}Hear me out!
{163586}{163742}Who is this Ransom Stoddard?|And what qualifications has he
{163743}{163860}that entitle him to aspire|to such great office?
{163864}{164047}We are told he's a lawyer,|an attorney at law,
{164052}{164216}an officer of the court.|Yes, but what kind of lawyer?
{164217}{164349}A man who usurps the function|of both judge and jury
{164350}{164430}and takes the law into his own hand.
{164623}{164707}Quiet! Quiet!
{164751}{164841}What other qualifications|has he, then?
{164843}{164917}The blood on his hands?
{164918}{165000}The hidden gun beneath his coat?
{165001}{165106}The bullet-riddled body|of an honest citizen?
{165107}{165160}Honest citizen?! Liberty Valance?
{165162}{165244}You fool! Liberty Valance,|an honest citizen?
{165246}{165346}Is this your fearless champion|of law and order?
{165347}{165470}- Mr. Chairman!|- The mark of Cain is on this man,
{165472}{165552}and the mark of Cain|will be on all of us
{165553}{165641}if we send him|with bloodstained hands
{165643}{165717}to walk the hallowed|halls of government...
{165719}{165795}- ..where Washington...|- Mr. Chairman!
{165826}{165877}- Mr. Chairman!|- Order! Order!
{165879}{166043}...yes, and Lincoln still live,|immortals in the memory of man.
{166044}{166089}Mr. Chairman!
{166302}{166326}Rance! Rance!
{166366}{166425}Order! Order!
{166532}{166579}Pilgrim.
{166670}{166781}- Where are you going?|- I'm going home, Tom.
{166782}{166852}I'm going back east where I belong.
{167090}{167232}Valance couldn't make you run away.|What is it now, your conscience?
{167251}{167393}Isn't it enough to kill a man,|without trying to build a life on it?
{167397}{167496}You talk too much, think too much.
{167497}{167612}Besides,|you didn't kill Liberty Valance.
{167691}{167793}- What?|- Think back, pilgrim.
{167876}{167946}Valance came out of the saloon.
{167947}{168052}You were walking toward him|when he fired his first shot.
{168053}{168104}Remember?
{168640}{168685}Pompey.
{168812}{168976}All right, dude.|This time...right between the eyes.
{169566}{169668}But...|Tom, why did you do it?
{169669}{169763}Cold-blooded murder,|but I can live with it.
{169764}{169846}Hallie's happy. She wanted you alive.
{169847}{169929}- But you saved my life!|- I wish I hadn't.
{169980}{170037}Hallie's your girl now.
{170085}{170163}Go on back in there|and take that nomination.
{170165}{170224}You taught her|how to read and write.
{170225}{170293}Now give her something|to read and write about!
{171184}{171278}Well, you know the rest of it.
{171280}{171362}I went to Washington,|and we won statehood.
{171363}{171441}I became the first governor.
{171443}{171570}Three terms as governor,|two terms in the Senate,
{171571}{171727}Ambassador to the Court of St James,|back again to the Senate,
{171728}{171847}and a man who,|with the snap of his fingers,
{171848}{171948}could be the next vice president|of the United States.
{172059}{172126}You're not going to use the story,|Mr. Scott?
{172127}{172193}No, sir.
{172254}{172325}This is the west, sir.
{172326}{172414}When the legend becomes fact,|print the legend.
{172415}{172474}He's right, Rance.
{172990}{173039}It's getting late, Hallie.
{173127}{173263}We'll keep in touch with you,|Pompey. I promise.
{173264}{173371}- But, Mr. Rance...|- Pork chop money.
{173830}{173916}Hallie...
{173917}{174001}Hallie, would you be too sorry
{174003}{174136}if once I get the new|irrigation bill through,
{174137}{174293}would you be too sorry|if we just up and left Washington?
{174295}{174476}I sort of have a hankering|to come back here to live.
{174499}{174597}- Maybe open up a law office.|- Rance...
{174626}{174725}If you knew how often|I'd dreamed of it.
{174726}{174866}My roots are here.|I guess my heart is here.
{174899}{174954}Yes, let's come back.
{175009}{175110}Look at it.|It was once a wilderness.
{175111}{175207}Now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?
{175299}{175441}Hallie, who put the cactus roses|on Tom's coffin?
{175465}{175510}I did.
{175671}{175763}Here, I got a brand-new spittoon...|Cuspidor, Hallie.
{175765}{175863}and Luke the engineer's got a full|head of steam in this tar bucket.
{175864}{175956}We'll make 25 miles an hour|or bust a boiler trying.
{175957}{176097}And we wired ahead to Junction City.|They'll hold the Express.
{176099}{176187}In two days and two nights,|you'll be in Washington.
{176188}{176233}Thank you, Jason.
{176234}{176312}I'm going to write a letter|to the officials of this railroad
{176313}{176416}and thank them for their kindness|and for going to all this trouble.
{176418}{176463}You think nothing of it.
{176464}{176538}Nothing's too good for the man|who shot Liberty Valance.
