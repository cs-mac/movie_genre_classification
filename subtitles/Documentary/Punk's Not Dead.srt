1
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,040
You have somethin'?

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,400
Do you or do you not?

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,280
No, no...

4
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,680
Milka!

5
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,760
Don't you make a
monkey out of me.

6
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,600
Where are you going, you dirt?
Where?

7
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,400
Give me back my wallet,
you gangster.

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,480
Give it!
I'm gonna call the cops.

9
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,360
No, you're not.

10
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,880
-No?
-No.

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,680
Mrs. Milka, do you need any help?
-Go away, you faggot.

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,440
C'mon, give it to me.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,600
Take 300, leave 200 for me.
-What do you need it for?

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm gonna make pastry for supper.
-You're lyin'.

15
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,160
Milka, your nose is growin'.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't, Milka!

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Better than nothing.

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,440
My name is Mirsa.

19
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,280
They call me ''The Late Mirsa''.

20
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,520
Actually, that is what I
nicknamed myself.

21
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,280
Up until 17 years ago
I had a band,

22
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,720
a Punk band.

23
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,880
We were No. 1 punks in the country.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,320
Since then, I'm living on old glory.
And on ''chasing my own tale''

25
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,080
as my grandfather used to say,
God rest his soul.

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,200
At the time we were playn',
Skopje was a city.

27
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,920
A city that lives...

28
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,720
It is a grave now...

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,400
It lay dead, underneath that
Cross they built on Mt. Vodno.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
Where did you get that shit?

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I bought it.

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,720
My dealer's name is Gzim.

33
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,120
He's an Albanian.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,240
Can you stop that?

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
We call him Jero.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,840
The chicks say he's got
an irresistible childish smile.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,680
I don't know... We don't like
each other much.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Turn left here.

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,960
But, that's not 'cause we're
an Albanian and a Macedonian,

40
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
enemies by default,

41
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,080
like, hate between Muslims
and Christians, that kind of stuff.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Well, I don't give
a flyin' fuck 'bout that.

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,120
I swear, during the fuckin' war

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,360
in 2001 between 'us and them'
I was so high,

45
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:24,919
so I had no idea who's
shooting and whom,

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,720
and what the hell is goin' on.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Hey, c'mon, we're late!

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Hey, fag, they're waiting on us!

49
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:34,759
Jero and I,
we respect each other, sure.

50
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:37,879
I help him dealing;
I find clients for him.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Hey, you punk..

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
You know, kids that
are into the music thing.

53
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,920
Honk at him.
-He gives me a price cut.

54
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,200
Sometimes he doesn't
even charge me.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
We divide the labor;
he works with Albanian kids,

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
I work with Macedonian kids.

57
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,200
But, he thinks I'm a surplus,
a simple excess.

58
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,720
I know that he's only
interested in cash.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Two different worlds, fuck it.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,640
Take.

61
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
You're putting my ass
on the line, man.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,120
And you're doing me a favor.

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,880
Jero remembers.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
There's gonna be some
cash in for you guys, too.

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm gonna wait on you until
the day after tomorrow,

66
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,360
until Wednesday.

67
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Wednesday!

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Believe it or not,
I got an offer for a gig.

69
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,080
He said it would totally
change my life.

70
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,160
It's a simple deal: I gather
my band and we hit the road.

71
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,320
I feel like playing so much,
I wanna cry.

72
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
We haven't performed
in 17 years.

73
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,440
They're diggin' us out of the grave.

74
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,920
Cool. Except, the gig is in Debar,
a town of fuckin' Albanians.

75
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,279
When this gets out in town,
I'm gonna find myself

76
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,400
in some serious shit.

77
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,880
Besides, it is
sponsored by some fucking NGO.

78
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,640
Anti-war vultures,
ethnic relaxation, bite my ass.

79
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,440
Take it or leave it.

80
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Fuck it, at least Jero's honest.
None of our bands didn't want

81
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,080
to take them up on it,
so I'm their last chance.

82
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,400
Last chance, my ass.
Piss on it.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
For me?

84
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
You bought it...

85
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,680
You've given money
for this stupid stuff.

86
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,000
And, as if this shit wasn't enough,
Milka started getting' on my ass

87
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,920
sayin' that I was just like
my old man - a man of doubts.

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
Maybe she's right.

89
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,279
And My dad I remember him or not.

90
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I was very young when he left us.

91
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,160
He fled to Australia
with a new woman.

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,240
He hasn't called since.

93
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,840
Milka doesn't mention him,
and I don't ask about him.

94
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't know
Probably, I don't give a shit.

95
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,320
Milka and I...

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
We live our own lives...
and it's working.

97
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,840
She lives on
chasing her own tail as well.

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
Where's the pastry, Milka?
-Who? What?

99
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,280
They ran out of flour at the grocery.

100
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,880
Gosh, you've been smoking
that shit again.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Go away, you stink. Go...
God will punish you.

102
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,960
I can't.
-Don't be such a wimper... c'mon.

103
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Don't do this to me.

104
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,600
Can I help you, gentlemen?
-We're together with them.

105
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,040
Do you have an invihtion?
-It's OK, chief.

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,680
This is not the one, is he?
-I hope not.

107
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
A freakin' party with not
a living soul in it.

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,720
A fake glamour.

109
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,320
I used to enjoy watchin'
the system crashin' down.

110
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Now, that's a bore to me.

111
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Hi.

112
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
Mirsa...

113
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,680
himself.

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The man is a punk legend in town.

115
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,360
Number one.

116
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
But, Gzim, darling, you know
what Debar's like.

117
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,480
Just try to picture this guy there.

118
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, you're gonna tell me
what Debar is like?

119
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,120
Fifteen bands have blown us off,
we're takin' a phony action.

120
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,320
Stop undermining me, please.

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,000
We are too deep in this shit.

122
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,240
Do you speak English?
-He's tired. He's tired.

123
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,040
Works all day and plays at night.

124
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,360
You know, your life style fits
like a glove in our program.

125
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,640
Jero!

126
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,120
DTY...

127
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Democracy, Tolerance, Youth.

128
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,680
Be serious, darlin'
I'm 40. Next month.

129
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,280
It's OK. I'll cut the bull shit.
I know what Punk is like.

130
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,600
The event is in a week,
so, if you need anything,

131
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,720
Gzim will find it for you.

132
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
Instruments, equipment...

133
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,120
Are you in?

134
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,880
Actually, I'm still out.
I'm not sure.

135
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,480
Jero, come on...
-He's joking, of course.

136
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,400
Jero...
-The man is an anarchist.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
He enjoys making drama.

138
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,840
I don't bite. You're so sweet.

139
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,040
You look like...

140
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,480
like Sid Vicious...

141
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,520
Give me that.

142
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,720
This is crazy, bro,
I swear. A gig? Hello!

143
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,200
What's he sayin'?
How much are we getting?

144
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,600
He's not saying anything.

145
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,360
Are we goin' to snatch
200 euros per person? Huh?

146
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,040
Bro, I really don't get your dilemma.

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
How long we haven't played? Huh?

148
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,400
You really helped me indeed.
Like a fucking expert!

149
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,120
Bro, I'm gonna say no to him.
Fuck him.

150
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,880
Do you have money for beer, bro?

151
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,760
No.
-Then say no to him.

152
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,480
Why are you lookin' at me?

153
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,360
'Cause you are so beautiful,
you fuckin' monkey-faced asshole.

154
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,360
Hey, stupid, think about it.

155
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,520
We're going to perform.
What else is important? Tell me.

156
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,040
We're gonna have to spit
on our whole image.

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,160
Spit on what? Our image?
-Yes.

158
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,760
Hey bro, have you seen
your self lately?

159
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,040
It's stupid.
That's all we have left.

160
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,840
Image?
-Yes.

161
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,880
We've an image left?

162
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,880
You are out of your mind.

163
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,000
You're out of your mind...

164
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,520
an image...

165
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,720
fool...

166
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
Shut up.

167
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Ljak's been my best friend
since I can remember.

168
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,760
He's the drummer,
we've been playing together.

169
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
I know I am no better,

170
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,760
but he totally remained a kid inside.
A kid, a real little brat.

171
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,040
I really love him.

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,680
A lot.

173
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,280
Why are you lookin' at me?

174
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Do I make you feel sick?
A lowlife?

175
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
Mind your business. Shame on you.
See what you look like.

176
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,160
Mirsa, bro, do you jerk off?

177
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,000
Say it I asked you if you spanked it.

178
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,560
I can't get a hard-on.

179
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,480
At least, tell me if you can get it
hard.
-Shut up, it's impolite.

180
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,400
There are cunts here.

181
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,320
Shame on you two.

182
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,040
I really can't get it up.
But I would really like to jerk off.

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I would spank it
-What would you spank?

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,160
My dick, of course.

185
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,320
I would spank it hard
until it wears off.

186
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,160
But, it's not usable.

187
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,440
You idiot, you drove
out the cunts.

188
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,760
There you go.

189
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,840
It's looking good, relax.
-It's a little tight.

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,560
It's perfect. The way it should be.

191
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,000
I needed a bigger size.
-You're looking great.

192
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,040
You look like a prince.
-A prince? I'm a condom.

193
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Nonsense!
You know, there aren't only

194
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,160
roles of princes in theatre.

195
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,080
A real condom.
-So what if you are a condom?

196
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
Somebody has to play
the part of a condom as well.

197
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,880
You're looking great.

198
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Where is Gzim?

199
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,160
Jero -Hey, bro.

200
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,680
Remember, Sid?

201
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
I don't bite.

202
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,840
Jero, let's... -No problem.
The girls are friends.

203
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,640
So, you accept? -Not yet.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Look, the guys are asking
for some if you...

205
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,040
Just a moment. Excuse me.

206
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,080
You're bitchin' now, honey.
-No...

207
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
I told you the conditions.
Jero...

208
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
Look, Jero...

209
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,920
The guys are asking
300 euro's per person.

210
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Plus, what me and
you agreed upon.

211
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
You really are a punk, man!

212
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,240
That's why you're goner.

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
You're a failure that walks, bro.

214
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,200
No bargaining with Jero.

215
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,120
The answer's... NO.

216
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,920
Fine, Jero...

217
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,320
I also feel funny about this...
I don't feel like doin' it.

218
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,840
To play in front of Albanians, huh?

219
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,120
But dealing for Albanian
doesn't make you feel funny.

220
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,840
Don't be pathetic.

221
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,160
Ok, fine. You persuaded me.

222
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,720
150 euros per person.
That's final. Think about it.

223
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,080
And? -Bad.
-What's bad?

224
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,000
150 euros.
-Per person?

225
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
Per person. -No way...

226
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,360
Motherfuckers!

227
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,520
These kinds of people
messed up Macedonia...

228
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,280
Stop shittin', please.

229
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,880
These kinds of people are
preventing our prosperity.

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Die, mothefuckers.
-Please, Ljak, leave me alone!

231
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
Unplug everything.
Those assholes from

232
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,640
the electrical company are here.

233
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,400
Leave me alone, Milka.
I have things to do.

234
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,200
What things, you fag?
What, you think I can't see?

235
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,760
You're just sitting there,
staring like a bull.

236
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,080
We have 30 unpaid bills.

237
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,920
They gonna hunt us down
like rabbits.

238
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,160
Milka, we fixed ours.
Do you need any help?

239
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,560
It's done, Mirsa. Those hooligans
cut our power supply.

240
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
Motherfucking capitalists
-Don't worry. We can connect

241
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,800
a wire from my place,
and you will have a light.

242
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,800
Don't worry.

243
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,960
The coolest place in the world
for me is Buenos Aires.

244
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,000
I've never been there.

245
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
I've never been in Debar, as well.

246
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,040
Fuck Debar, and Jero, and both
Albanians and Macedonians

247
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,520
and those NGO's.
Motherfuckers, all of them

248
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,560
Nina...

249
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Come in.

250
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,280
I hear you gonna play
for the Albanians.

251
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,320
Hey, don't you start that
shit, please.

252
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,600
Mirsa is a shithead.

253
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
Mirsa is slime.

254
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,160
Want some more of this?
-No.

255
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
You're being hard to swallow.
-Yeah.

256
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,320
You disappear for ten months

257
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,760
and you come here kissin' me
like you wanna take me out

258
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,560
of my pants.

259
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,680
You wanna be
together again?

260
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Like a guy and a girl?
-Is there another way?

261
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,520
I don't know, like a
brother and sister?

262
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,640
I would never take you in
as a brother.

263
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
Never...

264
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,760
Do you want?

265
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,440
Yes.

266
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm pregnant.

267
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,840
So am I...
-It's not funny.

268
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,720
Whose is it?
-I don't know.

269
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,480
It's not important.

270
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,480
It doesn't matter.

271
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,640
Listen
-What?

272
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,400
What, man?

273
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,400
Say it, man.
-We gonna play.

274
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,560
We'll get Blondie and Pasha.

275
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,560
Great.

276
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
You feel like playin'? -Damn,
I fell like fucking playin'.

277
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,760
Even in Debar?

278
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Even for Eskimos,
as Ljak would say.

279
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,080
And me?

280
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,880
What about you?

281
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,320
Will I hang along?

282
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,400
Yeah. -Really?
-No.

283
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,280
I was supposed to start
gathering the band.

284
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,400
Like those cowboys
in ''The Wild Bunch''...

285
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,560
Blondie lives in some small
shitty place in southern Serbia.

286
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,000
Pasha is in Sarajevo.
Who knows where...

287
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,800
Minion imponible...

288
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
But my adrenaline started
rushing, I admit.

289
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,840
You really are a fag, you know?

290
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,920
Like a little pussy...

291
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
Fine, drown in this stink.

292
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
Who's not coming with us,
can take it up the ass.

293
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Mirsa, bro, tell her.
Tell her I don't wanna go

294
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,240
to that blonde piece of shit!
Hello, what is it?

295
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,480
It's OK. -What else, man?
-I will play, but I am not going
after

296
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
that blonde jerk. -We'll find
somebody
else to come with us. Let's go.

297
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,000
You fat, nasty pig!

298
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,160
Who else are you gonna find?
Wait a little, Mirsa!

299
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,480
You like this? -Yeah, a lot.
And you?

300
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
Come on. -Stop it.

301
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,040
Nina's a real piece of work.
A shot of penicillin.

302
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,080
We were together
for seven years.

303
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,360
She wouldn't tell me
whose baby is she carrying.

304
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,280
I tried to persuade her
to have an abortion,

305
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,080
but not because I'm jealous,
I swear.

306
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,320
I even said that I will
claim the child as my own.

307
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480
It's only a matter of ideology,
the reason

308
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,640
why I don't wanna have children.

309
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,560
She got on to me saying that
I became a nihilist cause I was weak.

310
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
A clash, from the very beginning.

311
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,760
Why don't you two go alone?
I don't feel comfortable

312
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,040
taking the days off.
-It's only two days, jackass.

313
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,320
Why the hell are we goin', anyway?

314
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
Can we just call'em?

315
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,560
They'll blow us off
over the phone easily.

316
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,920
Besides,

317
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,160
I haven't left this city
for 17 years, man.

318
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,320
I feel like travelin', bro.

319
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Understand?

320
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,600
And, who's payin'?
Me? Again?

321
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Jero's gonna give us
some cash out-front.

322
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,960
Great.

323
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,320
Scream now, if you've got the balls.
-Shut up.

324
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,240
You think I'm scared
of Albanians? -Hey...

325
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,800
Are you fucking with me?

326
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,000
Who is it?
Jero, it's Mirsa. - What do you
want?

327
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,720
Can I come in?

328
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,240
Didn't you say

329
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,440
you'll try to find somebody else
-I tried, buddy. -Like hell you did.

330
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,840
They're not Keith Richards
and Charlie Watts.

331
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,080
OK, man. We ain't playin' then.

332
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,120
Don't try that cheap shot
on me. -Well...

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
How in the world did I make
a deal with you.

334
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,560
And you guys also don't
have passports, right?

335
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,080
Mirsa, bro, shouldn't we
all go home now? -Huh?

336
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
Should we go home?

337
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,600
What else?

338
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,240
But the day started great.
-Really, why are you so down?

339
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,080
Mirsa, wait.

340
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
Let's have a beer, bro.
Look at this.

341
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,360
Should I hit you once instead?

342
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,040
Bro, it's just one beer.
-You better both fuck yourselves.

343
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,720
The three of us.
It wants a beer, too.

344
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,560
I made a promise to the man.
He took the money out

345
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
of his own pocket.
-Fine.

346
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,920
Since you made a promise...

347
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,120
Hey, amateurs...
Wait for my sign!

348
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,520
Let's see what you
know, you fuck.

349
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,400
Are we ready?
Ready? -Ready.

350
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,120
You cunts... pussy!

351
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,360
Common!

352
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,560
Ljak! Ljak!

353
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,040
Congratulations!

354
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,680
Long live Gzim, bro!

355
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,360
Time's on the run, but fuck.
I felt like havin' a beer.

356
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,920
As Ljak would say:
Fuck Jero, he'll have to wait.

357
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,520
After all, he needs us,
not the other way around.

358
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Are you pissed off?

359
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,160
I am.

360
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,600
It's no big deal, I'll come
handy to you guys for the gig.

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,920
If there is one. -Why not?
You feel like playing, or what?

362
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
Those NGO vultures
don't give a fuck.

363
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,040
Big deal, it's important
that you guys are playing.

364
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
He's followin' your every step.
I'm here.

365
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,720
Cunt!

366
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,360
Hey, you cunt...

367
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,000
You crazy fool...

368
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,160
Be careful here, you steed!
-You be careful.

369
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,160
Mirsa... Mirsa!

370
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,920
You should've been a little
quieter last night.

371
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,680
They arranged a gig for us.

372
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,520
You goin' all over through
that stupid stuff again?

373
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,000
You shouldn't give a flying
fuck about what I'm doing.

374
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Mirsa! -Bro, brother.
-Mirsa!

375
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,000
Take it easy, honey, you're
going to kill your dad.

376
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,680
Hold on, I'm going in.

377
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,600
You gonna kill your old man.

378
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,440
Mirsa, my old man was
pushy about coming here.

379
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm leaving him in deposit with you,
deal with him.

380
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,040
OK, sweetie, daddy can
take it from here.

381
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,240
You go back to school.
Go now!

382
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,960
You fucked us all, jerk.
We should have been

383
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,680
on the road by now.

384
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,400
Where did you get this?
-Don't know.

385
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,560
Someone gave it to me.

386
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,360
Where did you get this, man?
-Why are you yelling at me?

387
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,440
Mirsa gave me the money.
That's where I got that.

388
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,200
Mirsa gave it to me.
Didn't you put cash in my hand?

389
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,640
Come on, say somethin'.

390
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,480
You told me to buy for everyone;
to do what I'm gonna do.

391
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,080
Fine, where is the
rest of the money?

392
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,440
I blew it all.

393
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,400
You should've stayed. Really.

394
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,240
You know, it was a bomb.

395
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,520
No, Nina. You know
what it was like?

396
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,120
We're so screwed.

397
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,560
Quiet, you asshole!

398
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,000
Look at him fucker.
-Let go, damn it.

399
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He's a fucking idiot.
Go see what he's doin'

400
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,800
Careful, let me. I can handle it.

401
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,960
Done. Go, go...

402
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,840
This pig is heavy, faster.

403
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,200
Done.

404
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,920
I'm a Houdini.

405
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,160
You're not helping me any.
Fuck, I'm dyin' here.

406
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,120
Let this wasted animal help you.

407
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,200
This is it, boss.

408
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,560
Bundesliga fleisch.

409
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,720
Buddy, this is less
than a 100 euros.

410
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
See how big this beauty is.

411
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,720
If you wanna do it this way, fine.
If not, go somewhere else.

412
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,520
We want to.

413
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,000
Here, in Skopje, they're messin'
with us, callin' us dinosaurs,

414
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,200
like, the punk music
is dead which is a fact indeed.

415
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,080
But, the whole punk-idea is great.

416
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,800
We are I don't know
the biggest guerillas in the world.

417
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,640
Do or die! That's us.

418
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,480
Take.

419
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,680
And quit fuckin' around.
Clear?

420
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,600
Plus, you're running late.
-Yeah...

421
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,400
What the hell are you laughin' at?

422
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,920
Give me that.

423
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,880
So, what? A thing of beauty.

424
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,280
Wow, Turkish.

425
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,560
Jero.

426
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:40,839
You think he's going
to persuade him?

427
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,280
He will, my ass.

428
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
There's a problem.

429
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,800
What's the problem now?
-Wait.

430
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,040
I took 20 euros from my kids;
just in case...

431
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,040
You pig! -Quiet.

432
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,920
Look, Jero...
-What's up?

433
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,960
Don't get all pumped up right away.

434
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,320
Listen to me.
- What is it?

435
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,640
We need 250 euros...
-Are you out of your mind?

436
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:01,799
No, that's it.
Another 250 and that's the last.

437
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,840
It's a promise.

438
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,960
The end, that's the last
I mean, we're broke, bro.

439
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,440
OK, 100 Euros.

440
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,360
And this is the last time,
understand?
Jero, look...

441
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,200
I don't wanna hear a word.
Not a word. That's it!

442
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
Good job, boy.
Well done, Mirsa.

443
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,040
OK? Be back in three dam.

444
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,320
Understand? -Don't worry,
we are no adolescents.

445
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,400
Cause, if you're not back in three
days, then don't come back at all.

446
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,160
Fair deal.

447
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,280
And again, Jero was the one who
found Blondie's address.

448
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,320
He's got his sources.

449
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,840
When Yugoslavia crashed,
Blondie and his dad,

450
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,040
a Serbian officer in the Yugoslav
Army, went to Serbia.

451
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,680
It was like, temporary.

452
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,040
And this ''like temporary''
remained for 17 years.

453
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,840
And this?
-It's for the children.

454
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,920
What are we to do with you?

455
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,400
Suck my dick, you fuck!
-Look at her,

456
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,000
you motherfuckin' bitch.

457
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:32,559
Stop that,
you're getting' on my nerves.

458
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,080
I don't give a shit.

459
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,600
Pull him over.

460
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,200
Here, in Serbia,
people have a saying:

461
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,800
You can foresee the day
by the way the dawn looks.

462
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,120
We foresaw ourday
a long time ago.

463
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,600
Hey punks, going to Belgrade?
-No, to Leskovac.

464
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,280
Well, come on, why are you
standing there like monkeys?

465
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,640
Wow, we're saved.

466
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm Tarzan... He's Chita.
Jane.

467
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,480
Where are you from?
-I'm Slovenian.

468
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,960
Can't you see that I'm beautiful?
-Oh, yeah...

469
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,760
Communism, communism...
-Fuck communism. Anarchism!

470
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,520
Take it...

471
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,160
What's that group that Blondie's in?
-I have no idea.

472
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,520
They're tryin' to get off the
''horse''.

473
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,280
Somethin' like love, nature,
understanding...

474
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,840
That kind of a shit ''feng-shui''.
Bite my ass.

475
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,040
Fuckin' pieces of shit.

476
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,400
Did you take a piss, you pig?

477
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,080
No, I took a shit.

478
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,920
Well, that's a bad sign.

479
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,280
For a while there, Blondie kept
calling from Serbia.

480
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,280
He even came once...

481
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,320
And, this was to be a band-reunion.
My ass, we busted like a soap-bubble.

482
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,040
On our first rehearsal.

483
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,640
I don't know why Ljak and Blondie
got into a fight.

484
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,760
They had the same girlfriend.
Mimi...

485
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,960
But that's not why.

486
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,160
They couldn't stand each other,
just like Jero and I...

487
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,040
Take it. Take it,
don't be a fag, motherfucker.

488
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,840
Do I look like a caddy to you?

489
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,240
It's important
to know that we are all one.

490
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,400
It's even more important to feel
that love's what spins the world.

491
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,120
Love! Remember that.

492
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,920
And we drain that love

493
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,200
from the Earth,
from ih depths

494
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,320
and ih roots.

495
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,280
Let us all...

496
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,040
hold hands.

497
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,160
And send a strong
message of Love.

498
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:54,480
Imagine that this message of ours
should reach the Universe,

499
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,600
the Gods,

500
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,680
Eternity.
Come on,

501
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,440
concentrate.

502
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,040
Breathe in...

503
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,520
Your body's here, but your spirit's
out there, with the spirit of Love.

504
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,720
Concentrate... there you go.

505
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
Travel go deeper.

506
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,600
Don't, stop it.
-Be still.

507
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,160
We gonna fly this
monkey into the Universe now.

508
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,840
As Leica did. -Leica was
a dog, not a monkey.

509
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,320
Didn't some monkeys fly
as well? -Yeah, they did.

510
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,920
Concentrate...

511
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,880
Mirsa, look.

512
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,680
Take a breath...

513
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,120
Not a monkey, nor a dog.
A grouse.

514
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,920
A primitive animal in love.

515
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,480
I'm proud to inform you that
this here is Eldorado.

516
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,400
Skopje ain't shit.

517
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,880
And now what?
You're not coming with us?

518
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,720
It's a gig, you fool.

519
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
And?

520
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm glad you came.

521
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,640
I can't do it. -Yes you can,
but you don't want to.

522
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,680
A pussy brainwashed you?

523
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,600
Ljak, don't do that!

524
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,720
What are you doin'?
-What do you want?

525
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,360
What are you up to?
-What's with you?

526
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,520
What's with you, you piece of shit?
Stay down!

527
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,960
You blonde shit!
Stay down!

528
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,040
Blondie, stay down,
or I'll drown you, you shithead.

529
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,840
You blonde shit!
Stay down!

530
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,360
I'm gonna drown you,
motherfucker.

531
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,080
Are you crazy,
you motherfuckers?

532
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,360
I'll drown him. Shout at him!
-You fat pig! -Stop it!

533
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,720
The band split up because of him!
-Because of me?! -Enough!

534
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,280
Why do you say this shit, you junkie?
We split up because of you!

535
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,400
Are you out of your fucking
mind, you motherfuckers?

536
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,480
Everything's gone to hell!
I don't believe in the afterlife,

537
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,400
but when I die, at least during
the first 50 years,

538
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:15,559
I'd like to be able to take a peak
into this planet's dwelling.

539
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:18,159
After that,
I could disappear forever...

540
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,800
I won't be givin' a fuck about a
thing.

541
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,960
Fuckin' pussy! If it wasn't for me,
you would've got your an kicked.

542
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,960
Look how pretty it is.
-It's beautiful.

543
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,800
You know what we gonna call it?

544
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,680
Ferdinand...
Look at him.

545
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,240
Bro, How can something
so small be so smart?

546
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,160
Look how smart and
pretty he is.

547
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,040
But the bulls are big, yet you
can still mess with them

548
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,920
with a red cloth for days.

549
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,120
Do you think that frogs
have souls?

550
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,160
This one does.

551
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,640
Ferdinand has a soul.
-Isn't that right?

552
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,880
I knew it.

553
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,440
Do the fleas and mosquitoes
have souls? -Fuck...

554
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,440
I guess not.

555
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,680
What do you think?
-They have nothing to hold it.

556
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,640
And where is Ferdinand's?
-Soul?

557
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,400
Right here.

558
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,080
Here? -Yes.

559
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,840
Ferdo, Ferdo...

560
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,280
They say some frogs release drugs.
-This one doesn't.

561
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,920
I checked him.

562
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
He's straight, bro.
As straight as I have seen.

563
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,120
Look how clear his eyes are?

564
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,360
Look clearer than mine.

565
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,680
Yeah, unbelievable, isn't it?

566
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,000
C'mon.

567
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,600
Come on, Ferdinand,
screw this faggot.

568
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,920
Our brother,

569
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,400
Sai Baba has said:

570
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,400
Don't fight the evil.

571
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Because the evil actually don't
exist.

572
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,760
Mirsa, give me your hand.

573
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,640
Give me your hand.

574
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,440
Hold him, hold him.
Hold him still.

575
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,160
Give me that.

576
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,040
You really are freaks.

577
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,320
Fuck me, but I gonna make
a junkie out of this God's creature.

578
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,200
If I don't,
you can call me ''Mohammed''.

579
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Hey, blonde...

580
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
We were the champs...

581
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,600
And? What did I get from that?

582
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:19,440
Beating... ''horse''?

583
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,840
Everything you get and everything
you lose is here, bro, here.

584
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,960
If it wasn't for these people,
I would've never be clean, brother.

585
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,880
It's clear to you that
I cannot come with you guys.

586
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,600
You're not helping me any...
-What's with you?

587
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,040
I wanna teach him how to take
a ''shot''. Turn him around.

588
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,240
Come on, stop.

589
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,360
How can you torture
that animal?

590
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,120
And how can you
torture these people here?

591
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,160
Ilija!

592
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,280
You really are something.
There's no way out for you guys.

593
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,360
You'll remain like this
until the end.

594
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,320
Ilija a newborn,
enlightened...

595
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,360
That's what we are like,
Blondie. Fuck it.

596
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,480
You are so full of shit all the time.
I told you that this blonde

597
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,320
piece of shit's gonna screw us.
This is not his first time, right?

598
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,320
Give it back.

599
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,120
I'll drink your blood and piss on
your grave, you slut.

600
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,280
If you're not a woman,
I would beat the shit out of you.

601
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,480
I'm scared shitless. -Slut.

602
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,920
You are a hero...
you can handle this.

603
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,600
It's not some hippy catch.

604
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,360
It doesn't matter,
anarchistic.

605
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,080
There's a difference.

606
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,840
A big one. -Yeah, right.

607
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,360
Fine, I'm a moron, and I don't
give a shit about those differences.

608
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,440
Simply, this baby's mine,
and I'm gonna raise it.

609
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,360
Why did you stop?

610
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,120
Mirsa is going to
be the daddy, right?

611
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,680
As you wish.

612
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,280
That's your problem.

613
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,760
But Blondie's a fool.
-How can you say that shit?

614
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,320
Go on, keep defending him.

615
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,520
Nobody understands you, too.
Same as him.

616
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,600
Stop screwing with me.
-You poor thing.

617
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,440
Stop screwing with me,
you hear?

618
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,960
You know what I think?
Seriously...

619
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,880
Please, tell me, ''seriously''.

620
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,000
The problem is here.
-Where?

621
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,480
Here.
-You don't say...

622
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,040
And a bit here...

623
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,320
And here as well.
-Yeah? -Yeah.

624
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,000
And also,

625
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,240
there...

626
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,280
Absolutely.

627
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,880
(singing) old communist song

628
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
What you're doing it's awful.
-We're doin' it cause of his teeth.

629
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,120
It's very important for him to
have healthy teeth. -What?

630
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,440
But, frogs have no teeth.
-This one does. Come and see.

631
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,160
This one is from Macedonia.
It's a mutant breed that's been

632
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,680
around since the time of
Alexander the Great.

633
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,760
You blonde shit!
-Way to go, Blondie!

634
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,480
We nearly collapsed on the trip
to Sarajevo 18 hours.

635
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:52,719
We're runnin' late, but I'm OK with
it.
I got excited,

636
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,720
like a kid with a lollipop.

637
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,640
The only thing that bothered us is
that we ran out of food for
Ferdinand.

638
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,360
Fuck this famous meat-pie
from Sarajevo. It's awful.

639
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:06,320
Ours is 100 times better.

640
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,200
Yeah, this is a real scam.
-Why? I like this one better.

641
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,280
You like it better?
You're no patriot at all.

642
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,680
I'm not, it's a fact. Fuck it.

643
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,120
Now you come to see me,
you hoodlums.

644
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,400
Quit saying shit.
This is business.

645
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,320
Congratulations.

646
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,840
There no salt in this.
And it's really hot.

647
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,800
Don't do that, I'm eatin'!
Don't, I'm eatin', you fucking pig.

648
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,920
Guys, now I have
some bad news.

649
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,320
But, take it easy on me.

650
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,320
It's possible

651
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,800
...that I cannot come with you.

652
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,120
Just maybe.

653
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,040
Why didn't you say so,
you circumcised fag,

654
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:14,199
so we didn't have
to come all this way.

655
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,320
How else would you see me?

656
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,840
You swine, you think someone would
travel all the way from Skopje

657
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,200
to see an ugly face like yours?

658
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,840
Mirsa, brother...

659
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,440
Would you come?
-Never.

660
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,400
See, swine? -I rang you guys,
but you were already on the move.

661
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,280
Suck my dick, asshole.
-Don't act all nice on me, you Gipsy.

662
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,080
I know when you're lyin'.

663
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,920
Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
-Oh, yeah? Yeah?

664
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,240
You wanna eat?
Wanna try Pasha's nuts?

665
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,200
I have to pick up the kids
from the kindergarten.

666
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,600
Com' on, we'll talk
on the way. Come on.

667
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,800
You didn't become some manager,
did ya, buddy?

668
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,800
I'm my own manager, son.

669
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,360
I'm a mediator between
the foreign invaders

670
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:12,600
and domestic business.

671
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,200
God provideth for the youngsters.
It'd be a shame for me to complain.

672
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,000
It's only two days, Pasha.

673
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,600
Mirsa, I'm no longer
the same Pasha.

674
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,320
We can see that you're not.

675
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,080
Plus, I got a shit load
of things to do, a shit load.

676
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,000
Hey, bro, take this
Pick up the kids,

677
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:38,600
keep goin' straight.
I'll see ya.

678
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,360
Hey, Pasha, wait!

679
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,560
I've no idea what Pasha's
business is all about,

680
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:47,360
nor where he got that rotten
white jeep with SFOR plates.

681
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,040
I didn't even ask.
I know, he'd lie to me.

682
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,720
Here you go. They were out of the
yellow one. They only had the red.

683
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,840
He's makin' trouble again.

684
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,760
We know him well
it's Pasha, all right.

685
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,520
Come on, don't fuck with me.
-No.

686
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,360
What color are his eyes?
-Violet, like yours.

687
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,280
I don't have eyes like a frog.
-No, they're pretty, like yours.

688
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,280
Notice the way he's lookin' at you.

689
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,640
Look how much he loves you,
I swear.

690
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,120
Pasha was the strongest,
musically speaking.

691
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,440
He was schooled for it.
Notes, and stuff like that.

692
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,240
He went to Sarajevo a little
before hell broke loose.

693
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:08,720
His mother was a Muslim, and his
father was one of us, a Macedonian.

694
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,040
I guess they thought that they'd
save their asses easier there.

695
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,040
But after a while, it was
too late for them to come back.

696
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,840
I really hadn't hoped that
he'd let me down.

697
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,880
A traitor...

698
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,800
I thought that I'd see a lot more
traces of the war in Sarajevo.

699
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,040
A cataclysm.

700
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,920
My ass. They cleaned it up,
those NGO's Mariah and company.

701
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:44,480
I found just some poor girl's handbag

702
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:46,240
with condoms in it,
'Made in Yugoslavia'.

703
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,640
Fuck, it really blows.

704
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,120
Don't, it's a sin!
-What?

705
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:22,320
What? I didn't hear you.
-Not that kind of sin.

706
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,040
It's somebody's secret.
It's not OK.

707
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,640
Do you think I'm an idiot?

708
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, I think you are.

709
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,760
What happened with my little
anarchist? He turned into a pussy?

710
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,080
Stop shittin', please.

711
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,200
Hey,

712
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,400
are you still mad?
Wasn't this cynical enough for you?

713
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,760
I mean, it's stupid, Nina!
Really stupid!

714
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:29,480
Where did you guys disappear?
-Oh, here...

715
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,200
You weren't gettin' ready to fuck,
were you?

716
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,840
We're done fucking.
Now, we're just a little pregnant.

717
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,440
Mirsa, bro.

718
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,960
We're going without Pasha,
huh? -Well, that's it.

719
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,400
Fucking little lizard.

720
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:08,640
Screw me, bro,

721
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,520
but I was sure that the blonde
shit is the one who gonna fuck us.

722
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,840
If you, too, had a business...

723
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,320
You said seven o'clock.
It's 15 after seven.

724
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:20,600
I'll do it. I will.

725
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:23,360
Don't lie to us!
-Sign the papers.

726
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:27,600
What happened?

727
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,640
They picked him up
from his bed. That's all.

728
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,400
I'll get it, I swear
Sign'em, motherfucker! Sign them!

729
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,760
Sign'em, motherfucker!
-I'll do it!

730
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,680
I'll do it. Take it easy.
Easy...

731
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,360
Are you OK?

732
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:56,040
No, I'm not.

733
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:58,880
Sorry, brothers, I got myself
into a situation.

734
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,640
Fine, fuck it, some other time.

735
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,440
When are you playing?
-Saturday.

736
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,840
I'm gonna keep
my fingers crossed.

737
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,320
Ferdinand got a diarrhea in Nish.

738
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,640
The chicks got scared
off their minds.

739
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:22,120
We're two days late.
Jero's gonna be really pined.

740
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,760
I don't give a shit.

741
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,000
Wait, wait.
Stop.

742
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,480
This's not right. -What's right then?
-This was not right.

743
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,960
Ljak, when did you start your part?
-I start on the fourth,

744
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,520
same as I have been my whole life.
The blonde shit behind you

745
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:52,040
starts on the third.
-Don't look at me.

746
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,320
You're the one who's
singing... nah, nuh, nah.

747
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,920
So the lyrics are the problem?
-Come on, it'll all come back to you.

748
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,240
I don't know the lyrics?
-You don't.

749
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Mirsa!

750
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,160
Hey, Mirsa!

751
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,080
Hey, you eagles.

752
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,960
The whole hood's rocking.

753
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:12,960
Hi.

754
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,960
Glad to meet you, folks.
I'm Mariah, I'm Danish.

755
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,520
Hi. -Hello, Maria...

756
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,560
I am Ljak.

757
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,920
Can I kiss you?

758
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:34,000
No.

759
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:42,400
Come here.

760
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,720
Meet Besim.

761
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,400
He's talented musician.
He'll be playin' whith you guys.

762
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,640
Say what?
-I can't believe it.

763
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,080
Are these silly photos yours?
I adore you, Sid Vicious.

764
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,320
Jero. Jero!

765
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,800
What is this?

766
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:14,560
Don't look at me that way.

767
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,760
You got screwed by the Bosnian,
so he's gonna fill in for him

768
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,520
and help you
with the song in Albanian.

769
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,320
It's a must, bro. Understand?

770
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,480
Multi-culture, damn it.

771
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,600
Hey, friend, we're playing punk!
-What can I say, it's a must.

772
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,360
What?
-Guys, I don't wanna hear anything.

773
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,680
The band has to be mixed.
That's it.

774
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,120
Come again, man.

775
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,680
Fuck it.

776
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,080
Big deal.

777
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,920
We found ourselves in
a ''brotherhood and unity deal''

778
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,800
with those NGO fucks.

779
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,360
It's not like we don't know
they're screwing with us,

780
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,840
but fuck them move on.

781
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,960
Let uncle Ljak take
a photo of you and Ferdinand.

782
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,240
There you go...

783
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,440
I love him. He's so cute.
-Uncle Ljak's gonna

784
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,760
take a photo of you with ''acute''.
For real.

785
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,000
Say sex -Sex.
-Seeeex... Everybody, sex.

786
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,280
What do you mean a threesome?
-Easy.

787
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,560
Ljak, Blondie and Mimi,
together.

788
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,360
No way.

789
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,440
With fucking and sucking
and all that?

790
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,960
Like, I'm fucking you
while you blowing Blondie?

791
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:55,119
All that, fucking sucking.
-Don't be stupid.

792
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,520
They do it all the time in India.
There are a million combinations.

793
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:04,640
Really?
-Ljak's right.

794
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,840
You're not being concrete.

795
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,720
Like, he's here, you're there,
and I'm on the other side.

796
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,480
You sissies scared, huh?
-Yeah, sure thing.

797
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,920
You rotten fags... All I'm trying
is to bring you close again.

798
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,640
Both of you to be great
and play together again.

799
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:35,559
I knew the dude with Nina
- Borche Orbital.

800
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:42,400
He was one of us, then he became
a techno DJ in ''A-Quadro''.

801
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:46,840
Of all the people in this town,
she found him.

802
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,720
Chaos is my drive.

803
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,840
Do not have any rules.

804
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,760
When they build a wall
in front of you,

805
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,880
you'll have to pin on it
and do somethin' else.

806
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,080
You should never, never
be completely understood.

807
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:11,520
That's a full stop.
The end.

808
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:13,680
I don't like full stops.

809
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,000
Excuse me.

810
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:31,200
It's a day in Buenos Aires
at this moment,

811
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,720
and it's winter.

812
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,720
Let me in, Mirsa.

813
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:40,400
I'm gonna stay here, even
sleep here, until you let me in.

814
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,840
Please.

815
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,880
Please, Mirsa.

816
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,280
Are you listenin'?

817
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,320
The baby's his.
-You're so lying.

818
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,000
Maybe I'm lyin' to you.

819
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,640
I don't know.
I can't be... 100 percent sure.

820
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,560
He wants the same thing you want.
He's offering me cash

821
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,520
to have an abortion.

822
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:28,679
I'm not offering you cash! I'm not
making you have an abortion.

823
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,000
Change the fuckin' subject!

824
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,120
I'm telling you, we were only
sitting in the car.

825
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,320
I saw you.

826
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,520
You're shittin'.

827
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,920
You're full of it, boy.

828
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,320
My love...

829
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,440
Nina loses her grip when I tell
her that she's carrying just another

830
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,120
wretch on the face of the Earth.
It's a fact. That's what I think.

831
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,360
But, I made a promise to her
that I myself will pierce

832
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,640
the child's ear on his first
birthday.

833
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,080
(singing in Albanian)

834
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,760
Wait, stop. Stop!

835
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,000
What does it say here,
''zemra im'' or Ibrahim?

836
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,160
Blow me, Mirsa. What do I look like
to you? Why should I know

837
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:24,280
how to sing lousy Albanian song.
Sorry, brother. -No problem.

838
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,880
You don't need to know anything!
What does this say?

839
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:32,160
''Zemra im'' or Ibrahim?
Zemra im.

840
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,640
Then why do you sing Ibrahim,
you fucking retard.

841
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,160
Wait...

842
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,160
Because, that's how it comes to me.
-It comes to you? -Yes.

843
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:45,400
It comes to you to say Ibrahim?
-Yeah, it comes to me to say Ibrahim.

844
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,800
Fuck you, and fuck Ibrahim
Sorry, brother, really.

845
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,160
That's how it comes to me.

846
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,600
What's up,
you little fags from Skopje?

847
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,280
You wanted to play without me.

848
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:06,360
Hello, Mirsa.

849
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:14,760
I cannot believe this, man.

850
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,360
Look at this ugly Bosnian face.

851
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:21,960
People, you won't believe me.
You'll think that I'm a pussy.

852
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:24,160
You are a pussy
all right, big time pussy.

853
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,080
People, I was drivin' down the road

854
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,720
when I see this sign: ''Skopje''.

855
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:37,520
And then I started cryin'...

856
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:39,920
tears in my eyes.

857
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,280
Just like I was one of
those poor immigrant workers.

858
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,800
I swear.

859
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:49,120
It's the truth.

860
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,680
What's with you, people?

861
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,600
Why are you so quiet?

862
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,560
We're goin' to a game. ''Vardar'' is
playin. -Go away, you fool.

863
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:05,120
Ljak!

864
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,400
Pasha, you're a big man!

865
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,640
Why is the stadium so empty?
-That's how it is lately.

866
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,560
Mirsa! -Hey, there goes Fritz.
-Hey, you're the man! -Hello, Fritz.

867
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:23,280
You are the best. A legend!

868
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,400
Is that Blondie?
-It's Blondie.

869
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,120
And Pasha? Hello, Pasha.

870
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,080
You are going to perform, huh?
Let me know, do you hear?

871
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,480
What'ya doin' here?
Aren't you at the game?

872
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,240
The game's over.
It started at one o'clock.

873
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,840
We lost. -It's over?
-Take care.

874
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:45,200
You did this on purpose to me.
-Yeah, right.

875
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,880
You did it on purpose, I know.

876
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,160
There goes Vardar, see?
-Thanks, friends. Thanks.

877
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,640
He wanted to see
''Vardar'' play soccer.

878
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,200
Shitheads, I haven't seen a
football game in a long time.

879
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,560
Stop hittin' me.

880
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,120
You get on my nerves
with that football shit.

881
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,880
What's up, slackers?

882
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,160
I'm tired of waitin' damn it.

883
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,560
NGO! What's up?

884
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:09,200
What'ya doin' here?
Did you bring us some cash?

885
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,200
Very funny.
-Hey, Jero, this is Pasha.

886
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:16,080
This is Sali, a young trumpet
player. Gipsy. -Another one?

887
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,000
He'll come handy to you guys.

888
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,040
To hell with him, there are
already too many of us.

889
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,640
I'm living him here with you,
do whatever you want.

890
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,640
I'm not going to take
your bull shit talk.

891
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,400
Jero, aren't you being an
asshole a bit too much?

892
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,520
Ljak! Be still.

893
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,000
Jero, what was our deal,
huh? What was the deal?

894
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,440
Where did you guys
crawl up from? Damn it. Mirsa!

895
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,640
You stay here.
-You can't do this, Jero.

896
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,200
Hold on, you can't.

897
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,680
Hold on, dude!

898
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,440
Fine, fine...
-It's not working out.

899
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,000
Guys, we are going again.

900
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,720
Only the chorus.

901
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,120
Pasha, you're great.
-I know.

902
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,960
Hey, kid...

903
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,520
Come here.

904
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:56,000
Go stand over there,
next to Blondie.

905
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,720
A big band, hey Mirsa?

906
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,600
We can play at weddings now.

907
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,760
Are you done?
-Two more seconds.

908
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,960
Come on.

909
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,080
Wow...

910
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:51,440
That Milka did a great job.

911
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:57,120
This is awesome.

912
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,880
Look how she spelled ''dead''.

913
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,520
She's a sweetheart...

914
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,320
To Debar, to Debar, to Debar...
Macedonian folks...

915
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:21,640
How far is that Debar of yours?
-Two days of horseback riding.

916
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,360
We'll cut across through
the villages. It's faster.

917
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:38,920
And now what?
-Where are we going, Jero?

918
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:40,560
Pasha!

919
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,600
The granny here...
yeah, this granny...

920
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,280
Granny, Debar?
-Who are you?

921
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,520
Are you one of us or them?
-We're one of ours.

922
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,920
Then, what are you doing here?
-We got lost, granny. Lost...

923
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,200
To go to Debar, go straight
up the hill, then take a right.

924
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:00,359
May the Lord guard you, children.

925
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,640
Why in the world are you going there?
-We're in a hurry, granny.

926
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,480
A lot of their people are on this
path.
-Huh?

927
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,880
Thanks, thanks a lot, granny.
We'll be careful.

928
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:34,400
Turn the engine off.

929
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,080
We are screwed.

930
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:41,400
Nobody says a word.
Let me do the talkin'.

931
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:54,080
Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

932
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:56,760
Are you all one of ours?
-We are, we are...

933
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:22,360
Brother, we're in a rush.

934
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,200
Where?
-To a concert in Debar.

935
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,320
What do you have in there?

936
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:37,120
I'm asking what do you
have in there? -An accordion.

937
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,080
No passage allowed.
You can't go further.

938
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,920
Brother, we're in a rush.
I have to take the guys to a concert.

939
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:54,920
Plus, we are one of yours.

940
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,920
You can't go.

941
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:04,080
What's that?

942
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,800
What is that?
-Ljak -Ljak.

943
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,480
Hey, you, what
do you have in there?

944
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,320
Give it.
-No way. No way...

945
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,560
Give it to him, you imbecile.

946
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,640
Open it. Open it!

947
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:27,320
That was it...

948
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:30,840
Open... c'mon.

949
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,880
Hey, guys, come here!
Come and see this.

950
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,320
C'mon, start it!
Come on!

951
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,960
Have a nice time!
-And a safe trip!

952
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,080
Motherfuckers!

953
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:39,640
Hello, guys. Come with me,
I will explain everything.

954
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,800
Mariah?

955
01:16:56,359 --> 01:16:58,520
What the fuck is this?
-What's this?

956
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:00,920
System break-down.

957
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:04,360
These are packin', bro.
-Well, they've already left, bro

958
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:08,560
Honey, you can't do this to me.
-I can, believe me.

959
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,920
And I am doing it right now.

960
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,680
It's crazy, and it's cruel.

961
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,240
Miss Rasmunen, please hurry up.

962
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,280
I'm very sorry, Gzim.
I regret very much.

963
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,880
But unfortunately this is not
the issue at the moment,

964
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,760
so we should all fuck off!

965
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,880
Motherfuckers.

966
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,880
Fuck the punks.
Tell them it's the swine flu.

967
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:42,080
And you know, we are late.
-Yeah.

968
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,240
Excuse me.
-Motherfucker.

969
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:52,680
Jero, what's the problem?

970
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,600
It's a shame we couldn't do this,
sweethearts. I love ya.

971
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:58,600
Gzim will explain it to you.
Take care.

972
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:01,040
Guys, it's from the highest level.

973
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:07,120
Believe me, it's not up to us.
-Then, to who is it up to, you fucks?

974
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,320
This is not right, you gangsters!
-Let me fuck the bitch in the
vehicle.

975
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,600
Mariah's multi-culti kept on bouncing
in my mind. Just like a mantra.

976
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,560
Motherfuckers, all of them
motherfuckers.

977
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,760
Everything is going to be OK.

978
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,480
Hi, little meety.

979
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,760
It's a frog. -Ferizai?
-Ferdinand.

980
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:04,680
Ferdinand.

981
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:35,800
You'll never walk alone, baby.

982
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,240
Mimi, sweetheart.

983
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:54,640
Drugs?

984
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:57,560
Blondie, sweetheart,
yeah.

985
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,160
Drugs.

986
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,600
Are you OK, brother?

987
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,560
Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah...

988
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:40,600
I swear, Jero, everything is OK.

989
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,440
Jero, bro...

990
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:49,200
Wait for me, be right back.

991
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,040
Jeronimo!

992
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:04,800
And?

993
01:21:06,439 --> 01:21:07,680
Tell us.

994
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,560
Tell us, really. -Say it.

995
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:12,240
What is it?

996
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,080
We're playing.

997
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:17,560
You're lying, bitch.
-You're lying...

998
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:20,080
Guys, we're playing!
-Stop shittin' us.

999
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,240
I made a deal!

1000
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:26,720
A gig, bro!

1001
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,960
Tonight, at the centre of culture.
I made a deal.

1002
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:33,640
C'mon, Pasha.

1003
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:37,280
Way to go.

1004
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,880
Don't close the bottle.

1005
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:42,080
We're starting in five minutes.

1006
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:44,720
You guys, behave.
-Are there people out there?

1007
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,360
They'll show up.
Questions?

1008
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,400
OK? Fine.

1009
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,720
Ladies and gentlemen, it's an
honor to present to you

1010
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,480
the multi-culti band from Skopje
''Worker's therapy''.

1011
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,320
Thank you for your presence.

1012
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,720
Let's go. Are we ready?

1013
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:17,560
You stay here now
Daddy has a little gig,

1014
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,840
daddy has to work.

1015
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,680
Be nice, don't get into trouble,
daddy have job to do.

1016
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,880
Let's bust them, Ljak.
-That's right, we'll bust them.

1017
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:28,840
Of course we'll bust'em.
Isn't that right, Ferdo?

1018
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,360
What is this?

1019
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,800
Be quiet, brother and
keep on rockin'.

1020
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,960
Look at the bald one.

1021
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:01,640
Fuck... ready?

1022
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:22,600
Mirsa, follow me, bro!

1023
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,400
C'mon.

1024
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:55,280
Monkeys!

1025
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,840
What kind of shitty music is this,
you motherfuckers?

1026
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:08,320
Stop playing and come outside!
-Go home! Leave!

1027
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,560
You fuckin' losers, get outside!

1028
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,360
Are you showin' your dick to me?
What the fuck? To me?

1029
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,680
Buddy, be careful. Be careful.

1030
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,800
Look, there's a problem!

1031
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:27,960
To whom is he showing
his dick, motherfucker?

1032
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:29,800
Take'em outside!
-It's OK.

1033
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:32,600
Do we understand each other?
Understood?

1034
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,600
You sit down!

1035
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,160
Bring in more guys,
there's a chaos in here.

1036
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:47,760
Hurry! Hurry up!

1037
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:58,360
There's gonna be trouble!
-Fuck'em, bro. Let'em come!

1038
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:08,840
They came here and
they're toyin' with us!

1039
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,880
Who the fuck are they?

1040
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,800
I'm gonna take your soul,
you motherfucker!

1041
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:27,760
Get'em outside!
-Throw them out!

1042
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,120
Come outside, or
we'll kill you in here!

1043
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,400
Go outside.

1044
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,160
Calm down, brothers,
we're one of yours.

1045
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,560
Go outside! -Calm down, please.
-Come outside.

1046
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,800
Move, or I'll hit you.

1047
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,600
Run, guys. Run now...

1048
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,720
Move, I will bust your ass!

1049
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:07,480
Run, you monkey! Run!
Screw the gig! Run!

1050
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,080
I'll fuck your wife, asshole!

1051
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:10,800
Let me get'em!
-You fucking cunt!

1052
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,320
Run, you idiot.

1053
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,640
Nina!

1054
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:18,440
Run, run! Fast.

1055
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,240
Ferdinand...

1056
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:26,440
Hey, son.
Here you are.

1057
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,560
Good.

1058
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,320
What 'bout the instruments?

1059
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:34,200
Run, bro, run!

1060
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,160
Kid, c'mon!

1061
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,280
Where'd they go?
-There!

1062
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:50,040
If they catch us, we're fucked.
We're fucked!

1063
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:52,600
Do something! Do something

1064
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,360
Hello?!
What do you mean ten minutes?

1065
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,720
Hurry up and get'em!
Hurry up, you idiot!

1066
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,840
Take this.

1067
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,320
Move, move!

1068
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,960
Mirsa! -What is it, Sali?

1069
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:19,040
C'mon, hurry up.

1070
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,560
Keep hittin' the door, fucker.

1071
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,520
Let's go from the other side.
-Where? -On the other side.

1072
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,480
Catch her, Blondie.

1073
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:34,640
Come on.
Come on, Mirsa.

1074
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:37,520
Come on, bro.
-Come on, Mirsa

1075
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,000
Drive!

1076
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,960
Hold on, you shitheads!

1077
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
We performed, bro.

1078
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:55,160
We performed....
-We performed, yeah.

1079
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,440
Despite the organizer's good
intentions, this concert of tolerance

1080
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,720
turned into a violent incindent,
where serious consequences

1081
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,480
were avoided by an inch...

1082
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:35,760
The extradition of Lirim Jakupi
- The Nazi is uncertain.

1083
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,160
Kosovo remains silent
on this matter.

1084
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:40,240
Panic not, the price of
bread will not rise.

1085
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:42,040
Hey, you junkie,

1086
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,640
do I have to learn from the TV
that you're back?

1087
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,200
How did you get the power
back on, Milka?

1088
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,760
Kiki broke off the seal
and connected us.

1089
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,120
Hey!

1090
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:59,520
I saw on TV that it was rough, huh?
-It was great, until they threw us
out.

1091
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,960
But...

1092
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:11,400
It brought you luck, right?

1093
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:19,560
Take it.

1094
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,880
A little memento from Skopje.

1095
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,200
It's nice.

1096
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:28,200
Is it a male or a female?

1097
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,120
A female. Her name is Elisabeth.
-Yeah?

1098
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,200
Yes. She's Ferdinand's girlfriend.

1099
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,400
You really are a fag because
you're splittin' them up.

1100
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,560
Isn't that right, Ferdo? -''Little
fag..''
-See, you're a fag.

1101
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,280
I have to, brother.
-Why do you have to?

1102
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:48,840
It's Tuesday... it's bad luck.

1103
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,680
It's a night.

1104
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,120
Pasha, give us a minute, please.

1105
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:02,360
Let's baptize the kid.

1106
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,600
Hold the frog.

1107
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,880
Come with us,
we wanna tell you somthin'.

1108
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:10,960
Oh, no you're not.

1109
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,400
Blondie, grab a hold of him.
That's good.

1110
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,080
Now, you are one of us.

1111
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,960
Let me have Ferdinand.

1112
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,160
Fuck you, your daddy's
gonna make you a punk.

1113
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,000
Where are you, champs?

1114
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:51,760
You're going to sing
to the Albanians, huh?

1115
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,880
You motherfucking sell-offs.

1116
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:57,960
There are too many of them?
-Too many.

1117
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,440
Should we run?
-We run.

1118
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,240
Catch'em. Faster.
Catch'em.

1119
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:19,360
Run to the left!

1120
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,800
Run that way!

1121
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,120
Stop. -What is it?

1122
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:33,240
Ferdinand.

1123
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,040
You motherfucker!

1124
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,080
Ljak!

1125
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,240
Where are you going,
you piece of shit.

1126
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:51,800
I'm gonna cripple you,
you shit!

1127
01:32:52,039 --> 01:32:53,680
Motherfuckers.

1128
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,240
Shitheads!

1129
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,920
You're going to play
for the Albanians?

1130
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:08,760
You motherfuckers. Mirsa!

1131
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,560
Die, you piece of dirt.

1132
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:44,520
Wow, man. Wait, stand up.

1133
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,360
Real cunts, bro.
Cunts!

1134
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,920
They screwed us good, huh?

1135
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,560
Motherfuckers.. all of them.

1136
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,880
We were all at the funeral.
Except Pasha.

1137
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:05,760
They kept him at the hospihl.
He had severe injuries.

1138
01:36:06,039 --> 01:36:09,160
As my grandpa Kuzman used
to say: ''May dogs piss on

1139
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,640
the graves of those who work
in the emergency rooms".

1140
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,920
But, not only theirs.

1141
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:21,640
And we decided to call this place:
''Ferdinand's grave''.

1142
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:29,320
Brother, let me ask you somethin'.

1143
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:31,800
Do you still jerk off?

1144
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,000
All the time.

1145
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,040
All the time?
-All the time.

1146
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:38,840
Do you spank it?
-Yeah, the whole deal.

1147
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,760
Do you jerk off?
-I jerk off.

1148
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,880
When was the last time you did it?
-Yesterday.

1149
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:45,840
How 'bout you?
-Me? Tonight.

1150
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,680
Jero, what about you?
-How should I put this, bro?

1151
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,760
Me too.
I don't wanna to lie to you.

1152
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,560
Nina, brother, do you jerk off?

1153
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:00,200
Wow!

1154
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:05,200
Or does Mirsa do it by himself?
