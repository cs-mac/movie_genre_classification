133

When did you decide to fly?

374
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:36,498
So the world can evaluate

375
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,373

. This is our place, this is our home

429
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:21,235
The only reason they did this by
. Is because they knew they would not be punished

430
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:24,374
The fear of someone taking

431
00:33:24,374 --> 00:33:26,623
. Would hit toward your mouth

432
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,906
. Highly suddenly become courageous

433
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:35,208
Perhaps this is true, but the laws
. Are the laws

434
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:36,973
. You should not use violence

435
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:46,817
We must mean something

436
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:50,305
. They made me look cowardly flight, what they did

00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:02,260
Over the weekend, my brothers

440
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:04,881
. They treat us well

441
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:08,871
. So what was being tolerated by the Government

442
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,879
. I mean, the laws were almost the same here

443
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,024
. No one could hear

444
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,304
. But this is the worst for them

445
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,982
. Such as insulting us

446
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:27,364
. This is what we have to do

447
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,667
. We humiliated

448
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,652
What is your problem?

449
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:14,888
. This is to encourage them -
Why? -

450
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:15,926
What do you speak? -
. Shut up -

451
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:19,135

00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:35,661
. Such as what happened today

454
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:38,772
Does this make sense?

455
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:42,604
I told

456
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:44,237

457
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:45,869
. Yes

458
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:47,683

496
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,805
. Trust me, this is not important

497
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:04,428
. No. 51, should play

498
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:05,943
! Let's go, come on

499
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:11,773
I want to do this because I need
. To medicine

500
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:12,873
There is in my bag

501
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:14,757
You can find it -
Enough -

502
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,591
! Let him stand up, come on

503
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,150
Come on! Come on -
Can not -

504
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,800
Why not let the man rest?

505
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,224
No 77

506
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:33,736
Must gather all the prisoners

507
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:35,964
. And do not talk to me

508
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:38,061
. However, I spoke with you first

509
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:41,077
! Oh man, look at him

510
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:42,840
. Man, can not do

511
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:55,141
You understand that this is the experience of imprisonment
True?

512
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:56,495
. Yes

513
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:58,227
. And if you understand

514
00:40:58,585 --> 00:41:02,854
. Laws that walk by -
. As is obvious -

515
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,442
. You are a prisoner

516
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:11,392
. You do not give orders, we give

517
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:15,354
Am I clear to you?

518
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:23,048
. Let the man Ertaj

519
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:33,161
Do I have to begin the punishment now?

520
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:35,879
Is this what you want?

521
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:39,551
What is supposed to mean this?

522
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,843
This means, if not shut up

523
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:50,460
. I will try to know how will I cope with this

524
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:55,905
Why not try to be rational?

525
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:59,029
What do you think of this reason?
Oobdo wise to you now?

526
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:00,890
Leave the man -
. Do it -

527
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,936
Does it sound reasonable now?

528
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:06,138
. The extended hand, the experiment ended

529
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,350
. You know this

530
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:09,854
. And I know this

531
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:12,757
To prison now, come on

532
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:15,852
. There is nothing wrong

533
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:16,877
. Well all of us

534
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:18,222
To Zenzanatkm

535
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:20,954
. Come on, guards, bring them to the cells

536
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:22,008
. Come on

537
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,982
Why entered the prison experience?

538
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:18,716
. These animals inside the cage

539
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:22,899
. We'll find out which one of us will be al-Assad

540
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,778
. Who will own and daring

541
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:32,290
I think we are top of the revolution that
. Restricted monkeys

542
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,623
It does not matter, how much we will still be humming?

543
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,852
. Eat a strong showing of the secular

544
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,530
. These are the things

545
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,153
. Otalmt this in prison for 17?

546
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:56,200
. You probably think I'm someone else -
. No -

547
00:43:56,664 --> 00:44:02,658
I saw you, looks strong
. So I thought to be one of the supports me

548
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:11,189
You are trying to topple its regime
True, young man?

549
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:14,236
. I see a lot of the channel detection

550
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:18,888
. Citizens by not stand for the money

551
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:23,631
Otaatvhm this?

552
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:27,020
. There is nothing wrong

553
00:44:35,848 --> 00:44:36,655
If

554
00:44:36,655 --> 00:44:38,368
Why entered anyway?

555
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,212
Did not ask me this before?

556
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:47,421
. Yes, I asked him

557
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,238
It is better to leave this young man

558
00:44:51,598 --> 00:44:52,775
áãÇÐÇ?

559
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,310
áãÇÐÇ?

560
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,978
She said that tampering with the guards
. Will face serious problems

561
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:04,658
Any guards? -
. Guards here -

562
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:06,733
. There

563
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,607
. Are driving everything

564
00:45:12,804 --> 00:45:15,535
. I propose that depends on the protection of a friend

565
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,137
This is the right way, man

566
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:20,808
It does not matter what the man wished to be like

567
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,709
. Ceased to disturb, you have no right to

568
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:31,483
This place has one rule
. And is to continue and only get a feel

569
00:45:32,498 --> 00:45:34,662
. Then you will be fine

570
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:36,995
. So let it go

571
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,746
. Trust me

572
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,020
. Let it go

573
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,140
. Tell me

574
00:45:49,048 --> 00:45:51,064
. I've lost my temper

575
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,177
. It was an offer no more

576
00:45:53,177 --> 00:45:54,941
. You may

577
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:59,409
If someone wants to go -
We can not do anything -

578
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,605
How do you know this?

579
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:09,024
Here are cheap, most of us, and if we wanted to Nil
. To have done, we isolated place, we are alone

580
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,940
Men's experiment would not let anything happen -
And how much you know? -

581
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:21,705
. Is the commander-induced

582
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,900
In any case

583
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,701
That remained in this

584
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:27,984
. One of them would pull out

585
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:30,337
Hey guys, that one hurt

586
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,122
. The experiment will end

587
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,512
. And no one of us will pay

588
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:36,506
. If you must put the record straight

589
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:37,961
What do you think?

590
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:43,040
Do you know how to control them?

591
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:49,358
. Intimidated

592
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,219
Prisoners

593
00:47:58,577 --> 00:47:59,807
. They hear your words

594
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:06,418
. For some reason they look at you like you Commander

595
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:10,950
. I have news for you

596
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:16,589
. Here, the commander Dirt

597
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:21,599
. This place we

598
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,594
. No one else

599
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:28,520
. There are all kinds of things

600
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,688
. That we can do for you

601
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:33,070
. To make you despair

602
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:47,580
If

603
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:50,915
Do we have a problem?

604
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,809
Respect the power now

605
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:59,334
. Woe to you, O wretched

606
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:35,400
. These things Mlitni

607
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:42,285
. This shower

608
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:44,436
. This will send a message

609
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:46,133
. It sends a message

610
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,319
. Joined to

611
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:51,719
. Come on

612
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,421
åá ÃäÊ ÈÎíÑ?

613
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:31,245
. This was brilliant

614
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:32,741
This is bad

615
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:35,630
. I mean, you were wicked

616
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,806
(And this is a good thing (Pierce

617
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,564
. Light not illuminated

618
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:44,747
. I saw this

619
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,330
. And this has not illuminated

620
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:50,743
. We have done what we did

621
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:52,867
. We sent a message

622
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:56,179
. And will not lose our position -
. What I'm saying I have -

623
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:00,614
An event of such a thing again

624
00:52:01,046 --> 00:52:02,392
. Anything

625
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:05,465
. Will withdraw

626
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:11,360
. To issue such an arbitrary decision

627
00:52:13,471 --> 00:52:15,506
Will cause all of us

628
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,077
. Hundred thousand

629
00:52:20,008 --> 00:52:21,664
. I do not care, sir

630
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:40,635
. Let it go

631
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:01,068
To hurt someone you love them

632
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:02,841
, Usurped or kill

633
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,147
. And the failure of law conviction

634
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:09,229
And the man came out through no fault of
You can not do anything

635
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:11,131
Not considered that this justice?

636
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:13,271
. I do not think these conditions

637
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:16,348
Justice is what keep us safe
. In the community

638
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:21,041
Justice
. Is started the war

639
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,407
, Eye for an eye

640
00:53:24,758 --> 00:53:28,531
. This is to make the species evolve

641
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:33,358
If you are who knows what will require
. The evolution of the human race

642
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,553
This is what the men smarter
... Me to report this

643
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:39,253
. The long-term

644
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:44,913
"Today, the Fourth"

645
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,037
Look what I found
. Take

646
00:54:22,686 --> 00:54:24,417
. This will give your blood sugar

647
00:54:24,984 --> 00:54:28,975
I do not want -
None, where a lot of candy -

648
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,033
. It is cheaper breads

649
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:34,447
. The sugar, trust me

650
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:36,785
. If own insulin

651
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,403
. I thought you do not need insulin

652
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,064
. I have diabetes

653
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,361
. When they brought me here

654
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:52,079
. I thought that I can enter

655
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,267
! Oh my God

656
00:54:55,979 --> 00:54:56,756
(Benji)

657
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:02,007
Listen, you can not hide this from them
Must tell them immediately

658
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,775
. To thee from here

659
00:55:05,046 --> 00:55:07,007
Do not you understand, you can die?

660

Arise, switch places, this place is

You know that the decisions we take
. Must be collective

854
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:11,901
This experiment is over, we have used violence

It has been more than half an hour

And what does this mean?

. Red Lights is the only thing we possess

864
01:15:33,226 --> 01:15:34,477
Not aware of this?

865
01:15:37,642 --> 01:15:39,814
