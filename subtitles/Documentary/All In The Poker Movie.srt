1
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,703
<i>In truth, they're bastard
stepchildren...</i>

2
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,006
<i>wisdom and hindsight.</i>

3
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:42,976
<i>Here's the problem with wisdom</i>

4
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,277
<i>You only get it after you need it.</i>

5
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,147
<i>It doesn't help you right now.</i>

6
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,683
<i>It only teaches you enough</i>
<i>to help you the next time.</i>

7
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,554
<i>I'm talking about the kind
of wisdom that comes from
experience.</i>

8
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,358
<i>The kind that tells you if your wife
pushes you to take the night shift,</i>

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,593
<i>there's probably a reason.</i>

10
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,367
<i>And then there's hindsight.</i>

11
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,302
<i>It's like looking in the
rearview mirror.</i>

12
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,806
<i>You can't see what you're
going through until you've driven
past it.</i>

13
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,476
<i>Hindsight, like, "Ah, what do you
mean I've had too much to drink?"</i>

14
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,844
<i>"I'll be fine".</i>

15
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,548
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>

16
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,283
<i>They don't help you with today,</i>

17
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,152
<i>only with tomorrow.</i>

18
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,754
<i>But tomorrow is a day away.</i>

19
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,390
<i>And today, well...</i>

20
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,826
<i>Today's a shitstorm I might
not live through.</i>

21
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,463
<i>So let me take you back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>

22
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,965
<i>'Cause the only way to get any
wisdom out of my story...</i>

23
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,101
<i>is to look at it in hindsight.</i>

24
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,171
Well, you're legit now, hero.

25
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,842
If you make it through poker night,
it's all downhill from there.

26
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,411
And, uh, considering you're a...

27
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,947
wet-nose, son of a bitch
political appointee...

28
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,316
you did okay.

29
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,352
The boys seem to think
you got potential.

30
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,988
Glad to hear you approve,
Lieutenant.

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,924
I never said I approve, shithead.

32
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,193
And don't fuck up, alright?

33
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,862
And don't ever make us look bad.

34
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,100
And get rid of that piece
of shit eyesore.

35
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,636
You're gonna be a detective, you
gotta start driving like one.

36
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,638
First thing tomorrow.

37
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,775
Hey, thanks, Lieutenant.

38
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,544
Fuck you.

39
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,221
<i>10-16.</i>

40
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,290
<i>10-16. Domestic disturbance.</i>

41
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,325
<i>413 East Morris.</i>

42
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,528
<i>Any units in area respond.</i>

43
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,535
Dispatch, Unit 4334 is 10-76.

44
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,841
<i>There's nothing out</i>
<i>this time of night...</i>

45
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,843
<i>except for trouble,</i>

46
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,013
<i>and there's no reason</i>
<i>to go looking for it.</i>

47
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,716
<i>But it wasn't as if there was anything
waiting for me at home anymore.</i>

48
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,559
Hey!

49
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,627
<i>That was it.</i>

50
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,596
<i>The first sign.</i>

51
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,366
<i>I could've seen it coming if my brain
was working, but it wasn't.</i>

52
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,268
<i>Doesn't matter how often
I replay it.</i>

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,271
Hello?
<i>I never get it right.</i>

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,907
Fucker.

55
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,763
Go! Run!

56
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,736
No.

57
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,538
Not again.
Please.

58
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,240
You said...

59
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,819
<i>Taking the call.</i>

60
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,421
<i>I wasn't doing anyone any favors.</i>

61
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,192
<i>Had a few two many at the game.</i>

62
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,830
<i>Wasn't really in any shape
to go out, and response is slow,
not thinking clearly.</i>

63
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,901
<i>It's an empty street</i>
<i>somewhere between</i>
<i>service towers,</i>

64
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,536
<i>but I had a radio in the car.</i>

65
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,873
<i>Just decided to go forward</i>
<i>without calling for backup.</i>

66
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,642
<i>And number four...</i>

67
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,843
Go! Run!

68
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,144
<i>Amy.</i>

69
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,848
<i>Well, she was a mistake</i>
<i>in more ways than one.</i>
Shit! Amy?

70
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,849
Where am I? Who are you?

71
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:31,363
<i>It is now day three, and still</i>
<i>no word on the whereabouts</i>
<i>of Detective Stan Jeter,</i>

72
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,898
<i>missing since Sunday.</i>

73
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
<i>His car was found here</i>
<i>by the lake,</i>

74
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,202
<i>but there are no signs</i>
<i>of any struggle.</i>

75
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,038
<i>For the past two days,</i>
<i>search crews have dredged</i>
<i>the waterway.</i>

76
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,575
<i>Lieutenant Calabrese, tell us what
you've heard about Detective Jeter.</i>

77
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,845
<i>We're not gonna give up</i>
<i>till we find him.</i>

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,749
<i>Anybody seen or heard anything,</i>
<i>please contact the station.</i>

79
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,185
<i>Channel 9 viewers might
remember Stan Jeter...</i>

80
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,356
<i>as the heroic officer who
single-handedly brought down</i>
<i>Terence Alby.</i>

81
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,559
Let me out of here,
you son of a bitch.

82
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,729
Oh! Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

83
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:07,232
You know I'm a cop, right? You...
you hurt a cop and they're coming
after you, man.

84
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,368
And..and no..no mercy.

85
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,804
Well, you let me out right now,
we can sort this out and...

86
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,007
Everything happens for a reason,
Detective.

87
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,111
Remember that.

88
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,681
Also remember...

89
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,016
people see what they
want you to see.

90
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,854
They're looking for you
at the river.

91
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,324
Not here.

92
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,693
In a week,

93
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,863
no one will be looking
for you at all.

94
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,333
No one will remember you at all.

95
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,934
In fact,

96
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,605
you're already being forgotten.

97
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,008
What the fuck is that?

98
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,083
<i>Three days.</i>

99
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,152
<i>God, help me.</i>

100
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,521
<i>Three days in this room.</i>

101
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,856
<i>Three days lost.</i>

102
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,692
Come on.
<i>Three days since poker night.</i>

103
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:11,029
Ah. Look who's here.
Guest of honor.

104
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,533
How often do we get a
fuckin' genuine hero in
our midst, boys?

105
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,669
Yeah. Alright.
What'd you bring?

106
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,905
Come on. Come on. Listen.
Just get your stuff and listen.

107
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,374
I'm telling...
I'm in the middle of a story.
Sorry.

108
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,843
Alright, so... where was I?

109
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,478
You lost me at "Once upon a time".

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,280
I got it. I got it. Okay.

111
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,016
Okay. So I spend, like, the next
two years... I'm following this guy,
right.

112
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,851
Wherever he goes, I go.

113
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,053
Goes to a family reunion,
"Hello".

114
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,622
I mean, he's in a hotel room
banging some whore,

115
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,926
I'm in the room next door,
you know, with a glass against
the wall, you know, listening.

116
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,661
- That's a little creepy.
- So...

117
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,932
I mean, this guy takes a piss, I'm
so close, I get tinkled on my shoes,
you know.

118
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,101
And still nothing. We get
<i>nothing.</i>

119
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,371
And I can tell that the guys
upstairs are getting sick and
tired of this shit.

120
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,074
'Cause every time I go in they give
me the "fuck you" eyes...

121
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,909
when I'm handing my card
for overtime.

122
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,545
But I don't care 'cause I know.

123
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,417
I know in my gut that this is
the motherfucker that capped
Franklin and Meyers.

124
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,689
And I know I'll never sleep
another night in my life as long
as he's still out there.

125
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,324
And then the day comes.

126
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,495
<i>Then they tell me, we're done.</i>

127
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,163
<i>Case is retired.</i>

128
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,798
<i>No more overtime.</i>

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,501
<i>We've had two years.</i>
<i>Finito.</i>

130
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,835
Really?
Thank you.

131
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,337
That was our best?
Yeah.

132
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,838
That's the best?
<i>Fuck them.</i>

133
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,508
<i>I go apeshit.</i>
<i>I'm..I'm destroying shit.</i>

134
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,676
<i>I'm throwing shit.</i>

135
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,014
<i>So there I am.</i>
<i>I'm driving home.</i>

136
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,949
<i>I'm furious.</i>

137
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,353
<i>I'm driving by Spike's, and that
bastard's truck is sitting there.</i>

138
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,756
<i>He's, you know,</i>
<i>inside having a beer</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>

139
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,058
<i>and my two friends are dead</i>
<i>in a ditch somewhere,</i>

140
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,161
<i>and only that asshole knows
where they're at.</i>

141
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,131
<i>And I sit there... staring.</i>

142
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>And I'm trying to come up</i>
<i>with a plan.</i>

143
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,636
So, it comes to me.

144
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,640
Did you go in there and beat
the shit out of him?

145
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,683
You take him outside, then you
beat the shit out of him.

146
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,762
Nah, you idiots. You take him
outside.

147
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,864
You have him beat the shit
out of himself.

148
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,244
Don't they teach you kids nothing
in the academy anymore?

149
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,547
Alright, no.
You see this?

150
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,685
I'm trying to tell a story,
and all these guys care about
is a cheap laugh.

151
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,788
Hey, let's just remember there are
two dead cops in here. Alright?

152
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,290
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

153
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,660
Hi, I'd like, uh... whiskey double.
Alright.

154
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,862
And..you know what?

155
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,565
Double for my friend here.

156
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,701
Thanks.
My pleasure.

157
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,736
What are you so happy about?

158
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,906
I am celebrating the greatest day
of my life.

159
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,942
Tell me about it.

160
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,947
Alright.

161
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,351
I'm a cop, right?

162
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,790
I've been spending the last couple
years, every day of my life,

163
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,126
searching for the bodies of these
two buddies of mine...

164
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,964
that got killed by some heartless
bastard, right?

165
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,199
Nothing.

166
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,568
Then this morning I found
the bodies.

167
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,407
They were out in the woods,
not even that far from here.

168
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,144
I can finally take a vacation.

169
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,682
Hey, give him one more.

170
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,918
And keep the change.

171
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,854
Take care, my friend.

172
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,230
<i>I couldn't have waited more than
10 minutes, and here he comes,</i>

173
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,099
<i>he's looking around,</i>
<i>he's all nervous.</i>

174
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,102
<i>He gets into his truck,</i>
<i>and he creeps off.</i>

175
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,672
<i>And I creep off right
behind him.</i>

176
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,803
<i>And then this idiot goes right</i>
<i>into the middle of the woods.</i>

177
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,471
<i>He walks right to a clearing.</i>

178
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,541
<i>Starts stomping around like he's
been missing something.</i>

179
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,150
<i>And after a while, he finally</i>
<i>decides that we must have made</i>
<i>a mistake, and he leaves.</i>

180
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,519
<i>I get on the horn to the chief.</i>

181
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,525
Hey, Captain.
This is Cunningham.
I found them.

182
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,761
The next day we dug those two up.

183
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,896
That prick's serving
double life now.

184
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,533
See, that's what it's all about.

185
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,804
That comes from years of being
on the job. You can't teach that.

186
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,907
Whole point of poker night,
young buck.

187
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:28,680
You listen, you learn, you go
and you do likewise.

188
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,249
And you always use
your best weapon,

189
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,817
and that's your brain.

190
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,486
You always trust your heart.

191
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,554
Yeah, thanks for that, Confucius.

192
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,590
Getting all teary over here.

193
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,292
Are we gonna play cards or are we
just gonna shoot the shit?

194
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,394
That's what we're here for.

195
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,896
Alright.

196
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,132
Time for you to lose money.

197
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,242
Hey.
Hey?

198
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,211
I'm not happy
about you being here.

199
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,413
If I had a say, you wouldn't
be getting this promotion.

200
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,916
Listen, Maxwell...
Am I wearing a fucking dress?

201
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,418
Don't interrupt me.

202
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,821
You knew my rules.
You broke my rules.

203
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,623
If this all goes wrong,

204
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,992
I'm gonna fuck you up.

205
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,127
Girls doing okay here?

206
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,365
Fine.

207
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,968
Just need a few more of these
in me, I'll be right as rain.

208
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,037
You hear anything, Floyd?

209
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,008
No.
But I got my cell.

210
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,911
You know my wife threw me out?

211
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,314
She says I'm driving her crazy.
Short fucking trip.

212
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,350
Wanna play some cards?
You know how I like taking
your money, don't you?

213
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,252
- I know you like taking my money.
- I love taking your money.

214
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,454
I brought extra.
Good. I'm a little short.

215
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,857
Hey, can I borrow 20 before
we start?

216
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,992
Of course.

217
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,095
Sit down.

218
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,198
Come on in, gentlemen.

219
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,999
So, this is how it works, kid.

220
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,669
You against us.

221
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,338
We win a hand, we tell you a story.

222
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,642
And, uh, you ought to listen up
'cause these stories are worth a
year of street experience.

223
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,745
So, put yourself in our shoes,

224
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,516
you, uh, think like we think,

225
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,586
and then one day when you
find yourself in a bad spot,

226
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,656
you'll remember what
we taught you.

227
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,626
Hopefully, you'll make it out alive.

228
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,698
We were there making mistakes.

229
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,800
You listen, you learn.

230
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,602
Maybe you don't have to make
the same ones.

231
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:34,339
We ain't good for much else
except these stories.

232
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,342
It's all we got left to contribute
to you young kids.

233
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,378
Speak for yourself, Calabrese,
old bitch.

234
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,715
I'm still out there kicking ass
and breaking balls.

235
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,951
I seen you, Calabrese.
I could limp faster than you
with Bernard on my back.

236
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,686
I could take a shit
faster than you.

237
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,956
Hey. Hey. Fuck all you all,
motherfuckers.

238
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,961
You grumpy-ass motherf...
I'll kick all your fucking asses, right
here and right now.

239
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:01,199
- Aw, shit. Come on.
Sit down, Calabrese.
- Alright. I'll sit down.

240
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,035
You're supposed to get wisdom as
you get older, not leak it out when
you piss.

241
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,704
<i>About 10 years ago, the chief</i>
<i>made a decision to start...</i>

242
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,239
<i>bringing in some heavy hitters.</i>

243
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,942
<i>We're a small town,</i>
<i>but crime was rising.</i>

244
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,646
<i>He figured you bring in some big
city vets about ready to retire...</i>

245
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,215
<i>and give them a couple years here
training the rookies,</i>

246
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,951
<i>they might just be able to
stay ahead of the curve.</i>

247
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>He brought in some of the best.</i>

248

<i>Jason Cunningham.</i>

249
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,692
<i>This guy survived the Richmond
drug wars and took down over 300
collars.</i>

250
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,828
<i>Incorruptible and unsociable.</i>

251
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,464
<i>A.J. Bernard, one of Memphis's
finest.</i>

252
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,268
<i>A.J. solved over 45 homicides,</i>
<i>retired here seven years ago.</i>

253
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,038
<i>Been one of the poker squad</i>

<i>Byron Davis, Chicago PD.</i>

255

<i>Toughest cop I ever met.</i>

256

<i>Had an accident four years ago and
headed for greener pastures.</i>

257

<i>Floyd Maxwell, 15 years
on the front lines.</i>

<i>Doesn't say much, but when
he does, listen.</i>

<i>They call him "the Hawk" and
the Hawk was watching me.</i>

260
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,291
<i>The lieutenant, Mike Calabrese.</i>

261
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,860
<i>Maybe the most beloved</i>
<i>senior officer ever.</i>

262
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,097
<i>Always looking out for his men.</i>

<i>Last year he saved my life.</i>

264

up where the...

265
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,740
Shot fired. Shit.

266
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,221
Get your head out of your ass, Jeter!

267
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,998
Thank you.

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,666
Stay close.

269
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,668
Lieutenant.

270
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,603
I want to say thank you.

271
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,808
You saved my fucking life.

272
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,410
No, you did. Y..you...

273
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,213
I would be dead and un..un..under
the ground if it wasn't for...

274
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,183
Get the fuck out of here with this
sympathetic bullshit.

275
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,186
Crying in your beer.

276
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,423
Somebody want to get this
fucking guy a dress?

277
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,766
You don't say thank you to me.

278
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,535
You do better.

279
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,774
You come onto the scene
ready for action.

280
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,710
You pay attention.
You learn.

281
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,946
And the next time you help out
the new guy.

282
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,350
You save<i> his</i> life.

283
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,253
That's all the thanks I need.

284
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,696
Hey, boys, get this.

285
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,399
This drunk fuck wants to buy
us all a round.

286
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,868
Hey!
Go figure.

287
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,539
So, nurse!

288
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,174
- Here we go.
- How did I get so lucky?

289
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,676
Five card draw. Straight up.
Oh, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

290
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,411
- Ah, here it comes.
- Jesus Christ.

291
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,246
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding.

292
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:07,418
We haven't even started yet
and you're asking a question?
Hey, hey.

293
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,487
That is not how this works.

294
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,192
We ask the questions, we do the talking,
you do the listening.

295
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,829
Okay, but I'm serious.
I have a question. Just one.
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,899
Jesus Christ, ask the fucking
question before our pensions
run out, for Christ's sake.

297
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,502
What if I win?

298
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:33,311
Listen, 10 years of playing poker night,
rookie's never won, never will.

299
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,379
Okay, but if I do.

300
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,482
Say I get that, that one great hand.
What then?

301
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,851
Hey, look here. If you win,
all bets are off.

302
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,453
Alright?
You tell the stories and
we start learning.

303
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,490
And we'd be pretty bad cheaters
if we're dealing you good cards.

304
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,928
Alright.
First lesson.

305
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,231
I wasn't looking at your card.
I saw you peeking.

306
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,766
It's an easy one.
It's about perspective.

307
00:18:55,768 --> 00:19:00,905
We deal with three percent of
the population 97% of the time.

308
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:05,276
And now everyone in the world
is not a lowlife, lying,

309
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,013
backstabbing, ass-covering
son of a bitch.

310
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,451
But..but it's mostly who we deal with
on a daily basis.

311
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,087
And they all think they're smarter
than you.

312
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,089
So here's your lesson.

313
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,025
- They're not.
- Except for the ones
who actually are.

314
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,263
We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend they don't exist.

315
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,032
<i>But sometimes they do exist.</i>

316
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,035
<i>The monsters from your nightmares.</i>

317
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,805
<i>They're real, and you can't wake up.</i>

318
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,012
There you are.
So tell me, Detective.

319
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,947
How old are you?

320
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,117
Twenty-five?

321
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,652
Twenty-six?

322
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:55,927
Take a little from column A
to fix column B.

323
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,697
Am I right?
I don't know what you're talking about.

324
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,867
I can make us a deal. Okay?
I..I..I got connections.

325
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,135
A deal?
Yeah.

326
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,536
Okay.

327
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,975
I was just like you once.

328
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:16,547
<i>Just a normal guy with
a normal life...</i>

329
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:23,554
<i>who went to a normal job
day after day after day.</i>

330
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,357
<i>I was a forecaster, Stan.</i>

331
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,527
<i>Predicting behavior and
regulating change.</i>

332
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:35,132
<i>Just another one</i>
<i>of the worker bees</i>
<i>buzzing around.</i>

333
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,269
<i>I just never seemed</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>

334
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,541
<i>I got to the point where I just couldn't
take it anymore, Stan.</i>

335
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:47,378
<i>I wasn't going to be just another one
of those sheeple...</i>

336
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,283
<i>marching to the beat of someone
else's drum.</i>

337
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,988
<i>So I decided, right then and there,</i>

338
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,889
<i>I was going to change my life.</i>

339
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,160
<i>But in order to do that, Stan,</i>

340
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,997
<i>I needed goals.</i>

341
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,833
<i>It took me a while to be honest
with myself.</i>

342
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:12,803
<i>I had to look into my
inner recesses, Stan.</i>

343
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,373
<i>I had to look deep,</i>

344
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,009
<i>and then I found them.</i>

345
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,616
<i>Two to be exact.</i>

346
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,030
<i>Making the rules was easy.</i>

347
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:44,001
<i>Crossing the line is what separates
the men from the boys.</i>

348
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,905
<i>But I was diligent.</i>

349
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,342
<i>I was a hard worker.</i>

350
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:15,633
Well, Stan, we're gonna have to
pick this up at another time.

351
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,669
- Just wait a second. Okay?
- What?

352
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,038
- Don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

353
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,208
No, you don't have to do that.
You don't...

354
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,344
Don't have to...
Sorry, Stan.

355
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,346
Rule number one calls.

356
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,998
Oh, God, no.
Amy!

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,236
Ow!
Hey, stop! Just leave her alone!

358
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,472
Hey!

359
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,649
Hey, kid, how you doing?
Hey.

360
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,290
You don't look so good.
Ah, no. I'm fine.

361
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,327
It's the night shift, you know,
kicking my ass.

362
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,496
Anything to do with this?

363
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,999
Let's talk.

364
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,774
Hi, Daddy.

365
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,346
No, it's okay now.

366
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:39,417
A nice officer is here to take him away.

367
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,219
Yep. Just like you taught me.

368
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,890
He won't be looking
in any girls' windows
anytime soon.

369
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,459
Nicely done.

370
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,061
Jeter.

371
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,832
Where'd you go?

372
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,401
- I'm sorry.
- Look, Stan.

373
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,071
Just between us.
You're a good cop.

374
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,340
Could be a great cop.

375
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,975
So,

376
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,680
what's the deal with Amy?

377
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,683
Oh, come on, Lieutenant.

378
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,286
I mean, she's just a kid.
Alright.

379
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,388
I just wanted to hear it
straight from you is all.

380
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,890
Hear what?
That there's nothing going on
between the two of you.

381
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,126
I don't know anything, Lieutenant.

382
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,529
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Something's going on.

383
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:29,133
I know she's been calling here,
asking for you.

384
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,610
Jeter.
<i>Hi, Officer Jeter?</i>

385
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,911
<i>This is Amy.</i>

386
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,551
Hi, Amy.
Listen, you can't call me here.

387
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,387
<i>I know. I know.</i>
<i>I was thinking.</i>

388
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,590
<i>Maybe you could take me
on a drive along?</i>

389
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:56,560
<i>You know, give me a
first hand peek into the world
of law enforcement.</i>

390
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:00,297
Um, yeah, I don't think your dad
would be too happy about that.

391
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,000
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>You're not afraid of my dad,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

392
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,036
<i>Besides, I can do what I want.</i>
<i>I'm an adult.</i>

393
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,938
Almost an adult.

394
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,641
<i>Oh, come on, Stan.</i>
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

395
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:14,645
<i>Besides, if you don't</i>
<i>pick me up, who knows what</i>
<i>kind of trouble I might get in.</i>

396
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,848
<i>Someone's gonna call the cops
either way.</i>

397
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,986
I don't know.

398
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,258
Oh, me too. I just like the spirit,
you know?

399
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,164
Like, everyone's happy and
there's lights. It's pretty.

400
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,732
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,434
Yeah.

402
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,236
And...

403
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,667
I need to know.

404
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,440
I don't want any stinking trouble, not
on this department, not on you.

405
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,109
You got me?

406
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,679
I'm telling you the truth, Lieutenant.

407
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,848
I never saw her.

408
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,624
Don't let it hit the fan, Jeter.

409
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,027
You're a hero cop, you're gonna
make detective next week.

410
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,864
Don't give 'em any dirt.

411
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,939
Stan?

412
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,707
Stan, can you hear me?

413
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,943
Yeah!

414
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,712
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you okay?

415
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,681
Please.
We have to get out of here.

416
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,150
How long have you been here?
The whole time.

417
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,553
- How did he get you?
- I got a call.

418
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,322
<i>He said you were in trouble.</i>

419
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,325
Are you?
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
Let's go. Get in.

420
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,827
Listen.
I don't just get in the car
with strangers.

421
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,863
Alright.
Look, you see this blood?

422
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,665
Huh? He doesn't have much
more time. Okay?

423
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,334
He's asking for you.
Let's go.

424
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,237
<i>Wait. Wait a minute.</i>
<i>He knows that I know you?</i>

425
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,675
<i>But you found me, Stan. They must
know where we are, right?</i>

426
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,711
No, I got a call on the radio.

427
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,814
A domestic. Five miles up the road.
My phone didn't work.

428
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,449
But I've been gone for two weeks.

429
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,352
Aren't there any leads at all?

430
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,654
No, they...

431
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,322
They thought I might be involved.

432
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,292
Please, Stan, you have to stop him.

433
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,461
He comes in here...

434
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,249
I know this is hard.
Okay, I do.

435
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,885
I'm gonna try to think of a way out.
Can you get free?

436
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,255
No. No, I tried. I tried everything.

437
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,424
I can't.

438
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,495
If we're gonna get out, we've got
to get out when he's gone.

439
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,665
- Wait. He's gone?
- Yeah, he..he's gone.

440
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,001
He leaves sometimes. He leaves
...I can hear his car leave.

441
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,338
Alright. I need you to listen carefully.

442
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,675
You tell me if you hear anything. I need
to know if he comes back, okay?

443
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,810
Okay.

444
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,681
Alright. You deal, gimpy.

445
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:13,951
Watch it, tough guy.
I'm gonna shove my gimp cane
up your ass.

446
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,886
Yeah. You'd have to
catch me first.

447
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,421
I've never been on your back.

448
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,991
Excuse me.

449
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,260
Hello?

450
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,264
Yeah, any news?
Okay.

451
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,799
It's in the study.

452
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,902
Yeah, I can come back if...
Okay.

453
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,772
Alright, thanks.
Bye.

454
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,241
It's all gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

455
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,076
What's the game?

456
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,811
Texas Hold'em.

457
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,480
Alright, so listen up.

458
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,849
You got to try to put yourself
in our shoes.

459
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,152
Try to picture the story.

460
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,487
What would you do?
What would you think?

461
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,122
Her name was Misty.

462
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,725
<i>If you can't think it,</i>
<i>you can't see it.</i>

463
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,162
If you can't see it,
you can't learn.

464
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,100
Do you see it?

465
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,170
Oh, yeah.
Then walk the scene.

466
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,775
Officers.
Hey, where's our vic?

467
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,076
In there.
That way.

468
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:16,413
Jim, you got an extra pair of gloves?

469
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,215
There you go.
As usual.

470
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,630
<i>This is the big one.</i>

471
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,566
<i>Murder.</i>

472
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,973
<i>You look at the body</i>
<i>for a real long time.</i>

473
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,908
Till it's burned
into your head.

474
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,044
Without you,

475
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,745
whoever did this gets away.

476
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,448
You're responsible
for avenging her.

477
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,085
You're doing God's work now.

478
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>The place was a mess.</i>

479
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,258
<i>DNA everywhere.</i>

480
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,663
<i>This guy was the Old Faithful
of sperm.</i>

481
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,899
<i>We had the evidence.</i>

482
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,368
<i>Now we needed the match.</i>

483
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,438
<i>So the investigation started,</i>
<i>but it never stopped.</i>

484
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,941
<i>Started with family, friends,</i>
<i>boyfriends, co-workers.</i>

485
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,776
<i>I lost track at 100 guys.</i>

486
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,545
<i>One year stretched into three.</i>

487
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,146
<i>Nothing.</i>

488
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,086
<i>Her parents kept calling me,</i>
<i>wanting updates.</i>

489
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:33,156
<i>There was nothing to tell.</i>
<i>But I was gonna catch this guy.</i>

490
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,259
<i>I wasn't gonna let this one go.</i>

491
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,462
<i>I promised them I wouldn't quit.</i>

492
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:42,766
<i>Eight years later,</i>
<i>a handyman gets called</i>
<i>for a broken furnace.</i>

493
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,801
<i>Something's blocking a vent.</i>

494
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,238
And boom. Guess what pops out.

495
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,673
<i>Panties.</i>

496
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,175
Loads of fucking panties.

497
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,811
<i>So here's how it works.</i>

498
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,480
<i>Those panties had sperm</i>
<i>all over them.</i>

499
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:00,083
<i>The sperm on the panties matched
the sperm all over Misty's house.</i>

500
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,921
<i>Whoever juked on the panties was
the same person who killed Misty.</i>

501
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,489
<i>The house the panties</i>
<i>were found in...</i>

502
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:09,092
<i>was a rental property about three
blocks away from Misty.</i>

503
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,796
<i>Going back eight years, we found out
who lived there.</i>

504
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,798
<i>A wannabe actor.</i>

505
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,336
<i>But the closest he ever</i>
<i>got to the film business</i>
<i>was working here.</i>

506
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,309
<i>All I needed was a swab.</i>

507
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,577
<i>But the way he was
looking at me...</i>

508
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,781
<i>He must have been waiting his
whole life for me to show up.</i>

509
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:36,420
<i>He must have lived his life in
fear that someday, somehow his
secret went out.</i>

510
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,588
<i>And he wasn't going down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

511
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,094
Hey! Freeze!
I said stop!

512
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,336
Hey, stop!

513
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,541
Hey!

514
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:58,608
Stop! Stop!

515
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,243
Sorry!

516
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,698
Hey, police!
Move.

517
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,604
Jesus.

518
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,674
Fuck.

519
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,923
Hey!

520
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,692
Hey, stop!

521
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,410
Stay down!

522
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,419
Shit.

523
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,797
Hey, get out of the car!

524
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,503
Ah.

525
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,209
<i>That was it for me.</i>

526
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,846
<i>Last run. Never walk without
a cane again.</i>

527
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,582
<i>But I wasn't done fighting.</i>

528
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,318
<i>I'd been chasing this guy</i>
<i>for eight years.</i>

529
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
<i>I wasn't gonna lose him now.</i>

530
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,425
<i>And that's how you get 'em.</i>

531
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,062
- Same as I got you bastards.
- Whoo..hoo..hoo!

532
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,698
Whoo!
Son of a bitch.

533
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,867
The race doesn't
always go to the swiftest.
Dang.

534
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,169
You take your time.
You build your case.
And you...

535
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:09,106
never, ever give up.

536
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:12,375
- Go fuck yourself.
- Look, it's true.

537
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,277
Fuckin' bumper sticker.

538
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,047
Why does Davis solve all his cases
with panties?

539
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,749
Why do all yours get solved by
naked sweaty boy informants?

540
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,419
- I stick with what I know.
- Reminds me of Maxwell's story.

541
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,954
Okay.

542
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,223
We're gonna just play
cards, thank you very much.
Alright.

543
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,592
Oh, no. Come on. Tell that story.
Come on.

544
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,403
Come on.

545
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,684
<i>This is it.</i>

546
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,953
<i>The big moment.</i>

547
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,923
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

548
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,092
<i>Make it happen.</i>

549
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,561
<i>Don't give up.</i>

550
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,005
Ah.

551
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,710
Ah. Shit.

552
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,845
Ah.

553
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,281
Fuck. Shit.

554
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,616
Ah, fuck. Oh.

555
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,832
Fuck.

556
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,774
Amy?

557
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,109
Stan!

558
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:56,546
- Amy?
- Can you hear me?

559
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,648
- Amy!
- Stan!

560
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,350
Follow my voice.

561
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,852
Stan!

562
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,924
Can you hear me?
Yeah. I can hear you.
Follow my voice.

563
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,030
Where are you?

564
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,801
I'm over here! In here!

565
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,978
Stan?

566
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,288
Amy?
Stan!

567
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,632
Please. Oh, my God. Oh.

568
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,035
Are you okay?
What happened?
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,304
What happened?
Hold on. Stop.

570
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,440
Oh.

571
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,343
The giant thing...

572
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:04,180
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

573
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,950
You gotta get me out.
You gotta get me out of here.
Okay, Amy.

574
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,086
You gotta get me out...
Listen to me, okay? I can't pull
these chains out.

575
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,622
I need to find some tools.
I need to call the police and
get 'em over here.

576
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,424
I'm gonna go upstairs for a second.
No, no, no.

577
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,126
You can't leave me. He's gonna
come back. He's...

578
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,729
If I don't get something to break you
out, he's going to kill us both.

579
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,166
Okay?

580
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,336
Okay. I'll be back. I promise.
Okay.

581
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,173
You fucking...

582
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,197
Shit.

583
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,359
Fuck.

584
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,581
Ah!

585
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,649
<i>I had my chance.</i>

586
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,418
<i>I had my chance, and I took it.</i>

587
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,054
<i>No one could fault me for that.</i>

588
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,891
<i>But I knew it would be a cold day
before I would get that chance again.</i>

589
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:39,195
<i>Now I had more important things</i>
<i>on my mind than escape.</i>

590
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,931
<i>I just needed to concentrate</i>
<i>on staying alive.</i>

591
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,272
Ah!

592
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,909
Stan!

593
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,248
Ah.

594
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,651
Oh.

595
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,199
Game is called Chase the Queen.

596
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,602
Which I'm sure you're all used
to doing.

597
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:25,174
The queen and anything
comes after is wild.

598
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,477
Two down, one up,

599
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:30,647
two up, one down, one up.

600
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,949
Ugh. Hand of crap.

601
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,118
Queens and wilds. I can't keep track
of this shit.

602
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Hey, Bernard.
Why don't you just start
your story, okay?

603
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,855
So I can go take a piss.

604
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:42,458
It was 1979.
Holy shit.

605
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,193
In '79, I was still in diapers.

606
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,095
Back then, they didn't give
you guns, right?

607
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:50,300
You just had a club. You hit the bad guy
over the head and then drag him back to
your cave?

608
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:53,736
'79... I was still married
to my first wife.

609
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,672
Oh, yeah, Cleopatra.

610
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,909
It was 1979.

611
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,246
We had a double murder.

612
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,448
Gruesome double murder.

613
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,351
No witnesses, one suspect.

614
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,219
The son.

615
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,888
Shawn.

616
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,628
Just give me a call.

617
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,502
If you go anywhere, give me a call,
let me know.

618
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:27,971
Oh, okay. I will.
You feel that?

619
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,073
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

620
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:32,809
- Feel what?
- Something's not right.

621
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,377
- That's all.
- Thanks, sir.

622
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,079
It's not what they say.

623
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,882
It's what they don't say.
Okay, so what should I do?

624
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:43,219
Help him find the words.

625
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,655
Hey, kid! Hey.

626
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,690
Y..yeah?
Hold up. Hey, come here.

627
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,126
Uh, okay.

628
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,095
Just wanted to ask you a
couple more questions.

629
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:55,565
I told the detective everything I know.
He's said I could go.

630
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,600
It's in the eyes.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

631
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:00,637
I know, I just thought we might
walk it over one more time.

632
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,006
It'll just take a few minutes.

633
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:06,609
Sure, I guess.
I mean, should I have a lawyer
or something?

634
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,177
There it is.

635
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,780
I guess if I had something to hide,
sure, I'd want a lawyer.

636
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,983
But if you've done nothing wrong.

637
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,519
That's up to you. You think
you need a lawyer?

638
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,922
N..n..no. I..I guess not.

639
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:23,493
Alright. Well, then let's go.
Go?

640
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,262
Take him on the drive.

641
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,401
The drive?

642
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,536
Oh, my God. Not the drive.

643
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:37,006
Jones had the cup of coffee. Douglas
had the crying corner.

644
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,475
A.J. Bernard?
Long drive.

645
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,144
Well, he needs a long drive.

646
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:44,047
If the drive was any shorter,
he wouldn't figure a goddamn
thing out.

647
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:46,849
It's..it's true.
It was 1979.

648
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,720
Silence was a part of it.

649
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,158
But it could also gives you
time to think.

650
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,528
Time to get inside
their heads a bit.

651
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,363
Figure out what happened.

652
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,970
Wait. Why are we here?

653
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,340
You said... you said we were going
to my Grandma's house.

654
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:15,778
Just want to walk it through
with you again, like you told us
bit by bit.

655
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,549
I just want to go.

656
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,452
I know, just once more.

657
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:24,554
Please.

658
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,422
Fine.

659
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,063
Here's the thing.

660
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,032
Killers all have a reason.

661
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:39,068
If you know the reason,
you're halfway home.

662
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,639
<i>They just want you to
understand them.</i>

663
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,676
<i>They did those things</i>
<i>with a purpose.</i>

664
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,946
<i>You understand the reason...</i>

665
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,115
Go on... you found your guy.

666
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,388
Take me back there, Shawn.

667
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,023
What'd you see?

668
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,016
<i>Here's the thing about this job.</i>

669
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,152
<i>There is no bottom.</i>

670
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:32,021
<i>Just when you think</i>
<i>you've seen it all,</i>

671
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,423
<i>the bottom falls out.</i>

672
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,058
There is no worst.

673
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,361
Just new levels of hell.

674
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,331
What happened?

675
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,002
Shawn?

676
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,538
Tell me what happened.

677
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,276
I..I came in, and someone was
beating them.

678
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,813
Who? Who was it, Shawn?

679
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,916
They were good people. Who would
want to kill your mom and dad?

680
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,919
No, they weren't what you think.

681
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,454
What am I supposed to think? You
told me they were good parents.

682
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,558
Now why would someone
kill these good people?

683
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,426
Y..you didn't know them.

684
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,061
- They...
- They what?

685
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:15,198
Open it! Open the door right now!

686
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,800
<i>They yell at you?</i>

687
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,735
<i>They beat you?</i>

688
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:23,739
<i>Mommy hold you a bit too close?</i>

689
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:27,410
Yeah. They did it all.

690
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,390
What were you gonna
do about it, Shawn?

691
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,293
Were you gonna let them get away
with treating you like that?

692
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,430
I can see why you did what
you had to do, Shawn.

693
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:49,899
This couldn't go on like this forever.

694
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,401
- Now tell me what happened.
- Tell me, Shawn.

695
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,803
Tell me what happened.

696
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,438
Ah!

697
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,907
No!

698
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,414
Ah!

699
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,056
Ah! I killed them!

700
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,260
It was me. I killed them.

701
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,729
You don't always get what you want.

702
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,198
I got a broken jaw and 18 stitches.

703
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,400
But I got the confession.

704
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,203
Sometimes you pay a price
for justice.

705
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,441
How you doing, buddy?
Come here.

706
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:36,312
It's okay. I'm here. It's okay.
It's okay.

707
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:38,147
<i>In my line of work...</i>
You alright?

708
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:40,216
<i>I see things.</i>
Who did this to you?

709
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,351
You ain't got nothing
on me, motherfucker!
Calm down, man!

710
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,986
- I'm fuckin' doing it!
- No, no, no!

711
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,122
<i>Bad things.</i>

712
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,258
<i>Things that shouldn't be seen.</i>

713
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,498
Food.

714
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,733
<i>When you're faced with this
every day,</i>

715
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,802
<i>you find ways to deal with it.</i>

716
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,737
<i>It might not be the best ways.</i>

717
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:08,010
<i>At the academy, we were told</i>
<i>that we work for God.</i>

718
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:12,682
<i>That we are the last line</i>
<i>of defense to protect the world</i>
<i>from the tyranny of evil men.</i>

719
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,750
<i>And I remember thinking</i>
<i>that sounded stupid.</i>

720
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,987
Ah.
<i>I don't now.</i>

721
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,089
<i>Now I know what evil looks like.</i>

722
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,792
<i>I've seen it up close and personal.</i>

723
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,429
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

724
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,131
What the hell did you do to me?

725
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,434
<i>And I can never look at things
the same again.</i>

726
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,340
Oh!

727
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,444
Ah. Ah.

728
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,349
Do you know...

729
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:50,586
how many tubes of Krazy Glue
it takes to...

730
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,521
hold a man to a wall?

731
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,993
Would you believe 34?

732
00:49:56,995 --> 00:50:00,529
A lot more than I thought too.

733
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:04,367
Please, just tell me what you want.
I'll do everything I can.

734
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,570
Shut up.

735
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,907
Please, there must be
something you need.
Now you were close.

736
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,843
So close.

737
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:17,079
The next time you try to escape,
it's gonna hurt.

738
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:21,283
Really hurt. Oh, you don't
believe me?

739
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,386
Here.

740
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,623
Ah!

741
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,396
See what I mean?

742
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:35,431
You're sick!

743
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,999
Thank you.

744
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:39,135
Leave him alone!

745
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,506
Oh.

746
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,744
So touching.

747
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,312
She really likes you.

748
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,349
Too bad she's jailbait.

749
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,887
Just..just let her go, okay?

750
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,555
It's me you want, right?

751
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:04,226
We have more in common
than I thought, Detective.

752
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,330
Although...

753
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,332
I think she's too old for me.

754
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,936
Why are you doing this? Why?

755
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,338
Uh, where's this going?

756
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,316
Don't try and be smart.

757
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:30,386
I'm always five moves ahead of you.

758
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,154
You see what I want you to see.

759
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,490
You know what I want you to know.

760
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,527
While you're playing catch up,

761
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,564
I'm already planning next month.

762
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,034
Hey, wait..wait a second.

763
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:47,169
What about your family?

764
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,739
Huh?
Why did you kill them?

765
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,808
You're so transparent.

766
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,878
But sure. Why not?

767
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,817
Where were we?

768
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,387
<i>Oh, yes, my new goals.</i>

769
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,490
<i>If you really want to kill people...</i>

770
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,758
<i>and you really want</i>
<i>to get away with it,</i>

771
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,694
<i>then you need to do
a little research.</i>

772
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:16,165
<i>Now where do you go to learn</i>
<i>sick things like that?</i>

773
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,766
<i>The Discovery Channel, of course.</i>

774
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,604
<i>The have a whole channel</i>
<i>just devoted to murder.</i>

775
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:25,708
<i>It was like watching TV</i>
<i>to get a PhD in murder.</i>

776
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,078
<i>And the Internet.
A world of debauchery right
at your fingertips.</i>

777
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,715
<i>Everything you ever wanted to know
about anything sick and twisted,</i>

778
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,750
<i>available at a keystroke.</i>

779
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,553
<i>Night after night I was learning more.</i>

780
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:39,955
<i>Arguing. Sharing knowledge.</i>

781
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,626
<i>It was like being a member in
the most exclusive club ever.</i>

782
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:45,327
<i>I was liberated.</i>

783
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,631
<i>I didn't feel alone for the first time
in my life.</i>

784
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,834
<i>But...</i>

785
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,337
<i>I needed something more.</i>

786
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,175
<i>Someone to share with,</i>

787
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:02,511
<i>to learn from,</i>

788
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,447
<i>to help me sharpen my skills.</i>

789
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,453
<i>I needed a mentor.</i>

790
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,093
<i>It was everything I ever
hoped for and more.</i>

791
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,462
<i>Someone who got me,</i>
<i>understood me,</i>

792
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:23,199
<i>where I was coming from.</i>

793
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,970
<i>He helped me be the man</i>
<i>I am today.</i>

794
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,605
<i>To be all I could be.</i>

795
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:41,217
<i>But there comes a time when
you have to grow up.</i>

796
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,453
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>when you kill your parents,</i>
<i>and you leave the house.</i>

797
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,822
What a dipshit.

798
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,357
<i>That time came,</i>

799
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,893
<i>and that's when I knew</i>
<i>I was ready.</i>

800
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,429
<i>Ready to be on my own again.</i>

801
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,432
What happened to your mentor?

802
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,969
And you call yourself
a detective?

803
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,674
Enough about me. Let's talk
about you.

804
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,453
I see potential in you, Detective.

805
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:20,122
You're a lot like me.

806
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,724
Trapped.

807
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,662
Well, you saw what I had to do
to break free.

808
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,597
And I want you to do the same.

809
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,433
Please.

810
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,803
Just let me go.

811
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,805
Let yourself go.

812
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,709
Free yourself.

813
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,482
I want you to think about something,
Detective.

814
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,419
Why you?

815
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,923
Out of everyone.

816
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,159
Why you?

817
00:54:57,161 --> 00:55:00,696
Do you think you have what it
takes to go up against me?

818
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,364
You think you're smart enough?

819
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,033
I don't think so.

820
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,968
I think you fall short.

821
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,570
Way short.

822
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,910
Game's almost over, Detective.

823
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,336
You know, I've been thinking.

824
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:45,407
You know, what's going on here is, uh,

825
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,310
it's not right.

826
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:52,414
I used you to catch the detective
and now that I have him,

827
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:56,919
I don't really need you anymore.

828
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:03,058
I have a sickness, and, uh,

829
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,761
I see that now.

830
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,697
And I can't keep doing this.

831
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,937
So what I want is for you
to call your family...

832
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:18,240
and tell them that you're alright,

833
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,809
and tell them to come get you.

834
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,144
Okay?

835
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,580
What?

836
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,984
Oh, but...

837
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,121
Alright.

838
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,576
Alright. So.

839
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,780
Here.

840
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,881
Daddy?

841
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:36,285
Can you hear me?
Yes, I'm alive.

842
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,154
He wants you to come get me.
He said he's gonna let me...

843
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,056
Ah!

844
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,493
No.

845
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,870
Dad.

846
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,376
Hello, Amy's dad?

847
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,111
How are you today?

848
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,881
Oh, I wouldn't talk
like that if I were you.
Stop!

849
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:07,749
You do realize I have
your daughter, right?
Daddy!

850
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,252
Don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him!
Da...

851
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,221
Get off!
Yeah, that was her.

852
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:15,324
Alright. So this is gonna be simple.
You're gonna take $10,000.

853
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,993
You're gonna get in your car and you're
gonna drive up River Road.

854
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:21,930
You're gonna drive 5.2 miles,
and you're gonna head up to
the house there. You got it?

855
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,032
3:00 pm. And no cops.

856
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,569
And I mean no cops or your daughter
comes back dead and pregnant.

857
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,108
That's it for me, boyos.
Cash me out.

858
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,077
What are you talking about?
It's 11:30.

859
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,513
Yeah, you're not going anywhere
till we hear our favorite story.

860
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,615
Give me a fucking break.
No, no, no.

861
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:45,387
You're gonna stay right here
and tell us a sexy little story.

862
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,123
- I get all tingly just thinking about it.
- I bet you are.

863
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,025
Floyd. Come on.

864
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,529
I'm out of Viagra. The little woman's
been begging for it.

865
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,063
I need you, bro.

866
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:58,800
You guys are assholes.

867
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,836
Thirty-five years on the fucking job,

868
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,739
highly-decorated detective, you think
I only got one story?

869
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,708
I got a million. Here, there's one.

870
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,744
I had this guy...
No!

871
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:10,546
Hey! No! Nope.
Come on. Tell it, Floyd.

872
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:11,980
- We want<i> the</i> story.
- You want<i> the</i> story?

873
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,148
Yeah,<i> the</i> story.
Yeah!

874
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,183
For your own fucking
perverse pleasure...

875
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,618
Alright.
Thank you.

876
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,554
I will indulge you...

877
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,456
in a tale of fine police work.

878
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,894
And whatnot.

879
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,264
It was a little ways back. I had
a little less gray in my hair.

880
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:33,135
I might have been wearing a Members
Only jacket, I'm not sure.

881
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,938
Bottom line is, there were
three bodies.

882
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,343
One in the water.

883
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,283
<i>One in the woods.</i>

884
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,754
One in the dumpster.

885
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,591
<i>Now this was a big deal</i>
<i>at the time...</i>

886
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:59,227
<i>because this was</i>
<i>the first serial killer</i>
<i>in the area, right?</i>

887
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,130
<i>Each of the victims was killed</i>
<i>in a different place.</i>

888
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,366
<i>But all of them were missing</i>
<i>their pinkies.</i>

889
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,639
<i>So we called this guy</i>
<i>"the pinky thief".</i>

890
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,741
<i>All the victims though, they
were hustlers, right?</i>

891
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:15,644
<i>Guys selling themselves out
to the highest bidder.</i>

892
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:21,316
<i>But the one common thing was, each
of 'em was afraid of the same guy.</i>

893
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,951
<i>This asshole named Nate Munson.</i>

894
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,720
<i>He's some bullshit photographer,</i>
<i>right?</i>

895
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:26,254
<i>He would lure 'em</i>
<i>into his world,</i>

896
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,157
<i>you know, with the promise</i>
<i>of glamor pictures, right?</i>

897
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,160
<i>'Cause they're all aspiring models,</i>
<i>fucking actors and whatnot.</i>

898
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,865
<i>So we liked this guy</i>
<i>for all these killings.</i>

899
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,808
Oh, such a nice night.

900
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,379
He would lead them into the woods
to his own little personal lovers' lane
place...

901
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,347
that he'd staked out.

902
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,119
Oh, watch your step. It's slippery
on this moss.

903
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,854
We thought he killed them there,

904
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,390
then disposed of the bodies later.

905
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:04,192
I don't see anything here that says
that this is our guy.

906
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,228
- This is our guy.
<i>- We know this is our guy.</i>

907
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,331
- I know it is. I can feel it.
<i>- But each scene is too clean.</i>

908
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,299
<i>We can't bring him in</i>
<i>without evidence.</i>

909
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,301
<i>He'll take a fucking walk.</i>

910
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,604
But if we're right, and he kills
someone else,

911
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:18,740
we're gonna catch hell in the press
when they find out that we knew about
the guy...

912
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,776
and he went on killing.

913
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,644
So there's only one way
to do this right.

914
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,946
<i>Someone had to go undercover.</i>

915
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,982
I drew the short straw.

916
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,121
<i>They wired me up,</i>

917
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:36,525
<i>and the go word is,</i>
<i>"You're making me hot".</i>

918
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,794
<i>"You're making me hot".</i>
Wow.

919
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,829
<i>Poor choice of words.</i>

920
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,866
<i>It comes from upstairs.</i>

921
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,270
<i>They make the unfortunate</i>
<i>fucking tactical decision...</i>

922
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,439
<i>to link us up with some local
SWAT team.</i>

923
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:53,809
<i>These guys were fucking</i>
<i>world-class bozos, right?</i>

924
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,844
<i>Shit-bird number one.</i>

925
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,713
<i>Shit-bird number two.</i>

926
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,248
<i>Shit-bird number three.</i>

927
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,018
Here, that's you.
Sniper two, Johnson, there.

928
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,789
Snipers had me triangulated,
ready to put this fuck in the ground
first sign of craziness.

929
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,458
Nice.
Whoa, hey.

930
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,495
The guy's fucking feeling me up
and I'm thinking to myself,

931
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:16,631
this better be the fucking guy,
alright? You know?

932
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:20,669
Because if this guy's just in it
for the fucking sex,

933
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,337
he's never gonna see
a jail cell...

934
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,040
'cause I'm gonna take him out
right there on the spot.

935
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,777
<i>So after a while he starts</i>
<i>getting rough.</i>

936
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,345
Handcuffs.

937
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,420
Oh, hey. Hey.

938
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,889
- What is that?
- Who's in charge now, huh?

939
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,491
What are you doing?

940
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:45,527
Huh? Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

941
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,897
Hey.
Ah, yeah.

942
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,033
Yes. You're kinky. You're fuckin' kinky.

943
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,770
Come on.

944
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,372
Now you're fucking...
you're making me hot.
Why don't we get...

945
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,407
- You're making me hot.
- Why don't we...

946
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,514
You're making me hot.

947
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,589
Yeah, you're making me hot!

948
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,491
You're..you're making me...

949
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:18,560
Oh, shit!

950
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:20,262
Hey, you're making me hot!

951
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,870
<i>Shit-bird number one has been</i>
<i>on the phone with his wife.</i>

952
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,438
<i>They're having a fight.</i>

953
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,744
<i>Shit-bird number two catches</i>
<i>some kids smoking pot.</i>

954
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:40,282
<i>Shit-bird number three ate Mexican
for lunch and he's got the fucking runs.</i>

955
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,885
You're ma... you're making me hot!

956
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,887
Hey, hey.
You're making me hot.

957
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,489
Uh.

958
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,224
So at this point,

959
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:52,794
Munson moves behind me, and I know
he's gonna cut my finger off.

960
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,763
I realize that I'm on my own, right?

961
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:56,631
There's gonna be no back up.

962
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,302
So I do the one sensible thing
that any man would do.

963
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,637
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
W..w..wait. Come here.
Come here.

964
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,373
I asked for a kiss.

965
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,547
Give me a kiss.
Huh?

966
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,420
Turns you on?
Yeah. Fuck it.

967
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,722
Come here.

968
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:21,857
Yeah.

969
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,593
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Oh, yeah.

970
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,969
- He's down.
- Move!

971
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,505
Hey, where the fuck were you?

972
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,107
Fuckin' piece of shit.

973
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,243
Come on!

974
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,844
<i>Bottom line.</i>

975
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:46,715
If you're in the shit,
you're all you got,

976
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:49,718
you make your fucking play.

977
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,353
You're right. It's a lesson, kid.

978
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,626
And if all else fails...
ask for a kiss!

979
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,261
Don't move, motherfucker.

980
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,996
Okay. Okay.
Right there.

981
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,266
Get your fucking hands up.

982
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,104
Okay, okay.

983
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,507
Get 'em up. Where's my daughter?
What do...

984
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,442
Where is she?
What do you mean your daughter?

985
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,277
I don't know what you're
talking about.

986
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,114
Don't fuck with me or I will smoke you.

987
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,116
You tell me where she is now.

988
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,887
Okay, don't. I don't know what's
going on here, man.

989
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,855
I..you know, I was just
walking my dog,

990
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:04,292
and I saw you at the house and I just
came to tell you that nobody's home,
okay?

991
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,061
They're away.
They're away.

992
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:07,796
Don't give me that.

993
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:10,832
You called me on my cell phone,
you piece of shit.

994
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,801
- Where is she?
- Don't. Please.

995
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,369
Just listen, okay?

996
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:15,971
I don't know what's going on here.

997
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,840
I don't know what you're talking about.
But please don't kill me, okay?

998
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,509
Don't..don't kill me. I got kids too.

999
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,015
You fuck...

1000
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,585
Please.

1001
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,988
Please.

1002
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,893
Oh, shit. Shit. Fuck.

1003
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:40,729
I'm sorry. Put your hand down.

1004
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:43,231
Put your hand...
stand up.

1005
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,936
You alright?
Yeah.

1006
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,638
Shit, I'm sorry.

1007
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,041
I'm sorry.

1008
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:55,577
Fuck. Are you okay?
I mean...

1009
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:03,084
You should really call
the cops or something.
They can help.

1010
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:08,390
I am the cops.
Oh.

1011
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,691
It's okay.

1012
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,799
Hey, you know, I'm sure everything's
gonna turn out fine.

1013
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,869
You know.

1014
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,504
I hope you find your kid.

1015
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,875
Thanks. Look, I'm sorry
about that back there.

1016
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:28,810
Yeah.

1017
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,347
Thanks for your help.
Yeah.

1018
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,384
No problem.

1019
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,883
Ah.

1020
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,347
Come on.

1021
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:02,070
Stan. Stan, can you hear me?
Yeah.

1022
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:04,172
Stan! Are you okay?

1023
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:07,008
Yeah, I'm okay.

1024
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,643
Is he here? Have you been down?

1025
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,513
No, he left. He left.
He called my dad.

1026
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,587
What are you doing?

1027
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,544
Stan, what's going on in there?

1028
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:06,401
What did he do to you?

1029
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,470
No. No.

1030
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,273
Get behind the bed. Get...

1031
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,810
Sit.

1032
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,964
You move, you die.
Alright?

1033
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:51,546
Shit.

1034
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,718
Amy!

1035
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,892
I had a rough day at work today.

1036
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,932
I could use something
to relax me.

1037
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,838
I think you know
just what it is.

1038
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,354
No, don't! Stop!

1039
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,890
Stop it!

1040
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,358
No!

1041
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,462
No! Don't!

1042
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,120
That was dumb, Detective.

1043
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,128
Oh, no.

1044
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:32,413
Oh, no.

1045
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:35,983
You fucker!

1046
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,766
What's wrong?

1047
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:53,368
Hmm?

1048
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,105
Oh, it's not that bad.

1049
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,209
Shit!

1050
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,553
You're gonna pay for that.

1051
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:21,896
<i>I've pulled my gun three times</i>
<i>in the line of duty,</i>

1052
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,699
<i>with mixed results.</i>

1053
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,869
<i>One.</i>

1054
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,839
<i>Two.</i>

1055
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:38,713
<i>The third is really the story
of my career.</i>

1056
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:40,581
<i>It all starts with a call.</i>

1057
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:44,519
<i>A strange one this time,</i>
<i>a guy named Fisher.</i>

1058
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:46,954
<i>He works at this trailer
storage facility.</i>

1059
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:51,492
<i>Now it seems last month</i>
<i>his phone bill goes up 700%.</i>
<i>No clue why.</i>

1060
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:55,630
It's not 3,700 cents.
It's 3,700 fuckin' dollars!
Okay.

1061
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:59,367
It's a fucking phone bill! It's not
a fucking mortgagepayment, for
Christ's sake!

1062
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:02,737
<i>And all of a sudden, he's
billed for seven lines and hundreds
of international calls.</i>

1063
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,305
<i>First, he thinks it's Johnson,</i>

1064
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:07,341
<i>a manager who works
there, runnin' up some phone
sex numbers.</i>

1065
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:11,179
<i>But the calls are there whether
Johnson is or not. Phone company
won't help him.</i>

1066
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:14,682
<i>They say they have invoices,</i>
<i>invoices with his signature,</i>

1067
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,417
<i>and the signature looked good.</i>

1068
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,554
<i>It matched.</i>
<i>Fisher swears it's not his.</i>

1069
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:21,355
<i>I told him I'd look around.</i>

1070
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:25,593
<i>Might be some kids</i>
<i>tying into the line somewhere</i>
<i>and messing around.</i>

1071
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,563
<i>Anyway, it beats sitting</i>
<i>in the car.</i>

1072
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,599
<i>Quiet night.</i>
<i>It's nice out.</i>

1073
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:33,367
<i>Good night for a walk.</i>

1074
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:35,503
<i>Full moon.</i>

1075
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,839
<i>And something struck me.</i>
<i>I don't know what.</i>

1076
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:41,476
<i>But I wondered what things</i>
<i>would look like from the top</i>
<i>of those cars looking down.</i>

1077
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,678
<i>I just decided to go</i>
<i>for a climb.</i>

1078
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,416
<i>I've replayed that night</i>
<i>thousands of times.</i>

1079
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:50,852
<i>It was the turning point</i>
<i>in my career.</i>

1080
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:54,055
<i>And the truth was...</i>
<i>it was all luck.</i>

1081
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,233
<i>Some people work to get
where they are.</i>

1082
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,371
<i>Some people marry into it.</i>
Fuck.

1083
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:14,008
<i>And I got here by climbing up</i>
<i>a bunch of train carsto look at
the moon.</i>

1084
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,681
Jesus!

1085
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,064
<i>I can't describe what I saw</i>
<i>that night.</i>

1086
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,668
<i>I would never have thought the
things there were even possible.</i>

1087
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:17,972
<i>When I close my eyes,</i>
<i>the pictures are still there,</i>
<i>haunting me.</i>

1088
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,787
Fuck.

1089
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,515
This is good.
Real good.

1090
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,718
Police! Freeze!

1091
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,929
<i>Terrence Alby.</i>

1092
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:18,165
<i>I had just shot Terrence Alby.</i>

1093
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:21,435
<i>Never had fired a gun</i>
<i>at a person till then.</i>

1094
01:17:21,437 --> 01:17:23,204
<i>And I killed him.</i>

1095
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:26,707
<i>They called me a hero. They
made me a detective.</i>

1096
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,310
<i>But I really had nothing</i>
<i>to do with it.</i>

1097
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,713
<i>I was just lucky. I wanted to see
the moon.</i>

1098
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,418
<i>Three times I pulled my gun.</i>

1099
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:41,122
<i>But I had never, ever, shot and killed
an innocent man.</i>

1100
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,027
<i>Until today.</i>

1101
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,197
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

1102
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:30,171
Don't get up, you lazy
fucking bastard.

1103
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,976
If you wanted to lose weight, you
should've just quit drinking.

1104
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,281
Alright. You're gonna be fine.

1105
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:43,150
Let's just get some back up and
get you the fuck out of here.

1106
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,722
Goddamn it. I knew something
was wrong.

1107
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,057
Fucking guy.

1108
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,961
Can I help you?

1109
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:57,798
Uh, Detective Calabrese,
Warsaw PD.

1110
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,335
Uh, we're going door-to-door
in the neighborhood.

1111
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:04,839
Well, it's not much of a neighborhood.
The next house is three miles.

1112
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,407
You okay there?

1113
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:12,146
Oh, yeah. I just have a cold.
Still contagious.

1114
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:14,348
We, uh...

1115
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:18,152
We had a detective go missing
a couple of weeks ago. Jeter?

1116
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:21,355
Mmm. Yeah, yeah. I've been
following the story.

1117
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:22,656
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:26,227
Uh, he was working in the area,
on call.

1119
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:27,828
Oh.

1120
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,133
Well, I haven't seen anything here.

1121
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:36,270
No cars? No suspicious people?

1122
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,839
Nobody coming to the door
you didn't know?

1123
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:40,274
You mean, besides you?

1124
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:46,647
Yeah, well, thanks for your time,
Mister, uh...

1125
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:48,816
James.

1126
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,818
Uh, you mind if I come in?

1127
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,254
Why?

1128
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,457
Just a routine check.

1129
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,259
You got a routine warrant?

1130
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,528
Do I need to get one?

1131
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,267
Nope.

1132
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,508
Hey, do you have a partner
in that car outside?

1133
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,211
Why?
Well, I was gonna put on
a pot of coffee.

1134
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:19,313
Wanted to know how many
cups to make.

1135
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,783
Nope.

1136
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:24,518
Just me.

1137
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,188
Please, come in.

1138
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,237
We got a 911 call about a week ago.

1139
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,039
911. Please state your emergency.

1140
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,041
<i>When the operator</i>
<i>picked up the call,</i>

1141
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,743
<i>there was nobody there.</i>

1142
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:51,078
Hello?

1143
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,214
So is that unusual?

1144
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:54,682
Not really.

1145
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:58,252
But, uh, when she went to end the call,
she missed the button.

1146
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:03,390
She was, uh, deeply immersed in
an article about the Kardashians.

1147
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:11,732
Anyway, she didn't realize that
the call was still connected.

1148
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:14,501
Hello?

1149
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:15,936
Sir?

1150
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,771
Hello? Can you hear me?

1151
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,241
<i>So what happened?</i>

1152
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:24,278
Well, finally the call ended.

1153
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,115
But not the story.

1154
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:32,620
No, not the story.

1155
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,991
We traced the call.

1156
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:39,860
I mean, it was a partial trace.

1157
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:42,696
Strangely enough, that call
was made from somewhere
in this neighborhood.

1158
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,232
Uh..huh. Interesting.

1159
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,134
Yeah.

1160
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:55,209
And then, uh, cops came out
here about a week ago, do a little
follow-up work.

1161
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,144
One of 'em never came back.

1162
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,782
So that's two down, somewhere
out here.

1163
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:04,718
Yeah.

1164
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,355
Jeter, somewhere out here.

1165
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:15,529
And, uh, that call from
somewhere out here.

1166
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:23,137
And then another cop goes missing
from somewhere out here.

1167
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,172
There's just so many questions.

1168
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:31,312
Anyway, I figured I should probably
check it out and...

1169
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:48,362
Goddamn cell phones. You can
never get a fucking signal.

1170
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:49,997
Is he dead?

1171
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,700
Who?

1172
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,404
The man. Is he dead?

1173
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:59,707
<i>No, no. No, he's still alive.</i>

1174
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:01,909
<i>But I tagged him pretty good.</i>
<i>He's not going anywhere.</i>

1175
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,344
What did you use?

1176
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,779
Fuck!

1177
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:07,715
What?

1178
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:09,249
I used my .45.

1179
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,818
No. To keep him there.
What did you use?

1180
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,419
Handcuffs.

1181
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,702
<i>Never, ever, in my
wildest dreams.</i>

1182
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:32,006
<i>This is not how it's supposed</i>
<i>to happen. If..if I would have</i>
<i>said something.</i>

1183
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:36,110
<i>Anything. I knew in my heart</i>
<i>the cuffs weren't enough. I was</i>
<i>just too slow.</i>

1184
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,078
<i>Too damn slow.</i>

1185
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,483
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

1186
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:53,360
- Shit!
- You bastard!

1187
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,661
Fuck!

1188
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,497
You... no!

1189
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,101
Do it!

1190
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,412
Fellas, read 'em and weep.

1191
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:14,314
Oh, fuck me.
Goddamn it.

1192
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,284
Full house. Aces wild.
You called it.

1193
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:18,552
Hang on, hang on.

1194
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,721
We ain't seen what the kid's got yet.

1195
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,390
You mind, kid?

1196
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,429
Deuce.

1197
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,566
Another deuce.

1198
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,770
No help there.

1199
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,673
Oh, shit.

1200
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,944
The plot thickens.

1201
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,346
And...

1202
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,817
No!

1203
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:50,818
Come on!

1204
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,087
<i>Oh, man!</i>
<i>Damn!</i>

1205
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,521
Kid beat you with four twos.

1206
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,490
Twos? What the fuck?
Who was dealing?

1207
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,092
Holy shit.

1208
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,694
You know what this means?

1209
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,362
Huh?

1210
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,267
What?

1211
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,171
You get to ask the questions, kid.

1212
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:13,340
This is insane.

1213
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:16,310
You're dead, for Christ sakes.

1214
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:20,681
- You too, Maxwell.
- Yeah, they're both dead.

1215
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:23,317
What we want to know is,
did they die for nothing?

1216
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:26,320
No, you don't know.

1217
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:29,389
You weren't trapped in this
fucking room for weeks.

1218
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:32,526
You sit there and..and you
smoke your cigarette and you
tell me these stories,

1219
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:35,329
but h..h..how the fuck is
this gonna help me?

1220
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,298
I have done everything I can.

1221
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,101
I can't get out if I'm stuck
to the fucking wall!

1222
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:45,706
Take it one step at a time, Jeter.

1223
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,508
One step.

1224
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,811
You gotta rescue my daughter.

1225
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:55,449
You put this motherfucker in
the ground. Put a stake in his
fucking heart.

1226
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,520
Whatever you do,
do not give up.

1227
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:03,557
Hey, you are in a fight.
So fucking fight.

1228
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:06,627
I just..I just gotta... I just want this
to stop.

1229
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:08,695
Come on, kid. Figure it out.
You got all the clues.

1230
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,364
You just got to string them together.

1231
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:12,699
What the fuck are you
talking about, clues?

1232
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:16,136
The guy, he comes in here and drugs
me and beats the shit out of me.

1233
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,005
Think about it.

1234
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:22,109
He grabbed Amy to get to you.

1235
01:26:22,111 --> 01:26:24,912
She disappeared two weeks before
you did. He had a plan.

1236
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,116
<i>This place, middle of nowhere.</i>

1237
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:34,454
<i>The rooms in the basement...
that took a lot of work. It's no
random accident.</i>

1238
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:38,592
<i>Come on. He set this up for you.</i>
<i>You're the one he wants.</i>

1239
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:40,060
Just stop it. Please, just...
just stop it.

1240
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:42,429
He could have killed you right away.
But he didn't, alright?

1241
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:45,966
So think about it. Why did
he let you live?

1242
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:47,901
He's trying to tell you something.

1243
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:50,571
He wants you to figure it out.
I can't do this.

1244
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:52,306
Yes, you can!

1245
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,542
Now you think about it.

1246
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,478
What's the key? He said you
already knew what it was.

1247
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,482
How am I supposed to find
the key when I don't know
who this guy is, huh?

1248
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,959
The mentor.

1249
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:13,060
There you go.

1250
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,542
<i>I had no idea who he was.</i>

1251
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,979
<i>Without the mask, he was
simply no one.</i>

1252
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:59,059
Now tell me. Tell me why this?
Why me?

1253
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:01,328
What? Because of Alby? Because
I killed your mentor?

1254
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:03,296
Very good, Detective.

1255
01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:08,301
I knew if I spelled it out for you,
you'd catch on eventually.

1256
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:10,804
Just took longer than I anticipated.

1257
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:13,140
Yeah, but why all this, you sick fuck?

1258
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,878
Because in that train car
was my life's work.

1259
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:23,583
<i>I did it all for him.</i>
<i>To please him.</i>

1260
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,452
<i>I was shipping that car out</i>
<i>the next day.</i>

1261
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:30,323
<i>Moving on to California</i>
<i>where they really appreciate</i>
<i>people in my profession.</i>

1262
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:32,259
<i>I wanted him to see it</i>
<i>before I left.</i>

1263
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:35,562
<i>To show him that I was a man.</i>

1264
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:37,531
<i>You robbed me of that.</i>

1265
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:41,635
<i>All my crimes, wiped away,</i>
<i>assigned to a corpse.</i>

1266
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:43,904
<i>The corpse of a man I surpassed
in every way.</i>

1267
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,108
<i>I had a rough time after that.</i>

1268
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,044
<i>I couldn't get out of bed.</i>
<i>I wouldn't take my calls.</i>

1269
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:52,646
Go away!

1270
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:56,950
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

1271
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:02,422
<i>My friends, they took me out,</i>
<i>tried to introduce me to girls.</i>

1272
01:31:02,424 --> 01:31:05,292
He's in the back, right there.

1273
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:07,694
He sure is nice.

1274
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:10,797
Is your mom around? No?
<i>Nothing.</i>

1275
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,999
<i>And then it comes to me.</i>

1276
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:18,138
<i>I needed to go back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>

1277
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:22,476
<i>When things were more simple,</i>
<i>more clearer.</i>

1278
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,245
<i>My goal statement.</i>

1279
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:34,120
<i>Mmm. Now let me think.</i>

1280
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,124
<i>Who stands in my way?</i>

1281
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:39,726
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1282
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,098
<i>Detective Stan Jeter.</i>

1283
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,202
<i>The man who stole my greatest
moment of triumph.</i>

1284
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:51,605
<i>Now that man had to pay.</i>

1285
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:06,553
Well, bravo, Detective.

1286
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:08,788
You have all the answers.

1287
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,525
Too bad you don't have
much time left.

1288
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,393
What are you talking about?

1289
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:16,763
You didn't think I could take care
of this all by myself, did you?

1290
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:22,969
Oh, no. Too many loose ends
for one man.

1291
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,610
I have my own apprentice now.

1292
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:33,980
And he should be here any minute.

1293
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:45,025
Amy?

1294
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,263
Amy, can you hear me?

1295
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,203
Amy. Amy. Oh, Amy.

1296
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,373
Oh, shit.

1297
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:11,351
Amy, wake up. Amy. Amy, wake up.

1298
01:33:11,353 --> 01:33:13,920
Come on.

1299
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:17,824
- Okay.
- We're getting out of here.

1300
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,370
<i>Stop it!</i>

1301
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:11,077
<i>No! Stop!</i>

1302
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:12,445
I'm in here!

1303
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:23,223
No surrender! Let's move in!

1304
01:34:23,225 --> 01:34:25,925
- Police, I need help!
- Drop the weapon!

1305
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:28,928
Guys, I said I need help!

1306
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,131
Somebody help! Keep Amy breathing!

1307
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:34,100
- Drop your weapon!
- No, he's in the basement!

1308
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:55,922
<i>So that was my story.</i>

1309
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:58,792
<i>Wish I could say it had
a happy ending.</i>

1310
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:01,394
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>

1311
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:04,631
<i>In the end, I don't know
if they mean shit.</i>

1312
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:06,966
<i>Because he was right.</i>

1313
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:10,236
<i>People see what
they want to see.</i>

1314
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:16,476
- So that's it?
- Pretty much.

1315
01:35:16,478 --> 01:35:18,578
Hard to argue with that much
physical evidence.

1316
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:21,815
Three dead cops, two killed
with bullets from my gun.

1317
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:24,050
Kind of hard to talk your way
out of that one.

1318
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:33,159
And the kiddy porn thing. Juries
don't really like that.

1319
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:38,865
Hey, what's he doing?

1320
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:41,334
But you claim you're innocent.

1321
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,438
And this mysterious kidnapper?

1322
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,209
The guy who supposedly kept you
in the basement the whole time?

1323
01:35:49,211 --> 01:35:50,810
What about him?

1324
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:05,425
- He was gone.
- And how would you respond to
those who say you made him up?

1325
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:09,462
Well, it doesn't really matter
much now, does it?

1326
01:36:09,464 --> 01:36:10,930
Amy Maxwell?

1327
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:13,967
Coma, three months.

1328
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:15,702
Time's up.

1329
01:36:15,704 --> 01:36:18,037
I have a few more questions.
Time's up.

1330
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,912
<i>He was still out there.</i>

1331
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,081
<i>And no one knew him</i>
<i>better than me.</i>

1332
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:31,251
<i>How he operates, what
he's capable of.</i>

1333
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:35,855
<i>I wasn't done, not by a long shot.</i>

1334
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:38,224
<i>One day, I'll be free.</i>

1335
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:41,361
<i>And then I'm gonna do to him</i>
<i>what he did to me.</i>

1336
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,136
<i>And then it all changed.</i>

1337
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,511
<i>Amy was awake.</i>

1338
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,980
<i>And talking.</i>

1339
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:05,852
<i>The evidence against me took on
a new light, and it didn't hold up.</i>

1340
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:08,555
<i>Now getting free was just
the beginning.</i>

1341
01:37:08,557 --> 01:37:11,658
<i>I thought back to all that I learned</i>
<i>that first night of poker.</i>

1342
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,494
<i>Then, they were just stories, but
now they were my guides.</i>

1343
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:18,164
<i>A map that would lead me to
the end of my journey, to him.</i>

1344
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,767
<i>I was using my brain and
following my heart.</i>

1345
01:37:20,769 --> 01:37:22,602
<i>Lots of false leads</i>
<i>and wrong turns,</i>

1346
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:26,439
<i>but I knew I was getting closer,</i>
<i>patiently moving forward.</i>

1347
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:29,275
<i>I knew this guy better
than anyone else.</i>

1348
01:37:29,277 --> 01:37:31,377
<i>I knew how he thought, what
he was looking for.</i>

1349
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:35,014
<i>I knew his reasons. And that
meant I could catch him.</i>

1350
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:55,368
And I heard this little girl
screaming. So I went over to
see what was happening.

1351
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,406
- How does that look?
- Oh, yeah, that was def...

1352
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:41,848
So..so, that's it.
He got him?

1353
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,384
He's a cop. That's what he does.

1354
01:38:44,386 --> 01:38:47,553
One shot, right through the heart.

1355
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:49,322
And I say, rot in peace.

1356
01:38:49,324 --> 01:38:53,092
We lost two of our best
to that bastard.

1357
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,528
There's only one choice there.

1358
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,264
That's your captain.

1359
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:02,201
Pride of the department.
He got two fucking parades
for that.

1360
01:39:02,203 --> 01:39:05,138
Got more balls than he
does brains, man.

1361
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,074
Hey, that's my kind of cop.

1362
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,876
Who's your kind of cop?

1363
01:39:09,878 --> 01:39:11,110
- Hey!
- Not you.

1364
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,146
Finally. Come on, you're late.
Sit down.

1365
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:16,416
- What, you don't wear a watch?
- There it is.

1366
01:39:16,418 --> 01:39:18,818
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get the game on.

1367
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,119
Go. Salud.

1368
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:25,959
They always like this, Captain?

1369
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,961
Always. I told you it was gonna
be like this.

1370
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:29,929
Don't listen to a word he tells you.

1371
01:39:29,931 --> 01:39:32,999
This guy was crapping his pants
worse than you his first night.

1372
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:35,234
Couldn't play cards. Couldn't
tell stories.

1373
01:39:35,236 --> 01:39:38,438
Same then as he is now.
Uno, baby.

1374
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,974
Stop jawing. Start dealing. Let's play
some fucking cards.

1375
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:43,076
You done bitching?

1376
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:46,746
Alright. Here we go. Five card stud,
no wilds.

1377
01:39:46,748 --> 01:39:50,450
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>

1378
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:53,519
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>that was the purpose</i>
<i>of poker night.</i>

1379
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:55,755
<i>To teach the next guy a lesson
from your mistakes.</i>

1380
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,105
<i>We deal with three percent</i>
<i>of the population...</i>

1381
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:14,107
<i>97% of the time.</i>

1382
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:15,808
<i>And they all think they're smarter
than you.</i>

1383
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,410
<i>They're not.</i>

1384
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,184
<i>Except for the ones</i>
<i>who actually are.</i>

1385
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:31,624
<i>We never catch those bastards.</i>
<i>We just pretend they don't exist.</i>

1386
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:33,793
