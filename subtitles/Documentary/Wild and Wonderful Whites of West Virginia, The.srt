2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,380
Okay. I'm hanging up.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,990
Oh, why wasn't she more careful?

4
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,320
Dongok got into an accident and got hurt.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,020
But one of the singers at the club didn't show,

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,380
so I have to cover for him.

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,590
Can you drop by and check on them?

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,850
Why don't you go?

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,720
If mom finds out, she'll lose it,

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,120
so don't let her find out.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,120
Are you hurt anywhere else?

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,450
If you feel any pain later on...

13
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,790
Come in!

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,390
Who... Are you?

15
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,690
I'm Ms. Kang Dongok's guardian.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,650
She was wearing a helmet,

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,720
so she didn't get seriously hurt.

18
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,150
I ran a few basic tests,

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,920
but there are only superficial wounds.

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,690
Okay, thank you.

21
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,920
But the driver wasn't wearing a helmet,

22
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,320
so she should go to a bigger hospital...

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,420
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,490
So what happened?

25
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,350
That's crazy. I knew he'd do something,

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,590
but I didn't know he'd go so low.

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,150
I mean, how could a person do...

28
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,250
Hold on, hold on.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,350
The treatment is finished,

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,120
so you can take her home.

31
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,020
Okay, so tell me. Yeah?

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,090
Man! How could that be?

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,280
Dongok.

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,320
Kang Dongok.

35
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,790
Dongok...

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,220
It's me, Dongseok.

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,920
I know.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Are you okay?

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,050
Should we go to a bigger hospital?

40
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,190
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,020
For what?

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,020
For everything.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,090
What do you mean?

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,390
I'm sorry, Dongseok.

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,920
There's nothing to be sorry for.

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,280
So don't say you're sorry.

47
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,350
I'm sorry, Dongseok.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,720
If you say you're sorry one more time!

49
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm going to get really mad!

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,850
Uh, okay. I won't say that.

51
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,350
It's my fault. I'm sorry, Dongseok.

52
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,790
Excuse me, but I need you to come with me.

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,250
If you want to die, do it alone!

54
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,150
Why would you take my sister

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,090
along for the ride?

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,250
Come out right now!

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,890
You better come out!

58
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,050
I can't come out!

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,990
If I do, you'll kill me! I'm not crazy!

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,850
Oh, your mouth seems to be working fine,

61
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,990
so you must be okay!

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Get out of there!

63
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,790
No! I'm never coming out!

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,890
You...

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,950
Come out on the count of 3

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,750
or I'll break this door down!

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,750
1, 2, 3!

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,950
Kang Donghui.

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,950
What do you want?

70
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,480
Dongok's asking for you.

71
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,050
You should go.

72
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,480
Cha Haewon! Come out right now!

73
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,350
Get out, Donghui.

74
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,250
Mind your own business and get lost!

75
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,350
I said open the door!

76
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,690
Get out.

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,650
You get lost!

78
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,020
Get out!

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,490
Donghui.

80
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,550
Dongseok...

81
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,620
Are you... Fighting?

82
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,950
Don't fight, Dongseok.

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,250
Don't fight, Donghui.

84
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,950
Don't fight...

85
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,450
Donghui.

86
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,390
We're not fighting. We weren't fighting.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,250
We were just kidding around. Honest.

88
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,480
- Honest? 
 - Yes, honest.

89
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,350
Let's get out of here.

90
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,850
I'll tell you why we were

91
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,050
kidding around like that.

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,250
Let's go.

93
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,450
Haewon, come out here.

94
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,020
I heard you got hurt.

95
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,950
Come on.

96
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,150
Cha Haewon!

97
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,450
Is Dongok okay?

98
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm sorry

99
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,820
for letting Dongok get hurt.

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,120
What are you doing? Let me go!

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,150
What are you doing?

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,790
Let go of me.

103
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,420
Huh? Let go!

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,420
- What are you doing? 
 - Just get in!

105
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,750
What are you doing? Where are we going?

106
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,050
To a bigger hospital.

107
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,190
Yellow's "baby seed"

108
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,690
runs to Red's "baby house"

109
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,920
and becomes one with Red's "baby seed."

110
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,690
What does this mean?

111
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,150
Who's Yellow and who's Red?

112
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Were you sleeping during the documentary?

113
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,720
Yellow is dad, and Red is mom.

114
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,350
Dad's seed meets mom's seed

115
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,990
and they become a baby.

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,250
Oh, why is it so complicated?

117
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,550
I'm not doing my homework.

118
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,820
What's really weird isn't that.

119
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,950
Mom!

120
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,150
Hey.

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,650
Are you doing your homework?

122
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,790
Eat this while you do it.

123
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,950
Yes!

124
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,450
Mom, may I ask you a question?

125
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,420
Of course! What's your question?

126
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,090
When you had us, you were 56 years old?

127
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,820
Yes, I was.

128
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,990
You weren't going through menopause?

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,320
The book said women

130
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,190
go through it in their 50s.

131
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,590
Menopause? What's that?

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,820
Is that food?

133
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,150
You don't need to know that.

134
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,150
I'll explain it to you when you're older.

135
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,990
Oh! I forgot!

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,620
I left the kettle on the stove!

137
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,520
Eat this up and go to bed.

138
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,850
Wasn't that a bit odd?

139
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,650
Something's fishy, don't you think?

140
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,250
Whoa! You nose works so well!

141
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,120
How did you know I farted?

142
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,250
It didn't even make any sound.

143
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,720
Soshim, what's wrong?

144
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,890
Did something happen again?

145
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,850
I thought they were little babies,

146
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,250
but they're all grown up.

147
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,820
Who? Dongwon and Dongju?

148
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,220
Yes.

149
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,720
They asked how old I was when I had them

150
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,550
and asked about my menopause.

151
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,850
Kids these days know everything.

152
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,150
Wow! Dongju's a real sharp one!

153
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,950
Her favorite TV show is "Ask Anything."

154
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
Just wait. Soon, she'll uncover

155
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,750
who her real mother is.

156
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
I know!

157
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,650
We can't hide the truth forever.

158
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,790
They'll find out that Donghui isn't

159
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,480
their brother but their father.

160
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,850
How long should I keep this a secret?

161
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,090
Why didn't you put Donghui

162
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,350
as their father on their birth certificates?

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,020
Because I didn't want to ruin my son's future.

164
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,520
If anyone knew they were Donghui's kids,

165
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,150
who would ever want to marry him?

166
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,150
He said he wanted his name on the birth

167
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,290
certificates, but I locked him up in his room

168
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,950
and went to get their birth certificates.

169
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,090
You were so considerate...

170
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,150
You're such a thoughtful person!

171
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,650
I could never do something like that.

172
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,720
Wait, I told Donghui to apologize to grandpa,

173
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,020
so where is he?

174
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,090
I'm not too heavy?

175
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,950
You're not heavy.

176
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,850
I could carry 10 of you on my back.

177
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,220
We could've taken your motorcycle.

178
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,450
You want to get on a motorcycle after

179
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,150
being hurt on one?

180
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,020
No, not really.

181
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,820
I can bring my motorcycle home tomorrow.

182
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,220
I like giving you a piggy back ride.

183
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,750
Haewon...

184
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,620
She got hurt because of me.

185
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,550
We were on the scooter,

186
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,190
and I dropped my bag,

187
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,990
so I got up to pick it up.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,690
That's how we got hurt.

189
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,250
She should've driven better.

190
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,190
Haewon gave me the head thing,

191
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,320
so she got hurt much more than I did.

192
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,450
She deserves it!

193
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,590
Why?

194
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,480
She's rude and mean.

195
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,050
Haewon is nice.

196
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,480
No, she's not.

197
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,090
She is.

198
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,790
You don't know what you're talking about.

199
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,950
Dongseok is nice, too.

200
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,920
By that standard, serial killers are nice, too.

201
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,620
Dongseok is nice, and Haewon is nice, too.

202
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,150
By those standards, witches are nice,

203
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,990
the Grim Reaper's nice,

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,280
and Hitler is nice, too!

205
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,320
What?

206
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,850
Let me down!

207
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,350
I don't want to talk to you.

208
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,220
Let me down!

209
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,750
This is crazy.

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
Fine, fine.

211
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,690
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,690
Dongseok is nice, Haewon is nice,

213
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,790
everybody and anybody's nice.

214
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,450
Happy?

215
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,720
Promise me you won't

216
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,790
fight with Dongseok anymore.

217
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,050
I won't, I won't.

218
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,290
Are we good?

219
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,820
We're good.

220
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,150
Get on my back.

221
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,690
Dongok?

222
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,750
Yeah?

223
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,420
You...

224
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes?

225
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,350
You don't hate Dongseok?

226
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,320
I don't.

227
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,050
That must be nice.

228
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,020
Not hating Dongseok.

229
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,550
It is nice.

230
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,520
I can call you a cab, if you want.

231
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,750
You know how expensive that would be?

232
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,690
Please take me home.

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,380
I can do it myself.

234
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,850
This is because

235
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,420
I'm in so much pain, exhausted,

236
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,990
and sleepy,

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,950
and I didn't want to die just yet,

238
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,950
so I did everything you wanted to do.

239
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,090
But don't rub it in.

240
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,220
What if I want to?

241
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,450
Text me your account number,

242
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,690
and I'll wire you the money you spent on me.

243
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,120
Okay.

244
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,250
What's your number?

245
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,550
I'll need it to text you my account number.

246
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,350
I'll just give it to Donghui.

247
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,590
You think he'd give it to me?

248
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,390
Then I'll give it to Dongok.

249
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,620
You don't want me to know your number?

250
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,420
Is she hurt seriously?

251
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,420
No, just a bit.

252
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,890
Shh, be quiet.

253
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,720
We can't let mom find out.

254
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,650
I know.

255
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,790
She asked me where Dongok went,

256
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,890
and I told her she was with Haewon.

257
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,090
I told her I'd open the door for her

258
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,890
and that she could go to bed.

259
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,650
You're so smart! Who do you take after?

260
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,650
Dongseok!

261
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,750
Where do you live? Which way is it?

262
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,790
My name is Cha Haewon.

263
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,320
My dream is marrying you, Dongseok.

264
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,050
I've made my decision, so you should...

265
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,050
My dream is to grow up quickly

266
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,920
and leave this town.

267
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:09,790
So I won't see idiots like you ever again.

268
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,490
I won't give up on you.

269
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,650
I'll make you fall in love with me.

270
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,550
I'm serious. I can do it.

271
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,350
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

272
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,120
What happened?

273
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,550
I didn't want to wake you.

274
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,050
And I didn't know where you live.

275
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,050
Where do you live?

276
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,250
This is your home?

277
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,280
No, my office.

278
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,180
I'll send you the money.

279
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,350
Seunghun.

280
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,450
What the heck!

281
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,950
Where were you last night?

282
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
Do you know how many times I called you?

283
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,750
My phone got smashed.

284
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,020
Who's in that car?

285
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,890
Who were you with last night?

286
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,920
What were you two doing all night?

287
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,690
Can't you tell from her face?

288
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,290
Haewon's hurt.

289
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,850
Who are you?

290
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,120
Me?

291
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,650
Kang Dongseok.

292
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,950
You're Oh Seunghun, right?

293
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,990
I'm going upstairs.

294
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,890
I remember you.

295
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,650
Don't you remember me?

296
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,650
Of course I do.

297
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,790
My grades weren't as good as yours,

298
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,550
but I'm still smarter than you.

299
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,050
Haewon was in a scooter accident.

300
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,820
She may have delayed symptoms from

301
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,890
the accident, so if that happens,

302
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,280
take her to see a doctor.

303
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,950
Were you with Haewon all night?

304
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,280
I'm sure her treatment didn't last all night,

305
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,020
so what were you doing?

306
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,250
Why should I tell you what we were doing?

307
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,090
Tell me! I have a right to know!

308
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,050
Haewon is my girlfriend!

309
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,690
Then ask her yourself.

310
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,050
See you around, Seunghun.

311
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,490
He thinks he's so special!

312
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,920
Cha Haewon! You stay right there!

313
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,350
What did you do with him all night?

314
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,850
I slept.

315
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,350
What? You slept?

316
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,290
I got a shot, and I slept in his car.

317
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,490
That's the best excuse you've got?

318
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,650
Give me the details.

319
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,690
What did you do in the car with him?

320
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,320
Seunghun, I'm in a lot of pain right now.

321
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,280
You're in pain? I'm in pain, too!

322
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,420
Stop pretending to be in pain and talk.

323
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,090
Didn't you say you were in love with me?

324
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,090
So what were you two doing together?

325
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,790
Don't close your eyes!

326
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,420
You feel too guilty to face me?

327
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,120
Open your eyes and tell me what you did!

328
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,850
Seunghun, are you going to marry me?

329
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,620
Whoa, why are you bringing that up?

330
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,090
About last night with Kang Dongseok...

331
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,420
Seunghun, if you're going to marry me,

332
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,250
I'll tell you what I did with Kang Dongseok

333
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,150
for each hour I was with him.

334
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,690
I'm going home to change.

335
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,550
Hey! Hey!

336
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,350
Whoa! My neck's stiff!

337
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,950
I already have someone in mind.

338
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,050
Oh?

339
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,290
Oh, right, right.

340
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,690
Your boss, Oh Seunghun?

341
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,390
I heard you've been chasing after him.

342
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,350
It's not like that.

343
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,050
He's interested in me, too,

344
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,050
but he's playing hard to get.

345
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,280
Dongseok said something came up last night.

346
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,850
But he's coming home tonight,

347
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,290
so just hold on, father.

348
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,250
You told me that 3 times already.

349
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,020
I did?

350
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,650
I've been absent-minded lately,

351
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,990
so I repeat things over and over.

352
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,550
Maybe you should get examined for dementia.

353
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,890
Don't worry.

354
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,350
I won't get that. I must stay healthy

355
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,320
to take care of you.

356
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,190
I won't cause you any pain from now on,

357
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,720
so please don't get sick, Soshim.

358
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,690
If something happens to you, I'll just die.

359
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,120
Okay, I'll never ever get sick.

360
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,650
Have some water, father.

361
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,050
What's Donghui doing?

362
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,890
Did you kill my precious grandson?

363
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,850
Donghui.

364
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,350
Donghui.

365
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,320
Huh? What? Are you in pain?

366
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,820
No, I'm not.

367
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,790
Why are you sleeping here?

368
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,150
In case I needed to take you to the hospital.

369
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,350
Are you really okay?

370
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,450
Yes, I'm fine.

371
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,520
Tell mom you tripped on the stairs.

372
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,380
If you tell her the truth, she'll pass out.

373
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,820
Okay.

374
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,590
Get up. You need to go to school.

375
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,420
Kang Dongju! Hey.

376
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,120
Whatever. Keep sleeping.

377
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,620
Sleeping's more important than school.

378
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,150
You didn't go home last night?

379
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,320
No. Something came up.

380
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,820
Can I see where Mr. Han's accident occurred?

381
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,350
Right now?

382
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,850
Yes, right now.

383
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,180
I can take you there,

384
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,350
but did you know they wanted to cover it up?

385
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,650
Mr. Han was really stressed out about it.

386
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,480
If you're worried about me,

387
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,890
I appreciate the thought.

388
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,320
If you're trying to get in my way...

389
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,820
Now that you say they wanted to cover it up,

390
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,650
I'm even more intrigued.

391
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,380
Does that make me crazy?

392
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,220
This was where the accident occurred?

393
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,290
But this isn't an accident-prone location.

394
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,790
Mr. Han's a careful driver, and since it was

395
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,350
nighttime, I'm sure he was even more careful.

396
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,320
He tried to avoid a car coming

397
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,280
from the opposite direction?

398
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,920
Where does this road lead to?

399
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,950
Is there a lot of traffic at night?

400
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,750
It's a shortcut to the expressway,

401
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,090
but at that hour, there's hardly any traffic.

402
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,250
Only the locals take this road.

403
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,590
You said there was no black box in the car?

404
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,820
Right. Mr. Han had one installed in his car,

405
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,320
but it was gone.

406
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,790
Are you sure it was gone?

407
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,750
I was the one who got it installed for him.

408
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,690
Who's this Bae Taejin guy he was meeting?

409
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,750
He runs 12 massage parlors in this area.

410
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,450
He called Mr. Han that night.

411
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,820
Mr. Han was on his way to see him.

412
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,180
You said Mr. Bae's body was found

413
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,990
1km away from here?

414
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,350
Yes, a bit less than 1km.

415
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,850
2 men who were supposed to meet each

416
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,650
other got into accidents 20 minutes apart.

417
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,020
1 died and the other was seriously injured,

418
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,720
but both were deemed as accidents.

419
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,650
It's certain, then.

420
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,650
Huh? What is?

421
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,050
Let's throw out all previous records,

422
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,090
and start this investigation from scratch.

423
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,550
Okay. I got it.

424
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,550
Keep a close eye on that rookie prosecutor

425
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,790
and find out what he's up to.

426
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,220
Father!

427
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,220
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

428
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,850
You!

429
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,590
What have you been up to lately? Huh?

430
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,650
Uh, I'm not really up to anything.

431
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,620
I've been working hard, meeting customers.

432
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,890
Father!

433
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,520
Some girl called me.

434
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,820
She said she's carrying your child,

435
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,890
and asked what she should do.

436
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,650
Who?

437
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,950
Who would dare to do that?

438
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,320
Did she say her name was Yeongsuk?

439
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,920
Or Yunjeong?

440
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,250
You bastard!

441
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm sorry, father!

442
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,120
You...

443
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,920
When you do something,

444
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,480
you have to learn to take responsibility!

445
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,180
How can you let her call me!

446
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,620
Am I your secretary?

447
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,390
I'm sorry, father! Please don't kill me!

448
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,820
So...

449
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,490
Is Haewon still chasing you around?

450
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,650
Yes.

451
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,990
Is she out of her mind?

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,550
How could she fall for a man like you?

453
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,590
She has to be nuts!

454
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,850
Man!

455
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,420
Hello? Haewon!

456
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,620
Cha Haewon! My baby girl!

457
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,590
It's your father.

458
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,020
Why won't you call home?

459
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,550
Your mom's been pouting about it.

460
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,320
It's raining here.

461
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,820
It's been pouring since afternoon.

462
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,450
The rain made me miss you even more,

463
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,550
so I had some rice wine.

464
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,920
My baby girl, Haewon.

465
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:45,650
I know studying abroad is hard,

466
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,490
but can't you come home to see me?

467
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,650
Why did you ask to see me?

468
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,520
Haewon, I'll call you again.

469
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,390
Did you do this?

470
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,550
Is this all your doing, Oh Chisu?

471
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,450
Is this all your doing, Oh Chisu?

472
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,950
Is this all your doing, Oh Chisu?

473
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,150
Oh, look at you!

474
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,490
What happened to your face?

475
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,690
Who did you beat up this time?

476
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,290
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

477
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,620
How embarrassing.

478
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,390
I'm so ashamed of you!

479
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,590
If your dad saw you like this from heaven,

480
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,390
he'd try to come back to punish you!

481
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,620
What's that?

482
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,450
Good or bad, you're still my daughter,

483
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,650
so I brought these for you,

484
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,520
but I shouldn't give them to you.

485
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,190
I can't give them to a girl who gets into

486
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,350
fights all over town.

487
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,150
Go drink some tap water instead.

488
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,650
I'm giving this to your sister.

489
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,280
You can't just give them to someone else!

490
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,320
What's 3 times 8?

491
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,690
3 times 8? Why?

492
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,890
The multiplication table. 3 times 8.

493
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,890
You don't know that?

494
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,850
I'm trying to test you.

495
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,220
Haeju says

496
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,480
the shock of your father's death

497
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,990
has driven you a bit mad.

498
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,280
I haven't gone mad.

499
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,050
3 times 8 is 21! Right?

500
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,950
Haeju, are you still sleeping?

501
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,120
Cha Haeju, wake up!

502
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,420
Oh, leave her alone. Don't wake her up.

503
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,990
She needs her beauty sleep.

504
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,720
My Haeju,

505
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,950
have nice dreams and sleep tight.

506
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,520
You're my only hope now.

507
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,520
Sleep well and get more beautiful,

508
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,790
and find a rich man to marry,

509
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,650
and rescue me from this hell, Haeju.

510
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,550
My princess.

511
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,250
My darling girl.

512
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,320
Mom! Did you buy this with my credit card?

513
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,750
So what are you going to do about that?

514
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,520
What are you going to do?

515
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,590
If you keep messing with me,

516
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,520
I'll kill you, Cha Haewon!

517
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,990
Cha Haewon, you!

518
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,890
Donghui...

519
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,620
Let me go, let me go.

520
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,350
Why do you talk so violently

521
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,790
even in your dreams?

522
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,350
Your real life is violent enough.

523
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,820
You should at least have sweet dreams.

524
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,420
Why are you in my room, old woman?

525
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,090
Your mom sent me.

526
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,120
What does she want?

527
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,120
Go to your grandfather

528
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,720
and apologize and promise

529
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,350
never to yell at him again.

530
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,250
Or else she's going on a hunger strike.

531
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,380
Your mom hasn't eaten since last night.

532
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,490
If something happens to her, I'll kill you.

533
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,250
I'll rip you to shreds!

534
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,990
You're getting old, so don't push yourself.

535
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,890
Trying to teach him a lesson might kill you.

536
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,280
I know your hunger strikes have

537
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,420
worked in the past for Donghui many times.

538
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,050
You stopped him from moving in with Sohui,

539
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,850
his kindergarten sweetheart.

540
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,850
You stopped him when he demanded you to

541
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,350
let him marry his middle school teacher.

542
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,090
And when he was in high school,

543
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,090
he fell in love with actress Lee Yeongae,

544
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,790
and he wanted to quit school

545
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,090
to become her body guard.

546
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,720
Your hunger strikes did work all those times.

547
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,250
But Donghui's an adult now,

548
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,120
and you're much older.

549
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,280
And I think this is getting kind of old.

550
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,820
Uncle's right, mom.

551
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,750
You can't threaten me into apologizing!

552
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,050
This isn't a threat!

553
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,690
Your mom hasn't eaten since last night.

554
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,720
She's going to starve herself to her grave!

555
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,590
Still, I'm not apologizing.

556
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,420
Fine. Don't apologize.

557
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,480
You wouldn't mean it anyway.

558
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,820
So don't ever apologize.

559
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,120
Don't.

560
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,220
Oh, Soshim!

561
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,750
Mom!

562
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,150
What's wrong with me, Ssangho?

563
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,650
Soshim! Keeping this up will kill you!

564
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,890
Who cares?

565
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,850
Just let me die.

566
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,520
I should be struck by lightning

567
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,850
for having a good-for-nothing son like him,

568
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,750
so it'd be better off if I starved to death.

569
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,250
At least I'd die being skinny.

570
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,990
That's a cheap shot, grandpa.

571
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,120
Cheap shot?

572
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,550
You're a man and older than I am.

573
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,090
Yet you used your daughter-in-law to

574
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,280
make me apologize to you.

575
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,420
Don't lecture me, boy!

576
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,690
Soshim! Donghui's trying to lecture me!

577
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,180
Grandpa!

578
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,920
Soshim!

579
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,120
Donghui's yelling at me now!

580
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,220
When did I yell at you?

581
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:29,150
Soshim! Donghui's trying to hit me!

582
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,920
I'm sorry. You're really something...

583
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,850
What did you say? I can't hear you.

584
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,220
I said I'm sorry.

585
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,520
I'm old and going deaf. I can't hear.

586
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,590
I said I'm sorry, so you can beat me up!

587
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,550
Why would I beat my precious grandson up?

588
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,890
Oh, my precious boy, have a candy.

589
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,790
Fine.

590
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,020
Say, "Ready, action."

591
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,520
Ready.

592
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,550
Action!

593
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,480
Dongsu, despite how things turned out,

594
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,180
I've never blamed you once.

595
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,190
If you were me, you wouldn't have, either.

596
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,590
We do what we're told.

597
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,490
We do what we're told, right?

598
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,550
Did someone tell you to kill me?

599
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,820
What's he saying?

600
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,220
Hello.

601
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,120
Your timing is unbelievable.

602
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,150
I was about to say

603
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,890
"You go... To Hawaii."

604
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,380
Did you get some practice?

605
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,020
Why are you teaching Haeju Chinese?

606
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,950
I'm not making enough money working for you.

607
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,180
I've been taking care of her since last week.

608
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,020
You stay out of this.

609
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:58,020
I need to talk to him about going to China.

610
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,550
But Haeju,

611
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,220
are you sure you studied?

612
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,720
Of course!

613
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,550
Introduce yourself in Chinese.

614
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,890
That's a piece of cake.

615
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,020
"I love you."

616
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,220
No? Then...

617
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,480
"Did you eat?"

618
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,120
You think you can work in China?

619
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,890
You can't even speak the language.

620
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,590
I can memorize all these in 10 minutes.

621
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,020
You're funny.

622
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,050
I know how you did in school.

623
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,950
Why don't you fix that accent of yours?

624
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,320
Hey, Cha Haeju!

625
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,820
Yes, director.

626
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,620
Oh, hello.

627
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,720
Director?

628
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,090
What director? From where?

629
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,220
Do you have to do this?

630
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,550
Yes!

631
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,050
There's only 1 spot open on the home shopping

632
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,790
channel, so Haeju can take this one.

633
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,320
And when something else comes along,

634
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,220
Dongtak, you can take it.

635
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,050
Shut up!

636
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,150
Okay, then.

637
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,750
Who makes it look more delicious?

638
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,380
Auditions for eating blue crabs in soy sauce!

639
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,620
Let's do this.

640
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,590
Start!

641
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,550
You've stolen my heart!

642
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,790
My love, blue crabs in soy sauce!

643
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,790
Since you're all so handsome,

644
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,850
the soju's on the house.

645
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,350
So please come again.

646
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,380
Goodbye.

647
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,620
- Thank you. 
 - Bye.

648
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,320
Promise me you'll be back!

649
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,990
Thank you.

650
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,720
Some of the onions I delivered were rotten?

651
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,750
Not all of them, just a couple.

652
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,820
Even so, I'll exchange them for you.

653
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,820
I'm sorry.

654
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,320
I'll bring you another sack tomorrow.

655
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,690
Oh, she stinks!

656
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,890
Doesn't she take showers?

657
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,090
That stain on her jacket's a month old.

658
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,390
How gross!

659
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,050
She's too busy working.

660
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,850
Ssangho, when a man is a neat-freak,

661
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,750
women don't like it.

662
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,990
That's why you're still single.

663
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,180
I'd rather be single for the rest of my life

664
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,050
than marry a woman like her.

665
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,690
I'm sure she has a boyfriend.

666
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,490
You shouldn't be so mean.

667
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,420
If there's a man who says he likes her,

668
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,820
I'd pull all my hair out and give it to him.

669
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,180
Okay?

670
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,150
Didn't you miss me?

671
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,620
I did.

672
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,320
Let me see...

673
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,450
Look at your hand!

674
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,050
Oh, right!

675
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,920
I ordered this for you.

676
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,150
What's this?

677
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,090
You don't look so well these days,

678
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,450
and you've lost weight.

679
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,850
That's because I'm old and I drink a lot.

680
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,350
So have this and get healthy.

681
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,820
It's okay. You drink it.

682
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,750
Just seeing your face makes me feel alive.

683
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,990
You're my red ginseng.

684
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,550
This is a gift. Take it.

685
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,920
Man!

686
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,790
Men are supposed to give gifts.

687
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,350
Women are supposed to give love.

688
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,320
Ssangshik!

689
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,690
I want to stay longer,

690
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,990
but the principal might want me.

691
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,750
Oh, you should go.

692
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,150
Come here.

693
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,150
Drive carefully and don't get sick!

694
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,790
Don't go showing off your strength.

695
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,280
Remember, you are a lady. Got it?

696
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,650
Got it.

697
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,180
See you later.

698
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,550
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

699
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,050
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes! Goodbye.

700
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,250
Mul! Dongju!

701
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,420
Shouldn't you be going home?

702
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,720
We're going to the nurse's office

703
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,280
to get our friend.

704
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,650
A friend? Who?

705
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,820
Iseul.

706
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,850
Dongwon's ex-girlfriend.

707
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,990
Uncle Dongwon was two-timing?

708
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,920
He was seeing you and Shin Minji, too?

709
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:08,120
Aunt Dongju, did you know about this?

710
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:08,920
Yes...

711
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,890
And you didn't try to stop him?

712
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,690
You think Dongwon would listen to me

713
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,220
if I told him not to be a two-timer?

714
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,950
Not really...

715
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,280
This is why you should've gone out with me!

716
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,380
The girls at this school have no taste in men!

717
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,420
What's so great about Kang Dongwon?

718
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,950
Why does everyone want him?

719
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,990
I get better grades, and I'm more handsome.

720
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,350
Does Mul like you, too?

721
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,280
Were you in a love triangle?

722
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:50,620
We weren't. I only love Dongwon.

723
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,890
Dongju, you're his twin sister,

724
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,990
so can you help me get him back?

725
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,450
I may be his twin sister, but I can't do that.

726
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,920
Why would you even want him back?

727
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,120
Ms. Kim...

728
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,650
Cheon Iseul!

729
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,690
Get over that two-timing jerk!

730
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,850
Get over him and find someone else.

731
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,050
Dongwon's not the only man on earth.

732
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,050
Find a new boyfriend,

733
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,480
get married,

734
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,250
and have lots of children!

735
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,920
Ms. Kim!

736
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,250
What you just said

737
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:33,820
isn't appropriate to say to a 9-year-old girl.

738
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,380
I know...

739
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,950
What's wrong with me...

740
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,320
I'm so sorry, girls.

741
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:57,280
I have a fever, so I'm not myself today.

742
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,120
Oh, boy!

743
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,720
He's going to be just like Donghui...

744
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,320
Can you stop the car for a second?

745
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,450
If you want to catch the broker,

746
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,220
there's the way that you go to the

747
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,480
legal aid cooperation.

748
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,790
It's too far, and you don't even

749
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,320
speak Korean so well,

750
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,380
so I'll file a complaint on behalf of you.

751
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,450
Thank you, thank you.

752
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,720
And here's the address and phone number of

753
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,280
the foreign labor center.

754
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,520
It's a safe place, so you can stay there with

755
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,120
your baby for a while.

756
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:28,180
They also provide vocational education,

757
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,590
so if you need it, just tell me.

758
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,790
Thank you, thank you.

759
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,790
By the way, do you have any powdered milk?

760
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,120
That can't be!

761
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,550
I just used it at another place.

762
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,320
Try swiping it again.

763
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:32,650
I tried it 5 times. It says it's suspended.

764
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,550
Why don't you call the credit card company?

765
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,550
No... That can't be.

766
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,950
Then, can you give me this on credit?

767
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,550
Excuse me?

768
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,550
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.

769
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,690
I'm a regular here.

770
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,290
Just give me these on credit.

771
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,690
I can't do that.

772
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,720
Then what about the sashimi, the beef,

773
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,320
and the hairtail they cut up for me?

774
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:07,120
My family needs to eat them tonight.

775
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,790
Here.

776
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,950
Why don't you charge it on my credit card?

777
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,720
Okay. The total is $181.25.

778
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:25,550
Excuse me, but who are you?

779
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,250
Have we met before?

780
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,950
Are you from this neighborhood?

781
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,820
It's been a while. I'm Kang Dongseok.

782
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,220
You haven't changed a bit.

783
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,450
We give out the fastest loans.

784
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,890
Women get special interest rates.

785
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,590
Happy Cash.

786
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,620
We give out the fastest loans.

787
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,290
Women get special interest rates.

788
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,650
Haewon, Haewon!

789
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,320
Happy Cash.

790
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,850
Did you suspend my credit card?

791
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,720
That's not yours, it's mine!

792
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,180
You know what happened

793
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,820
to me, because of you?

794
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,620
Can't you see I'm working?

795
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,550
We can talk at home...

796
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,250
Because you suspended my credit card,

797
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:20,220
Kang Dongseok paid for our stuff, girl!

798
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:24,890
That dumb, vulgar boy, the housekeeper's son!

799
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,120
The very boy who used to eat our leftovers!

800
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,120
He paid for our stuff!

801
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,790
He was showing off, boasting,

802
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,090
laughing at us for losing everything!

803
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,620
Oh! How humiliating!

804
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,250
Why did he have to see me like that?

805
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,220
Oh, the humiliation!

806
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,450
It was so humiliating!

807
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,820
Prosecutor Kang Dongseok!

808
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,820
What are you doing here?

809
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,590
How are you feeling?

810
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,220
What's this?

811
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,990
The money my mom

812
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,120
borrowed at the grocery store.

813
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,020
It's okay. I just wanted to...

814
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,320
Take it.

815
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,450
This is for the hospital bills and the ride home.

816
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,350
I better get going.

817
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,720
You two make a cute couple!

818
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,790
Kang Donghui!

819
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,090
If you're so worried about Haewon,

820
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,090
then you should start dating again.

821
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,420
Like in the old days.

822
01:02:50,558 --> 01:03:13,500
Subtitles by KBS World

823
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,890
Then why don't you come back

824
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,320
as my uncle in your next life?

825
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,720
I'll do that! Yes, I will!

826
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,620
He might seem like a hooligan,

827
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,320
but he doesn't beat people up for no reason.

828
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:27,450
You're his mom. Why can't you see that?

829
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,190
Donghui, Dongtak, Dongok.

830
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:32,720
Who knows what mess they'll get into next?

831
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,920
There's a reason why I'm going bald.

832
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,420
If you weren't so below us,

833
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,380
I'd let you marry my son.

834
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,290
Can you come see me?

835
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,850
Can you come and hold me a while?
