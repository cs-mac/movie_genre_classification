2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,175
(drumroll)

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,512
(cheering and applause)

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:24,456
Man: Ladies and gentlemen,
Jerry Lewis!

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,857
- (playing intro)
- (cheering intensifies)

6
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,899
- (music stops)
- (cheering continues)

7
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,876
Jerry Lewis: Hum!

8
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,181
Ha!

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,883
Ha! Ha-ah!

10
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,916
Oh, I see.

11
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,226
Oh, I see.

12
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,062
Yeah. Oh.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,263
Every time I get up in the morning,
I open my eyes,

14
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,431
I'm a hit, you know.
What do I need to do after that?

15
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,306
I'm a smash.
I open my eyes... I got another day.

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:20,335
I look up and I say,
"Okay, thanks," move on.

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,211
Mah, mah, mah, mah!

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,346
(chuckles)

19
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,877
Oh, God, how dumb.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,247
When you get to be 85,

21
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,590
you think about all the stuff
you've learned.

22
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,687
And then you sit one day

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,096
with a film documentarian

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,296
and you talk about
all of your brilliant brains

25
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,770
that you had.

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,568
They weren't always brilliant.

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,337
I'm still working on
getting into that

28
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,072
better-than-it-was-yesterday
mode.

29
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,673
(cheering and applause)

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,915
What the hell?
Are you nuts?

31
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,617
Man: What a treat!

32
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,716
What a treat?

33
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,626
Come backstage.
I'll show you a real one.

34
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,028
(laughter)

35
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,965
Jerry Seinfeld: I think
if you don't get Jerry Lewis,

36
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,736
you don't really
understand comedy,

37
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,141
because he is
the essence of it.

38
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,544
(orchestra playing jazz)

39
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,310
He is essentially it.

40
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,148
He is the diamond
of comedy.

41
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,259
The stuff that looks like
it's just slapstick and just happening,

42
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,296
that's 'cause he's a genius
and he can make it look like that.

43
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,866
You can't reach
as many people

44
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,379
for such a long period of time

45
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,938
unless it's thought out.

46
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:07,817
All guys, you know,
who loved funny,

47
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,515
were touched by him.

48
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,955
(blows raspberry)

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,355
Oh!

50
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,758
There's only one Jerry Lewis.

51
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,785
- (snoring)
- Look at all of the laughter

52
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,196
that he has given to people.

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,361
I really love Jerry
and owe him so much.

54
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,840
He's just been a real,
you know, mainstay

55
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,139
in my life as a child growing up
and also in my career.

56
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,517
He is the last great giant

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,353
of the great days
of the business.

58
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,521
He bridges the old Hollywood
and now.

59
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,359
## Mamâe, mamâe, mamâe, eu quero ##

60
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,558
## Mamâe, eu quero mamar ##

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,295
## Mamâe, eu quero... ##

62
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,793
- (recording slows down)
- ## Mamar. ##

63
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,899
He was the most gifted,
intuitive person ever.

64
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,141
It's astonishing, you know.
He spoke this language

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,978
that even probably
wildlife would laugh at.

66
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,644
(whistles)

67
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,019
I don't ever remember
a time before Elvis.

68
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,422
I don't remember a time
before Jerry Lewis.

69
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,450
He was always
part of my consciousness

70
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,553
at the youngest age
that I can think of.

71
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,860
Everybody's like him
in the morning

72
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,490
when they get up
and look in the mirror

73
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,398
and start making faces.

74
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,336
Everyone's like him
when they want to try to be funny.

75
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,402
We're all like that.
It's just that he was the best,

76
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,932
you know.
(chuckles)

77
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,968
(drums playing)

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,344
If you don't like Jerry Lewis,
I have no interest in hanging with you.

79
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,354
We can't even have
a relationship.

80
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,991
Jerry Lewis was in this
magic position

81
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,026
of being
a monster box office star.

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,095
And he could do
what he wanted.

83
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,334
And he didn't play it safe.

84
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,400
He has been some extraordinary things,
amazing things.

85
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,809
(laughs loudly)

86
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,949
He makes movie after movie
after movie that...

87
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,115
people go crazy
for this thing he's doing.

88
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,786
It's almost like
before Jerry, after Jerry.

89
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,988
He's like the Beatles
of movie comedy.

90
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,190
(jazz continues playing)

91
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,804
(reporters clamoring)

92
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,440
- Woman: How do you do?
- Lewis: How do you do?

93
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,748
- Are you French?
- Oui.

94
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,481
Good.
Then you belong here.

95
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,546
Can you say in French,
"Bonjour, les petits gens"?

96
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,582
Oh, bonjour, bonjour.
Bonjour. Fini.

97
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,027
<i>Woody Harrelson: A lot of people,
by the time they hit their 70s,</i>

98
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,690
you know,
they're pretty much,

99
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,222
"Well, I've done
what I needed to do."

100
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,758
He just keeps charging.

101
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,566
I love that about him.

102
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,505
Lewis: I have a message
for your editor.

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,703
I just got off the plane
and I open up the newspaper

104
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,473
and there's this picture
of Brad Pitt.

105
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,540
I don't want any of those
small little pictures.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,984
And then I want to go see
Brad Pitt at the hotel

107
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,851
and tell him
he's finished.

108
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:08,020
It's amazing how much energy
and creativity he still has.

109
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,325
The fact that he's still doing it
is pretty cool.

110
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,798
Woman: Are you going
on the red carpet tonight?

111
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,597
Lewis: Yeah.
I'm going to put on a tuxedo.

112
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,501
- It'd better be a good film.
- (laughter)

113
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,267
I hope it's dirty.

114
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,830
(laughter)

115
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,035
Jerry Lewis: France is always
given the credit

116
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,907
for discovering Jerry Lewis.

117
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,675
But in terms of fan following,

118
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,842
Italy is first, Germany is second,

119
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,342
the Netherlands is third,
Japan is fourth,

120
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,051
Australia is fifth
and France is sixth.

121
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,150
This week fan mail
is going to be

122
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,924
the same amount
that we got 15-18 years ago.

123
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,397
Announcer: Monsieur Jerry Lewis
est avec nous ce soir.

124
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,595
Lewis: We're excited
about our film.

125
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,126
And we came to Cannes
because we knew

126
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,867
there were films like
"Suck My Blood"...

127
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,341
- (laughter)
..."I Was a Teenage Lesbian,"

128
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,402
"After the Circumcision,
Lick lt."

129
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,880
Crowd:
Please. Please. Jerry.

130
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,907
Merci beaucoup.

131
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,852
(cheering and applause)

132
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,949
Although my films
to this day

133
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,985
make a lot of money
all over the world,

134
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,327
I've never received

135
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,857
critical and loving
affection

136
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,336
like I do from the French.

137
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,635
(narrating)
When I played Paris, I was onstage

138
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,574
and I knew that there were
13,000 to 15,000 people

139
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,410
lined up to try to get tickets
for the day after.

140
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,905
It went on like that
for 30 days.

141
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,578
At the end of one show

142
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,316
they brought me
affectionate gifts:

143
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,087
Flowers, wine, cheese, ham,

144
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,617
cookies, candy.

145
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,722
The stage was engulfed.

146
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,732
I would love to do that again.

147
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,499
I could do it again.

148
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,007
All I have to do is say,
"I'm going to do it again," that's all.

149
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,140
The story of an older man

150
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,375
is not ordinarily
why you would make a film.

151
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,442
But since everyone I know
grew up with me...

152
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,387
(woman translating)

153
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,152
...I want them
to get old with me.

154
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,557
And you know
what's so wonderful?

155
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,358
To see the signs
and the billboards and the ads...

156
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,888
"Jerry Lewis Live!"

157
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,027
Beats the hell out of the alternative,
I'll tell you that.

158
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,698
We do two things
all over the world.

159
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,768
We throw away the garbage

160
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,838
and we throw away
the old people.

161
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,941
(woman translating)

162
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,648
And I think the old people
have a life,

163
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,249
- they have...
- (woman translating)

164
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,417
(laughter)

165
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,690
They have no interpreters.

166
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,494
I'm not so sure
Jerry Lewis ever has quit.

167
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,365
He's just too important.

168
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,342
Lewis: I think
that I recognized

169
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,280
that I'm strictly
a professional entertainer

170
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,682
and my concern
is getting them entertained.

171
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,485
Chris Lewis: It comes from a long,
long way back in his life.

172
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,717
(Jerry Lewis laughs)

173
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,921
Making people laugh
is what made him feel accepted.

174
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,327
You know, from not having his parents
because they were traveling

175
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,197
in vaudeville all the time
and being raised by his grandmother,

176
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,724
the acceptance that he got
from people around him

177
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,361
was by making them laugh.

178
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,100
Jerry Lewis: I did a show
when I did Sahara

179
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,574
and my dad comes backstage.

180
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,703
And it was one of those shows
that was so electric.

181
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,237
I did about two hours
and 20 minutes.

182
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,411
And I said,
"Dad, what about tonight?"

183
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,286
He said, "Don't worry,
you can make it better tomorrow."

184
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,689
I said, "What the hell
are you talking about?

185
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,057
It's the best show
I ever did in my life."

186
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,460
He said,
"With one exception:

187
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,193
You turned your back
on your audience

188
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,760
to get a laugh from your band.
That's not professional."

189
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,737
There was no way to go with it.
I had to just hear him.

190
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm a little heavier now.
Do you notice?

191
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,611
That's right. You're telling me.
(laughs)

192
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,579
Okay. (mock laugh)

193
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:26,381
## When there are grey skies... ##

194
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,081
What?
Don't you mind in the least.

195
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:33,080
My dad played in burlesque
getting 50 bucks a week

196
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,593
as the singer, straight man

197
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,392
and MC at burlesque shows.

198
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,729
My mom was his conductor.

199
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,167
She was an incredible musician.

200
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,832
He and she would play
on a Saturday night,

201
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,864
four hotels in the borscht circuit.

202
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,639
(Danny singing in Yiddish)

203
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,704
So the owner said to my dad,

204
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,878
"If you let the kid go on,
we'll give you 10 more."

205
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,183
So the following Saturday

206
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,689
my mom had a tux
made for me.

207
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,919
How do you not clap

208
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,427
for a five-year-old in a tux?

209
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,020
(chuckles)

210
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,530
As a kid, I can't see it working...

211
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,556
a little five-year-old going,
"Hey, lady!"

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,068
They'd be like, "Hey.
What's wrong with that child?"

213
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,095
He had to kind of grow into that.

214
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,336
Jerry Lewis: And when my dad
taught me the song,

215
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,366
he knew what he was doing.

216
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,778
Now I sang a Depression song.

217
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,180
## Once in khaki boots ##

218
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,412
## Gee, we looked swell ##

219
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,444
## Full of that Yankee deedlee dum ##

220
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,220
## Half a million boots ##

221
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,318
## Slogging through hell ##

222
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,524
## And I was the kid
with the drum ##

223
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,623
## Hey, don't you remember ##

224
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,964
## I'm your pal ##

225
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,334
## Buddy, can you spare ##

226
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,839
## A dime? ##

227
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,139
And people went ballistic.

228
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,168
And I take the bow.

229
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,203
My foot slips,
breaks the bulb,

230
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,876
explodes and makes
this huge noise.

231
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,750
And I jump three inches
off the stage

232
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,618
into my father's arms.

233
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,182
And I heard...
this laugh was incredible.

234
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,786
It was the first audience
I ever heard laughing

235
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,161
at something I did.

236
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,565
And it was good.

237
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,296
I thought to myself,

238
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,362
"God, is that my life?
I'm gonna be a bulb-breaker?"

239
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,500
(laughs)
A bulb-breaker.

240
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,842
## God bless me... ##

241
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,972
(laughter)

242
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,006
Oh, I'm such a doll.

243
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,810
(snickers)
## When I... ##

244
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,981
I was already telling my dad,

245
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,253
"I know what I want to do
in this life,

246
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,283
and that's just perform
like you."

247
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:54,266
## Promise you won't stray... ##

248
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,791
Jerry Lewis:
Everything that was on that stage

249
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,236
was for the betterment
of his performance.

250
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,739
You're a fancy singer, boy.

251
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,811
Jerry Lewis: I never saw
such a selfless man.

252
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,837
He went out there
to give them pleasure.

253
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,181
## Sonny boy. ##

254
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:17,315
I was like the kid that knows
he's gonna play baseball

255
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,985
and has to spend four weeks
at Babe Ruth's house.

256
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,053
He was part of the last
wonderful vaudeville people

257
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,089
that taught all of us
in motion pictures what to do.

258
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,604
In order for comedy to work

259
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,767
there must be a pace,

260
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,800
a tempo.

261
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,211
Without a tempo,
you have no joke.

262
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,580
Without a tempo,

263
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,983
you have no visual

264
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,750
and you lose
the spirit of comedy.

265
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,519
- (fast music playing)
- (typewriter keys clicking)

266
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,011
Seinfeld: The typewriter...
just the way halfway through

267
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,953
he doesn't keep repeating it.
He changes it like a musical variation,

268
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,424
but his instinct telling him,
"Time to change it," you know,

269
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,926
and makes the second half of the bit
just as funny.

270
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
(music playing)

271
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,255
(typewriter keys
resume clicking)

272
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,178
(music finishes)

273
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,377
(cheering and applause)

274
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,615
Carol Burnett:
He's a very gifted genius.

275
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,180
(laughs)

276
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,318
The typewriter... whew.

277
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,989
I could have that on a loop
and just watch it all the time.

278
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,827
It's just brilliant.

279
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,493
Someone get the stool
for me, eh?

280
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,435
The stool up...
the individual...

281
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,872
(laughter and applause)

282
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,773
Thank you.

283
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,783
I went on the road at 16.

284
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,813
I went to Buffalo,

285
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,691
played the Buffalo Palace
Burlesque Theater

286
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,890
that my dad had played
20 years before.

287
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,127
They put me on
in front of the front curtain

288
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,534
after a sketch
messed up the stage.

289
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,698
They had to get the stage clear
for the stripper.

290
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,503
Of course I didn't need music.

291
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,271
I did a dumb act.

292
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,540
- (tenor singing)
- Put the recording on

293
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,208
and I mouthed my lips
and I made my salary.

294
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,445
I did "The Barber of Seville"

295
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,476
with a grey fright wig.

296
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,957
I did Frank Sinatra,
"All Or Nothing At All"...

297
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,050
yeah, mime, mimic.

298
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,459
They didn't hear me
say a word.

299
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,431
You learned a lot
doing five shows a day every day.

300
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,196
Vaudeville was a great
stepping-stone.

301
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,395
(doorbell rings)

302
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,569
Billy Crystal: He's a crossover
from vaudeville and burlesque.

303
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,873
It's like when silent films ended,
there was this long reach

304
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,608
till talkie comics really hit.

305
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,843
And he feels like
he's straddling that.

306
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,145
Close them together.

307
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,119
Close? Oh, all right.

308
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,212
Crystal: There's classic clowning
in him

309
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,847
and there's this insanity.

310
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,127
(sighs)

311
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,154
They scooted...

312
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,827
Jerry Lewis: If you look at a scene
I did in "The Patsy,"

313
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,929
I rehearsed catching the vases
for three weeks.

314
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,964
And I think we went through
300 or 400 of them.

315
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,068
I just kept getting prop department
to make some more.

316
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,876
I worked my heart out
to get it to work right.

317
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,118
People really like
to get a shot at

318
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
finding out
what you think about things.

319
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,394
And it's amazing
what comes up

320
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,731
during the course
of a Q&A session.

321
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,258
So let's try it.

322
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,272
<i>In 1972 I was
in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

323
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,901
and I met
the king of rock 'n' roll

324
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,934
Elvis Presley.

325
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,310
Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,508
Now tonight I meet
the king of comedy

327
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,312
- Jerry Lewis.
- (cheering and applause)

328
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,616
Jerry Lewis:
Thank you. Thank you.

329
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,986
Elvis is not dead.

330
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,424
And neither am I.

331
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,950
Ha-ha!

332
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,395
Wow, you know,
people ask him things

333
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,762
because he's been around
for 500 years.

334
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,529
So it's like, you know,
"Moses, when you...

335
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,969
<i>you know, that 27th year
in the desert</i>

336
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,529
when you built the thing..."

337
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,700
"Oh, yeah, the matzo factory.
Well..."

338
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,678
You know, it's like... he's like...
he's this biblical character.

339
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,236
Hi.

340
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,875
I would shake hands with you,
but I see you're busy.

341
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,408
- You got it, kid.
- (laughter)

342
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,780
It was wonderful,
just one right after another.

343
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,521
I had a dream about you, about...

344
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,292
- (microphone thuds)
- (laughter)

345
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,466
Jerry is sexy, very charming.

346
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,064
I find him very nice-looking when
he's not doing, "Hey, lady," you know.

347
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,132
But I've always thought
Jerry was sexy.

348
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,873
So I understand why people would...
do they throw underwear at him?

349
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,677
I wanted to ask you
if you think I have a problem,

350
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,707
because I'm
only attracted to men

351
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,517
with thick, black, dark hair
because of you.

352
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,853
(laughter)

353
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,695
What about 6'2", 320-pound,

354
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,168
I mean, huge men
with blond hair?

355
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,670
I'm only attracted to men

356
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,402
with thick, dark,
black hair like you.

357
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,172
Have you been
to South Africa?

358
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,237
(laughter)

359
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,681
It's side-splittingly,
crazy funny.

360
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,207
And it's just him.

361
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,516
It's just him being Jerry.
What's better than that?

362
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,421
Jerry Lewis: They know that it's
coming off the top of my head.

363
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,891
Now I do 30 minutes of that.

364
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,826
It's totally spontaneous.

365
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,852
It's unscripted. It's unrehearsed.

366
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,855
It really brings out, I think,
the genius of his comedy,

367
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,663
because not everybody
can do that.

368
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,194
I have a gentleman over there.
Yes, sir.

369
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,230
Jerry, I worship you.

370
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,176
I think you're the greatest.
But I needed to say...

371
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,941
I wanted to ask you
if you think I have a problem.

372
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,780
I am only attracted to men
with thick, dark, black hair...

373
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,250
(laughter)

374
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,186
...because of you, Jerry.

375
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,020
(cheering and applause)

376
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,392
Bravo.

377
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,098
(man laughs)
Thank you.

378
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,199
I prayed my whole life
for stardom

379
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,710
and two things
that comes with it.

380
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:57,647
You walk in every kitchen
of every hotel in America...

381
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,175
that's stardom... if you want
to get to your dressing room.

382
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,380
And the other one is

383
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,652
YouTube...
half of my act is on it.

384
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,888
- Man: Which half?
- The one I did with my partner.

385
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,986
So here he is,
my good partner...

386
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,725
## Dean Martin. ##

387
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,359
(fanfare)

388
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:20,462
Jerry Lewis:
That was July of '46.

389
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,441
You don't often lay back
and think back that far.

390
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,001
I do on occasion,

391
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:31,482
but it's a long, long time.

392
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,417
(breathes deeply)

393
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,182
Lewis and Martin:
## What would I do without you? ##

394
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,882
## What would I do, boy? ##

395
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,721
## What would I do without you?
What would I do? ##

396
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,249
Martin: ## I need a partner,
you're the one ##

397
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,989
Lewis: ## I'll be right there
when the show goes on ##

398
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,428
- ## I'm for you ##
- ## I'm for you ##

399
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,056
Together:
## From California to Kalamazoo ##

400
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,727
## What would I do without you
when you're gone? ##

401
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,293
## When you're gone,
when you're gone ##

402
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,898
## Oh, what would I do without you?
What would I do? ##

403
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,005
Jerry Lewis: Standing up on that stage,
I knew it instantly

404
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,709
we were on our way
to the galaxies.

405
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,719
Dean didn't really recognize
what I was feeling

406
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,414
till the second night.

407
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,081
Then he came to me
and he said,

408
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,148
"I think I know
what you're talking about."

409
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,216
I said, "How?"
He said, "Well,

410
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,854
I feel like I'm walking
more upright."

411
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,297
I said, "You got it.
You got it."

412
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,461
## We' Marie... ##

413
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,098
(plays piano chords)

414
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,131
(laughter)

415
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,702
Carl Reiner: My first recollection
of Jerry is very, very clear.

416
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,476
<i>It was 1947, Boston.</i>

417
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,349
I hate to use the word
"blown away," but I was.

418
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,580
And I never use that word
until today.

419
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,612
"Blown away" is a terrible phrase.

420
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,988
I was so impressed.

421
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,653
First of all, it was a totally
ad lib thing.

422
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,595
They had no act.
And that's what made it brilliant.

423
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,293
- (continues playing chords)
- (audience laughter)

424
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,018
It was this guy interrupting
his friend from singing...

425
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,111
that's the whole thing.
His friend started to sing

426
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,917
and he just kept
interrupting him.

427
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,753
Why are you waiting?

428
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,323
I forgot what song
we were singing.

429
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,353
(laughing)

430
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,025
Come here!

431
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,195
It was mayhem,
but hysterical mayhem.

432
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,229
People were on the floor.

433
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,043
That went all right, crazy?

434
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,780
I've never seen anything
as funny in my life

435
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,311
as that particular act,
never forgot it.

436
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,189
And of course
the rest is history.

437
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,971
Everybody felt the same way
about Jerry and Dean.

438
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,405
It was a revelatory act.

439
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,432
Everybody who saw it
became fans.

440
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,445
There was no doubt they were
gonna make it. There was no doubt.

441
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,004
## We' Marie ##

442
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:22,008
## We love you all. ##

443
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,181
Jerry Lewis: We had a deep respect
for one another's ability.

444
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,886
I knew that Dean had
the goddamnedest sense

445
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,226
of instinct
that I had ever seen in anyone.

446
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,324
(British accent) Oh, Judy, Judy, Judy,
you can't take a baby

447
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,029
out of a man's life
and expect him to go home...

448
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,934
(applause)

449
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,769
Well, it's not right
and it's not fair. Right now...

450
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,105
(normal voice)
I mean, right now, Jerry's impression

451
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,134
of the ex-prime minister
of England.

452
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,874
Ladies and gentlemen,
Winston Churchill.

453
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,975
(Great Britain's anthem playing)

454
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,552
(high nasal voice)
Thanks very much.

455
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,718
Jerry Lewis: My partner said
to Winston Churchill,

456
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,160
"Do you have to smoke
that much?"

457
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,664
I thought I'd have
a heart attack.

458
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,792
It was his humor.

459
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,029
What did he say?

460
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,061
And Churchill looked at him
and he said,

461
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,096
"I really enjoy it."

462
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,333
And I ran out of there.

463
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,047
He had this incredible sense of,

464
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,209
"Now's the time to do it."

465
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,412
You and me, you and me.
Ventriloquists, you and me.

466
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,616
Oh, no, no. We sing and we dance.
We're a team.

467
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,454
He wants a ventriloquist.
That's a guy, and he uses...

468
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,357
oh, no!

469
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,760
Jerry Lewis: My instinct
topping his...

470
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,095
it was an incredible
combination.

471
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,123
What's all this noise?

472
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,568
(audience laughter)

473
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,900
Jerry Lewis: I needing
a father figure

474
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,342
because I was out
on the road,

475
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,403
and him needing
a friend figure.

476
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,438
He needed that
more than anything.

477
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,418
It was a love affair.
It was the big brother.

478
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,445
And Dean and Jerry's dad
kind of look similar.

479
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,424
Martin: Wait, I don't like the way
you two guys are working together.

480
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,586
It's too good. And "Sonny Boy"...
I used to do it with you.

481
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,619
- No, we'll do it together again.
- Can you hold it down, Danny?

482
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,688
You see what you're starting, Dad?
You're starting a whole argument.

483
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,666
Dean, listen, don't worry
about nothing.

484
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,691
So I think there was also

485
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,967
a paternal transference
there too.

486
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,237
H-hello.
I-I'm Jerry Lewis, the new busboy.

487
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,266
I'm Dean Martin,
the old waiter.

488
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,302
Oh. It's a small world, ain't it?

489
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,280
It's a little too small.
Let's get out of here.

490
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,646
All right.

491
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,878
Jerry Lewis: I think
people were frightened

492
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,250
over homosexual
probabilities.

493
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,057
They didn't want to recognize that this
was two people that loved one another,

494
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,556
like a man and a woman,
a wife and a daughter, a son or husband.

495
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,060
- Why don't you take your clothes off?
- Here, I don't even know you.

496
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,406
Richard Belzer: They came along
at a time right after World War II.

497
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,105
No one was ever
that anarchic...

498
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,477
- What's the matter?
- Flood.

499
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,075
...and that physically attractive,
that young, that dangerous.

500
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,278
- Get off the stage!
- Look, I don't mind in a room

501
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,844
with the whips and the chains,
but not in front of the audience.

502
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,090
Get off the stage.

503
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,081
It was the '50s. It's a very...

504
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,585
you know, after the war,
it's a very conservative time.

505
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,565
But what came about
was this kind of anarchy.

506
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,089
You know, you had
rock 'n' roll.

507
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,034
You're laughing.
You forgot to take your watch off.

508
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,630
(laughter)

509
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,472
So Martin and Lewis are, I believe,
part of that same movement,

510
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,376
because they created
a real sense of anarchy.

511
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,676
- You're all mine! (laughing)
- You're overactive, Jerry.

512
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,650
The secret was, of course,
that the audience was in on it.

513
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,675
They were being naughty too.

514
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,952
They redefined the nature
of show business,

515
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,390
which is pretty amazing
when you...

516
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,360
you know, it's pretty
astounding stuff.

517
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,354
Jerry Lewis: Very unbelievable...
the things that happened to us.

518
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,993
In a matter of six months

519
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,095
we went from making $450 a week...

520
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,163
we were getting $20,000 a week.

521
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,573
People in our business...
their heads were turning all the time,

522
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,010
"What? How much? What?
What did they do?

523
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,983
I don't know, but they're hotter
than we will ever be.

524
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,986
And they're getting all of the money
there is in the world."

525
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,956
And we're reading in every paper
and seeing on ever television program

526
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,221
and hearing people talking
about what we were doing

527
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,818
and carrying on.

528
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,057
We were very excited
and very proud.

529
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,329
I don't think we knew exactly what
was happening to us, but it was fun.

530
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,997
(playing intro)

531
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,836
## Just remember... ##

532
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,343
Crystal: When Jerry was
onstage with Dean,

533
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,345
something really special
happened.

534
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,370
They were amazing together.

535
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,814
And it just looked like fun.

536
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,579
Straight men are very rare.
The great ones...

537
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,887
you can think of Carl Reiner
with Mel, and Dean.

538
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,519
He was different.
He was charming.

539
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,520
He was funny. He could act.
He could seriously act.

540
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,556
He was unselfish.

541
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,295
He sang great.

542
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,235
And they made each other great.

543
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,297
Stand up. Take a bow.
Don't be shy.

544
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,604
Hey! Hey, lady! Lady!

545
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,009
(grunts, screams)

546
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,681
Richard Lewis: It's like you were born
and all of a sudden

547
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,276
you're watching
a Martin and Lewis film.

548
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,618
And it's like I figured
he was just part of the earth,

549
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,784
you know, one of the essential things
to know about.

550
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,124
Crystal: They were the biggest stars
in the world

551
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,096
as a comedy team.
When does that happen?

552
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,361
That a team like this
could sell out

553
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,836
five, six shows a day
was unheard of.

554
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,701
We love you all
and we hope we can see you

555
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,399
at the Paramount July 4th
for two weeks.

556
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,136
- Good night. God bless you all.
- Good night. Goodbye.

557
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,202
Jerry Lewis: We did two weeks,
eight shows a day,

558
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,544
56 shows a week.

559
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,073
We made $600,000,

560
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,553
'cause we got 90% of the tickets
and the theater got 10%.

561
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,216
In order for me to get them
out of the audience

562
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,054
so that we could fill up
the theater again,

563
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,459
I would say, "If you come backstage,
we're gonna have pictures for you."

564
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,224
And as we left the stage,

565
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,698
you saw 4000 people
exit the theater.

566
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,066
And they did that
three or four times in a day,

567
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,766
so you wind up with, like,
16,000 or 20,000 people out there.

568
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,072
- (crowd screaming)
- And it was mass chaos

569
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,476
all through Times Square

570
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,605
right down to 9th Avenue.

571
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,084
The mayor of the city came up
to ask us to do something.

572
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,053
So I said to him,
"Well, we could just close tonight.

573
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,886
We could go away."
He said, "No, no, no, no, no.

574
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,324
No, it's good for the city."

575
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,488
Eddie Murphy: When they blew up,
it was very much like the Beatles

576
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,963
or like Sinatra and Elvis.

577
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,491
Thousands of people in the street...
looks like it's New Year's Eve,

578
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,935
you know, and it's just that
they're playing a gig in town.

579
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,962
They're the first big rock star.

580
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,805
There was no rock star
back then when they came out,

581
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,311
but they had
rock star popularity.

582
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,336
Burnett:
I was just starting high school

583
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,144
when Jerry and Dean
came along.

584
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,480
It was explosive.

585
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,419
And I'd be the first in line

586
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,480
to see one of their movies
when it opened.

587
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,015
Richard Lewis: You can't get
bigger than this

588
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,550
and for all the right reasons.

589
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,120
He ripped people's brains out.
He ripped them to shreds.

590
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,155
You want to come up
for coffee?

591
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,497
(crowd screaming)

592
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,969
We ain't got any!

593
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,632
Jerry Lewis: The pandemonium
that it caused

594
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,666
was exactly what happened
with the Beatles later on.

595
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,701
It was incredible.

596
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:32,182
Every once in a while I look on
the stage to see where he would be.

597
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,207
He's not there anymore.

598
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,880
So I think about
the great times we had.

599
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,014
He would walk
in front of an audience

600
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,651
and, before he sang a note,
he would say to them,

601
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,652
"I want all of you people here tonight
that do not drink,

602
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,427
I want you to know that tomorrow
when you get up,

603
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,230
that's as good as you're
gonna feel all day."

604
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,066
(laughter)

605
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,696
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

606
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,229
- Are you looking at me?
- Yes.

607
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,242
- I'm over here.
- Oh, hello there, Jerry.

608
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,473
You wouldn't mind breathing out
that way once or twice, would you?

609
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,002
(blows air)

610
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,811
Jerry Lewis: I used to tease him
over the years..."Upright."

611
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,684
If I saw him getting down
or depressed..."Upright."

612
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,248
"Oh, yeah, okay."
It worked.

613
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,158
Chevy Chase: But I always wondered
what happened after that breakup.

614
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:20,221
Obviously Dean went on
'cause he had that great hair

615
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:24,394
and was very, very funny
and a, you know, great talent.

616
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,404
July 25th... I think a lot.

617
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,168
That was the night
we teamed up...

618
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,735
July 25th, 1946.

619
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,907
And we split July 25th, 1956...

620
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,974
10 years to the day.

621
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,880
There's no way to explain
what I felt.

622
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,390
And I said goodbye,
and he said goodbye.

623
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:52,124
Then the work goes on
and on and on.

624
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,563
Alec Baldwin: I guess
it was just destiny

625
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,430
that it wasn't gonna last
very long

626
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,662
and that Lewis had to go off
and do his own thing.

627
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,864
Not that he didn't need Martin,

628
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,567
but there was just a whole other thing
he needed to do.

629
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,702
Deana Martin: They had their thing
together. They had their time.

630
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,713
And I'm kind of glad they didn't try
to do something again,

631
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,045
because it was just perfect
the way it was.

632
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,452
And then we can just admire them
for who they became.

633
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,081
Seinfeld: Jerry and Dean
deciding to end

634
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,114
when they were still legends,

635
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,821
as opposed to
when it was starting to fray...

636
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,853
I wanted that too
for my Tv series.

637
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,925
I wanted to make sure
that I just went out before...

638
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,766
a moment before
and not the moment after.

639
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,670
Do you still think
about Dean at night?

640
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,402
There isn't a day in my life

641
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,434
that I don't think
of my partner,

642
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,878
- not a day.
- (applause)

643
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,815
Never.

644
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,115
I don't have any qualms

645
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,383
about proclaiming

646
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,754
the love I had
for my partner.

647
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,817
Every time I walk on a stage,

648
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,852
I know it's because of him

649
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,797
and what he did
to get me there.

650
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,802
It's a constant appreciation

651
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,736
and a gratitude

652
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,672
to a man that I can't
communicate with,

653
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,335
but I just hope
he is peeking and listening

654
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,971
and knowing how much I care
and how much I miss him.

655
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,413
(Jerry Lewis narrating)
When you understand what it was

656
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,440
that people saw and felt...

657
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,715
they saw a love affair
between two men

658
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,051
and they were coming out
to make money doing it.

659
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,489
And they were having
a wonderful time.

660
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,017
And audiences couldn't believe
the fun they were having.

661
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,326
That was the mystery of it.

662
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,094
Martin: Let's do an old thing
we used to do in the old act.

663
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,261
All right, that's fine with me.
You'll never have an ar...

664
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,829
you never, with me,
an argument, at no time.

665
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,272
- Never?
- Never.

666
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,831
- Promise?
- Word.

667
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,140
- Let's have lunch someday.
- Give me a ring. I'm in the book.

668
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,167
- All right.
- All right.

669
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,578
We sure created something.

670
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,916
And we made it work

671
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,513
and had a ball for 10 years,

672
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,751
never to be duplicated

673
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,124
by any couple of anything, ever.

674
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:06,330
(plays a chord)
Try this.

675
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,025
(plays a chord)
Try this.

676
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,499
## Ah. ##

677
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,400
(off-key) ## Ah. ##

678
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,337
- ## Oh. ##
- ## Oh. ##

679
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:19,776
- ## E-e-e. ##
- ## E-e-e. ##

680
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,675
- ## Ha-ha. ##
- ## Ha-ha. ##

681
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,408
- Argh!
- Argh!

682
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,746
## E-e-e-e ##

683
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,877
## Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ##

684
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,320
## E-e-e-e... ##

685
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,483
I don't think he'd fare very well
with Simon Cowell.

686
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,720
## I lost my heart ##

687
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,353
## In a drive-in... ##

688
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,954
- (car horn honks)
- ## Movie. ##

689
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,397
I think Paula would probably
have rooted for him.

690
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,960
And Randy may have thought
that he was slightly pitchy.

691
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,971
## Yeah, yeah ##

692
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,997
## Right in the movie ##

693
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,976
## In my car. ##

694
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,446
- (car horn honks)
- (cheering and applause)

695
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,677
Oh, he sings great.
Jerry sings great.

696
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,979
(orchestra playing jazz)

697
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,476
Talent... he's just got it
in his pores, all kinds of talent.

698
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,322
Then I could do a number.
My hit record...

699
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,389
would anyone like
to see that?

700
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,300
<i>Jerry Lewis: I did a record.
All it did was 7 million copies</i>

701
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,100
at the last accounting.
It could be much more now.

702
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,232
It's a good feeling too.

703
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,204
(orchestra stops)

704
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,376
You gotta go until I sing.

705
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,079
Stay with it.
Don't be afraid.

706
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,645
- Oh, just stay with the theme?
- Stay there.

707
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,658
I got you. Okay.
One more time, please.

708
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,853
Dean you're not,
but you will do.

709
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,158
(laughter)

710
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,997
- (orchestra playing)
- From a film that I'm very proud of,

711
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,526
circa 1963,

712
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,597
we do the hit song from
"The Nutty Professor."

713
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,871
- (cheering and applause)
- Yeah, what?

714
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,207
## That old black magic ##

715
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,805
## Has me in its spell ##

716
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:08,012
## That old black magic
that you weave so well ##

717
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,389
## Those icy fingers
up and down my spine ##

718
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,416
## The same old witchcraft ##

719
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,451
## When your eyes meet mine ##

720
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,830
## The same old tingle
that I feel inside ##

721
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,166
## And then the elevators ##

722
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,671
## Start this ride ##

723
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,231
## Down and down I go ##

724
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,402
## Round and round I go ##

725
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,845
## In a leaf caught in the tide ##

726
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,042
## I should stay away... ##

727
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,779
## But what can I do? ##

728
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,344
## I hear your name ##

729
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,619
## And I'm aflame ##

730
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,095
## Aflame with such
a burning desire ##

731
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,895
## That only your kiss ##

732
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,197
## Can put out the fire... ##

733
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,796
He gives everything he's got, like
it's the last time he's ever gonna sing.

734
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,535
You know, that's the kind
of performer he is.

735
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:09,410
(recording playing)
## Be my life ##

736
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,110
## For no one else can end ##

737
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,812
## This yearning... ##

738
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,016
Crystal: A lot of comics were doing
record lip-syncing,

739
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,047
but his was different.

740
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,186
He wasn't just lip-syncing "Mule Train"
or one of those things.

741
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,493
He was interpreting music.

742
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:31,900
## There'll be no one but you ##

743
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,201
## For me ##

744
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:42,008
## Eternally... ##

745
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,379
It was as special a kind of skill
in its own way

746
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,976
as Chaplin bouncing the ball
in "The Great Dictator."

747
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,283
It's playing with something
and giving it a different life.

748
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:56,851
## Be my life. ##

749
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,330
I did a record act all my career.
(chuckles)

750
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,424
## Here's what you'll be saying ##

751
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,895
## When you are far from home... ##

752
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,169
Chris Lewis: My dad's got
Al Jolson's original charts

753
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,177
that he gave him, on his shelf
in his office in vegas.

754
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,406
It's Jolson's music
and he gave it to my dad

755
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,472
'cause he knew
my dad idolized him.

756
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:22,612
## The sun shines east,
the sun shines west ##

757
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:26,180
## I just learned
where the sun shines best... ##

758
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,158
(both humming a tune)

759
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,592
Right there, that's a...

760
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,327
That's it. You got it.

761
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,027
And then the answers will be
in that new, slower... uh!

762
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,797
Yeah, yeah, but then
it's in that... uh!

763
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,566
- It's in the new tempo.
- Uh! Uh!

764
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,472
- (orchestra playing)
- ## Weep no more ##

765
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,477
## My lady ##

766
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:52,210
## Sing that song for me ##

767
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,717
## So don't be low, uh-huh ##

768
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,653
## Why does it go ##

769
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:02,387
## You have me on your knees ##

770
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,862
## A million baby kisses ##

771
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,330
## I'll deliver ##

772
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,925
## If you will only sing that ##

773
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,493
## "Swanee River" ##

774
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,528
## Rock-a-bye ##

775
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,837
## Your rock-a-bye baby ##

776
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,810
## With a Dixie ##

777
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:30,083
## Melody. ##

778
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,645
(cheering and applause)

779
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,951
I have to go to the toilet.

780
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,792
So the rabbi and the priest

781
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,266
are seated together
on the plane.

782
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,963
And the flight attendant
is checking to see

783
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,370
if people would like a drink
after take-off.

784
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,874
She approached
the rabbi first.

785
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,673
"Rabbi, may I get you a drink
after take-off?"

786
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,011
He said, "I'd like a tall
scotch and soda with a twist."

787
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,414
She said, "Fine."
Then she approached the priest,

788
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,352
"Father, may I give you a drink
after take-off?"

789
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,877
He said, "Young lady,

790
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,755
before I would allow alcohol
to pass through these lips,

791
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,157
I would rather
commit adultery."

792
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,254
The rabbi said, "Hold my order.
I didn't know we had a choice."

793
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,595
(laughter)

794
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,899
Let me have that bag.

795
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,734
We'll give them
a little thrill.

796
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,332
(reporters cheering)

797
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:30,136
I walked in the airport
with that.

798
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,513
(narrating) I take my Academy Award
wherever I go.

799
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,816
And it's home now
on this small pedestal.

800
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,448
And the Academy Award
sits on it.

801
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,425
And I watch it all night.
People are watching television...

802
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,121
I'm watching my Academy Award.
(chuckles)

803
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,323
Why not?

804
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:51,767
See, I have an infinite love
of my industry.

805
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,071
Film is part of my blood.

806
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,505
(narrating) Dean's and my first film...

807
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,100
I had to just ask questions.

808
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,634
I didn't stop.

809
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,977
They couldn't find me
on the lot.

810
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,011
I was either in miniatures,
camera department,

811
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:13,285
wardrobe, editing,
the scoring stage.

812
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,656
I was like horseshit.
I was everywhere.

813
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,593
Oh, you're scared also?

814
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,721
(narrating)
And I was getting an education.

815
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,095
There was nothing
about our industry

816
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,761
that I didn't make up my mind
I was gonna learn.

817
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,101
And I didn't know
at the time

818
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,129
why I needed to learn it,

819
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,507
never realizing that I was gonna
turn it into pay dirt.

820
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,837
They said that... what?

821
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,544
I turned down Metro, 20th,
Universal, Sam Goldwyn,

822
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,576
and went with Paramount.

823
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,021
Well, I don't care really
about the hours or money.

824
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,751
- Good. You're hired.
- Oh.

825
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,021
When you're that guy

826
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,722
and you have that kind of career,
everybody wants to work with you.

827
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,958
- There'll be lots of extras...
- Yeah.

828
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,489
They're sending you
all the scripts

829
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,558
and you've got all the directors
want to work with you

830
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,729
and all the studios
want to throw money at you.

831
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,739
All the beautiful dames
you'll be with...

832
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:03,797
Oh, mwah.

833
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,934
- Sharp cars...
- (mimics engine)

834
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,070
Well, Lewis is that perfect intersection
of some great movie career

835
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,879
where you've got the goods
and audiences love what you do

836
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,443
and, you know,
you just strike gold.

837
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,648
- We pay all expenses.
- Oh!

838
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,487
Jerry Lewis: Every time
I created a film,

839
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,983
I generated revenue that they
couldn't really believe was there.

840
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,587
They had hoped for it,

841
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,962
and it was there every time.

842
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,990
I stayed with Paramount

843
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,902
for $800 million

844
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,996
in ticket rentals.

845
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,907
That's when the movies were
25 cents apiece.

846
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,070
Crystal: People who are not
historians don't realize

847
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,774
how powerful he was
at such a young age.

848
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,808
Well, he was directing and starring
and writing his own movies.

849
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,083
And he was the biggest star
in the world for years.

850
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,784
Richard Lewis:
He brought families together.

851
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,589
The four-year-old would laugh.
The 40-year-old would laugh.

852
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,188
The grandfather would laugh.
It's hard to do that.

853
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,198
It's hard to do that.
He did that.

854
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,826
Jerry Lewis: Adolph Zukor
used to call from New York

855
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,234
to the West Coast office
of Paramount

856
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,502
and say, "I'm just calling to tell you
to keep him warm.

857
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,009
Keep him warm."

858
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,034
Someone asked
Barney Balaban

859
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,673
how he gets along with
Jerry Lewis. He said, "Great.

860
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,242
If he wants to burn down the studio,
I'll give him the match."

861
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,276
I used to get up
in the morning

862
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,151
and say,
"Dad gave me this studio."

863
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,089
- (honks horn)
- You know, I'd drive in

864
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,115
and start playing around.

865
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,424
He didn't abuse the right
to have the keys to the studio.

866
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,057
He made real
cutting-edge comedies.

867
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,090
Jerry was truly an artist.

868
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,534
I'm DOA Bird,

869
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,336
producer of fine films.

870
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,863
That's right.

871
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,899
And if I may,
I would like very much

872
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,708
for some of you folk
out there

873
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,341
to meet some of the people
that are to blame for...

874
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:56,478
I'm sorry, I mean,
that are responsible for this film.

875
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,715
Someone gave me a hat
with four beaks.

876
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,280
This one was
the director...

877
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,691
Shh, swine, can't you see
I'm creating?

878
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,527
Oh, it's you, Mr. Bird.

879
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,896
It's a pleasure to have you
on the set. (clicks heels)

880
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,561
Oh, I broke both my...

881
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,539
- Producer...
- Oh, they're all strange.

882
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,031
- Writer...
- Hel... hello, Mr. Bird.

883
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,136
Hel... l...

884
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,080
I love you, great producer.

885
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,915
Actor. They wanted to talk to me...
they'd switch the hat around.

886
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,011
Here is our star...

887
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,080
the man who will deliver us
from Tv

888
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:38,220
and once again having the theaters
bursting with laughter...

889
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,253
Jerry Lewis.
(snickers)

890
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,458
Quentin Tarantino:
It always really is exciting

891
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,299
when a performer feels compelled
to move into filmmaking

892
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,065
and go even further
with their art.

893
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,733
Jerry Lewis: My impression
of your everyday,

894
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:54,039
run-of-the-mill, basic, ordinary,
simple drunk.

895
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,877
(scattered laughter)

896
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,111
The same drunk
in an earthquake.

897
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,417
(laughter and applause)

898
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,993
What a stupid way
to make a fortune.

899
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,019
(cheering and applause)

900
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,554
Announcer: Paramount Studios
announces an unprecedented

901
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,829
$10 million pact
with Jerry Lewis.

902
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,167
Such excitement over a piece of paper
has not been experienced by the world

903
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,605
since the League of Nations Covenant
was rejected

904
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,801
by the Congress
of the United States of America.

905
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,334
Chris Lewis: My dad did make a deal
with Paramount.

906
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,074
He signed a $10 million deal
with Paramount in '59.

907
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,776
And at that time
they made a deal

908
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,048
where after 30 years all of the rights
would revert back to him,

909
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,714
because they wanted him
so badly.

910
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,781
Crystal: Here came this big noise.
What was that?

911
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:45,852
He had a different magnetism
and a different energy

912
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,864
than anyone onscreen had
at that time.

913
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,001
Jerry Lewis: "Cinderfella"
was made for family.

914
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,233
And I built the entire

915
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,208
marketing campaign on that,

916
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,235
because the film that I was doing
was so special.

917
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,715
I went to Rockwell and asked him
if he would do it.

918
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,546
I wanted the best.

919
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,644
I have the only Rockwell
ever commissioned

920
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,850
to be the advertisement
of a motion picture.

921
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,382
Hey, mister,
you got that all wrong.

922
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,451
How?

923
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,656
You forgot the most
important letter...

924
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,688
the F.

925
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,002
Whoa. Whoa.

926
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,906
His comedies, you know... he was very
specific about when they came out...

927
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,002
you know, a summer picture
and then a Christmas picture.

928
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,674
Jerry Lewis: And I wouldn't let
the studio release the picture

929
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,377
- until it was holiday time.
- (crowd gasps)

930
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,818
"Just leave 'Cinderfella' alone.

931
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,220
I want it
as a Christmas release."

932
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,156
- Man: But, chief...
- But nothing.

933
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,182
You sell 'em
and I'll make 'em.

934
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,127
Now for the Christmas campaign
I'm gonna make

935
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,187
a real kids' picture
with big names.

936
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,994
- Okay, chief.
- And when you talk to New York,

937
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,730
you tell them I said...
I'll do anything they say.

938
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,761
Jerry Lewis: And Paramount
was at a point

939
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,638
where if they didn't have
a Jerry Lewis movie in the summer,

940
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,666
they're blowing a lot of money.

941
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,202
So I said to Barney Balaban,
"I'll give you a Jerry Lewis movie."

942
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,238
I go to Florida and I wrote

943
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,843
a 165-page screenplay
in nine days.

944
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,912
And I was shooting
on the 14th day.

945
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,618
Jerry, can we play
that "Bellboy" theme?

946
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,388
- I'm waiting to hear it.
- A-one, two, three, four...

947
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,261
(playing "Bellboy" theme)

948
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,288
Jerry wrote the theme
from the "Bellboy."

949
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,858
It's "The Star-Spangled Banner"

950
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:35,497
with the funny note at the top.
(hums theme)

951
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,100
- That's what... that's...
- (laughter)

952
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,981
Jerry Lewis: When I left New York
to open at the Fontainebleau,

953
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:49,452
I had this short amount of time.

954
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,216
I had a clock
by my typewriter

955
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,349
that was noisy.
(imitates clock ticking)

956
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,987
And every tick I heard
was getting me closer to,

957
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:02,021
"Jesus Christ, you big mouth,

958
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,557
how did you get yourself into this?"
(laughs)

959
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,593
And I'm reviewing
what I'm writing...

960
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,003
"Oh, it'll be okay.
I'll write some more."

961
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,340
I finished the script
before I finished my engagement.

962
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,369
I was only there
for two weeks.

963
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,339
The motion picture
you're about to see

964
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,909
isn't the run-of-the-mill
film fare

965
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,649
that has been presented
to the moviegoing public of late.

966
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,351
There is no story
and no plot.

967
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,520
It is a visual diary
of a few weeks

968
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,961
in the life
of a real nut.

969
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:41,995
Jerry Lewis: I went to Billy Wilder
and I said, "Read this."

970
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,907
And he read "The Bellboy"
and he came back to me and he said,

971
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:49,275
"Goddamn wonderful.
It's wonderful.

972
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,304
(imitates accent) I can't wait
to see it on the screen. It's terrific."

973
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,317
I said, "Well, I want you
to direct it."

974
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,343
He said, "Are you crazy?
I wouldn't direct you. Are you nuts?

975
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,585
You do it. It's your baby.
You wrote it. Direct it.

976
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,616
You'll get what you want
that way."

977
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,323
I said, "Okay."
I hadn't thought about that.

978
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,025
But then I closed
at the Fontainebleau,

979
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,562
then I got it done
in 48 days.

980
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,234
I go and I open at the Sands
in vegas...

981
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,744
another commitment
that I had to honor.

982
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,214
So I was cutting the picture
down in the musicians' room

983
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,809
in the basement, at the Sands,
and delivered it to Paramount...

984
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,320
- Hold it.
...in less than 20 weeks.

985
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,084
- Who are all these people?
- They all work for you, chief.

986
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,592
Mm-hmm, and who's the guy
with the straw hat?

987
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,594
He's the guy that tells you
who we are.

988
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,653
Jerry Lewis: I'd never had
such a good time.

989
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,791
I was getting stronger
in my convictions

990
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,825
of what I was printing.

991
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,703
I was getting stronger
about my ability.

992
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,229
I've never seen you
laugh so hard.

993
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,071
I've got Stanley
on theater seating duty.

994
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,874
Alone? How long has he
been in there?

995
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,779
I just sent him in. He'll be in here
for two, three days at least.

996
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,407
- Let's go and watch.
- Okay.

997
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:24,767
(door rattles)

998
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,969
(whistling "Bellboy" theme)

999
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,745
He's fast.

1000
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:38,117
Jerry Lewis: The night
that I finished the first shoot day,

1001
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,919
I called my dad.
He said, "How did it go?"

1002
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:45,155
And I said,
"Dad, I can't believe

1003
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,722
I did the things
I didn't know I knew

1004
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,357
and it worked."

1005
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,391
He said, "Stay there."

1006
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,995
That was his answer...
"Stay there." "Okay."

1007
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,864
It was an extraordinary time.

1008
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,503
It's like that one time
in your lifetime

1009
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,536
that something like that's
gonna work

1010
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,673
or that you're gonna
even attempt it.

1011
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,910
There you are, Stanley.
Get everything out of the trunk.

1012
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:21,019
And Paramount
turned chicken

1013
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,692
when they read
the screenplay.

1014
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,201
And they thought
I was doing a silent movie.

1015
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,227
I said, "It's not a silent movie.

1016
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:31,365
A lot of noise in this movie.
The kid just doesn't talk."

1017
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,536
I said, "You don't have to
go with me.

1018
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,637
Stay out of it..."

1019
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,079
(phone ringing)

1020
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,412
"...and I will produce the film."

1021
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,781
(phone stops ringing)

1022
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,552
"But it will be my negative."
"Great." They were thrilled.

1023
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,992
- (whistling tune)
- (phone ringing)

1024
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,890
(phone continues ringing)

1025
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,963
(phone stops ringing)

1026
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:08,000
<i>Jerry Lewis: $975,000 later...</i>

1027
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,205
- (phone rings)
...I cut negative.

1028
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,846
(phone ringing)

1029
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,192
- (phone stops ringing)
- To date, it's brought me and my family

1030
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,219
almost $300 million.

1031
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,960
(phone ringing)

1032
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,665
- (phone stops ringing)
- And they were not participating.

1033
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,695
Belzer:
He wrote "The Bellboy"

1034
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,674
and paid for it himself

1035
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,142
and shot this masterpiece

1036
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,578
where he doesn't speak
until the last minute of the movie.

1037
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,276
How is it we never heard you
talk before?

1038
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,754
Because no one ever asked me.

1039
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,589
Jerry Lewis: Nobody believed
I could pull it off in the first place.

1040
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,651
Nowadays if they hear
the word "Bellboy,"

1041
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:02,563
they puke right in the hall,
on the rug..."Bleh!"

1042
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,693
Because there's no telling
what it's gonna continue to make

1043
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,726
for years on end.

1044
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,762
When you got a good negative,

1045
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,240
it's forever.

1046
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,510
A woman goes to the doctor
for an exam.

1047
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,171
A woman goes to the doctor
for an exam.

1048
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,202
She comes home.

1049
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,080
She's flitting around the house
from room to room

1050
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:24,143
with an energy level unlike anything
the husband had ever seen.

1051
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,178
He finally stops her.
He says, "Honey,

1052
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,555
would you be kind enough to tell me
what the hell you're so happy about?"

1053
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,652
She said, "Sweetheart, you know
what the doctor said to me today?

1054
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,154
He said I had the breasts
of an 18-year-old."

1055
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,190
He said, "Really?

1056
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,702
What did he say about
your 45-year-old ass?"

1057
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:45,265
(laughter and applause)

1058
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,606
She said, "Your name
never came up."

1059
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,011
(laughter and applause)

1060
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:55,381
Oh! Oh!

1061
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,581
Listen to the women..."No!"

1062
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,112
Jerry refers to himself
in different ways.

1063
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:05,287
He calls himself Jerry or "the kid"
or "the idiot,"

1064
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:09,731
because he has to know
which Jerry he's playing

1065
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,825
in different scenes.

1066
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,632
And I had a similar thing
on my show

1067
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,765
where I had...
was Jerry and Tv Jerry.

1068
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,314
Crystal: Directing yourself
in your own movie

1069
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:34,312
that you've written and you've crafted
a character for yourself is so hard.

1070
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,020
Man: 51-2.

1071
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,222
Crystal: If you have a vision
for something and he knows who he is,

1072
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:44,665
and it sometimes is hard for someone
else to get that out of you,

1073
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,636
so you trust nobody
but yourself.

1074
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,865
Well, just don't do something.
Sit there.

1075
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,137
Uh, that is...
class dismissed!

1076
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,041
Tarantino: And it wasn't just,
"Let me do it

1077
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,478
because I'm tired of listening
to that hack," all right,

1078
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,345
or, "Well, if that guy can do it,
I can do it."

1079
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,043
You know, he didn't come
from that place.

1080
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,075
He wanted his films
to be terrific.

1081
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,180
And he wanted to be considered
a serious director who did comedy.

1082
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:11,125
He is much closer
to Buster Keaton than Charlie Chaplin,

1083
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,652
insofar as actually taking
the film medium

1084
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:17,860
and trying to get laughs
by the way you shot stuff,

1085
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,392
by the art form itself...

1086
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,598
- (whistling a tune)
...not just the pratfalls,

1087
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,301
not just "filming my comedy,"
but the comedy is also

1088
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,502
part of the filmmaking
process itself.

1089
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,678
(camera shutter clicks)

1090
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,713
(birds chirping)

1091
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,158
Steven Spielberg: He was a restless
filmmaker, you know.

1092
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,856
He was always searching.
He was, I think, looking around

1093
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,364
for a new way
of telling a story, you know.

1094
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,424
He was trying to, I think,
almost redefine

1095
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,561
the art of the narrative.

1096
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,800
The Marx Brothers,
when they had the right writer

1097
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,606
and the right director
and all the pieces were in place,

1098
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,373
they made great movies.

1099
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,244
Man:
490, take 4.

1100
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,441
(knocks)

1101
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,008
- Yes?
- (laughs)

1102
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:12,886
But Jerry made them himself.
He did it all himself.

1103
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,947
So that's a very different thing.

1104
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,755
I have always been

1105
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,627
so intrigued

1106
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,759
with what we are
capable of doing technically.

1107
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,792
Richard Lewis:
Jerry is a genius.

1108
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,270
He invented unbelievable things
as a director

1109
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,603
that people use to this day.

1110
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,905
Every time a director takes a shot
and then runs over

1111
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,570
and looks at it,
it's Jerry.

1112
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,102
Oh!

1113
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,546
Jerry Lewis:
I had nightmares

1114
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,279
thinking how much I've learned
in the picture industry,

1115
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,653
and what do I do
if I want to direct Jerry?

1116
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,716
(mumbles)
I don't know that.

1117
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,593
Jerry Lewis:
What do I do? Ask an editor?

1118
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,030
Do I ask a camera operator?

1119
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:00,161
Suffuse his sense of humor
to the way that it must be,

1120
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,364
to print or dump?

1121
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,270
What do I do?

1122
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,707
I decided

1123
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:11,476
that if I was gonna
direct Jerry,

1124
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:15,678
the only time
I would ever print

1125
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,176
would be if I saw
what he did.

1126
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,019
In the picture business
we have wires that usually hold.

1127
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,621
- (woman giggling)
- Unfortunately

1128
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,496
this goddamn thing broke.
Cut.

1129
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,195
He is the performer.
Jerry's not only

1130
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,228
writing, producing, directing,
God knows, painting the sets,

1131
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,263
whatever the hell he's doing,
you know.

1132
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,572
You understand why he created
video assist...

1133
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,271
because he's the performer.

1134
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,713
What about if you had

1135
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,707
a video camera
alongside your B and C

1136
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,879
and you keep your monitor
where you can see it?

1137
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,513
Because there wasn't
tape then.

1138
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,753
Murphy: Video playback
changed all of filmmaking.

1139
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,624
This guy said,
"Hey, wait a minute.

1140
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,221
Let me see right on the set
what we just shot."

1141
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,665
I don't know one person that
doesn't go back and look at the monitor

1142
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:08,398
and go, "Can I get another one?
Can we do one more?"

1143
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,999
Jerry Lewis: I go to Tokyo
and I sat with Mr. Morita...

1144
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,509
the chairman of the board
of the Sony Corporation,

1145
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,308
with his research people.
And they're all drawing me sketches.

1146
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,214
Shipped everything back
from Tokyo with me

1147
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,911
and I called the crew
and we set up everything.

1148
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,943
It was magic.

1149
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,548
Spielberg: The video assist
was invented by Jerry

1150
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:31,151
because nobody had any idea
what they were getting

1151
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,889
until the operator blessed it

1152
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,022
or until the operator
critiqued it.

1153
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,931
Jerry Lewis: So it became
a great tool for my wardrobe,

1154
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,958
makeup, grips, electricians.

1155
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,836
The camera operator
loved seeing

1156
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,238
what he had just finished
setting up.

1157
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,175
Spielberg: The camera operator
was in collaboration for the first time

1158
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,338
with the filmmaker,
with the director himself.

1159
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,746
And now the operator
and the director could figure out

1160
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,410
how to tweak the shot,
make it better.

1161
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,442
That's genius.

1162
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,682
But it also, I'm sure,
helped his comedy...

1163
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,349
Argh!

1164
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,120
...'cause he could see it
right there.

1165
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,423
I directed Jerry Lewis
in "Mr. Saturday Night."

1166
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,624
He came on the set.
He saw the video assist.

1167
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,101
He told me, "I invented that."
I said, "But you didn't have playback.

1168
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,400
You just could watch."
And he went, "Details, details."

1169
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,397
Jerry Lewis: And then a year later
I get video tape.

1170
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,706
Spielberg: There should be a sign,
you know, saying...

1171
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,611
(laughing)
"Jerry Lewis invented this."

1172
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,808
Jerry Lewis: I learned
from Joe Mankiewicz...

1173
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,046
"You will be a great director
the day you understand

1174
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:34,250
you have to create
an atmosphere of fun.

1175
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:38,249
You will get people
skipping to work in the morning."

1176
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,459
- ## I love you, I love you. ##
- (laughing)

1177
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,160
## You're Jewish
and I'm gay. ##

1178
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,692
(crew laughing)

1179
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,796
One picture of the family.
Hold it.

1180
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,569
- (laughing louder)
- Cut!

1181
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:55,099
Jerry Lewis: Every set that I did
anything on

1182
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,839
was open to the public.

1183
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,870
The sign on the huge doors was,

1184
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:02,578
"This is not a closed set.
Please come in."

1185
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:05,018
Belzer: The fact
that it says "Open"

1186
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,046
shows how fearless,
how gracious...

1187
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,616
"This is what I do.
Come and look at it. I'm proud of it."

1188
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,493
- Jerry Lewis: I'm going to work.
- Man: All right, places, please.

1189
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,827
Jerry Lewis: All right,
let's hear it for the movie star.

1190
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,958
- Jerry Lewis: Hey, stupid!
- Crew: Hey!

1191
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,833
My name is on the screen.
I get the credit for all.

1192
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,236
But everyone on my crew
was a teacher

1193
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,263
in one way or another.

1194
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,072
I've worked very hard
to let them always remember

1195
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,274
that I couldn't do
any of the stuff I did without them.

1196
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,076
Burnett: He was a guest star
on my show.

1197
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,110
He knew everybody's name
on our crew.

1198
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:41,214
Once he was introduced
to everybody, he never forgot it.

1199
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,487
- Hello, Morty.
- Hello, Mr. Habanaffen.

1200
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,893
May I help you? A lot of people
have difficulty with that.

1201
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,556
- It's Wo...
- Wo...

1202
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,190
...ben...
...ben...

1203
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,791
...lot...
...lot...

1204
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,495
...ny.
...ny.

1205
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,697
- Wobenlotny.
- Babanotten.

1206
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:59,105
John Landis: I did a series
of commercials for Coca-Cola

1207
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:01,406
with Jerry Lewis
in the early '90s.

1208
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,810
He shows up,
8:00 in the morning,

1209
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,748
and he was introduced
to every single individual there.

1210
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,411
<i>Had to be 70 people.</i>

1211
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,443
And then we shot.

1212
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,978
At the end of the day
he wanted everyone's attention.

1213
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,924
And everyone looks and he says,
"Listen, I'd like to say

1214
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,792
good night, Bob,
good night, Larry,

1215
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,491
good night, Gloria,
good night, Shirley, good night..."

1216
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,228
Every single person's name...
he knew their names.

1217
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,566
And so he went out
in this blaze of glory

1218
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,039
and everybody was like,
"Wow!"

1219
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:34,804
I got two sets
of bleachers on my set

1220
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,039
where visitors
could sit and watch.

1221
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:41,015
My crew loved it.
They were as big a ham as I am.

1222
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,747
They had fun watching me
as the director.

1223
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,812
- (plays a chord)
- (sings off-key, laughing)

1224
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,120
Then they had fun
watching me as the comic.

1225
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,853
(laughing)
Cut.

1226
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,884
They'd see me
run into myself.

1227
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,056
- (laughing)
- Cut.

1228
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,998
It's a challenge,
when you're feeling all of this power

1229
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,731
that you have to have
and delegate to the right people,

1230
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,137
to keep yourself calm
to give a performance.

1231
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,301
Woody Harrelson: The camaraderie
had to be important for him

1232
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,471
just to be able to feel like
he could just let go

1233
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,176
and do some of that
wild insanity that he would...

1234
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,048
he'd come up with
just the most...

1235
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,144
(truck horn blows)

1236
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,654
Argh!

1237
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,658
You have to feel safe
to be able to do that.

1238
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,990
(crew laughing)

1239
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,021
Son of a bitch.

1240
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,226
Will you leave me alone?

1241
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:34,395
It just seemed like
the most fun you could have...

1242
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:37,964
in the '60s at Paramount,
doing his thing.

1243
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,474
Man: 310-2.

1244
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,068
And one day
I read in the paper

1245
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,978
that a motion picture
advertiser needed help.

1246
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,777
(sighs)

1247
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,841
- Do you have to go to the toilet?
- (crew snickering)

1248
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,182
- No.
- No?

1249
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,245
- I'm just fine.
- (laughter)

1250
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,654
All right, cut.

1251
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,318
I have to tell you this

1252
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,056
because I can't keep it
to myself any longer.

1253
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,656
I was in New York
three weeks ago,

1254
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,962
couldn't get a cab.
It was raining.

1255
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,162
So I go downstairs
to the subway

1256
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,194
and I get on the train.

1257
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,503
I'm sitting there
and it makes one stop.

1258
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,975
And this guy gets on

1259
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,138
wearing leather pants,

1260
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,579
leather jacket,

1261
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,415
leather shirt, leather tie,
leather boots.

1262
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,980
And he had rings on his ears,
on his nose, on his lip.

1263
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,653
And he had his hair
swiped up

1264
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,720
yellow, red,

1265
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,790
green, purple.

1266
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,824
And he sits down
right opposite me.

1267
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,860
And I'm staring at him.

1268
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,895
He says, "What's the matter,
old man?

1269
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,500
Didn't you ever see
anything strange before?"

1270
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:50,069
I said, "Yeah, about 20 years ago
I had sex with a parrot.

1271
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,103
I thought you were my son."

1272
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,480
(laughter and applause)

1273
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,378
This is just another thing
of his amazing eye.

1274
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,789
(explosion)

1275
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,816
Man:
Get the door!

1276
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:08,826
(door squeaks)

1277
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,128
Seinfeld: When he gets called
into the dean's office

1278
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:20,006
as Professor Kelp
after the explosion

1279
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,875
and he sits down
in that chair

1280
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,211
and sinks into it...

1281
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,716
to have the eye to know,

1282
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,117
"This will look funny."

1283
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,213
He's not doing anything.
He's just sinking

1284
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,247
in a chair.

1285
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,283
It's brilliant.

1286
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,921
It's so funny.
It's so simple.

1287
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:43,431
When I first started watching it,
I just know,

1288
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,661
"This guy is making me laugh
every time I see him."

1289
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,193
And now, having done
a few things myself,

1290
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,968
I understand a lot more

1291
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,999
and I appreciate

1292
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:58,946
the incredible richness
of his skills even more.

1293
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,616
Look at the headline
of the column.

1294
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,989
- Are you in focus?
- Man: I am.

1295
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,994
Good. 'Cause I like this kind of stuff
to be in focus.

1296
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,792
(laughing)

1297
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,025
The thrill of getting an idea

1298
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,092
and then sketching it
and then sitting behind a camera,

1299
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:23,799
and you're looking
and you see it's exact, let's shoot it...

1300
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,275
it's a rush.
You want to do it some more.

1301
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,767
(jazz orchestra playing)

1302
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,906
I wanted to see the kid

1303
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,508
- in a boardinghouse.
- (knocks)

1304
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,815
Well, when you start
with an idea like this,

1305
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,014
it just blooms.

1306
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,115
So I built this set.

1307
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,786
And it cost me almost a half a million
to build it.

1308
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:47,660
We're talking about 1960.

1309
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,687
All my sound...

1310
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,223
everything was in the ceilings.

1311
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:55,294
- Man: Let's try to get a microphone...
- One, two, three, four...

1312
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,204
Jerry Lewis: I had three mixers
on the set

1313
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,266
to cover the 42 rooms.

1314
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:05,573
Spielberg: Those humongous sets
on "Ladies' Man,"

1315
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,209
in a sense, rivaling
"The Diary of Anne Frank" set

1316
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,617
and "The Rear Window"
Hitchcock set,

1317
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,451
you know,
where it was all there.

1318
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,549
It was all there for a filmmaker
to make choices.

1319
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,288
Just pull back... you had it all
right before your lens.

1320
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,698
They asked me if I would want

1321
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,896
to teach a class at USC.

1322
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,805
And I thought
that sounded terrific.

1323
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,241
And I went for it.

1324
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:38,736
And I had
eight magnificent years

1325
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,581
teaching post-grad students.

1326
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,711
He believed in young people.
And he believed

1327
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,085
in a whole new generation
of filmmakers coming up.

1328
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,183
And he had a class.
For young filmmakers.

1329
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,854
And I had made "Amblin"'...
my short film.

1330
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,455
And he invited me
to show the film to the class

1331
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,830
and to speak about my process.

1332
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,165
In my case,
being a fan of Jerry's,

1333
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,193
almost feeling like
pinching myself...

1334
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,830
I can't believe
I'm in the same room

1335
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,171
and Jerry Lewis is actually
having a conversation with me.

1336
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,768
Jerry Lewis:
Spielberg was in that class.

1337
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,575
- Bogdanovich.
- Bogdanovich was in the class,

1338
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,605
Randy Kleiser.

1339
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,640
He was warm.
He was embracing.

1340
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,549
He was funny.
He was serious.

1341
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,850
When he taught at USC

1342
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,982
and we were in his class,

1343
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:24,185
he recorded those classes,

1344
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,559
which ultimately became the book
"The Total Film-Maker."

1345
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,087
Jerry Lewis:
Marty Scorsese

1346
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,397
never went on the set
without the book.

1347
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,302
I would argue with him about something,
he said, "Hold on a second."

1348
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,102
So he'd lean over and
he'd turn pages in my book.

1349
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,041
Spielberg:
And he loved those kids.

1350
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,907
I mentor now to this day.

1351
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,648
Jerry Lewis taught me
the importance of mentoring.

1352
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,082
Harrelson:
The main reason I'm a performer

1353
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,812
is because of Jerry.

1354
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,752
He speaks
to the common man.

1355
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,778
All I wanted to do
is apologize to you, see?

1356
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,017
Will you get out of here?
If you don't, I'm gonna...

1357
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,322
- Argh!
- Oh, wait, my foot.

1358
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,521
- My foot is stuck.
- Get out of here.

1359
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,531
Harrelson: You love him.
You root for him...

1360
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:06,262
the, "Oh, no, not getting
into more trouble, no."

1361
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,668
- (kid screams)
- (woman screams)

1362
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,009
Here, let me cover you up.
(babbling)

1363
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:19,413
(woman screaming)
Get me out of here!

1364
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,780
(orchestra playing jazz)

1365
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,795
- (orchestra stops)
- (laughter)

1366
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,978
I dug the '60s comic books when I was
a kid. I thought they were great.

1367
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,481
His comic books rocked.

1368
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,574
His comic books were made
better than Bob Hope's.

1369
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,950
I just gotta say that.
I know it's controversial.

1370
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,477
(laughter)

1371
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,648
But Jerry did the better comic
than Bob Hope.

1372
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,715
Jerry Lewis: Oh, Jesus.
- (Tarantino laughing)

1373
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,750
He just spit
on the American flag.

1374
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:09,321
Tarantino: Well, I remember
one of Truffaut's quotes:

1375
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,128
Jerry Lewis is almost like

1376
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,657
a whole year's worth of cartoons
in one performance.

1377
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:30,142
Jerry's comedy existed in the world
where cartoons already existed.

1378
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,585
Jerry Lewis is kind of like
a cartoon figure.

1379
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,953
(laughter and applause)

1380
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,288
(cheering)

1381
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,999
He was a kid.
I mean, I loved the cartoon gags.

1382
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,702
Whoa!

1383
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,606
There's real Tex Avery stuff
going on.

1384
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,303
(groans)

1385
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,902
(roars)

1386
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,745
My God, that's just what I did
all the time as a kid...

1387
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,274
you know, making faces.

1388
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,412
There was nobody better at it
than him.

1389
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,321
(giggling)

1390
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,821
(cheering and applause)

1391
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,562
Jerry went back
to the silent era

1392
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:26,597
and he brought visual sight gags
back to American movie theaters.

1393
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,940
They weren't doing that
for a long time.

1394
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:32,037
Long before the Zuckers
did "Airplane!"

1395
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,209
Which I think owes a lot
to Jerry Lewis movies,

1396
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,241
and before those great
visual comedies...

1397
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:40,744
you know, like all
the Leslie Nielsen comedies.

1398
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,994
You have to look at Jerry.
He's kind of the father of that style

1399
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,689
of gags.

1400
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,402
Oh!

1401
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,601
(cheering and applause)

1402
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,952
I've always thought
that there was a connection

1403
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,013
between Jerry Lewis
and Bugs Bunny a little bit,

1404
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,820
but one of the biggest
connections is,

1405
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,986
when Bugs Bunny would get
dressed up as a woman,

1406
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,222
well, that's pretty much like
when Jerry Lewis

1407
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,356
got dressed up
as Carmen Miranda, all right?

1408
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,492
(laughing)
And one of the weird things about it

1409
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,935
is they actually go
for sex appeal.

1410
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,996
He looks like a girl.

1411
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:57,025
Tarantino: "Looney Tunes" would
constantly break the fourth wall

1412
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,659
and talk to somebody
in the theater...

1413
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,965
"Hey, you in the third row,
shut up."

1414
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:05,531
Over here.
Let's not fool with the child star.

1415
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,237
Tarantino: The end of "Patsy"
when he falls...

1416
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,439
- Whoa!
- Stanley!

1417
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,914
Tarantino: It's a perfect example
of a "Looney Tunes,"

1418
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,883
break the fourth wall...
this is what we're watching,

1419
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,977
in fact, and why are you
watching it? (laughs)

1420
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,385
Stanley.

1421
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,083
Aren't you overacting a little bit,
Miss Balin? Balin.

1422
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,422
It's a movie, see?
I'm fine.

1423
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,724
The people in the theater know
I ain't gonna die.

1424
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:29,230
Here, it's a movie stage.
Here, look at this, see?

1425
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,664
There's wires and lights.
And I'm gonna make more movies,

1426
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,760
so I couldn't die. It's like
a make-believe. It's a dumb city.

1427
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,705
Tarantino: That's still kind of
a bizarre joke today. It's out there.

1428
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,174
You are a complete nut.

1429
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,337
Which reminds me, I'm having nuts
and whipped cream for lunch.

1430
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,243
Would you join me, please?
Crew, that's lunch.

1431
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,840
One hour for the actors
and seven days for the technicians.

1432
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,249
It's a movie set
breaking once and for all...

1433
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,554
(wheezing, mutters)

1434
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,186
Jerry Lewis: There's a lot of
resilience in a director.

1435
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,957
He can take a lot of crap.

1436
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,692
It's too heavy.
You'd better cut it, Lenny.

1437
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:04,892
(crew laughing)

1438
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,733
Jerry Lewis: What he has to exude
for the actors

1439
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:13,230
is solid confidence
that he knows

1440
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,539
the way you're gonna cut it,

1441
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:18,102
and the director
is gonna tell you.

1442
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,137
When you make a set-up,

1443
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,151
know where it's coming from,
to there,

1444
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,710
and where that's going,
to there.

1445
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,917
The captain of the National Airlines jet
just flew in from New York

1446
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,425
and he left his briefcase
in the cockpit of the plane.

1447
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,258
- Now get down there and get it.
- (tires screech)

1448
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:38,426
Jerry Lewis: In "The Bellboy,"
when I had him drive to the airport,

1449
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,233
go into the airport,
walk up the steps,

1450
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,899
he's looking for
the captain's briefcase...

1451
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,602
didn't have to say anything;
didn't have to do anything;

1452
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,941
music wasn't even important.

1453
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,813
Oh, Stanley?
Yes, he works for me.

1454
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,456
He what?

1455
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,289
(engine roaring)

1456
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,955
The fact that it was
on the cut:

1457
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,294
"He what?"
Bang!

1458
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,824
<i>He's up there at 7,000 feet.</i>

1459
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,471
I recut it 13 times,

1460
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,965
always coming back
to the original thought...

1461
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,844
chick-choo, chick-choo,
chick-choo.

1462
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,349
You take a beat
between "chick"...

1463
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:31,318
you can't do that.

1464
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:35,016
Man: Would you say something
into the microphone for me?

1465
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,150
- Jerry Lewis: Now?
- Okay.

1466
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,618
(loudly)
How's it going?

1467
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:43,790
Geronimo!

1468
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,861
Jerry Lewis: The creative mind
needs sound and picture.

1469
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,134
Argh!

1470
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,767
I have to have the sound

1471
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:57,802
as vitally important
as the picture.

1472
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,178
(footsteps squeaking)

1473
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,893
(footsteps squeaking)

1474
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,696
(school bell rings)

1475
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,036
Jerry Lewis: He comes in.

1476
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,701
We see that he's just blotto.

1477
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,871
It's the hangover
of the century.

1478
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:34,541
I used the slam
of a safe door.

1479
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,847
(loud bong)

1480
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,250
Oh.

1481
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:41,414
Jerry Lewis: And I went
to the Bank of America to shoot it.

1482
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,924
And we recorded the...

1483
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:48,419
bo-o-ong!

1484
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:51,728
And I had the mike
on the inner door,

1485
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:55,134
so you really heard
what nobody ever heard.

1486
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,660
(booms)

1487
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,606
No one's ever been in there
when they did that.

1488
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,541
(squeaking)

1489
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,171
Jerry Lewis: Chalk on the board...

1490
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,647
it bothered me watching it.

1491
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,843
Oh.

1492
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,751
(chewing loudly)

1493
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,949
(sneezes)
The sneeze.

1494
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,254
(loud noise)

1495
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,385
Jerry Lewis: I used a grizzly bear's
growl for that.

1496
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,262
(loud hisses)

1497
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,289
(drops echoing)

1498
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,063
I had about 26 sounds.

1499
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,768
A book.

1500
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,035
(loud thud)

1501
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:38,001
Nobody realizes
how loud a book can be.

1502
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,414
Now you enlarge that sound.

1503
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,210
No, it's better with a hardcover.

1504
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,745
It's better with a hardcover.

1505
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,087
(piano intro plays)

1506
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,285
(horn blows)

1507
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,726
(laughter and cheering)

1508
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:03,762
Is someone
giving birth back there?

1509
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,796
Name it after me.

1510
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,309
These are the glasses

1511
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,039
that we are seriously
contemplating using

1512
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,707
for some of the sequences.

1513
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,740
Let me try
the other ones now.

1514
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,445
Oh, God, that pinches.

1515
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,549
Profile smile... to see
that the teeth are correct.

1516
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,854
(man laughs)

1517
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,259
This is the makeup

1518
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,230
with a little more red.

1519
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,496
Murphy: I do get to stretch more
when I put stuff on,

1520
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,935
because you have
whatever your baggage is

1521
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:38,462
when you show up,
and your little stuff

1522
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,441
that people expect of you.

1523
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:43,137
When you're somebody else,
they don't know what to expect.

1524
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,237
You get to do a lot
of different things.

1525
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,181
And Jerry did that, you know,
before anybody as well.

1526
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:51,049
Hello, Los Angeles tower.
This is Eddie's Airways,

1527
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,987
the airline for the birds.
Ha-ha-ha! A little pun.

1528
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:00,518
Chase: I think of him put in a situation

1529
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,962
the way you put Peter Sellers
into a situation,

1530
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:06,695
and he turns and he's got
this stuff on his nose.

1531
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:09,067
Don't tell me that
that hadn't occurred to Jerry

1532
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,696
a few years earlier.
(laughs)

1533
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,037
Battle stations!

1534
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,701
(ringing bells)

1535
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,802
Murphy:
Peter Sellers gets credited

1536
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,870
with doing stuff like that.

1537
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,109
Jerry's doing it
before everybody's doing

1538
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,140
multiple character stuff.

1539
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:28,520
Chase:
This guy... me, Fletch,

1540
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,287
using multiple funny costumes
that I wore...

1541
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:35,057
if it in any way rang of Jerry Lewis,
I'm proud of it.

1542
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,088
- Man: Your name, sir.
- Uh, Bugs Peyton.

1543
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,623
What is it again?

1544
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,899
I said Bugs Peyton.
My name... Bugs Peyton.

1545
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,530
Mugs Peyton?

1546
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,871
Hey, schmuck,
Bugs, not Mugs.

1547
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,274
What's this there?
A television?

1548
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,801
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1549
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,110
- What business are you in?
- I'm a priest.

1550
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,174
(crew laughing)

1551
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,880
Man:
You're a priest?

1552
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,448
Yeah, free rites at the Mormon
Tabernacle Temple in Idaho.

1553
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,982
Man:
You look Jewish to me.

1554
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,930
- Doesn't everybody?
- (laughter)

1555
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,490
I really think

1556
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,969
Jerry should get
a Kennedy Center honor.

1557
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,563
Jerry Lewis:
Jack came out of the service

1558
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,939
when Dean and I were playing
the Chez Paree in Chicago.

1559
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:24,070
And we lived
at the Ambassador East.

1560
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,103
I had a suite on the north side

1561
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:28,581
and Jack's suite
was on the south side.

1562
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,881
And he would come in to me
every once in a while

1563
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:35,083
and asked me what I thought
of this paragraph, and he reads it.

1564
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:38,149
And about the third time he came in
with something, I said,

1565
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:42,061
"Are you doing a speech?
Are you appearing somewhere?"

1566
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,190
He said, "No, this is something else.

1567
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,564
I'm calling it 'Profiles in Courage."'

1568
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,660
I said, "Really?"

1569
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:52,605
The book that became my bible.

1570
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,577
I'd give my soul if I could have dinner
with Jack Kennedy again.

1571
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,205
He never ever spent time with me

1572
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:03,911
that I didn't hear something
I never wanted to forget.

1573
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:08,252
One day we were in Hyannis Port

1574
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,451
and we're on the golf course.

1575
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:14,485
And the one thing that
Jack Kennedy told me for sure...

1576
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:18,226
"Don't get into
anything political.

1577
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,257
You're gonna lose
half your audience."

1578
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,530
Whenever I came to see
Jack Kennedy,

1579
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,905
he made sure I came up through
the bowels of the White House,

1580
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,435
up through the staircase
and into the Oval Office,

1581
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,743
so that the press didn't ever know
I was with him.

1582
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,773
I had 19 visits

1583
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,479
and no one ever knew it.

1584
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,555
I did his last birthday appearance.

1585
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:46,560
It was the night of his birthday
at the Armory

1586
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,994
and I was teasing Jack.

1587
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:52,158
(onstage) Could you put the light on
so I can see if he's here?

1588
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,169
Mr. Pres... would you just wave
so I know?

1589
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,103
Is he here?

1590
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,698
Because if you got me here
all the way for nothing...

1591
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,335
Is that you?

1592
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,175
Mr. President,
it's me... Jerry.

1593
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:08,205
Remember? The nut.
I voted for you.

1594
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,150
(narrating) I'll never forget it,
as long as I live.

1595
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:21,056
Seinfeld: There is no real
low-brow in comedy.

1596
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:24,031
(tires screech)

1597
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,260
It's even harder to do that

1598
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,292
than some other forms
of comedy

1599
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,600
where you have
dialogue and character.

1600
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,232
Just get in a car
and make me laugh.

1601
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,139
(humming a tune)

1602
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,007
(Seinfeld chuckling)
That is not easy.

1603
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,036
(woman over speaker)
Fella!

1604
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,980
Yes, Stepmother.

1605
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,813
Stepmother:
Where's my car?

1606
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,716
Seinfeld:
To drive a Rolls Royce

1607
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:48,587
and to make the car funny,

1608
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,955
to drive funny...

1609
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:54,450
no one else
has ever done this.

1610
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,521
This is brilliant.

1611
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,897
This is sophisticated.

1612
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,459
You gotta be a genius
to figure out

1613
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,871
how to make a car
drive funny,

1614
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,671
so that you watch the car
and you laugh at the car.

1615
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,440
Enjoy your ride, Stepmother.
I fixed the car

1616
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,640
perfectly mechanically
beautifully.

1617
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:14,909
(wheezes)

1618
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:17,281
Seinfeld: This is not
lowbrow to me.

1619
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,309
This is the highest brow.

1620
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:23,518
Jerry Lewis, Noel Coward...
you know, right there.

1621
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,425
(car creaking)

1622
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:29,123
- My name is Bettina Bailey.
- What is it?

1623
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:31,064
- Bettina.
- Bettina?

1624
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,090
- Bettina, yes.
- That's so nice.

1625
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:36,365
Um, I want to let you know

1626
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:40,135
my lifelong dream,
if you wouldn't mind,

1627
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,803
to hug you, please.

1628
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:45,740
Here?

1629
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,305
(laughter)

1630
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,579
Now?

1631
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,678
Or if you got a room back there,
you know, either way.

1632
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:56,485
(laughter)

1633
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:59,516
It's so nice of you.
I'll tell you what:

1634
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,496
After the show,
if you come backstage,

1635
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,363
I will let security know
to let you in.

1636
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,834
I will give you a hug,
but I cannot promise you

1637
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:10,394
that it'll end there.

1638
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:16,309
Woman:
On Myspace, they asked,

1639
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,868
"Who would you most like
to meet?"

1640
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:19,903
Well, my number one was God,

1641
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,280
- but my number two was you.
- (crowd exclaims)

1642
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:25,150
So maybe we can make it
a threesome with Bettina

1643
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:28,678
- and let me come back, get a hug?
- (laughter and cheering)

1644
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,395
I'm gonna be busy, ain't I?

1645
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,866
Is the drug store open?

1646
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,664
You don't need it.
I've gone through menopause.

1647
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,967
- Oh, Jesus.
- (cheering and applause)

1648
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:53,042
One, two, three, four...

1649
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,315
What I do when I dance is fake.

1650
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,583
(laughs)

1651
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:37,750
I am one of the faking fools.

1652
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,056
The dancing became

1653
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,085
a part of the writing process.

1654
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,121
(swing music playing)

1655
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:46,156
What I love about Jerry is,

1656
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,897
he's never had a dance lesson
in his life, he told me.

1657
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:52,771
He fakes it. Well, goodness me,
he fakes better than I dance.

1658
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,105
(swing music continues)

1659
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,453
I know nothing about dancing

1660
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:44,515
other than time, rhythm.

1661
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:47,653
I stood in the wings
watching my dad

1662
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:51,859
at the ripe age...
five, six, seven, eight.

1663
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:56,131
I mean, I watched some of the best
dancers in the world.

1664
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,970
He was trying
to experiment with comedy

1665
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:04,740
in a weird way that Gene Kelly
was trying to experiment

1666
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,838
with what you could do
with dance in movies.

1667
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,850
(fanfare)

1668
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,547
(percussion intro plays)

1669
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,182
(jazz orchestra playing)

1670
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:18,658
Jerry Lewis:
I gave the crew the setup.

1671
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,890
I had tracks.
Music was ready.

1672
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,693
And I had to be ready.
When I was ready, I went.

1673
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,493
That was my own
choreography.

1674
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:03,731
I did that in take one.

1675
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,797
Two setups...
I did the whole dance.

1676
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,468
The front office was
in shock

1677
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,909
because I shot that whole sequence
in four hours.

1678
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,788
I went up the stairs
in eight seconds.

1679
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,996
- (clock chimes)
- I think I'll have to get along.

1680
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,027
I'll never forget you.

1681
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:47,170
Jerry Lewis: 66 steps
in eight seconds.

1682
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,912
But at the top of the steps
I had a heart failure.

1683
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,156
I was in Mount Sinai Hospital

1684
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,090
30 minutes later.

1685
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,061
The insurance company
didn't want to pay us.

1686
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,256
They didn't believe I made it
in eight seconds.

1687
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,322
And they kept looking
at the film.

1688
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:07,357
I said, "The film don't lie."

1689
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,633
66 steps in eight seconds.
(chuckles)

1690
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:18,135
While I'm in the oxygen tent,
my father opens the flap,

1691
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:21,046
looks in and says, "Do you know
what you're doing to your mother?"

1692
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,447
My baby.

1693
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,974
I'm lying here,
hoping I'm gonna survive,

1694
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:27,886
and he's asking me if I know
what I'm doing to my mother.

1695
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,890
It was a perfect Jewish question.

1696
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:32,392
Oh, my child.

1697
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,861
(laughter)

1698
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:38,229
Seinfeld: He's a brilliant
musician of comedy.

1699
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,530
Comedy is math and music.

1700
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,093
It's very precise
and mathematical,

1701
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:47,904
but it has to have
a musical kind of flow to it.

1702
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,137
(playing fanfare intro)

1703
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:00,286
Maybe it could be
just a touch faster.

1704
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:02,152
Okay? Same thing. Thanks.

1705
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,988
If you waved your arms faster,
it would have been faster.

1706
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,392
(musicians laughing)

1707
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:11,957
They played exactly
what you were doing.

1708
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:16,436
Belzer: I watched JL
rehearse a 36-piece orchestra

1709
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,462
and know every instrument.

1710
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:22,135
I mean, this is a musical genius
in the true sense.

1711
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,472
(orchestra stops playing)

1712
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:31,314
Train wreck.

1713
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:33,286
(laughter)

1714
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:37,417
- Rick, where did that happen?
- We've got it covered.

1715
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,358
(laughing)

1716
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,827
Jerry Lewis: When you get music
in your soul

1717
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:45,629
and you are then becoming
a creative artist...

1718
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:48,965
I could never just
put music over there.

1719
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:52,029
It was always imbued
in my being.

1720
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:55,133
If you look at a scene I did
in "The Patsy,"

1721
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,304
I do the kid that has tickets
for the premiere

1722
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,246
but he's not dressed for it.

1723
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,875
I chewed that scene
for four days

1724
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:07,581
till I got it exactly
the way I wanted it.

1725
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,420
And then, when I scored it,

1726
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:13,621
I still didn't get it perfect.

1727
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,791
And then I took one of the pieces
of music that we had recorded

1728
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:20,266
and I Mickey-Moused it

1729
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:24,465
to go...
(imitates sped-up music)

1730
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:26,905
And it was one spot
where it needed it.

1731
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:30,843
And it made it happen
really, really good.

1732
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:34,143
I was very proud of the work.

1733
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,515
You know, you put a comic
on the screen

1734
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,715
for an audience
for eight minutes...

1735
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:43,656
that's almost a reel.

1736
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,386
(music slows down)

1737
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:49,328
Without the music it would have been
a whole, long eight minutes.

1738
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,490
The music moved it.

1739
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:53,523
It gave it that thing

1740
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:58,005
that an audience sitting
in the theater needs to be told.

1741
01:32:58,039 --> 01:33:00,303
- (music vamping)
- Pull the tracks out of there

1742
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,037
and look at it,
and it almost works without it.

1743
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,671
But it will never work
with wrong music.

1744
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:15,082
When you talk of comedy
as the art form,

1745
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:18,683
it demands
what music gives it.

1746
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,355
The trombone will play D-flat,

1747
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:29,836
you play E,
and you play E-sharp, okay?

1748
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,498
Listen to this, folks.

1749
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:37,000
(dissonant chord plays)

1750
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:40,241
Man:
That is the shit.

1751
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,340
There's always one
that don't belong there,

1752
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:44,374
but if it was out of there,
it'd be perfect.

1753
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:46,249
(laughter)

1754
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,517
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Okay.

1755
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,755
Good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1756
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,454
- Do we have a gentleman?
- No.

1757
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:57,828
Good. Screw them.

1758
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,730
Cough.

1759
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:04,569
When you have a guy
in the band

1760
01:34:04,605 --> 01:34:07,403
who's better than everybody else
at his instrument,

1761
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:09,272
you gotta hear a solo.

1762
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,245
(humming a tune)

1763
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:14,873
And the same with Jerry...
you know, you want to see Jerry

1764
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:18,510
in a funny movie, and then you want
to see him just do a solo,

1765
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:20,486
'cause he's that good.

1766
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:23,456
(orchestra playing jazz)

1767
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:52,047
(trombone solo playing)

1768
01:35:04,598 --> 01:35:06,395
(trumpet solo playing)

1769
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:13,531
(music finishes)

1770
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:17,344
I did take one... print it.

1771
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,312
See what happened

1772
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:23,305
<i>September the 4th, 1976,</i>

1773
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,251
that created the most talk

1774
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:27,982
in the world of television.

1775
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,421
(studio applause)

1776
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,654
I have a friend who loves
what you do every year.

1777
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:35,719
Arthur Forrest: This is quite a story
that almost nobody knows.

1778
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,129
<i>It was 1976.</i>

1779
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:40,793
And the phone rang.
It's Frank Sinatra.

1780
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:43,269
He said, "If I was to bring Dean
on the show,

1781
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,067
how do you think
he'd react?"

1782
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:48,701
And I said, "I think he would
react marvelously."

1783
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,234
And they hadn't really
reconciled yet.

1784
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:54,509
Forrest: And he says, "I've arranged it.
He wants to do the show."

1785
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:57,016
We didn't tell anybody
because we knew

1786
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:59,417
if it leaked out,
I would be a dead man.

1787
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:03,014
They said, "He'd come up
in a limo with seven or eight people

1788
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:06,549
and Dean would be one of them
with a raincoat and a hat and glasses."

1789
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:10,621
I said, "When Frank comes out,
make sure all the stations down the line

1790
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,154
record his appearance.

1791
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:14,667
Get all the PR people you can
in the audience.

1792
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,795
It's gonna be a big story."
They said, "What is it?"

1793
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:18,498
I said, "I can't tell you,
but just trust me."

1794
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:20,404
Sinatra: Just tell him out there
to come in.

1795
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,672
(cheering and applause)

1796
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:27,704
Jerry Lewis: We would meet
for the first time in 20 years

1797
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:29,739
only because of the stupidity

1798
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,651
of when people
get highly emotional.

1799
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:35,553
And we both felt badly
about that.

1800
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:39,915
And I'm looking,
and I went,

1801
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,451
"Oh my gosh,
that's Dad walking out,"

1802
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,487
'cause I could tell his walk.

1803
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:47,330
And then when I saw his face
and I saw Jerry's face

1804
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,700
and they hugged...

1805
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:56,035
<i>Chris Lewis: That scream that came out
of that audience of 750 people...</i>

1806
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,510
<i>I mean, it sounded like
750,000 people.</i>

1807
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:00,810
It was just amazing.

1808
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:07,644
Jerry Lewis: People love to know
that love prevails.

1809
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:09,622
So how have you been?

1810
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,648
(laughter)

1811
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,924
Jerry Lewis:
And they went their separate ways.

1812
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,430
They didn't see one another.
And then they got back.

1813
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:19,864
And when they kissed and hugged
at that last moment,

1814
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,060
it was worth all of that.

1815
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:23,433
We haven't seen each other
for 20 years.

1816
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,732
(laughs) Yeah.

1817
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,332
Well, you know, there was all those
rumors about our breaking up,

1818
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:30,366
and then when I started the show
and you weren't here, I believed it.

1819
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:34,177
Everybody was just dumbfounded.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

1820
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:36,206
So you're working?

1821
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,912
(laughter and applause)

1822
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:42,782
I love your movies.

1823
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:45,553
You're, like, the only thing
my parents and I can agree on.

1824
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:47,493
What did you think
of the Eddie Murphy movie...

1825
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:49,223
"The Nutty Professor" movie?

1826
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:51,197
I produced it.
What do you think I thought of it?

1827
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:54,099
After you cashed the check,
what did you think of it?

1828
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:58,833
It was my financial pleasure,
I guarantee you.

1829
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,273
(laughs)

1830
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:04,471
As a filmmaker,
I've been inspired by Jerry.

1831
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:07,674
And one of my favorite movies
of all time

1832
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,307
growing up
was "The Nutty Professor."

1833
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,977
When I got the chance
to do that again,

1834
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:13,748
that was like,
"This has to be incredible."

1835
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:15,880
Because of my love for this man,
this artist,

1836
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:19,757
it was like, "There's no way we'll do
this movie and not, you know, crush it."

1837
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:22,591
He was able to look
at Jekyll and Hyde

1838
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,121
and see that,
hey, that's funny

1839
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:27,929
that you could be this double life
and all that whole stuff.

1840
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,835
That's what's really brilliant
about "The Nutty Professor."

1841
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,365
John Landis: I thought
Eddie was extraordinary.

1842
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,536
I thought his character
as Sherman Klump

1843
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:40,138
was an absolutely extraordinary
character, and sweet.

1844
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:42,740
Murphy: That's another thing
that's pioneered by Jerry...

1845
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,774
mixing sweet and funny.

1846
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:47,309
You don't see that
until Jerry Lewis.

1847
01:38:47,354 --> 01:38:49,185
You see funny

1848
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:51,817
and you see madcap
and you see slapstick,

1849
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:55,522
but a character really
sweet and funny... that's Jerry.

1850
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:17,711
You can't do comedy
unless you know drama.

1851
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:20,219
I mean, comedy is...

1852
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:23,587
is the satire of reality.

1853
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:27,390
And you can't be funny
unless you know what the reality is.

1854
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,589
He mastered that very early.

1855
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,621
You may not believe this,

1856
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:34,566
but I was a very homely child.

1857
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:36,592
(laughter)

1858
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,901
Burnett: He was amazing...
amazing to work with.

1859
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:41,499
Really?

1860
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:45,842
Yes. My father suggested
plastic surgery.

1861
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:48,439
Oh, yeah?
When are you gonna have it?

1862
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:52,350
(laughs)

1863
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:56,050
I had it already.

1864
01:39:57,091 --> 01:40:00,720
They did a very unusual job.

1865
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:03,355
Burnett: A lot of clowns
can do straight stuff.

1866
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:05,524
I loved him
in "King of Comedy."

1867
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:08,729
You go that far out...
it's easier to bring it back in.

1868
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:10,794
(crowd clamoring)
Jerry! Jerry!

1869
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,466
Jerry Lewis: I am fortunate
I crossed over

1870
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:16,635
as strongly as you can
in "The King of Comedy."

1871
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,614
If you are equipped
to do physical, wild craziness

1872
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:23,445
as I have and do...

1873
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:25,475
I love... argh!

1874
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,111
Oh, l...

1875
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:32,717
...with it comes
an authoritative figure

1876
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,751
that comes from down deep

1877
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:39,164
that can now play it
as dramatically as you please.

1878
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,225
The pressure, the ratings,

1879
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:45,500
the same guests,
the same questions...

1880
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,099
I'm just not enjoying it
anymore.

1881
01:40:48,142 --> 01:40:52,101
I got more critical acclaim
from that film

1882
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:55,411
that I did for any of the work
that I did in my whole life.

1883
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,179
Critics acclaiming, acclaiming,
"Oh, he was this,"

1884
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:00,846
and I'm thinking to myself,
"You schmuck,

1885
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,585
do you realize I showed up and
I just read the words and went home?"

1886
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:08,026
I mean, I didn't have to do anything.
I had to be me.

1887
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,053
Crystal: Maybe the best
performance he gave

1888
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:12,759
was "King of Comedy,"
you know, as a serious actor.

1889
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,030
That was harnessing him
in a different way.

1890
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,559
That was another side
of Jerry.

1891
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:19,231
Oh, he was great in it.
And he embraced who he was.

1892
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,434
And he... you know,

1893
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:24,103
it wasn't the Jerry that we knew.
He was a different guy.

1894
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:27,113
You listen to my stuff for 15 minutes,
that's all. Is that asking too much?

1895
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,411
Yes, it is.
I have a life, okay?

1896
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:32,681
- Well, I have a life too.
- That's not my responsibility.

1897
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,710
Well, it is when you tell me
to call you and then you don't...

1898
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:37,155
I told you to call
to get rid of you.

1899
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:40,854
In the Scorsese film
he's more of a leading man

1900
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:43,454
than he ever was in any film,
and he was older.

1901
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,488
This is a leading man?

1902
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:47,727
Well, actually I was just
mixing these

1903
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,259
so that we could try
using it on the skin.

1904
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:53,034
You wonder, what kind of career
would Lewis have had

1905
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:56,065
if he decided
he wanted to play

1906
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,136
really kind of straightforward,
good-looking leading man.

1907
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:01,170
Lewis could have done that.

1908
01:42:01,215 --> 01:42:03,740
- (applause)
- You're very wise.

1909
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,775
(laughter)

1910
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:08,788
Now if you'll just hold it a second,
I'll thrill you some more.

1911
01:42:08,822 --> 01:42:11,347
Seinfeld: He came up with
the character of Buddy Love.

1912
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:13,916
He wanted to take
the worst qualities

1913
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:16,259
of the worst people
he had ever met

1914
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:21,063
and make them into this
very unsympathetic character.

1915
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:24,730
You rude, discourteous
egomaniac.

1916
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:27,467
You're crazy about me, right?
And I can understand it.

1917
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,999
Only this morning,
looking in the mirror before shaving,

1918
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:33,672
I enjoyed seeing what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.

1919
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:35,841
(kisses)
Have some, baby?

1920
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:37,874
Seinfeld: And he was
shocked to find

1921
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:40,887
that a lot of young people
loved Buddy Love.

1922
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:44,516
Thank you, kiddies. You're all
very, very nice little boys and girls.

1923
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:47,391
Seinfeld:
Jerry is incapable

1924
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:51,488
of not putting love

1925
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,523
into everything he does.

1926
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:56,798
Buddy Love, as mean
as he tried to play him...

1927
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:58,532
That's good for you.

1928
01:42:58,572 --> 01:43:02,201
Buddy Love is loveable,
as much as he wanted him not to be.

1929
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:04,506
Harrelson: If you didn't know
it was Jerry Lewis

1930
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,479
and you just met
both of those guys,

1931
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:09,073
you wouldn't know
that it was the same person.

1932
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:11,710
So it's amazing
how he created

1933
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:14,312
those two completely
distinct characters.

1934
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:18,552
I don't want to be
something that I'm not.

1935
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:21,254
I didn't like
being someone else.

1936
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:24,264
He's just a guy who truly
understands the material

1937
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:27,392
and he can just go to the depth
that he needs to go

1938
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:30,494
to make it really, you know,

1939
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:32,767
touching and emotional.

1940
01:43:32,806 --> 01:43:35,604
(sighs)

1941
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:38,042
You might as well like yourself.

1942
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:44,842
Just think about all the time
you're gonna have to spend with you.

1943
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,648
He probably could have made
a lot of films

1944
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:48,951
that he didn't make.
He's that talented.

1945
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:52,550
Scott Lewis: In 1995,
when he did "Damn Yankees,"

1946
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:54,584
it was just about the most
exciting thing

1947
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:57,620
I can ever remember
my dad doing in his career.

1948
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,962
Chris Lewis: I was there
for opening night on Broadway.

1949
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,561
And I was in a number of cities
with him around the country.

1950
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:06,573
It's such a great experience
for him.

1951
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:08,837
<i>People would say to me,
"Your dad is 70 years old</i>

1952
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:10,866
and he's doing
eight shows a week, my God."

1953
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,902
I said, "Are you kidding?
He would pay

1954
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:15,244
to get eight standing ovations
a week."

1955
01:44:15,282 --> 01:44:17,546
With the collaboration
of people onstage,

1956
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:21,145
it becomes a family.
And that's his ideal situation.

1957
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:24,089
That's perpetual motion for him.
It will keep him going,

1958
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:26,183
you know, with fuel
forever and ever and ever.

1959
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:28,592
Crystal: I saw him
in "Damn Yankees."

1960
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:31,564
The Devil has a big song called
"Those Were the Good Old Days."

1961
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:35,364
But when Jerry does it,
it becomes 25 minutes long.

1962
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:38,235
Suddenly he's doing
this cane thing.

1963
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,263
It has nothing to do
with "Damn Yankees."

1964
01:44:40,307 --> 01:44:42,639
"Throw me a cane.

1965
01:44:42,676 --> 01:44:45,338
A cane for..."
And the canes are flying.

1966
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,643
And suddenly you're in...
it's burlesque

1967
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,581
and you might as well
be seeing Chaplin.

1968
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:52,278
Sit there and enjoy for 20 minutes
the genius of a guy

1969
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,413
who, you know, is one of the few
who can do this.

1970
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,821
So I went backstage

1971
01:44:57,858 --> 01:44:59,849
and I just looked at him
and I went,

1972
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:01,884
"The canes."

1973
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,089
And he just... he said,
"I know. I know.

1974
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:06,533
What can you do?
You have to. I got to."

1975
01:45:08,835 --> 01:45:11,770
"Paris Match" one,
"Paris Match" two...

1976
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,898
- very glad to see you.
- "Paris Match" three...

1977
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,703
(Jerry Lewis narrating)
"Time" Magazine ran

1978
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:18,870
"The Most Popular People In the World
By Appearance,"

1979
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:22,279
and one was the president,
two was Muhammad Ali...

1980
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:24,614
Jerry Lewis: How are you?
Where do you want me? Let's go.

1981
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:26,642
(narrating)
...three was Mao Tse-tung,

1982
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:30,282
and four was the Pope
and Jerry Lewis, who tied.

1983
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:33,350
The year after that,
I made four by myself.

1984
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:35,725
It was very nice.

1985
01:45:35,762 --> 01:45:39,289
This wouldn't get printed
right here.

1986
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,324
(man laughs)

1987
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:43,666
You gotta go here.
Yeah.

1988
01:45:43,704 --> 01:45:46,138
Man: Yeah, that's perfect.
You should act like that.

1989
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,869
Oh, you like that?
Here, grab that. How's that?

1990
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:52,606
(mumbles)

1991
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:01,252
Are you finished?
I'm through.

1992
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:03,415
(laughing)

1993
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:07,024
Man: Can I have
a little bit more?

1994
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:11,459
Man: We're lost
in translation now.

1995
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,022
Hello.

1996
01:46:13,066 --> 01:46:15,762
(screams)

1997
01:46:15,802 --> 01:46:17,429
(trombone playing)

1998
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:21,167
"The Nutty Professor" inspired

1999
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,768
everything I did afterwards,
as far as my career.

2000
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:26,142
"The Nutty Professor"
is his baby.

2001
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:29,239
Jerry is actually going to be
directing it on Broadway.

2002
01:46:29,282 --> 01:46:31,409
He said, "I want you
to play that character."

2003
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,851
Jerry Lewis: Marvin Hamlisch
and Rupert Holmes

2004
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,878
have written
12 numbers already.

2005
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:38,049
I'm gonna be the Jewish
George Abbott.

2006
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:41,788
He directed his last show
when he was 99.

2007
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:45,127
- (camera shutters clicking)
- Jerry Lewis: It's very interesting,

2008
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:48,999
because of all of the work
and all of the silliness

2009
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:52,198
that made children laugh

2010
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:55,640
that come to me now and say,

2011
01:46:55,675 --> 01:46:58,143
"I've grown up with you."

2012
01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:00,544
What they're saying is,

2013
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:03,310
"I'm not coming to you as the adult

2014
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,750
to proclaim this.

2015
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:09,222
I come to you as the child
that recognizes

2016
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:11,451
the child that did it."

2017
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:15,689
Harrelson: There's something
that came through about him

2018
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:19,062
that made America and the world
fall in love with him.

2019
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:22,068
And it's just that he has
this incredible

2020
01:47:22,102 --> 01:47:24,332
childlike brilliance.

2021
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:27,340
I let you talk me into this ridiculous
chair because I felt sorry for you.

2022
01:47:27,374 --> 01:47:29,239
- Now just open there.
- Look, I don't need this.

2023
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:31,039
- Oh, there.
- You missed. You missed.

2024
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:33,545
- No, you missed now, Herbert.
- You missed.

2025
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:37,676
Jerry Lewis: People want
to make contact with someone

2026
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:41,414
that advanced their childhood
through humor,

2027
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:44,049
and it's a very special thing.

2028
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:47,082
It gives me the kind of energy

2029
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,095
to come forward and do more.

2030
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:52,292
Generation after generation
is rediscovering, rediscovering him.

2031
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:54,892
When they see him,
they become the 10-year-old

2032
01:47:54,935 --> 01:47:56,926
that they were
the first time they saw him.

2033
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:59,598
Jerry Lewis:
Most of my audience was six

2034
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,039
and eight and 11

2035
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:04,839
when I exploded on the scene.

2036
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:07,506
And now they got children
who have children

2037
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:09,538
who want to see Jerry.

2038
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:13,314
(laughter and applause)

2039
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:16,914
Tarantino: As far as like his fan base,
that required children

2040
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:19,482
to be renewed and get involved
in Jerry Lewis movies.

2041
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,653
And that happened
for a long, long, long time.

2042
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:23,856
Richard Lewis:
Worldwide, children,

2043
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:26,331
no matter what language
they spoke, they got him.

2044
01:48:26,366 --> 01:48:28,834
You know, you try to find
a comedian

2045
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:31,997
who can, you know,
score in Iceland

2046
01:48:32,038 --> 01:48:34,199
and then do a nightclub date
in Brooklyn.

2047
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:35,902
Not happening, man.

2048
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:37,136
Oh...

2049
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,577
Burnett: They don't even have
to know what he's saying.

2050
01:48:39,613 --> 01:48:42,138
It's in his face.
It's in his body.

2051
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,912
It's in everything that he...
he's just...

2052
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:47,044
he's just funny.

2053
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:53,185
Harrelson: What's cool to me is,
I was getting ready to go to bed

2054
01:48:53,226 --> 01:48:56,593
and my daughter says,
"You want to watch a movie, Daddy?"

2055
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,098
"I guess I could watch
something.

2056
01:48:59,132 --> 01:49:01,259
What do you want to watch?"

2057
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:03,462
She said, "Can we watch
a Jerry movie?"

2058
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:09,436
Hey!

2059
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:11,808
"Can we watch Jerry Lewis?"

2060
01:49:11,845 --> 01:49:13,938
I was like, "You bet we can."

2061
01:49:18,451 --> 01:49:20,578
(blows air)

2062
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,612
There's not one film
that Jerry Lewis has

2063
01:49:23,657 --> 01:49:26,387
that a grandkid cannot watch.
He can watch all of his stuff

2064
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:28,656
just like you watched it then.
And it's funny

2065
01:49:28,695 --> 01:49:30,686
just like it was back then.

2066
01:49:36,536 --> 01:49:38,527
It's timeless.

2067
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,541
And it's accessible
family entertainment

2068
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:43,475
forever, forever and ever.

2069
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,308
Crystal: If you look at those
homo sapiens things...

2070
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:48,507
it's a monkey,
then it's a guy walking this way...

2071
01:49:48,548 --> 01:49:50,539
if it was comedy,

2072
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:52,575
it would be circus clowns

2073
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:55,611
and then it would be
the court jesters.

2074
01:49:55,655 --> 01:49:57,646
And then it starts to...

2075
01:49:57,691 --> 01:50:00,057
there's this guy walking,
and it's Charlie Chaplin.

2076
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:02,425
Then it's Harold Lloyd.
Then it's Keaton.

2077
01:50:02,462 --> 01:50:06,489
And then there's Jerry
and he's walking on his ankles.

2078
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:09,058
He's just one of the great
comedy directors,

2079
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:12,833
you know, not only of his era
but of all time.

2080
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:14,863
Murphy: You can see
his influence

2081
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:17,672
on a couple of different generations
of people, you know,

2082
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:20,236
and not just as a comic
but as a filmmaker.

2083
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,612
You see his impact
all over the place.

2084
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:25,015
(jazz orchestra playing)

2085
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:35,486
Alec Baldwin: Everybody
that's made comedy

2086
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:39,521
for the last 30 years or so...

2087
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:41,659
they have a debt to Lewis

2088
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:44,363
and what he did.

2089
01:50:44,404 --> 01:50:46,895
(French accent)
Are you the father of Jim Carrey?

2090
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:50,034
I banged his mother
many years ago.

2091
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:52,408
Landis:
And he's got this legacy...

2092
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:54,743
his films
and his television shows.

2093
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:57,079
What's incredible
about Jerry Lewis

2094
01:50:57,117 --> 01:51:00,575
is how long he's been
in the public eye.

2095
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,611
The only true test is time.

2096
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,420
And, you know, people are
still watching Jerry's pictures.

2097
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:08,086
Thank you.

2098
01:51:08,128 --> 01:51:09,891
Murphy: Who's done that,
an 80-year run?

2099
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:12,056
Has anyone done that?
That has to be some kind of record.

2100
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:15,590
Chase: We all know
who Jerry Lewis is in some way.

2101
01:51:15,635 --> 01:51:18,468
We know that he's
a serious man.

2102
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,996
He's accomplished
a great deal.

2103
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,032
I'm not saying
he's the greatest human.

2104
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:25,101
I'm not comparing him
to FDR.

2105
01:51:25,145 --> 01:51:28,012
Eleanor... maybe.

2106
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:31,882
Baldwin: He really is
the Marlon Brando of comedy films.

2107
01:51:31,918 --> 01:51:33,818
He's the Marlon Brando.

2108
01:51:33,853 --> 01:51:35,980
Where everyone apes Brando,

2109
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,751
everybody apes Jerry.

2110
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:39,486
- What?
- Lady!

2111
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,687
- Herman.
- Hey, lady!

2112
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:43,753
- Herman.
- Hey, lady.

2113
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:46,891
- He-hey!
- Classic, classic.

2114
01:51:46,933 --> 01:51:49,766
Seinfeld:
It's hard to be silly

2115
01:51:49,803 --> 01:51:51,896
in a way that makes
people laugh.

2116
01:51:51,938 --> 01:51:54,406
Being silly is like...

2117
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:56,432
is like being
an astrophysicist.

2118
01:51:56,476 --> 01:52:00,207
You have to be
incredibly sophisticated

2119
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:02,237
to be silly.

2120
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:04,773
Some people look at Jerry Lewis
and don't understand

2121
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:07,616
that what he's doing
is extremely sophisticated

2122
01:52:07,654 --> 01:52:09,451
at its silliest.

2123
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:12,014
There he is.

2124
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:14,492
Do you think I should do
the whole body?

2125
01:52:14,527 --> 01:52:16,518
Belzer:
He's from another planet.

2126
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,656
It's very hard
for anyone, I think,

2127
01:52:18,698 --> 01:52:21,531
to totally understand
Jerry Lewis

2128
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,900
in the entirety
of who he is as a man,

2129
01:52:23,937 --> 01:52:25,495
who he is as an artist,

2130
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:28,098
who he is as an industry,
as a philanthropist.

2131
01:52:28,141 --> 01:52:30,609
I mean, he's like a mountain.

2132
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:33,373
Some people get caught
in the foothills of him,

2133
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:35,506
but you have to really
scale the peaks

2134
01:52:35,548 --> 01:52:38,711
to truly appreciate
the phenomenon of Jerry Lewis.

2135
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:44,315
Oh-hh!

2136
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:46,325
I'm infinitely grateful

2137
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:49,157
and I plan to live
another 16 years

2138
01:52:49,195 --> 01:52:52,289
- so I beat Burns.
- (laughter)

2139
01:52:52,332 --> 01:52:54,823
I gotta beat Burns.

2140
01:52:54,868 --> 01:52:57,928
I just put my daughter
in college,

2141
01:52:57,971 --> 01:53:00,997
so I have to wait four years
for that to work.

2142
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,066
But then I'm gonna have her meet
a very nice young man.

2143
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:07,136
And then she's gonna get married.
I'm gonna walk down the aisle with her.

2144
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,842
And then I'm gonna be
in the hospital to see the baby.

2145
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:11,874
- (laughter)
- So that's my plan

2146
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:15,183
for the next 16 years.
And I hope you'll all join me.

2147
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:16,813
Thank you so much.

2148
01:53:16,856 --> 01:53:19,347
I think Jerry Lewis's legacy

2149
01:53:19,392 --> 01:53:21,383
will simply be the familiarity,

2150
01:53:21,427 --> 01:53:25,295
the household familiarity
of the name Jerry Lewis.

2151
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:28,323
I think that says it all
and will always say it all...

Jerry Lewis.

2153
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:32,761
Jerry Lewis:
Audiences will look at me

2154
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,797
and I will say, "I'm blessed.

2155
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:37,173
What I have been able
to do with my life

2156
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:39,576
has been extraordinary.

2157
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:41,910
But until I leave here tonight,

2158
01:53:41,948 --> 01:53:44,542
I haven't done it all."

2159
01:53:44,584 --> 01:53:46,575
I know what my dad
taught me...

2160
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:49,713
"Go out to do one thing...
sweat."

2161
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:53,317
- Man: Should we start the intro?
- Yeah.

2162
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:57,557
(narrating) "Get them to laugh.
That's your job... sweat."

2163
01:53:57,597 --> 01:54:00,031
See ya, kids.

2164
01:54:00,066 --> 01:54:02,057
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

2165
