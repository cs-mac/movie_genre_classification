1
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,964
I believe-
I truthfully believe

2
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,033
that reality television
has saved television.

3
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:31,437
I- I-you know,
actors, writers,

4
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:33,239
producers, directors,
agents,

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,665
we all aspire to
the truth, you know.

6
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:38,310
And what greater truth
is there than reality?

7
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:40,228
Even when it's scripted.

00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:23,371
<i>Look at these one-touch passes.</i>

40
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:36,835
<i>There's no doubt
Vance Carhartt is the stick</i>

41
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:37,969
<i>that stirs the diggers' drink
this season.</i>

42
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,371
Yeah! Oh!

43
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,240
Okay, tell me how excited you are

44
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,642
about the diggers possibly
going to the finals.

45
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,527
To see this town go far,
it's just-

46
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,162
<i>it's the most amazing
feeling in the world</i>

47
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,331
<i>and we have such
an amazing team.</i>

48
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:52,617
We are just so blessed
by Jesus Christ,

49
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,001
<i>and I know that he</i>

50
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,803
really wants us
to win state.

51
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,054
Um, I'm gonna change
gears a little bit.

52
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,956
You're friends
with Jaynie Hansen.

53
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:00,157
Have you spoken to her

54
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,360
since her father
was released from prison?

55
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,745
Um...

56
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,050
I don't think I'm supposed
to talk about that.

57
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:15,505
Erin, let's wrap this up.

58
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,508
I have to go now.

59
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,433
I'm telling you there's
something off, Lee.

60
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,101
These people aren't
as clueless as you think.

61
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,003
They've got
good bullshit detectors.

62
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,422
Now if-

63
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,757
make that when they find out
what we're up to,

64
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,226
there's gonna be
hell to pay.

65
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,094
<i>Hey, Ted.
- What?</i>

66
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,264
When Blanca gets here,
you might not wanna act

67
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,333
like such a limp dick
little douche.

68
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:44,968
She'll walk all over you.

69
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,689
Ted just couldn't
handle her, you know?

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,592
He was just
a little-a little wimpy,

71
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,660
and Lee let him have it,
so he had to go.

72
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:54,960
Ugh.

73
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,229
Yes, I fired Ted,

74
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,331
if that's what
you want to know.

75
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,000
I told him he could
finish out the week.

76
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,369
It gave me a few days
to find his replacement.

77
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,125
This is Margo Moorehead
reporting live

78
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,793
outside the Culver City
Courthouse,

79
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,462
where it looks like
even more bad news

80
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,662
for Blanca Champion.

81
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,530
On the heels of her
well-publicized

82
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,899
bout with exhaustion

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,001
come allegations
of assault and battery

84
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,303
from John Jordan,
a production assistant

85
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,472
<i>on the set of hew new movie
Hush Hush.</i>

86
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,808
As expected,
Jordan filed suit today

87
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,310
against Champion
and Affiliated Studios.

88
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,946
Allegedly Champion found
the green tea latte

89
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:34,466
delivered to her trailer
by Jordan not to her liking.

90
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,852
That's when sources say
Champion proceeded

91
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,838
to hurl the scolding hot
drink at Jordan

92
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,958
causing second degree burns
from his torso,

93
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:45,076
well, down to his
more delicate regions.

94
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,344
In a statement released
this morning,

95
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:49,280
Champion swears the beverage
was only lukewarm,

96
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,015
<i>which is indeed why she
threw it at him</i>

97
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,283
<i>in the first place.</i>

98
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,118
<i>This is Margo
reporting live-</i>

99
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,487
Hey.

100
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,788
<i>Wait, John, where exactly
were you burned?</i>

101
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,956
<i>Can you show us again?
- John, just one question.</i>

102
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,425
I, uh, I was
starting to think

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,493
that I'd never work again.

104
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,595
Oh, stop it, stop it.
Come on.

105
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,798
All right, I'm excited.
Tell me about this job.

106
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,066
I'm serious, okay,
it's a great concept

107
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,334
for a reality show.

108
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,103
Now picture this.
A small border town.

109
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:15,139
The high school hockey team
on a 100-year losing streak

110
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,908
winds up with a star forward

111
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,759
for the first time
in the school's history,

112
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,328
and they got a shot
at the State Championship.

113
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,863
Production's running
a little bit behind.

114
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,097
They need
a solid director,

115
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,598
and I told them
you're the guy.

116
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,435
Underdog sports team.
Kid makes good.

117
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:28,853
I like it.
I knew it, I knew it!

118
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,371
Now get this.

119
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:31,973
The team's called
the Gold Diggers.

120
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,340
They're from this
tiny little town

121
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,842
called White Plains
in North Dakota.

122
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,610
They're gonna-
North Dakota?

123
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,945
Oh, wow.

124
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,414
Uh, border town kind of
makes it sound like Mexico.

125
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,518
Uh, I don't know, Seaton.
I'm from San Diego.

126
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,336
I think I might freeze
my ass off.

127
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,253
Two words, Jake-
global warming.

128
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,539
My assistant
looked it up online.

129
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,540
It's like Cabo
up there right now.

130
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,774
Ohh.

131
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,926
When did you say
your condo payment was due?

132
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,998
Okay, look, I know
back on the ranch

133
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,333
getting cancelled
like that as tough on you.

134
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,368
I know, I get it, okay?
Now get over it.

135
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,404
This will boost
your confidence.

136
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:04,871
And besides, the network
would really consider

137
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:06,740
this one a favor.

138
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,242
And actually,
there's one more thing.

139
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,944
What?

140
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,146
Blanca Champion is
gonna be up there with you.

141
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:17,700
Blanca Champion?

142
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:18,669
You're joking, right?

143
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:19,887
I never joke

144
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,288
when there's a commission
involved, Jake.

145
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,456
Her next movie is with
the network's film division,

146
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,591
and she's playing
a reality television director

147
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,593
who uncovers some
major political scandal.

148
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:28,861
I haven't
read the script yet.

149
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,062
She wants to do
the whole method thing.

150
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,031
You know, be taken
seriously as an actress.

151
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,033
And since you and Blanca
work so well together,

152
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,801
the network thought
that she could observe you.

153
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,136
Work well together?

154
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,104
Seaton, I was
her production assistant

155
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,205
on her first movie.

156
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,440
I was
a glorified babysitter.

157
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,508
I doubt
she even remembers me.

158
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,892
Well, she guess what?

159
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:44,961
Now only does
she remember you,

160
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,195
she loves, loves,
loves the idea.

161
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,897
She said this time around
she could be your P.A.

162
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,249
Besides, with all
the bad publicity

163
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,317
she's been getting lately,

164
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:54,070
she could use
a little babysitting.

165
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:56,505
Seaton, let me
get this straight.

166
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,642
You want me to go
to a remote town

167
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,219
in a red state
that borders Canada

168
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,695
with Blanca Champion
pretending

169
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,264
to fetch people coffee?

170
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,215
Wait, Seaton,
that's ridiculous.

171
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,499
I'm not that broke.

172
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,301
And to be honest with you,
life is too short.

173
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,203
And how's it even possible?

174
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,370
You know what it's like
going out in public with her.

175
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,504
She draws crowds
like the Beatles.

176
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,907
No, no, no.
That's the beauty, Jake.

177
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,476
The townspeople have signed
non-disclosure agreements.

178
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,178
You and Blanca are gonna be
in the middle of nowhere.

179
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,047
Only studio publicity
knows about it.

180
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,015
And by the time the world
press gets wind of it,

181
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,483
your show will be wrapped.

182
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,551
And best of all,
they're gonna pay your rate.

183
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:27,752
Yeah, huh!
Yeah, you're welcome.

184
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,253
And besides,
getting out of town

185
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,689
might help you
get over the break-up too.

186
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,890
Thanks for going
there, Seaton.

187
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,257
Oh, come on, Jake.

188
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,860
<i>If my fiancee left me for some
dip-shit kid from survivor,</i>

189
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,228
I'd jump at the chance
to get out of town.

190
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,433
Can I bring my dog?

191
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:43,935
Yeah, I thought this would
be a great thing for Jake.

192
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,187
You know,
when your personal life

193
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,354
starts going to hell,

194
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:48,323
work really is
the best antidote.

195
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,694
My name is Nik,
and I am a P.A.

196
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:55,814
<i>on the show, uh,
Digger Fever.</i>

197
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:58,883
White Plains
is the kind of city

198
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,902
that people in Middle America
make fun of.

199
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:04,071
I know that there's
little kids operating machinery.

200
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,806
Uh, like, five-year-olds.

201
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,474
This is-this is
a really small town.

202
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:08,575
You know, there's-

203
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:11,312
it's-it's bizarre,
and, um,

204
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,813
that's just
the way they live.

205
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:13,948
They catch their food.

206
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,083
They hunt it,
they cook it, they eat it.

207
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:19,270
<i>You've gotta
hand it to coach Ty Carhartt</i>

208
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,004
<i>for breaking this team's
long-running losing streak,</i>

209
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:24,658
and turning this team
into real contenders for State.

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,077
All right, well,
that's all of it, Jaynie.

211
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:26,727
You better get home,

212
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:27,811
or your mom's
gonna kill me.

213
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,713
<i>And remember-</i>

214
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:30,898
I know, I know.
Vance wasn't here.

215
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,532
Right.
Thanks.

216
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:33,667
<i>Bye, Vance.
Great game tonight.</i>

217
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:34,668
Bye, kidlet.

218
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:37,370
Well, I'm gonna go up
and try tweaking the dish.

219
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:40,474
I'll see if we can
get some reception.

220
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:43,611
Um, babe,
I know it's weird,

221
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:45,779
but are you sure
you're okay?

222
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,247
I mean, with his
release and everything?

223
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:49,316
I'm okay.

224
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,117
Some dads give interviews
to Fox Sports,

225
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:54,220
and some give them
to parole boards.

226
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:01,293
If the way that crew guy
checked you out today

227
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,663
is any indicator,
when the show hits the air,

228
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,815
you're gonna be
the next Blanca Champion, baby.

229
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,933
Vance.

230
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:11,103
She's skanky,
and blonde, and rich.

231
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,338
We have nothing
in common.

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,673
Whoa.
Not true.

233
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:16,576
You both have
smokin' hot little booties.

234
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:18,545
Is that the only reason you date me?
- Yes.

235
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,783
And the fact it really
pisses off my dad.

236
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,553
Come on.
We have to close up.

237
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:28,387
Then I can focus
all my attention on you.

238
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:31,825
Go fix the dish while I turn
out the lights on the trails.

239
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,292
Okay, Roger that.

240
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,027
I can get the lights too.
Just finish up in here.

241
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,162
Really.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

242
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,196
I'll do it.

243
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:39,998
It'll take two minutes.

244
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,700
Hurry, please.

245
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,543
Couldn't wait, huh?

246
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,582
Very funny, Vance.

247
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,901
Come on, you know
I hate this shit.

248
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,936
Vance?

249
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,870
Come on, Vance.

250
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,424
Oh.

251
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:31,516
The way that girl died
is just-I don't know,

252
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,051
in any other town,
it would-

253
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:34,536
it would raise
a red flag.

254
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,187
And everybody here is just
kind of going about

255
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,623
their day-to-day business.

256
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,691
Nobody's thinking about it
like it's a big deal.

257
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:47,966
What do I think about the amount
of accidents in this town?

258
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,869
Um, I think it's a shame to
happen to all the pretty people.

259
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,471
I'm just kidding, that's-
that's not even funny.

260
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,472
That's inappropriate, sorry.

261
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,348
# I'm dangerous #

262
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,116
# dangerous # #

263
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,555
There you go, buddy.
How you doin', buddy?

264
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,825
I missed you.
Yeah, I missed you.

265
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,026
Hey, you must be Jake.

266
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,028
I'm Greg,
the production's U.P.M.

267
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,596
Hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

268
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:19,731
How was your flight?

269
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,099
Uh, it was good.

270
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,266
It was
a little windy.

271
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,668
Always like that
around here?

272
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,436
Pretty much.
Welcome to the north woods.

273
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:27,304
You ready to go?
Yeah.

274
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:30,908
<i>It's about a six-hour
drive to White Plains from here.</i>

275
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,394
I was surprised there was no
other crew on the plane with me.

276
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:36,280
Most of the crew arrived
the Monday before last.

277
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:39,417
It's been pretty intense here
with all that's happened.

278
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,018
Why, what's happened?

279
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,170
One of the local girls
just got killed

280
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:44,772
<i>in an ATV accident.</i>

281
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:47,073
<i>Townfolk pretty much
freaked out</i>

282
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,675
when Ted,
our first director,

283
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,844
tried to get exclusive
with them about it.

284
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,245
Wait.

285
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,980
Ted, your first director?

286
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,448
So I'm-
I'm replacing him?

287
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,551
Dude, those agent types
aren't too big

288
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,120
<i>on full disclosure,
are they?</i>

289
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:02,455
I generally tell my clients
what they need to know.

290
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:06,793
And Jake needed a job,
and, um-and he got it.

291
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,405
Shit.

292
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:41,393
Hello?

293
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:52,237
<i>Is there somebody
down there?</i>

294
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:55,391
<i>We're taking a poll this morning</i>

295
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,626
<i>on Good Morning White Plains,
with Bob Hansen.</i>

296
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,897
Hey, dude.
You're up.

297
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,108
Hey, man.

298
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,013
<i>Jake, this intersection's
a good landmark.</i>

299
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:21,249
<i>It's exactly 39 Miles
from your cabin.</i>

300
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,184
<i>The Mini-mart
on the right's</i>

301
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:25,036
<i>where we do most
of our shopping.</i>

302
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,120
Is this the place?

303
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,855
<i>Yeah, almost.</i>

304
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,958
<i>It's about another
mile and a half down this road.</i>

305
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,252
<i>They're summer homes, mostly.</i>

306
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:00,337
We tried to find
three together,

307
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:03,273
but no such luck.

308
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,142
Well, the second door
on the right's

309
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,911
your bedroom.

310
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:08,212
You're sharing
this place with Lee,

311
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:10,264
our executive producer.

312
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:16,953
<i>Did you-did you
just see that?</i>

313
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,756
<i>I think I just
saw a guy</i>

314
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:22,109
Standing out there
with a mask.

315
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,228
Dude, you've been up what,
like, 20 hours?

316
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,647
We're in the boonies, bro.

317
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,566
Oh, by the way.

318
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,951
Lee wants to meet you
in an hour at the local diner

319
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,269
for a production meeting.

320
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,104
Uh, okay.

321
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,473
Um, so it's just
me and Lee here?

322
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,308
Is he here
right now?

323
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,976
<i>Yeah, uh, she,
and no.</i>

324
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,746
She's actually sleeping at one
of the other crew cabins,

325
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,481
but we're not supposed
to know about that.

326
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:46,667
We could talk
about that later.

327
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,584
Got map and directions.

328
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,253
And keys.

329
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:52,739
Peace out, brother.

330
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:00,179
Bongo, what did I just

331
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,498
get us into?

332
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,774
I- I can't.

333
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,508
You're gonna have
to speak up.

334
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,612
I can't hear you.

335
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,650
Hello?

336
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,602
Sit.

337
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,972
Oh, piece of crap.

338
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,841
You must be Jake.
I'm Phoebe, Lee's assistant.

339
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,442
We're totally
excited you're here.

340
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,645
Jake, I'm Lee Tyson,
the show's producer.

341
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,813
Thank you
for getting here so quick.

342
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,014
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

343
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,317
Hey, it's too bad your
last show got canceled.

344
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,386
But their loss is our gain.
Am I right?

345
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,588
And you get
your very own

346
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,906
celebrity P.A.

347
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,308
Blanca Champion, ooh-
God bless her.

348
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,027
She has got
some beautiful tits.

349
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,446
Yeah, mm-hmm.

350
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,748
No, I'm sure she'll be, um,
flattered you think so.

351
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,116
Hey, Phoebe,
do me a favor.

352
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,284
Will you go call
the equipment house,

353
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,502
see where the rest
of our stuff is?

354
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,789
Sure, I'll be
right back.

355
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,912
Okay, look.
Here's the deal.

356
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:08,729
These people think
that we are here

357
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:09,981
to shoot a reality show

358
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,300
about their loser
hockey team making good.

359
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,669
But some girl kills herself
joyriding at night,

360
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,971
probably drunk

361
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,238
on moonshine or something.

362
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,641
Hey, hi.
More coffee, maybe?

363
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,258
Someday?

364
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,644
Closest Starbucks
is, like, 80 miles away.

365
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,479
I don't get it.
It's ridiculous.

366
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,680
Thank you!

367
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:26,914
Anyway,

368
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,000
Everyone is all bent
out of shape about this,

369
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,134
Except coach Carhartt,
who only cares

370
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,302
About winning
the championship.

371
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,405
Now, did I mention
the ex-coach, Hansen,

372
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,708
He's a flippin' loon
who just got out of prison

373
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,877
For accidentally killing
his wife ten years ago.

374
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,845
Carhartt's son
was banging Hansen's daughter.

375
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,647
Hansen's daughter

376
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:44,848
ends up dead.

377
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,550
It's fucking gold.

378
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:50,620
Wow, yeah,
um, that's-

379
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,906
<i>that's a lot
of information.</i>

380
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:56,326
Uh, you know, Lee,
I kind of, uh, liked

381
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:59,546
<i>the whole underdog
hockey team angle.</i>

382
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,966
I'm not really such a fan
of messing with people's heads.

383
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,587
And I am telling you
that I want you to go

384
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,339
to that high school
and shoot me a fucking show

385
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,308
about these crazy coaches

386
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,476
and their
beer-guzzling buddies.

387
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:13,644
Got it?

388
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,781
Um, I take my job
pretty seriously,

389
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,383
and i try to do good work
no matter what the show.

390
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,518
But talk to me
like that again,

391
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,420
and you can book me
on the next flight home.

392
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:25,622
<i>Sorry it took so long,</i>

393
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,957
it's totally freezing
out there and whatnot.

394
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,425
There's still
no cell reception.

395
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,593
I'll keep trying
the equipment house.

396
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:31,861
Oh, here.

397
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,963
Thank you.

398
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,790
Can I help you?

399
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,694
What?

400
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,596
The townspeople
are all up in my grill,

401
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:53,199
because I've got my crew
asking questions

402
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,000
that aren't just
about hockey.

403
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:56,202
I mean,
give me a break.

404
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:57,669
Do these people even own
a fucking television?

405
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:58,871
It's not like
the show's

406
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:00,472
for the fucking
nature channel people.

407
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,274
<i>Seaton Brookstone's office.</i>

408
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,225
Hello? Hey.

409
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,544
Shannon, hey, it's Jake.
Is Seaton in?

410
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:06,779
<i>Hi, Jake.</i>

411
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,281
<i>I'm having a bad time
hearing you.</i>

412
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:09,949
<i>It's not
a good connection.</i>

413
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,217
<i>I don't have Seaton right now;
he's in a meeting.</i>

414
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,152
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

415
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,453
Listen, Shannon, I-

416
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:15,922
This is the first time
I've had any bars

417
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,656
on my phone
since I landed.

418
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,524
Something-
something's off here,

419
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,591
and i really need
to talk to him

420
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,060
before I go in
and start this thing up.

421
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,662
Can you have him
call me please?

422
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,265
Hello?

423
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,600
Hello?

424
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,519
<i>Shit.</i>

425
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,638
Oh, over here?

426
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:33,972
Clients love, love, love

427
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,406
to bitch about problems
on locations.

428
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:37,242
You know,
"my wardrobe sucks. "

429
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,210
You know,
"my trailer's not big enough. "

430
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,563
You know, I-I-"they're housing
me in the woods. "

431
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,897
I try not
to take those calls.

432
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:44,232
By the time I return,

433
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,700
they've usually worked
it out for themselves.

434
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,058
I can't believe
she's coming here.

435
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,161
She has such
beautiful hair.

436
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,529
You're talking
like a loser, Erin.

437
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,599
Having these people here
is just all wrong.

438
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,717
Are we clear?

439
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:03,918
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,676
My girls should not be
looking up to her.

441
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:14,495
They should be
looking up to me.

442
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,464
Blanca Champion is coming
to White Plains

443
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:17,998
to do research
for a movie role.

444
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,167
She's playing
a reality TV director

445
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:22,002
who uncovers
some big political scandal.

446
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:24,855
You know,
I don't even want to tell you

447
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:27,557
what I saw
down in that boiler room.

448
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,092
Doesn't that sound
like a great movie?

449
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:31,928
I mean, this really is
an exciting business.

450
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,922
# I wasn't born #

451
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,241
# I wasn't born #

452
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:48,111
# I wasn't born to suffer #

453
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:50,447
# I wasn't born #

454
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,816
# I wasn't born #

455
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,019
# I wasn't born to suffer # #

456
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,520
<i>I think we're crew?</i>

457
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,187
Excuse me?

458
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,122
I'm Keir,
your camera assistant.

459
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:02,358
Or at least
I think so.

460
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:03,475
<i>'Cause no one spends
that much money</i>

461
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:06,229
<i>on sunglasses
around here.</i>

462
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,480
So I figured
you're Jake, right?

463
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:09,415
Uh, I-I am.

464
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:13,002
Um, and I got these for free
off my last show.

465
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,654
I was, um-I was worried

466
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:16,289
they were a bit
too fancy for me.

467
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,874
No, you pull 'em off well.

468
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,193
Finally, a friendly face.

469
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:21,928
Hey,

470
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,181
can I talk you into maybe
showing me around this place?

471
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:28,017
So, did you meet Lee?

472
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,418
Oh, yeah.

473
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,520
Yeah, she's quite a lady.

474
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,724
And I use
the term loosely.

475
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:36,960
Before we go in-

476
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,227
I don't mean
to cross any lines,

477
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:40,196
but can I
show you something?

478
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:43,699
Yeah, sure.

479
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:50,021
I'm dying
to google these people.

480
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:51,756
I don't know
if you've tried yet,

481
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,159
but it's impossible
to get on the internet up here.

482
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,428
I've tried the dial-up,
like, 30 times,

483
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:58,830
<i>only to get knocked off
after 10 seconds.</i>

484
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,616
This is
the girl that died.

485
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,284
Jaynie, right?

486
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:03,685
Yeah.

487
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,204
This girl's death

488
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:07,872
was just so violent.

489
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:10,458
So you started checking
into the town's history?

490
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,794
Hoping to find what?

491
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:13,879
I don't know.

492
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,247
But let's just say
for a town this small,

493
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:19,918
this place has had its share
of death and drama.

494
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,254
Left behind are Ty Carhartt
and his two-year-old son Vance,

495
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:24,673
the surviving twin.

496
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:26,225
Father and son
where in Whiskey River

497
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:30,512
Picking up supplies
when the accident happened.

498
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,481
This is Carhartt,
the hockey coach?

499
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:33,682
Yep.

500
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:35,649
I mean, this is
an awful story.

501
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,017
All of it.

502
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:39,603
But I don't really get
what it has to do

503
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,105
with this ATV accident.

504
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:43,390
That's just it.

505
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,760
I don't think
this was an accident.

506
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,912
You two
have to leave.

507
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,997
Now.

508
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,918
5, 6, here we go.

509
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,789
Gold Diggers go!

510
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,857
Gold Diggers go!

511
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:05,762
I told you,
bucket tosses.

512
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,468
Vance, you need
to focus!

513
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,169
Carhartt, the hockey coach?

514
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:13,287
<i>Yep.</i>

515
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,405
We're not gonna
beat Eagle Ridge

516
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,140
unless you show
some hustle, boy.

517
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,874
Maybe we ought to take
this practice outside.

518
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,176
Run a few laps.

519
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:22,179
Then you'll play like men
instead of wussies.

520
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,081
I don't want to accuse
Vance's dad

521
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,848
of having anything to do
with these killings,

522
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,419
But I-I have
a weird inkling that there-

523
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,187
there's some connection there,

524
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,157
because it's just bizarre
the way he treats his son.

525
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,692
And he creeps me out
in a way.

526
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:39,245
<i>Vance, come on, come on.
Move it, move it.</i>

527
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:41,414
He is so hard on
his son. It's relentless.

528
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,133
He makes him call him "coach,"
instead of "dad. "

529
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:44,700
Come on, coach.

530
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:47,570
Focus!

531
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:52,608
Kid's not getting much
of a morning period, huh?

532
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:53,709
Is that Luke?
Luke!

533
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,711
Jake!

534
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:56,763
I didn't know
you were on this show, man.

535
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:59,015
Thank God you're here.

536
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:00,183
These people
are a bunch of freaks.

537
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:01,417
<i>We did a show called,
uh, Your Town over in Miami</i>

538
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,485
a few years ago.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,820
Hey, so, uh,

540
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:05,454
What are you doing on this show?
I thought you were big time.

541
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:06,272
What, come on, man.

542
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:07,456
Anywhere you are
is the big time, right?

543
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:08,557
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,292
Hey, so, uh,
how's Stacy doing?

545
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,879
Uh, you know, let's, uh-
let's not even go there.

546
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,446
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.

547
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:15,814
How's the rest
of your crew?

548
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,416
Dude, let me put it
to you this way:

549
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,184
Our sound guy's a local hire
who lives in his car.

550
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,519
We should get going,

551
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,353
because Lee's
gonna get here.

552
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,105
And that woman,
we do not want to piss off.

553
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,739
All right man. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

554
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,441
Yeah, see you in a bit.

555
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:38,220
What the hell?

556
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,506
There he is.
How you doin', man?

557
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,057
All right.

558
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:43,725
Jake.

559
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,061
Looks like you
already met Keir.

560
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:48,197
This is Daphne,
our story producer.

561
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:50,332
And this is Mike,
your sound guy.

562
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:51,683
Hey, man, have we
worked together before?

563
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,919
What?

564
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,138
Hi, Jake.

565
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,155
Hi.

566
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:58,523
I know it's tres geeky
to say,

567
00:26:58,624 --> 00:26:59,758
but I love your work.

568
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,026
I'm so excited
you're on this project.

569
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:03,494
<i>Back On The Ranch
is my favorite show.</i>

570
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,696
Was.
Is.

571
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,664
I blogged my brains out on
the fan site to bring it back.

572
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,433
Uh, well, thank you.

573
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,834
I'm glad you liked it.
I did too.

574
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,970
All right, the only one
we're missing is Nik, our P.A.,

575
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,505
But he went to Winnipeg
to pick up Blanca.

576
00:27:14,606 --> 00:27:16,106
She's arriving
by helicopter.

577
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:17,441
Isn't that cool?

578
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:18,476
Yeah, that's very cool.

579
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:20,278
Look, I was
the first one here.

580
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,447
So if you want
the back story on anyone,

581
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,449
cast or crew,
come to me.

582
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,749
<i>Hi, Daphne!</i>

583
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:27,051
Is she here yet?

584
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:28,019
Almost.

585
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,803
That's Erin,
the head cheerleader.

586
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,539
She's very excited
to meet Blanca.

587
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,940
Hey, excuse me
for a second, Daphne.

588
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,141
Um, Luke, can we, uh,
go ahead and set up

589
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,209
for an interview?

590
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,777
I want to talk
to that kid Vance.

591
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:38,779
Daphne, can you, um,
sit in?

592
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,114
We gotta get a frame
for these confessionals.

593
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:41,249
No problem.
Good.

594
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,318
<i>Right here.
Good.</i>

595
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,588
I wonder
where Miss Falls is.

596
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,391
She's kind of a tyrant
with the girls before games.

597
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,340
<i>Daphne?</i>

598
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:17,442
Best moment
of this season?

599
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:19,861
Um-

600
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:22,214
Okay, yeah,
I guess it was, um,

601
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:25,584
looking at the sidelines
when we beat Riverdale,

602
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:27,385
<i>and, uh,</i>

603
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:30,989
seeing Jaynie.

604
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,791
You know, she was just
hootin' and hollerin'.

605
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:34,792
You know, and-

606
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:43,785
Whatever happened
to Jaynie out there

607
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,620
wasn't an accident, okay?

608
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:47,571
<i>And...</i>

609
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:49,623
<i>I want people
to know.</i>

610
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:54,745
Someone-

611
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,248
some monster
did that to her.

612
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:58,733
I don't know who.

613
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,968
But, um, I'm gonna
find 'em.

614
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,207
I gotta go.

615
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:14,932
Hey.

616
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:19,470
What would you say if I told you
I saw someone watching me

617
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:23,407
from the woods
this morning, in a mask?

618
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,258
I'd say
you sounded paranoid,

619
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:28,961
and, uh, I am buying you a stiff
drink tonight, my friend.

620
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:30,264
Blanca-
Blanca-

621
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,798
Blanca Champion, wow.

622
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:34,400
Oh, I'm really excited
to meet Blanca Champion.

623
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,369
I'd say we have
a pretty unique connection.

624
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,305
I mean, how many guys
can say that they've

625
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:40,407
carried all 28 pieces
of her luggage?

626
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:44,044
She's, uh-
she's very, uh-

627
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,545
I don't know
how to say this.

628
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:46,813
I held her hand.

629
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:49,299
Well, I blocked her hand.

630
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,052
Yeah, she was-
she was trying to hit me.

631
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:53,987
I- it was my fault.
I made a mistake.

632
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,389
But yeah, I mean,
we're pretty close.

633
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,174
I'd say "high maintenance,"
in a really good way.

634
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,643
She's charming, she's funny,
she works the room.

635
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:03,079
You know, she's the master
at the grand entrance.

636
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:13,389
I can't even begin
to believe this.

637
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,134
# you spin around #

638
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:28,287
# around yeah yeah #

639
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,505
# around around #

640
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,288
# around around around #

641
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,140
# love's a boomerang #

642
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:33,759
# it's a boomerang #

643
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,011
# yeah love's a boomerang #

644
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:38,297
# a boom boom boomerang #

645
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,848
# a boomerang #

646
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:40,833
# yeah it's a boomerang #

647
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:42,151
# love's a boomerang #

648
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:46,255
# a boom boom boomerang # #

649
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,806
Okay, I-I'll be right back.

650
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,074
Okay.

651
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,679
Hi, Blanca.

652
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,116
Hi, Scooby!
Hi.

653
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,184
Hi.

654
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,218
Um,

655
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,536
What the hell
are you wearing?

656
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,338
I was told
to dress sexy.

657
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,538
By who?
Seaton?

658
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,140
You look like Punky Brewster
with hypothermia.

659
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,360
It's being handled,
right, sweetheart?

660
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:09,861
Handled.

661
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:13,247
Miss Champion,
I am so excited to meet you.

662
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,649
I- I-
I am your biggest fan.

663
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,735
Um, you are
a personal hero to me.

664
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,504
Do you think
you can sign this, please?

665
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,390
Sure, sweetie.

666
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,958
Um, I know it's
none of my business,

667
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,393
but you two
were so close.

668
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,345
Uh, why were
you fighting?

669
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,213
Because she's a cunt.

670
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,131
<i>Okay.</i>

671
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:31,215
Uh, excuse us
for a second.

672
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,166
We're just gonna-

673
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,337
I'm a big fan too.

674
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:38,540
Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,058
Have a little, uh,
talk, shall we?

676
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,893
Okay!
- Easy, Scooby.

677
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,194
You're turning me on.

678
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,463
Yeah, please
don't call me Scooby.

679
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,214
Okay, okay, okay.

680
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,449
Hey, buddy.

681
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,718
Um, would you mind
excusing us for a second?

682
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,620
Hey, sexy.

683
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,255
<i>I like the way
those shorts</i>

684
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:56,690
cup your little ass.

685
00:32:58,025 --> 00:32:59,493
It's delicious.

686
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,131
Blanca.

687
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,698
Do you
even remember me?

688
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,700
I'm sorry, are we
in the boys locker room?

689
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:09,520
It stinks in here.
Bleh!

690
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,989
Yeah, no, I know this isn't,
uh, exactly ideal,

691
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,824
but i hear if we make it
through the next few weeks

692
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:16,826
on our best behavior,
we're gonna score

693
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,111
big bonus points
with the studio.

694
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:19,579
Ooh, what's
best behavior?

695
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,666
Well, it's probably, uh,
not using the "c" word

696
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,267
In front
of small-town cheerleaders.

697
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:25,352
Oh, God.

698
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:26,920
They're dealing with some
heavy shit around here.

699
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,239
A local girl recently
got killed in an accident,

700
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,773
so the people
are pretty shook up.

701
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,610
All right, whatever.

702
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,513
Okay, you know what?
I get it.

703
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,498
Don't worry, Jake.

704
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,933
I remember how nice
you used to be to me.

705
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,736
People don't really
tell me how it is these days.

706
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:46,889
And I'm serious about
this movie research stuff, okay?

707
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,657
I'm sick of playing
dopey teenagers.

708
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:50,292
I have to nail this.

709
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,293
We're cool.

710
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:52,411
All right.

711
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:53,695
Oh, hey, and, um,

712
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,981
it's kind of-
kind of cold in here.

713
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:58,050
So you may want to rethink
the whole mini-skirt thing.

714
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,185
Fuck off.
- Okay, nice. Very nice.

715
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:03,188
Jaynie Hansen's death, um-

716
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,190
You know, where I'm from,
you get a cut, a scrape,

717
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,493
A broken leg
is considered an accident.

718
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:08,795
What happened to her,

719
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:10,763
I don't think that
was an accident.

720
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:15,100
Jaynie's dad has always
scared the hell out of me,

721
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:16,386
to be honest.

722
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:22,407
# everybody loves you that way #

723
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:28,162
# everybody loves you that way #

724
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,333
Where are we even
going, anyways?

725
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:33,902
And I can't believe
this is the crew Van.

726
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:35,469
So lame.

727
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:36,971
It's the only
thing we'd all fit in.

728
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:38,773
Besides,
it's a low-budget show.

729
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:40,308
The school let us
use this for free.

730
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,477
Look, guys, if this is what
the kids were talking about,

731
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,112
then this is the story
to follow.

732
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,147
Everyone we've talked to
has brought up this Hansen guy.

733
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:47,699
<i>Jake's right.</i>

734
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,599
I mean this town's more
interested in this girl's death

735
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:49,718
than anything else.

736
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,369
Does anyone know
how long

737
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,704
this guy's been
out of prison?

738
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:54,940
Less than a month.
It's a big deal around here.

739
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,724
I saw a picture of Hansen's
dead wife at the school.

740
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:58,643
Very pretty.

741
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:00,561
Oh, lucky us.
A predator round-up.

742
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:04,099
<i>Is that what they do for fun</i>

743
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,400
here in cat piss,
North Dakota?

744
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:06,734
Hey, do I need
to remind you

745
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:08,670
that I'm on
a 10-hour schedule,

746
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:10,138
and I don't do overtime?

747
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,141
Okay.
Thanks, Mike.

748
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,509
Nice watch,
by the way.

749
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,742
Hey, dude, why don't you
sell that thing

750
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:17,744
so you don't have
to live in your trailer?

751
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,996
I like living in my camper.
Is that okay with you?

752
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:21,682
Whatever, loser.

753
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:23,316
Nik, do you have any idea
where this cabin is?

754
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,318
<i>Erin said we can't miss it.</i>

755
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,520
<i>Should be just
off the lake.</i>

756
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:30,357
# everybody loves you that way #

757
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,245
# everybody loves you
that way # #

758
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:37,514
Hansen was
supposedly devastated,

759
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:38,815
but Carhartt testified

760
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,550
that he saw Hansen
and his wife

761
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:43,720
fighting in the school parking
lot hours before her death.

762
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,756
That got him sent away,

763
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,624
and left
the coaching job open,

764
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,693
which went to Carhartt.

765
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:51,728
Hansen's lawyer found
some evidence

766
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:53,030
that got him released
on an appeal.

767
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,182
But, as you can imagine,

768
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:58,368
after ten years
in a North Dakota jail,

769
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:00,937
still pretty angry.

770
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,585
<i>Hello?</i>

771
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:38,291
<i>Coach Hansen?</i>

772
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:55,390
Ooh, I guess the pretty wife
kind of settled.

773
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,830
Hi, um,
my name's Jake Tanner.

774
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,498
And, um, we're in town
shooting a show-

775
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,702
I know
what you're up to.

776
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:08,036
Wash my thoroughly

777
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:09,972
from my inequity
and cleanse me from my sin.

778
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,406
Against thee, the only,

779
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:12,708
have I sinned and done

780
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,210
that which is evil
in thy sight.

781
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:17,078
This guy is fucking
scary as shit.

782
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:18,379
I'm just gonna
put this microphone on you

783
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,413
right here, okay?

784
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:22,250
Get the hell out of here.

785
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:24,469
<i>I didn't invite you here.
This is private property.</i>

786
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:27,472
I said get the hell out!

787
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:28,674
Okay.

788
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,176
Okay, okay, okay.
Sorry.

789
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:32,177
All of you.

790
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:33,211
We didn't mean
to bother you.

791
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,779
We don't want
any trouble.

792
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:35,780
<i>What about
my microphone?</i>

793
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:39,985
I'm billing production.

794
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,988
That reality TV crew
should have been

795
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,622
following me around,
you know?

796
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:46,790
While they were
out talking

797
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,442
to Jaynie Hansen's
crazy dad,

798
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:50,477
I was finding
the cheerleading coach's body

799
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,045
all mangled
in the wood shop.

800
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:55,266
Now that would have made for
some great television, you know?

801
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,184
I took some footage
with my camera phone

802
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:58,769
if you guys
want to buy it though.

803
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:20,140
I don't give a fuck
who she is, her agent-

804
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:21,808
Wait a minute, that asshole
is your agent too, isn't he?

805
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,810
Yeah, well,
he made me pay her as a P.A.

806
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:25,112
while she does
her research.

807
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:26,347
So guess
what that means?

808
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,481
She needs to work

809
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:28,398
<i>like a fucking P.A.,</i>

810
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,566
<i>so this is how it's going
to go.</i>

811
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,652
As long as she
is on my payroll-

812
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:32,786
remember this-
will do.

813
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,320
I wanna know
when she naps

814
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:36,322
where she naps,
and how long she naps.

815
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:37,824
You're gonna write it down
and deduct it from her paycheck.

816
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:39,258
Got it?

817
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,493
Lee, why don't you
give her a break?

818
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:42,512
<i>She traveled all night.</i>

819
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:43,896
That's just great, Jake.

820
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:44,897
What do you want to do,
give her a fucking bottle,

821
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:47,533
and change
her diapers too?

822
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,438
Blanca Champion...

823
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,390
All you can think
to yourself is

824
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:55,908
"why can't this girl
just get her hands

825
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,178
on some decent conditioner?"

826
00:38:58,279 --> 00:38:59,479
Just wash it.

827
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,247
I don't get it.

828
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:02,599
Can you explain it?

829
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,900
I didn't really know
what to expect,

830
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,135
uh, with Lee.

831
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,237
She's-she's-
she's a bitch.

832
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,638
She's a super-bitch,
actually.

833
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,706
Um, we're all trying
to kind of deal with her,

834
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,609
because she's our boss.

835
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,561
But, um, yeah,
there's no other word for Lee.

836
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:18,948
Lee doesn't really
get along with anyone

837
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:22,533
who isn't Lee.

838
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,587
Mister?

839
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:26,655
Hey, what's up, buddy?

840
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:28,273
I heard what Vance
said to you before.

841
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:29,842
He's right.

842
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:32,611
Mike, I think-
I think we're good.

843
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,815
Just doing my job, man.

844
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,886
It wasn't an accident.

845
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,555
Okay, I'm listening.

846
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:45,357
Jaynie used to take me
cross-country skiing there

847
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,691
all the time.

848
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,294
She knew that place.

849
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:53,248
I heard something
when I was leaving that night.

850
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,883
But I didn't
do nothing.

851
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:56,952
You know
what I think?

852
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:58,921
I think you're
one brave little guy

853
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,639
For telling me that.

854
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,325
I'm gonna do
some asking around.

855
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:05,060
Cool?
- Cool.

856
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,780
Come on.

857
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:12,349
You know, if-
uh, you know-

858
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,986
if you-if you
wanna nap in-

859
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:17,288
uh, the bed
in my camper is, uh-

860
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:19,523
it's a lot more comfortable
than in here.

861
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:22,626
I'm fine here, fuck face,
but thanks.

862
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:55,509
Lee.
You home?

863
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:02,248
Ah, hey, buddy.

864
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:04,166
<i>What are you doing?</i>

865
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,002
Yeah, you wanna
go outside, don't you?

866
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:08,071
All right.

867
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,923
All right, come on.
Come on, bongo.

868
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:14,794
Holy shit.

869
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:17,046
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You scared the hell out of me.

870
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:20,800
Don't go digging up shit
you don't know nothin' about.

871
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,653
I'm sorry, what?
- You heard me.

872
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,955
It's a small town.
We all talk to each other.

873
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:27,223
I don't care to hear

874
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:28,424
none of the shit
coach Hansen is spinnin'.

875
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,159
He's an ex-con.

876
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:32,395
And a murderer.

877
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,530
Are we clear?

878
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:36,516
Yeah.

879
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:39,168
We're clear.

880
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,013
Jesus Christ.

881
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:38,609
<i>Oh, wow, uh-</i>

882
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,110
Jesus, sorry.

883
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:41,763
Nice timing, douche bag.

884
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:44,966
Um, we were just gonna go
get a beer and whatnot.

885
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,968
You should totally come.

886
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:49,036
Okay.

887
00:42:57,378 --> 00:42:59,013
You're so bad.

888
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,941
I have that extra sense,
you know?

889
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,375
Like, I can smell blood
a mile away.

890
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,878
I knew something
was rotten in Bismarck.

891
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,848
Sheriff says she was in there
for hours before I found her.

892
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:37,250
Has anyone
told her husband?

893
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,052
Ah, he's down state
on a timber run.

894
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:41,321
I tried him on the CB,
but no luck.

895
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,390
Who you guys
talking about?

896
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,758
There was a-
an accident up at the school.

897
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:48,061
<i>Miss Falls,</i>

898
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:50,463
the cheerleading coach.

899
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:51,932
It was her, uh,
digger spirit

900
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,316
that finally did her in.

901
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:54,283
She's dead.

902
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:55,702
Decapitated.

903
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:56,769
Heart beatless.

904
00:43:56,871 --> 00:44:00,139
I get it.
That's awful.

905
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,676
How often do these
accidents happen?

906
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:04,678
Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

907
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,881
A wood shop
is a very dangerous place.

908
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:10,717
These kind of things
just happen every so often.

909
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,970
It's a part of life.

910
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,505
Look, uh,

911
00:44:15,606 --> 00:44:17,405
what do you say
we cut out of here?

912
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:19,674
Let's go
for a midnight swim.

913
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:20,993
I'd say "hell yeah. "

914
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:22,344
I'll get our coats.

915
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,369
<i>No good can
come of you staying here.</i>

916
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,621
You have brought evil
to our town.

917
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:34,323
The likes of which
we've never seen.

918
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,727
Mark my words
and leave now.

919
00:44:41,047 --> 00:44:42,047
Consider yourselves warned.

920
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:44,650
All of you.

921
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:45,718
Hey!

922
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:46,719
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

923
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:49,955
Come on, man.

924
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,357
Jesus.

925
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:54,460
Guess it's safe to say they
don't like us being here.

926
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,295
No, I don't think
they do.

927
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:58,029
No, no, no, don't any of you
listen to that crackpot.

928
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,365
He's a drunk.

929
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:00,766
He's jealous 'cause he wants
to be on TV.

930
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,401
He'll get over it.

931
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:04,102
You think so?
- Yes.

932
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,271
We just need to get our show
in the can and move on.

933
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:09,073
Now, wrap it up,
we got an early morning call.

934
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:11,276
I guess now isn't
a good time to mention

935
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:12,877
they found Miss Fall's body

936
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:14,312
at the school?

937
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:15,446
There was another accident.

938
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,715
You know what,
all this fucking town has

939
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,317
is screechy old men
with crusty mitts,

940
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:21,552
and perverts.

941
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:26,624
Let's get
the hell out of here.

942
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:33,831
Crazy shit, dude.

943
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,633
Man, I've done a lot of shows
where they picketed us,

944
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,135
<i>like Your Town: Seattle.</i>

945
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:39,053
They didn't want us there.
But this-this place, man-

946
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,788
you'd think they don't
even want an economy.

947
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,956
I mean, they just want to,
you know, sit around,

948
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:45,759
and, you know,
eat elk.

949
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,795
And the ex-coach,
he looks like the villain

950
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,129
<i>from the Scooby-Doo cartoons.</i>

951
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:50,431
Weird.

952
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:52,066
Honestly,
what I'd like to know

953
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,601
is where the fuck
my crew was

954
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:54,934
when that chalupa
was finding her body

955
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:56,503
in the wood shop.

956
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,638
Probably asking some
little kid

957
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:00,073
about the thrill
of victory.

958
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,874
I don't know
how often out here

959
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:04,945
women using heavy industrial
equipment have accidents.

960
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:07,130
So I don't know
if that's normal or not.

961
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,400
But in my book, uh,
that's three shades of weird.

962
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:51,607
<i>Did you hear this?</i>

963
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,426
<i>Blanca Champion has gotten
herself into trouble-</i>

964
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:55,645
For the last time, I don't know

965
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,046
where the damn
camera stuff is.

966
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,414
It never arrived.

967
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,282
Oh, will you just zip your pie hole?

968
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,217
I can't call the network
and tell them that

969
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:04,620
$30,000 worth
of equipment is M.I.A.

970
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,439
It is not okay
to talk to me like that.

971
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,658
I did not sign on
for this totally deceptive job

972
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,142
and whatnot.

973
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:12,511
And why can't you just give the
network the show they ordered?

974
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:15,247
It's a totally better show.

975
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:18,417
Because no one wants
to watch a show

976
00:47:18,518 --> 00:47:20,286
about some wittle
hockey team.

977
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:22,021
<i>They'd much rather
watch a show</i>

978
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:24,624
about a bloodthirsty convict
out for revenge.

979
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,158
That is why.

980
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:29,261
Can I ask you something?
- What?

981
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:31,396
Did you seduce me
because you thought

982
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:32,632
it would keep me quiet?

983
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,633
Because that was
a total miscalculation.

984
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:36,134
<i>Well, I think that</i>

985
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:36,901
you're gonna keep quiet.

986
00:47:37,002 --> 00:47:38,152
You know why?

987
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,621
If you don't,

988
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:40,955
I will cancel
your plane ticket home.

989
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:42,490
I will drive you out
into the woods,

990
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,791
and I will
leave you there.

991
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,628
You wouldn't
do that to me.

992
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:48,330
You can try me.

993
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,414
Now we can continue
to play nice or not.

994
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:51,783
The choice
is yours, Phoebe.

995
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:53,668
You're a real coose.

996
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:56,804
And an awful boss.

997
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,200
As long as these guys
play digger hockey,

998
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:29,136
and keep focused
on the game,

999
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:31,321
there's not gonna be
any stopping them.

1000
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:32,856
Look, I only got two hours
before the next game.

1001
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:34,958
I got things to do.

1002
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,247
Come on.

1003
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:42,566
Hey, is the, uh-

1004
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,667
is the coach mic'd?

1005
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:44,901
I'm having trouble
hearing him.

1006
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,403
No, he's not mic'd.

1007
00:48:46,504 --> 00:48:48,772
We left his out at the crazy
guy's shack, remember?

1008
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:49,906
Well, we gotta have
this guy mic'd

1009
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,040
before the playoff games.

1010
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,426
Well then I suggest
you send somebody

1011
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:53,494
out there
to get it.

1012
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:54,811
Okay.

1013
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:57,948
I'm sending you.
- Yeah, I could do that.

1014
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:00,016
Except is there
anybody else here that, uh,

1015
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:01,651
Can wire a P.A. system?

1016
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,370
Anybody else here
that can run play-by-play?

1017
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:04,905
It'll take me
about an hour and a half.

1018
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:06,139
So that's a perfect
amount of time

1019
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,608
for you to go
do it yourself.

1020
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:09,693
Okay.
Go rig your P.A.

1021
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:11,262
But, hey,
do me a favor?

1022
00:49:11,363 --> 00:49:14,964
Um, let's cut out
this whole smug asshole thing.

working my last nerve, okay?

1024
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,485
Okay.

1025
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:22,955
Sorry, boss.

1030
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:35,834
you're basically like
bus boy's assistant.

1031
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:39,805
Well, does this suck ass?

1032
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:42,375
Mm-hmm!

1033
00:49:42,476 --> 00:49:44,910
Am I getting paid
nearly enough to do it?

1034
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:48,014
No fucking way.

1035
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:54,353
Hmm.

1036
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:57,957
Coach?

1037
00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:00,059
Hey, um-

1038
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,626
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

1039
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:04,212
but, uh, we need to get
that microphone back

1040
00:50:04,313 --> 00:50:05,680
from earlier today.

1041
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:06,965
I thought...

1042
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,667
you might have
it in there.

1043
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:11,586
Hello?

1044
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:17,959
Don't be a puss.

1045
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:22,864
Look, uh, coach,
I just

1046
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:24,899
really wanted
to apologize,

1047
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:26,034
uh, about earlier today.

1048
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,493
Oh, shit!

1049
00:50:37,463 --> 00:50:39,230
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1050
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:41,516
What the fuck is-

1051
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:55,846
Blanca's hitting
on all the cute little boys,

1052
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:57,364
uh, in the school,

1053
00:50:57,465 --> 00:50:58,465
and taking them away

1054
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:00,367
from the little
cheerleader girls.

1055
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:02,703
These days,
it doesn't seem

1056
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,689
that Erin cares
for Blanca too much.

1057
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,925
Uh, I believe
she called her a-

1058
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,994
A "cocaine-fueled
gutter slut. "

1059
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:13,196
Also, she needs
to stop telling people

1060
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:14,765
that I'm overweight.

1061
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:16,550
I thought someone
had mistakenly told her

1062
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:17,951
that my name was Ella.

1063
00:51:18,002 --> 00:51:20,304
Turns out,
she's doing it on purpose.

1064
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:23,023
"Ella" is short
for elephant.

00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:12,547
<i>has been nothing</i>

1114
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,666
<i>short of a phenomenon.</i>

1115
00:53:18,353 --> 00:53:19,603
<i>Shot.</i>

1116
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:20,971
<i>Goal!</i>

1117
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:25,626
<i>The state championship
is just a bus ride away</i>

1118
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:29,697
<i>for the Gold Diggers.</i>

1119
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,603
Any sign of Nik?
- Nope.

1120
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:38,005
God, that's so weird.

1121
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:40,007
Oh, hey, coach.

1122
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:41,408
Great game tonight.

1123
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,010
Hey, listen.
Can I ask you a favor?

1124
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,579
Favors aren't really
my specialty.

1125
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,346
That's funny.

1126
00:53:46,448 --> 00:53:47,481
Hey, look, I-I noticed
you had a treadmill

1127
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,549
upstairs in the gym.

1128
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,018
Would you mind if I grabbed
a quick workout?

1129
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,054
You know,
I like your dedication, boy.

1130
00:53:53,154 --> 00:53:55,756
More people should make
fitness a priority.

1131
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,858
We're clearing out, so...

1132
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,227
just make sure to lock
the doors when you leave.

1133
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:02,029
Thank you, sir.

1134
00:54:03,632 --> 00:54:06,166
Oh, hey, excuse me,
coach stick-up-your-ass,

1135
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:07,601
do you think that I might
massage your penis

1136
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:12,005
for a few minutes so that
I too might get a workout?

1137
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:14,941
Is it hard being
such a douchebag all the time?

1138
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:18,111
Uh, no.

1139
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:20,313
No, I actually
kind of like it.

1140
00:54:20,414 --> 00:54:22,598
Loser.

1141
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:47,606
<i>Luke for Daphne.</i>

1142
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:51,878
Go ahead, Luke.

1143
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:53,579
Was the Tahoe ever
supposed to be used

1144
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:54,830
as a cast car?

1145
00:54:54,932 --> 00:54:55,965
Not that I know of.

1146
00:54:56,065 --> 00:54:57,666
Phoebe handled
all the rentals, why?

1147
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,535
It's just I found
a lipstick camera

1148
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:01,403
rigged in the back seat,
and I didn't put any

1149
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:02,921
lipstick cameras
on the equipment order.

1150
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:05,140
And this is
the second one I've found.

1151
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:07,776
I didn't know this show had
that kind of surveillance.

1152
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:09,745
I didn't think so either.

1153
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:10,912
I'll ask.

1154
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:14,015
Copy that.

1155
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:43,528
Hello?
I'm still up here!

1156
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:45,629
Oh, what the hell, man?

1157
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:53,503
<i>Hello?</i>

1158
00:56:58,335 --> 00:56:59,235
Whoa.

1159
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,037
What the fuck?
Who are you, man?

1160
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,694
Ow!

1161
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:56,758
Oh, fuck!

1162
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,386
Oh, fuck!

1163
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,122
Oh!

1164
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,937
Cops here are actually

1165
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:28,155
pretty laid back

1166
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:30,391
about actually, um,

1167
00:58:30,492 --> 00:58:31,809
working.

1168
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,544
The cops in White Plains
aren't like

1169
00:58:33,645 --> 00:58:34,979
the cops you see
in the movies.

1170
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,047
I mean, they like
doughnuts and all,

1171
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:38,583
but they're not really
into, like,

1172
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:41,385
answering the phone
or investigating.

1173
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:42,954
Try the local bar.

1174
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,822
It seems to be
their headquarters.

1175
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:48,692
<i>Big time Hollywood ho.</i>

1176
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:53,714
Have a lovely day.

1177
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,617
What'd she say?

1178
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:01,338
Hey, I meant to ask,
did you guys

1179
00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:03,707
pre-rig the cars with cameras
before we got up here?

1180
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:06,293
Can we please not talk
about work for a second?

1181
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:08,629
I need a break from this show
and this town.

1182
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,030
And, um, mm,
more liquor.

1183
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:16,119
Hey, any sign
of Greg or Nik?

1184
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,754
Nope, I thought
they'd be here already.

1185
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:24,077
Yeah?

1186
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:29,215
Hello?

1187
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:30,516
Hey, sugarpuss!

1188
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:32,752
Hi, see me standing here
with moolah in my hand?

1189
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:34,787
No?
Yes?

1190
00:59:34,888 --> 00:59:36,522
Hi!

1191
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:37,857
Hello, how are you?

1192
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:40,977
Any of you lovely ladies
want a shot of tequila?

1193
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,579
Mm, I'd like a shot.

1194
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:44,948
That a girl.

1195
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,783
Looks like Miss Champion

1196
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:47,918
found herself
another victim.

1197
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:52,855
Okay, to the super-star
hockey player.

1198
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,191
Well, to the super-hot
actress/model.

1199
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,762
Okay, I've been called worse.
But, whatever.

1200
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,864
Mm.

1201
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,068
<i>So, um,</i>

1202
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,387
I heard you were kind of close
to that girl that died.

1203
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:10,356
Sorry, the cheerleaders
were talking,

1204
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:11,857
and the microphone
picks everything up.

1205
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,792
Which is something
I need to remember

1206
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:15,694
next time I bag
on the crew.

1207
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:17,496
Yeah, I guess, um-

1208
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:19,798
I guess you can say
this went from being

1209
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,933
the best year of my life
to the worst in,

1210
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,769
you know, a blink.

1211
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,971
I'm really sorry.

1212
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:27,940
You know,
it gets better.

1213
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,876
<i>My dad died
when I was 14,</i>

1214
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:34,430
and i thought I would
never get over it.

1215
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,865
I mean, it doesn't
go away,

1216
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,334
but it gets easier.

1217
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,537
Promise?

1218
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,622
Yeah.

1219
01:00:46,792 --> 01:00:48,360
Isn't he
a little young for her?

1220
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:49,427
Is it still illegal

1221
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:51,062
if it's a boy?

1222
01:00:51,163 --> 01:00:52,797
I heard she slept
with that P.A. who sued her.

1223
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:54,482
And then
she got tired of him,

1224
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,584
treated him like garbage,

1225
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:57,585
until finally,
he had enough.

1226
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:58,954
See, that's how
rumors get started.

1227
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,588
What, you saying
it's not true?

1228
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:02,407
Well, I think the press
likes to paint Blanca

1229
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:03,575
as the bad girl.

1230
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:04,609
And I think sometimes

1231
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:05,810
she feels obligated
to live up

1232
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:07,244
to those expectations.

1233
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:10,614
Oh, Phoebe,
you've gone from zero

1234
01:01:10,716 --> 01:01:13,217
to Tara Reid in 60 seconds.

1235
01:01:15,453 --> 01:01:17,188
Let's just say
this show's all about

1236
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:18,189
firsts and lasts,

1237
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,992
and whatnot.

1238
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:26,380
I hate to be a buzz kill,

1239
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,615
but, uh,
I'm calling it a night.

1240
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:29,417
All right,
do me a favor,

1241
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,151
and just be careful, please.

1242
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:32,836
Okay.

1243
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:42,196
I- I love-
love being on location, but-

1244
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:43,497
well, here's the thing:

1245
01:01:43,598 --> 01:01:45,115
I like to smoke
a lot of chuddies,

1246
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:46,617
and, uh,
that can make one

1247
01:01:46,718 --> 01:01:48,184
a little bit paranoid.

1248
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:49,385
So, uh,

1249
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:51,421
the place is kind of
creeping me out, man.

1250
01:01:51,522 --> 01:01:53,707
I'm ready for it
to be over.

1251
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:55,776
This town gives me
the swingin' icks.

1252
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:02,099
Hello?

1253
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,666
<i>I'm so glad I got through.</i>

1254
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:06,303
Oh, my God,
I can't even begin

1255
01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:07,870
to believe this.

1256
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:10,140
I haven't had reception
for days.

1257
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:11,841
It's so good
to hear your voice.

1258
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:13,727
<i>Finally, I've been
trying forever.</i>

1259
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:15,145
<i>I was starting
to get worried.</i>

1260
01:02:15,246 --> 01:02:16,213
<i>How's it going?</i>

1261
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:17,631
<i>Uh, I need a margarita</i>

1262
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:18,831
<i>and a Palm Springs weekend</i>

1263
01:02:18,932 --> 01:02:21,434
like you wouldn't believe.

1264
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:23,953
Kathy?

1265
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:27,707
Oh, damn it.

1266
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:32,711
# to be the hero #

1267
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,780
# but I know what it's like #

1268
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:36,648
# to be loved by you #

1269
01:02:58,955 --> 01:03:01,891
Greg, are you okay?

1270
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:04,559
You been out here long?

1271
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:07,429
Freeze to death.

1272
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,032
Greg?

1273
01:03:12,768 --> 01:03:14,803
You stoned again?

1274
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,004
Oh, my God!

1275
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:31,252
No, no!

1276
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:34,088
No, I promise!
I promise I won't tell!

1277
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:37,125
Please, please,
please, please!

1278
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:39,961
No, no, no!
I won't-please!

1279
01:03:40,062 --> 01:03:41,196
Oh, my God!

1280
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:44,933
Please, please, please!

1281
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,865
What do you mean,
she didn't come home?

1282
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,167
She wasn't in her bed

1283
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:03,984
when I woke up.

1284
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:05,335
I thought maybe
she got lucky.

1285
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:06,019
With who, Blanca?

1286
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,337
We watched
her leave alone.

1287
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:08,705
I can't believe
you didn't wake me up

1288
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:10,340
<i>when you saw that.</i>

1289
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:11,859
You know what, I thought
maybe she hooked up with you.

1290
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,477
I caught her checking
my ass out a couple times.

1291
01:04:13,578 --> 01:04:14,744
All right, both of you
get off my hump.

1292
01:04:14,846 --> 01:04:16,914
I told you as soon
as I got up.

1293
01:04:17,015 --> 01:04:17,581
Uh, hey, Jake, coach says you have

1294
01:04:17,682 --> 01:04:18,932
to be on the ice
in ten minutes,

1295
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:20,200
or you won't be
allowed on at all.

1296
01:04:22,036 --> 01:04:23,954
Sorry.

1297
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:26,123
Where is the rest
of your crew?

1298
01:04:26,224 --> 01:04:27,374
You know what, Lee,

1299
01:04:27,475 --> 01:04:28,759
<i>I'd like to know
the same thing.</i>

1300
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,310
Something's really wrong here.
Luke is never late.

1301
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:32,078
I don't feel so good.

1302
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:33,997
Oh, Phoebe,
pull it together.

1303
01:04:34,098 --> 01:04:35,932
Fuck you, Lee.

1304
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:37,167
What again?

1305
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:38,401
Oh, my God.

1306
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:41,705
Jake, you've got about
five minutes to get on that ice.

1307
01:04:41,806 --> 01:04:42,806
We don't have a show
without this game.

1308
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:44,408
Well, what do you
want me to do, Lee?

1309
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:46,043
Three quarters of my crew
is missing.

1310
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:47,760
Like I told the last guy,

1311
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:49,762
you're the director,
figure it out.

1312
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:51,414
Sure thing, bitch.

1313
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:53,182
I'm sorry,
what was that?

1314
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:55,184
You know what, Lee?
I called you a bitch.

1315
01:04:55,285 --> 01:04:56,469
<i>I'm beginning
to understand why</i>

1316
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,038
the first director
only lasted a few days.

1317
01:04:59,139 --> 01:05:00,005
Keir, can you mix audio?

1318
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:01,691
I can try.

1319
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:03,426
Okay, Blanca, I'm going to need
you to hold the boom pole.

1320
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,744
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1321
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:08,047
I'm so gonna fucking kill
my acting coach.

1322
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,369
You know what?

1323
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,688
You do not
talk to me that way

1324
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:16,989
In front
of the crew.

1325
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:18,791
You finish out the day.

1326
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:20,025
After that,
you're fired.

1327
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,360
That's fine, Lee.

1328
01:05:21,462 --> 01:05:22,895
You know, I've worked with some
really difficult people

1329
01:05:22,996 --> 01:05:24,863
in my career, but you
are a whole 'nother breed.

1330
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:26,499
And you know what else?

1331
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,367
Nice job sleeping
with your assistant.

1332
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:29,802
It's very classy.

1333
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:31,036
Hey, by the way,

1334
01:05:31,138 --> 01:05:32,438
too bad your fiancee
wasn't on the show, Jake.

1335
01:05:32,539 --> 01:05:33,739
I could have banged her

1336
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,974
before she moved on
to the cast.

1337
01:05:35,075 --> 01:05:37,275
You try getting
another job with affiliated.

1338
01:05:37,376 --> 01:05:39,126
You're finished.

1339
01:05:57,397 --> 01:05:59,598
We need to comb
this school,

1340
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:01,166
and find
that missing stuff.

1341
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,502
You can't hide monitors
that size in a suitcase.

1342
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:04,986
You are the one
who will go down for this.

1343
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:06,955
<i>This isn't Bewitched, Lee.</i>

1344
01:06:07,056 --> 01:06:09,958
I can't just wiggle my nose,
and make stuff appear

1345
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:10,808
<i>and whatnot.</i>

1346
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:12,761
Just try to keep
an eye on things here,

1347
01:06:12,862 --> 01:06:14,195
if you can.

1348
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:16,865
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the crew.

1349
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:19,968
One of those morons
is getting promoted to director.

1350
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:26,240
Go.

1351
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,420
Gotcha.

1352
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:27,083
Holy shit.

1353
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,041
What the fuck?

1354
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:42,866
<i>Because no one wants
to watch a show</i>

1355
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,134
<i>about some wittle
hockey team.</i>

1356
01:07:45,218 --> 01:07:46,069
Oh, my God.

1357
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,071
Am I being punked?

1358
01:07:48,172 --> 01:07:49,539
I thought they
canceled that show.

1359
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:51,474
Ashton!

1360
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:58,514
What the fuck?

1361
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,869
Ah!

1362
01:08:48,782 --> 01:08:51,016
We just wanna go
on record here

1363
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:53,050
that a bunch
of our crew members

1364
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:54,519
are missing.

1365
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,355
Um, and Lee wants us
to shoot anyway.

1366
01:08:57,456 --> 01:08:58,705
But as soon
as this is over,

1367
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,307
we're gonna go find them.

1368
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,143
<i>Tell your camera guy</i>

1369
01:09:03,244 --> 01:09:05,362
I didn't appreciate him
leaving the treadmill

1370
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:07,097
and the lights on
all night.

1371
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,933
I am shocked

1372
01:09:09,034 --> 01:09:11,168
<i>at you people's
disrespect.</i>

1373
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:12,102
No good deed goes unpunished,
huh, Hollywood?

1374
01:09:12,203 --> 01:09:13,988
Sorry, coach.
That's not usually like him.

1375
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:15,256
Ah.

1376
01:09:15,357 --> 01:09:16,290
The bus leaves
tomorrow morning

1377
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:18,359
at 5:30 A.M.
for Fargo.

1378
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:21,628
It waits for no one.

1379
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:25,532
<i>Vance, come on.
Let's go.</i>

1380
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:29,386
Blanca, help Keir grab
some of this stuff.

1381
01:09:29,487 --> 01:09:31,155
Why?

1382
01:09:31,256 --> 01:09:33,423
Could you just help us
pack up this stuff, please?

1383
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:36,944
Jeez, bitch.

1384
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:38,612
And they say
I'm difficult.

1385
01:09:38,714 --> 01:09:41,549
Phoebe, should we
wait for you?

1386
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:43,850
Oh, I gotta get the releases
for tomorrow's game.

1387
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:45,618
And stop by
the mini mart.

1388
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,787
I'll meet you guys back
at the crew cabin, okay?

1389
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:50,256
All right.
Be careful.

1390
01:10:02,686 --> 01:10:04,554
<i>Luke? Nick?</i>

1391
01:10:04,655 --> 01:10:05,972
Um, you guys?

1392
01:10:06,073 --> 01:10:07,607
Hello?

1393
01:10:10,895 --> 01:10:12,629
Oh, phone's dead.
- Shocking!

1394
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,980
Doesn't look like Luke
slept in his bed last night.

1395
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:15,381
And you're right,

1396
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:16,932
'cause Daphne's bed
hasn't been slept in.

1397
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:18,301
It doesn't make any sense.
Where the hell's her truck?

1398
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:20,787
Oh, my God!

1399
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,140
Fucking shit!

1400
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,293
Oh, my God.

1401
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:29,228
Oh, my God.

1402
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,246
Don't touch it!

1403
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:31,480
Is that Mike's watch?

1404
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:32,414
Oh, my God.
What is it holding?

1405
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:33,515
It's the fucking microphone

1406
01:10:33,799 --> 01:10:34,783
that we lost at the cabin.

1407
01:10:34,884 --> 01:10:35,951
He must have went back
to go get it.

1408
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:37,402
Ew.

1409
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:40,305
Oh, my God,
that fucking sick coach

1410
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:41,239
must have cut his hand off!

1411
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,575
We gotta call the cops!

1412
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:43,775
Okay, guys, guys, guys.
Calm down, calm down.

1413
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:44,893
Check your phones.

1414
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:46,177
Do you have any signal?

1415
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:47,880
Keir, check your phone.

1416
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:49,131
Blanca.
Blanca, check your phone.

1417
01:10:49,232 --> 01:10:50,866
No signal, nothing.
I have nothing.

1418
01:10:55,805 --> 01:10:58,106
What is this?

1419
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:02,961
What is that freaky mask?
Who is this?

1420
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:04,329
Who cares?

1421
01:11:04,547 --> 01:11:06,265
Somebody is out there
who thinks it's okay

1422
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,800
to chops people's
hands off.

1423
01:11:10,936 --> 01:11:12,137
Oh, God.

1424
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,427
Oh, my God.

1425
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:20,861
That's Daphne.

1426
01:11:20,962 --> 01:11:21,929
What?

1427
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,765
I know that sign.

1428
01:11:23,965 --> 01:11:25,933
That's out
by coach Hansen's cabin.

1429
01:11:26,034 --> 01:11:27,434
We gotta get out there.

1430
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:35,226
Guys, we gotta go.

1431
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:36,560
<i>She could still
be alive, come on.</i>

1432
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:38,912
Come on!

1433
01:11:39,013 --> 01:11:40,114
I can't even begin
to believe this.

1434
01:11:47,088 --> 01:11:48,923
Hey, why are we
stopping here?

1435
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:50,458
Okay, listen, I'm gonna go
check out the site.

1436
01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:51,959
I need you guys
to stay here,

1437
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:53,895
and try to get in touch
with the cops, okay?

1438
01:11:53,996 --> 01:11:56,597
I saw an old CB radio
in the principal's office.

1439
01:11:56,698 --> 01:11:59,483
Tell them to meet me
by the predator round-up sign

1440
01:11:59,584 --> 01:12:00,885
by Hansen's cabin.

1441
01:12:00,986 --> 01:12:03,354
O- okay, so you're just gonna
go hang with the fucking killer?

1442
01:12:03,455 --> 01:12:05,389
Look, we gotta get back
on the highway and keep driving.

1443
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,757
I hate to break this
to you guys,

1444
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:07,892
But that girl
is probably dead.

1445
01:12:07,993 --> 01:12:09,259
And what if
she's not, Blanca?

1446
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,728
What if Nik and Luke
and Greg need our help too?

1447
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,081
How are we even
gonna get in there?

1448
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:15,448
Here, take these.
They gave them to me.

1449
01:12:15,549 --> 01:12:16,883
<i>Jake, I'm going
with you.</i>

1450
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:18,719
Wait, wait, wait, I'm not going
in there by myself.

1451
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,521
Well-all right, fine.
You're coming with us, then.

1452
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:23,456
Well, both
of those choices suck.

1453
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:24,791
Well, Blanca,
please pick one.

1454
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:25,959
Ugh!

1455
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,928
Fine, fine, I'll-
I'll stay here.

1456
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:29,863
But I'm taking your dog
so you have to come back for me.

1457
01:12:29,964 --> 01:12:31,064
We are gonna come back for you.

1458
01:12:31,165 --> 01:12:32,799
Just go find that CB radio,
and get us some help.

1459
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,868
And hey, hey.
Take this.

1460
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:15,006
Hello?

1461
01:13:15,107 --> 01:13:18,393
You guys got any laxatives?

1462
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,496
I haven't shit for weeks.

1463
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,302
Hello?

1464
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,708
Son of a bitch.

1465
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:20,721
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>

1466
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,657
<i>Please hang up
and try again.</i>

1467
01:14:37,554 --> 01:14:38,622
Anyone here?

1468
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,124
Coach?

1469
01:14:41,225 --> 01:14:43,343
Who's back there?

1470
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:46,829
Is that you, Phoebe?

1471
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,531
Is that thing still up there?
That thing in the mask?

1472
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:51,135
Mask?
Are you on drugs?

1473
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:56,657
We've gotta get
out of here.

1474
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,258
Run, run!

1475
01:14:58,359 --> 01:14:59,259
Just calm down.
- Run!

1476
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,945
Just a sec-

1477
01:15:04,365 --> 01:15:05,748
Get in the car.

1478
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:06,917
Get in the car,
get in the car!

1479
01:15:07,018 --> 01:15:10,586
Get in!

1480
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:12,055
This better not be
some kind of hijinks

1481
01:15:12,156 --> 01:15:14,107
for this television show.

1482
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,727
There was a guy in there
in a mask with an axe.

1483
01:15:16,827 --> 01:15:18,061
And he tried to kill me.

1484
01:15:18,162 --> 01:15:18,979
Kill you?

1485
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,280
You're talking

1486
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:21,748
like some kind of crazy-

1487
01:15:45,205 --> 01:15:46,772
Hello?

1488
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:48,874
Hello, is anybody there?
This is an emergency.

1489
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:08,527
Anyone?
Is anybody there?

1490
01:16:08,628 --> 01:16:10,763
This is an emergency.

1491
01:16:10,864 --> 01:16:12,865
<i>Anyone?</i>

1492
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:16,334
Bongo.

1493
01:16:16,435 --> 01:16:18,436
What are you barking at?

1494
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:57,024
Daphne!

1495
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:03,715
Daphne!

1496
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:11,655
What the fuck is that?

1497
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:13,456
What?

1498
01:17:27,061 --> 01:17:27,827
Holy shit.

1499
01:17:32,808 --> 01:17:34,308
Okay, let's get out of here.

1500
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,310
<i>Ow!
- Fuck!</i>

1501
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:46,012
Keir, we're not gonna
be able to move this thing.

1502
01:17:46,678 --> 01:17:47,678
Bongo!

1503
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:49,237
Where are you going?

1504
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:50,238
God!

1505
01:17:56,276 --> 01:17:57,276
Bongo!

1506
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:01,576
Look, I'm gonna go.

1507
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:04,077
I'm gonna get help.
I promise I'm gonna get help.

1508
01:18:04,522 --> 01:18:05,122
I'll be right back, okay?
I promise you.

1509
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:06,579
Okay, okay.
- I promise I'll be right back, okay?

1510
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,580
Okay.

1511
01:18:10,642 --> 01:18:11,642
Fuck!
Fuck!

1512
01:18:35,232 --> 01:18:36,232
Holy shit!

1513
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:40,916
<i>Blanca?</i>

1514
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:44,435
What are you-

1515
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:45,436
What are you doing down here?

1516
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:47,185
How long have you been
down here for?

1517
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,800
I snuck in when
that mean lady came down here.

1518
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:52,531
And then it came in.

1519
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:53,958
What do you mean "it came in. "

1520
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:54,959
It who?

1521
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,460
He's been watching you
through those cameras.

1522
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:58,907
He's been watching that.

1523
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:05,687
Oh, my God.

1524
01:19:32,196 --> 01:19:34,881
You saw him do this to her?

1525
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:39,753
Okay, we're gonna go.
Come on.

1526
01:19:39,854 --> 01:19:40,787
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Let's go.

1527
01:19:40,888 --> 01:19:42,756
This way's the quickest.

1528
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:57,720
Oh, my God.

1529
01:20:03,377 --> 01:20:05,278
Oh, God.

1530
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:14,387
All right.
We got to go, come on.

1531
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:26,765
Okay, okay.
Come here.

1532
01:20:26,866 --> 01:20:29,301
Listen to me.
I want you to stay right here.

1533
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:30,369
I'm going to get
us out of here.

1534
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,537
I have to get
these keys.

1535
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:34,640
I promise I'll come
right back, okay?

1536
01:20:42,231 --> 01:20:45,751
Shit!

1537
01:20:45,852 --> 01:20:46,968
Little boy, come here!

1538
01:20:48,805 --> 01:20:49,905
Blanca!

1539
01:20:50,006 --> 01:20:51,740
Listen to me,
I'm stuck.

1540
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:52,808
Listen, I need you to run.

1541
01:20:52,909 --> 01:20:54,175
Just start running
as fast as you can

1542
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:56,211
<i>until you find somebody
that you trust, okay?</i>

1543
01:20:56,312 --> 01:20:57,613
And tell them we need help.

1544
01:20:57,714 --> 01:20:59,014
Tell them that-
that Jake and Keir

1545
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:00,866
<i>are at coach Hansen's cabin
and they need help.</i>

1546
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:03,569
I promise I will find you.
Just go.

1547
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,437
<i>Go!</i>

1548
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:57,788
Blanca?

1549
01:22:02,977 --> 01:22:04,344
<i>Blanca?</i>

1550
01:23:04,071 --> 01:23:05,871
Who the fuck are you?

1551
01:23:15,015 --> 01:23:17,249
Oh, my God.

1552
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:19,318
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.

1553
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:28,927
Okay, okay.

1554
01:23:31,765 --> 01:23:33,832
Get off of me!

1555
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:36,702
Who are you?

1556
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:37,753
Oh, my God.

1557
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:40,388
oh, my God. It's you.

1558
01:23:40,489 --> 01:23:42,823
Look, I can explain.

1559
01:23:44,175 --> 01:23:45,209
And-and-and-
stop, stop, stop!

1560
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,411
If you'd just listen to me.

1561
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:47,545
If you'll just listen to me.

1562
01:23:47,646 --> 01:23:49,781
You'll love me
as much as I love you.

1563
01:23:49,882 --> 01:23:51,582
Don't you realize that
I've done this all for us?

1564
01:23:51,683 --> 01:23:52,950
For you?

1565
01:23:53,051 --> 01:23:55,019
If those other people
would have found out,

1566
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,354
they would have stopped it.

1567
01:23:56,455 --> 01:23:58,522
I'm the only one
that really cares about you.

1568
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:00,675
Did you care about
the people in the video?

1569
01:24:00,776 --> 01:24:01,992
They were gonna tell.

1570
01:24:02,093 --> 01:24:03,561
That girl
and her cheerleading coach.

1571
01:24:03,662 --> 01:24:06,331
They found my room.
You can understand, right?

1572
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,132
I already started.
I couldn't stop.

1573
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:13,387
Get your fucking hands
off her.

1574
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:29,853
I went through
a bunch of trouble

1575
01:24:29,954 --> 01:24:30,887
to make this
fucking show for you.

1576
01:24:30,989 --> 01:24:33,156
You're gonna watch it with me.

1577
01:24:33,257 --> 01:24:35,592
I've already seen it.
It's a piece of shit!

1578
01:24:35,693 --> 01:24:37,360
You said you wanted
the opportunity

1579
01:24:37,461 --> 01:24:39,295
to be taken seriously
as an actress.

1580
01:24:39,396 --> 01:24:41,297
And I gave you
that opportunity.

1581
01:24:41,398 --> 01:24:43,133
Because, believe me,
people are gonna

1582
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:44,801
take you seriously now,

1583
01:24:44,902 --> 01:24:46,236
because you should see your face.

1584
01:24:46,337 --> 01:24:49,456
You look really fucking scared.

1585
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:03,103
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1586
01:25:20,086 --> 01:25:21,921
It's okay.

1587
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:24,657
It's okay.

1588
01:25:24,758 --> 01:25:25,891
It's okay.

1589
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:35,934
It's okay.

1590
01:26:05,632 --> 01:26:06,831
Hey.

1591
01:26:06,932 --> 01:26:07,898
Hey.

1592
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,834
How you feeling?

1593
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:11,902
Oh, this has pretty much
been the worst job

1594
01:26:12,004 --> 01:26:13,238
I've ever had.

1595
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:15,423
How's your leg?

1596
01:26:15,524 --> 01:26:16,608
Uh, it hurts.

1597
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:17,976
But, uh,
I'll be fine.

1598
01:26:18,077 --> 01:26:19,478
Vance and Connor found me.

1599
01:26:19,579 --> 01:26:20,712
Got Blanca to thank for that.

1600
01:26:23,615 --> 01:26:24,799
How is she holding up?

1601
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,702
Uh, as well as could be expected.

1602
01:26:27,803 --> 01:26:29,120
God, imagine what the press

1603
01:26:29,222 --> 01:26:30,671
is gonna do with this thing?

1604
01:26:30,772 --> 01:26:33,324
And what about Mike?

1605
01:26:33,425 --> 01:26:35,243
Mike's description matches
the police report

1606
01:26:35,344 --> 01:26:37,779
of a recently escaped
mental patient.

1607
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,998
So who knows what to believe?

1608
01:26:43,168 --> 01:26:46,037
Is it worth it?

1609
01:26:46,138 --> 01:26:49,474
What?

1610
01:26:49,575 --> 01:26:51,292
Being so famous?

1611
01:26:56,548 --> 01:27:00,317
I'll get back to you
on that one.

1612
01:27:00,418 --> 01:27:02,319
<i>Authorities say</i>

1613
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,503
a grisly series
of murders took place

1614
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:05,822
all in an effort to impress
hollywood starlet

1615
01:27:05,923 --> 01:27:07,107
<i>Blanca Champion.</i>

1616
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:09,410
<i>Champion's involvement with,
of all things,</i>

1617
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:10,644
<i>a reality
television crew-</i>

1618
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,784
Hold on a second.

1619
01:27:43,545 --> 01:27:44,877
Wait, what is that?

1620
01:27:46,981 --> 01:27:49,181
It's a bullet-proof vest.

1621
01:28:15,009 --> 01:28:17,994
What do I think of what actually
happened in White Plains?

1622
01:28:18,095 --> 01:28:19,528
My God, I thought
it was tragic.

1623
01:28:19,629 --> 01:28:23,433
It was-it was
just tragic.

1624
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:24,600
And on the other hand,

1625
01:28:24,701 --> 01:28:25,969
it was some
of my client's best work.

1626
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:27,403
You know?

1627
01:28:27,504 --> 01:28:31,507
But what are you gonna do?
What can you do?

1628
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:35,310
We did send flowers.

1629
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:36,511
Not just Blanca.

1630
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:39,348
We sent them to families
of the dead people too.

1631
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:42,217
You know, I always knew
that sound guy was creepy.

1632
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:45,153
I mean, it doesn't take
that much time

1633
01:28:45,254 --> 01:28:47,522
to hook a microphone
to a bra strap.

1634
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:49,057
I was trying
to be professional,

1635
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:52,060
but there's a limit.

1636
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,528
Mike, I don't quite
understand why

1637
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,163
he's so obsessed
with Blanca Champion,

1638
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:56,398
to be completely
honest with you.

1639
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:59,067
Um, but no,
I mean, hey,

1640
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:01,736
listen, uh, I think he should
have just written a letter.

1641
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,138
I think that
would have been-

1642
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:04,506
I think that would
have been fine.

1643
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:05,607
I think that would have
sort of

1644
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,042
gotten the point across.

1645
01:29:07,143 --> 01:29:10,445
If you're asking me,
it was tough love.

1646
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:12,014
But it was love.

1647
01:29:12,115 --> 01:29:15,283
After the killing spree,
a local station in Minnesota

1648
01:29:15,385 --> 01:29:17,919
offered me a spot
co-hosting their morning show.

1649
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:21,490
I also received an offer
from the Christian Teen Network.

1650
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,757
But my agent Seaton thought
that was, you know,

1651
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,393
just embarrassing.

1652
01:29:25,494 --> 01:29:27,661
Seaton thinks
Jesus is overrated.

1653
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:29,596
I'd like people to know
that the reason

1654
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,732
Blanca threw that
hot latte at my crotch

1655
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,634
was because she caught
me setting up a camcorder

1656
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:36,970
to record our
next little bonefest.

1657
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:38,305
She wasn't too happy
about that.

1658
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:39,907
Uh, from what
the cops told me,

1659
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:41,475
Mike escaped
the mental institution

1660
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,244
by swiping some
sort of pills that,

1661
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:45,279
once taken, uh,

1662
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,880
diminish your vital signs
to a point where

1663
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,549
they're almost
undetectable.

1664
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:51,252
And, um, I guess he used
the same trick,

1665
01:29:51,287 --> 01:29:53,854
And he had, like,
a bullet-proof vest.

1666
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,190
I mean this guys is-
was, like-

1667
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:58,626
seriously knew what he was
doing, covered all his bases.

1668
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:02,530
Pshh-went right over my head.
I had no idea.

1669
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:06,567
Mike, the sound guy,
is a pain in the ass.

1670
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:10,103
Do I think Blanca was surprised,
uh, when she won the Emmy?

1671
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:11,505
I think she
was totally surprised.

1672
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:12,539
Yeah, absolutely.

1673
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,006
I wasn't.
Fuck no.

1674
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:16,343
God, I-I saw the d-dailies,
and the network knew it.

1675
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,379
I mean, she hit it
out of the park.

1676
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,248
And thank God that, uh,
crazy sound guy

1677
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,650
left the security
cameras rolling,

1678
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,085
because the-that Emmy
really drove up her quota.

1679
01:30:26,186 --> 01:30:27,354
I mean, I'm getting
5 million bucks

1680
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,421
for her to do
Hush, Hush 2.

1681
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:31,658
Vance, uh,
I don't know, for-

1682
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,827
I'm really glad,
but, uh-

1683
01:30:33,927 --> 01:30:36,195
for some reason,
has some sort of a, uh,

1684
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:39,366
bottle opener/bear trap opener
on his key chain.

1685
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:43,269
Uh, I've been opening
bear traps since I was a kid.

1686
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:45,204
So it really wasn't
that big of a deal.

1687
01:30:45,305 --> 01:30:47,974
Did I-did I get
the message from Jake

1688
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,176
about finding the hand
in the refriger-yeah.

1689
01:30:50,277 --> 01:30:51,811
Well, I was, uh,
trying to listen to it,

1690
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:53,713
but I was getting
on a plane at L.A.X.,

1691
01:30:53,814 --> 01:30:56,015
and Hillary Clinton
and the fucking Secret Service

1692
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:57,684
had taken over
the Lieutenant's Club.

1693
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,185
So I was out
with the masses.

1694
01:30:59,286 --> 01:31:00,887
And it's just ear-splitting
in that terminal.

1695
01:31:00,987 --> 01:31:01,920
I don't know how
you people do it.

1696
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:04,923
Affiliated, uh,
has hired me

1697
01:31:05,024 --> 01:31:07,926
TO Direct, uh,
Hush, Hush Part Two,

1698
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:10,396
which, we all know,
is Blanca Champion's next film.

1699
01:31:10,497 --> 01:31:12,130
What's next for me
is, uh-

1700
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:13,766
I'm actually playing
the character of Jake

1701
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:16,835
in the film version
of the White Plains massacre.

1702
01:31:16,936 --> 01:31:18,203
It was Blanca's idea.

1703
01:31:18,304 --> 01:31:20,105
And my lawyer's.

1704
01:31:20,206 --> 01:31:23,308
I'm fairly certain
that Blanca chick wants me.

1705
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,176
I'm beginning
to think this workout

1706
01:31:25,278 --> 01:31:26,845
wasn't such
a bright idea.

1707
01:31:26,946 --> 01:31:29,915
Uh, when Jake asked me to, uh,

1708
01:31:30,016 --> 01:31:32,050
go to coach Hansen's house
in the middle of the night,

1709
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:33,318
I think-

1710
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,753
My first reaction was I think

1711
01:31:34,854 --> 01:31:36,354
I threw up a little
in the back of my mouth.

1712
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:37,989
Okay, can we wrap
this thing up?

1713
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:39,257
'Cause I gotta take
Montana Moorehead

1714
01:31:39,358 --> 01:31:40,759
to the Daisy Awards tonight,
and I never keep

1715
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,594
a client waiting, so-

1716
01:31:42,695 --> 01:31:46,197
# so wrap me up in velvet #

1717
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:48,834
# velvet baby #

1718
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:53,103
# I wanna live forever #

1719
01:31:53,204 --> 01:31:57,475
# I want to be immortalized #

1720
01:31:57,576 --> 01:32:00,578
# velvet baby #

1721
01:32:08,704 --> 01:32:11,739
# and he's trying hard
to capture #

1722
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,642
# the little bits #

1723
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:17,010
# of immortality # #
