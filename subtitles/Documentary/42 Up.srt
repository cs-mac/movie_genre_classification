00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,067
Dodgers check into a hotel,
a, uh, a decent, good hotel.

160
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,541
You're worn out from the road.

161
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,426
Some clerk won't give you the pen
to sign in with.

162
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,182
"We got no room for you, boy. Not even
down in the coal bin where you belong."

163
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,311
Team stops at a restaurant.
Waiter won't take your order.

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,391
"Didn't you see the sign on the door?
No niggers allowed."

165
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,340
What are you gonna do then?
Fight him? Ruin all my plans?

166
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,540
Answer me, you black son of a bitch!

167
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,105
You want a player who doesn't
have the guts to fight back?

168
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,225
No.

169
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,105
No.

170
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,588
I want a player who's got the guts
not to fight back.

171
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,267
People aren't gonna like this.

172
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,540
They're gonna do anything
to get you to react.

173
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,625
Echo a curse with a curse
and, uh, they'll hear only yours.

174
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,468
Follow a blow with a blow and they'll say,
"The Negro lost his temper."

175
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,669
That "The Negro does not belong."

176
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,141
Your enemy will be out in force...

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,747
...and you cannot meet him
on his own low ground.

178
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,464
We win with hitting, running, fielding.
Only that.

179
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,830
We win if the world is convinced
of two things:

180
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,304
That you are a fine gentleman
and a great baseball player.

181
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,027
Like our Savior...

182
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,662
...you gotta have the guts...

183
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,149
...to turn the other cheek.

184
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,909
Can you do it?

185
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,061
You give me a uniform...

186
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,708
...you give me a, heh,
number on my back...

187
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,862
...and I'll give you the guts.

188
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,547
(PHONE RINGING)

189
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,946
Hello?

190
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,511
JACKIE (OVER PHONE): <i>Rae...</i>

191
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,821
(CHUCKLES)

192
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,505
Jack.

193
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,550
I'm in Brooklyn.

194
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,341
Brooklyn? For what?

195
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,229
Uh...

196
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,304
I don't want to say on the phone.

197
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,182
In fact, I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

198
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,065
What's going on? Aren't you supposed
to be playing in Chicago?

199
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,183
We've been tested, you and me.

200
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,187
(OVER PHONE) <i>We've done everything
the right way. We have.</i>

201
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,621
Me trying to make money,
you finishing school.

202
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,224
We don't owe the world a thing.

203
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,111
(OVER PHONE) <i>Only each other.</i>

204
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,066
Jack, what are you talking about?
What is going on? What happened?

205
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,910
Will you marry me, Rae?

206
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,425
Absolutely.

207
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,824
(LAUGHS)

208
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,431
Yes. Yes.

209
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,107
When?

210
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,024
Um...

211
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,262
How about right now?

212
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,548
Did my mom look happy?

213
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,907
Yes. You know your mother loves me.

214
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,782
Did my gram look happy?

215
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,710
Yes.

216
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,711
My brother look happy?

217
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,828
- Heh, your brother?
- Ha, ha.

218
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,468
Everyone looked happy. I've never seen
so many happy-looking people.

219
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,188
Did Jack Robinson look happy?

220
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,189
What if I can't make you happy?

221
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,150
Too late.

222
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,309
You already do.

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,988
It's you and me, Rae.

224
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,389
Ooh, ha, ha.

225
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,542
Um...

226
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,267
- Till the wheels fall off.
- Hmm.

227
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,664
Oh, Jack, the world is waiting for us.

228
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,267
The world can wait one more night.

229
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,340
Are you coming, Mrs. Robinson?

230
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,191
I'd follow you anywhere, Mr. Robinson.

231
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,305
Okay.

232
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,624
Okay.

233
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,541
WOMAN: (ON PA)
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

234
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,021
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

235
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,261
"Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.
Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour."

236
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,545
Are you okay?

237
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,182
I've just never seen one before.

238
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,905
JACKIE: Oh.

239
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,190
Yeah, we're not in Pasadena anymore.

240
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,385
Rae?

241
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,907
Rae?

242
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,230
Rae!

243
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,142
Oh, boy.

244
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,261
We have to lighten the plane.

245
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,546
There's some bad weather east of here.

246
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,431
A heavy plane is dangerous.

247
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,068
So someone'll have to cancel.

248
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,270
Look, I'm with the Brooklyn Dodger
organization.

249
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,831
I have to get down to Daytona.

250
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,586
I'm supposed to report to spring training
in the morning.

251
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,387
WOMAN 1: We'll do our best to get you there
by tomorrow, but it might be the day after.

252
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,787
- Jack.
WOMAN 2: - Right this way.

253
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,266
You gave away our seats?

254
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,387
You get us back on that plane.

255
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,701
You get us back on that plane right now.

256
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,423
Do you wanna call the sheriff...

257
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,464
...or should I?

258
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,271
MAN: Watch your step.

259
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,787
Oop, there he is. There's my boy.

260
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,625
Folks, stand back,
we'll get the bags out.

261
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,147
Jackie Robinson.

262
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,345
Wendell Smith.

263
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,546
<i>Pittsburgh Courier.</i>

264
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,426
A reporter?

265
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,426
(CHUCKLES)

266
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,346
Mr. Rickey sent me to meet you.
I'm gonna be your Boswell.

267
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,541
My who?

268
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,986
SMITH: Your chronicler.

269
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,348
Your advance man.

270
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,987
Hell, even your chauffeur.

271
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,471
Mrs. Robinson.

272
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,025
It's Rachel.

273
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,827
Man, you two looked wiped out.

274
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,021
You got a car?

275
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,944
Uh-huh.

276
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,867
SMITH: Brooklyn plays downtown.
Montreal just a few blocks from here.

277
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,388
Joe and Duff Harris live here.

278
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,906
He gets out the Negro vote.
He does a lot of good for colored people.

279
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,661
Now, Mr. Rickey set it up himself.

280
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,220
"If the Robinsons can't stay
at the hotels...

281
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,463
...they should stay someplace
that represents something."

282
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,510
You'll stay here all but a few days
at the end of the week...

283
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,427
...when the Dodger organization goes
to Sanford. It's about 45 minutes away.

284
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,146
You'll stay here, Rachel.

285
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,344
This'll be your home
when Jackie has to travel.

286
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,109
Uh, where are the other wives staying?

287
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,501
Welcome to Daytona Beach.

288
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,541
- There are no other wives.
WOMAN: - You must be Jackie.

289
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,829
You're the only one that Mr. Rickey
allowed to spring training.

290
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,946
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm. After you.

291
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,101
MAN 1: Come on, now, skip.

292
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,268
MAN 2: All right, here we go, boys!

293
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,340
- I got it! I got it!
- I got it!

294
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,471
That was a pretty big hop, there.

295
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,860
- You got the hop!
- Ha, ha.

296
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,786
Spring training.
It's where we work out our differences.

297
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,145
DUROCHER: All right!

298
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,463
You boys continue
to pretend you're ballplayers.

299
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,148
- Morning, Leo.
- Good morning, Mr. Rickey.

300
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,266
How are they doing?

301
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,141
They're rusty, but we'll have them
oiled up in no time, ready to go.

302
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,790
Oop.

303
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,549
First day of spring training.

304
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,351
Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know
how it feels.

305
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,511
It's okay.

306
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,582
That's not exactly a headline.

307
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,870
It's all I got.

308
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,988
Look, Jack, right now,
it's just me asking you.

309
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,343
<i>But there's gonna be The New York Times
and the Sporting News.</i>

310
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,822
- You should think about it.
- If they ask something, I'll answer it.

311
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,624
Okay, well here's one for you:

312
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,386
What if one of these white pitchers
throws at you?

313
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,867
Look, they're gonna try to get under
your skin. You need to be ready.

314
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,829
Listen, listen.

315
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,591
You know...

316
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,583
You know how when you're
at the plate...

317
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,186
...you want to see the ball
come in slow?

318
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,504

Hey, Jack, is this about politics?

You're not playing him at shortstop,
huh, Clay?

342
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,021
Oh, he's getting by on a quick release.
His arm's too weak for short.

343
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,581
I think second base is his spot.

I agree.

to act like gentlemen around him.

drawn up and you're all going to sign.

You know what you can do
with your petition.

If Robinson can help us win,
and everything I have seen says he can...

803
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,187
...then he is gonna play on this ball club!

804
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,471

Only the first.

808
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,380
There are more coming right behind him
every day...

809
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,862

and they wanna play.

come scratching and diving.

pay a little more attention to your work...

01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,309
Welcome to opening day of the 1947
Brooklyn Dodgers season.

972
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:16,267
As many of you know,
the Dodgers finished 96-60 last season.

973
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,344
Respectable, but still two games
behind St. Louis...

974
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,071
...who would, of course, go on to take
the World Series.

Jackie Robinson.

980
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,829
Jackie is very definitely brunet.

<i>Johnny Sain looking in.
When he's got that fastball working...</i>

987
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,669

a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.</i>

988
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,346
<i>Oh, and it's a hard-hit ball down
the third baseline.</i>

989
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,629
<i>Elliott gobbles it up and makes
the long toss across the diamond.</i>

You blew it!

995
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:22,190
BARBER: <i>It was a close play at first. A tie
usually goes to the runner but not this time.</i>

996
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:26,265
So that first big league hit
will remain to be seen.

997
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,988
So the Giants got Mize batting cleanup.

998
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,944
Shame about Leo.

999
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,787
Inevitable, I suppose.

1000
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,705

01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:53,271
Hell of a thing
when a man's got good health...

1007
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,831
...and plenty of money...

1008
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,863
...and absolutely nothing to do.

1009
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:00,388
Heh, well, I'm perfectly happy.

1010
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,065
Is that so?

1011
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,541
You know, when I took the Cleveland
uniform off two years ago...

1012
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:11,984
...I promised the missus I'd never put
on another uniform again.

1013
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,064
So the roses are beautiful...

1014
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,427
...and, uh, I sleep better too.

1015
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,584
Roses and sleep
are two wonderful things, Burt.

1016
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:26,110
But sleep you can get when you're in your
casket, and flowers look great on top of it.

1017
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,827
But, uh, you don't look like a dead man
to me, Burt.

1018
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,905
What's this about, Branch?

1019
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,746
I need you to manage the Dodgers
for me, Burt.

1020
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,101
- No.
- Now, wait.

1021
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,504
We're a ship without a captain
and there's a typhoon coming.

1022
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,748
I'm sorry, no.

1023
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,590
Don't you miss the game, Burt?

1024
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,668
Working with the players?

1025

Helping to get the best out of the team?

Go on, look me in the eye
and tell me you don't.

Baseball's the only life
for an old pepper pot like me.

1028

But I promised my wife, Branch.

1029
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,464
You promised her you'd never
put on a uniform again.

1030
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,861
You didn't promise her
you wouldn't manage.

1031
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,466
Wear a suit and a tie like Connie Mack.

I'm your new manager.

1041
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,021
I don't have much to say to you.

1042
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,631
Just, uh...

1043

...don't be afraid...

...of old Burt Shotton as your manager.

1045

You can win the pennant in spite of me.

1101
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:33,270
Leave your hat on the ground, maybe
somebody'll throw some money in it, huh?

1102
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,391
Put on a little show, nigger.

1103
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,508
Do a little shuffle.

1104

CHAPMAN: All right, nigger.

01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,666
Let's do this. You ought to be careful
in this sunshine.

that you sent down...

1111
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,908
...to the International League, huh?

1112
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,023

I hate to be the one to tell you.

Why don't you look in the mirror?

I'm supposed to just let this go on?

RICKEY: These men have to live with themselves.

I have to live with myself too.

Is that so?

1183

If you fight, they won't say
that Chapman forced you to.

1184
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:36,902
They'll say that you're in over your head.
That you don't belong here.

You know what you're here for,
don't you, huh?

1217
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,504
You're here to get the nigger dollars

You don't belong here, nigger!

Sit down.
You sit down or I sit you down.

1221
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,629
You're the problem, you disgrace.
What the hell kind of man are you?

1222
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:08,308
You know he can't fight back. Why don't
you try picking on someone who can.

1223
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,861
I'm not gonna fight you,
get thrown out of the game.

Stanky now having a chin-wag
with his ex-teammate Chapman.

Stanky from second
and Chapman from the dugout.

1227
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,821
We'll have to wait and see
what the umpire does...

1228
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,870
...since he's well within his rights
to kick Stanky out.

Hey, 12! That's enough.
Back to the dugout.

Hey, Stank? What's it like
being a nigger's nigger?

1233

I don't know, Chapman. What's it

Wonder how that happened.

- Why, any decent-minded person would...
- Sympathy, Harold.

of our homeland."

1405
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:33,980
A Jew probably wrote that.

It's in the damn papers!

This is not good, Ben.

1409
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:48,311
Makes the entire Phillies organization
look racist.

1410
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,985
You gotta do something about it.

Me? Look, I'm defending baseball.

1412

It's time for you to step up
and defend the Phillies.

1413
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:02,910
This started on the field, it's gonna end on
the field, and we're done talking about it.

- Hey.

Excuse me. Hi. Jackie.

01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,785
Uh, Wendell, um...

1418
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,187
A request came in.

1419
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:27,544
Uh, Ben Chapman, he's the, uh, manager
for the Phillies. You knew that.

1420
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,862
Uh, he'd like his photo taken with you.

1421
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,111
You been drinking, Harold?

1422

(CHUCKLING)

1423
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:39,661
No. No. I wish.

1424
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,909
No, Mr. Rickey, uh,
he thinks it's a good idea.

1425
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:47,063
He says it's gonna be in every sports page
across the country.

1426
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,861
An example that even the most hardened
man can change.

1427
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:57,184
Chapman hasn't changed.
He's just trying to save face.

1428
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,822
Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter
if he's changed.

1429
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,381
As long as it looks like he's changed.

1430
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,906
Jackie, you've seen the questions
come in slow.

1431
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,304
Now, just see this photo come in
even slower.

1432
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:15,385
Chapman said he'd come down here.
Or, uh, he could meet you in the runway.

1433
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,826
No.

1434
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,944
On the field.

1435
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:25,471
Where everyone can see.

1436
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:29,341
Did World War Ill break out?
Look at all of y'all.

1437
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:33,183
They even dug you up, Baum.
This must be important.

1438
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,388
Listen, I want to say something, uh...

1439
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:38,223
Jackie's been accepted into baseball...

1440
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:41,827
...and the Philadelphia organization
wish him all the luck that we can.

1441
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,981
I just hope that our trial of fire
has helped him along.

Sure.

01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:32,867
Hmm?

1469
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,227
If they knew you,
they would be ashamed.

1470
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:52,069
What can I do for you, Pee Wee?

1471
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:56,462
Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this.

1472
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:59,147
The series in Cincinnati next week?

1473
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:02,304
Yes. Important road trip.

1474
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,546
- We're only three games out of first.
- Yes, sir.

1475
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,705
Now, you know I'm from Kentucky.

1476
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:13,141
Then Cincinnati
will nearly be a home game for you.

1477
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:15,305
Well...

1478
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:18,869
...I got this letter.

1479
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,987
Apparently, some people aren't too happy
about me playing with Robinson.

1480
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,505
Huh?

Well, it's not typical to me, sir.

(CHUCKLES)

1488
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,904
How many of those letters
have you gotten, Pee Wee?

1489
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:55,302
Just the one. Ain't that enough?

1490
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,071
What are those?

1491
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:05,027
Well, I'll tell you what they aren't.

1492
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:10,027
They aren't letters
from the Jackie Robinson fan club.

1493
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:19,388
"Get out of baseball
or your baby boy will die."

"Quit baseball or your nigger wife..."

"Get out of the game or be killed."

1496
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,145
Does Jackie know?

1497
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,541
Well, of course he does.

1498
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,424
And the FBI.

1499
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,750
They're taking a threat in Cincinnati
pretty seriously.

1500
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:48,861
So excuse me if I don't get too upset
about you getting called a carpetbagger.

1501
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,670
You should be proud.

1502
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:57,150
Well, I'd just like to play ball, sir.
That's all.

1503
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,424
Oh, I understand.

1504
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,265
I bet Jackie just wants to play ball.

1505
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:05,503
I bet he wishes he wasn't leading
the League in hit by pitch.

1506
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:08,584
I bet he wishes people didn't want
to kill him.

The world's not so simple anymore.

1508
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,422
Guess it never was.

1509
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,584
We just, uh...

1510
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:21,266
Baseball ignored it, now we can't.

1511
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:28,020

Boss, we did it.

01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:33,221
We did it, we swept Cincinnati!

RICKEY: (OVER PHONE) <i>Great, Harold.</i>

1710
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,829
One more win could do it.

1711
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:39,028
Who's pitching tomorrow
for the Pirates?

1712
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:41,830
Ostermueller.

1713

BARBER: <i>Fritz Ostermueller on the mound.</i>

1714
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,344
<i>He's 12-8 on the season.</i>

1715
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,741
<i>A big game today in Pittsburgh.</i>

1716
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:54,109
<i>A win and the Dodgers will have clinched
the National League pennant...</i>

<i>...Yankees having already clinched
in the American League.</i>

<i>There's bad blood here...</i>

1719
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:02,026
<i>...as Ostermueller beaned Robinson
in the head earlier in the season...</i>

1720
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,751
<i>...prompting quite a rhubarb at the time.</i>

1721
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:08,383
<i>Teams have gone
their separate ways since...</i>

1722
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:11,020
<i>...with Ostermueller left standing
in the Dodgers' way...</i>

1723
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,791
<i>...as they chase the pennant
that eluded them last year.</i>

1724
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,749
Come on, Jackie, let's go!

1725
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,260
BARBER: <i>Here comes the pitch.</i>

1726
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:23,868
<i>And Robinson takes outside. Ball one.</i>

1727
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:27,428
- Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!
- You don't belong here.

1728
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,145
And you never will.

BARBER: <i>Robinson crowding the plate.</i>

1730

to a pitcher all season.</i>

MAN: There you go, Jackie!

1732
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:39,064
You got nothing for him, Ostermueller!
But he's got something for you!

01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,382
BARBER: <i>Ostermueller winds and throws.</i>

1734
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:45,344
<i>Low and away, ball two.</i>

1735
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:47,622
<i>Fritz seems
to be pitching around Jackie...</i>

1736
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:50,750
<i>...or as they say in the trade,
trying to get him to chase.</i>

1737
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,902
<i>Robinson's having
a fine rookie standard...</i>

1738
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:56,143
<i>...batting .301 with 31 doubles
and 10 home runs.</i>

1739
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:59,429
<i>He has stolen 27 bases this season
and has yet to be thrown out attempting.</i>

<i>Robinson patient,
waiting for something he can swing on.</i>

1744

Give me something.

1745
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,905
Give me something I can hit.

1746

You want it?

What are you afraid of?
