Please Enjoy The Movies

3
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,888
I want to propose a toast.

4
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,323
Today is a very special day
for me...

5
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,834
...so I'm nervous,
and I wrote down my speech.

6
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,974
A toast to the kindest, most gentle...

7
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,076
...and most wonderful man
in the world:

8
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,438
Papa.

9
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:23,207
Thank you for making my dream
come true.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,576
And now maybe let's dance.

11
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,523
Stop.

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,494
He's okay.

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,252
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Sorry. I'm so sorry.

14
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,083
I'll get more towels. Be right back.

15
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,600
Ivan Borisovich?

16
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,770
Ivan Borisovich!

17
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,776
The boss is down!
The hitter's dressed like a waiter!

18
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,855
Cover all exits! Cover all exits!

19
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,232
Sasha! Sasha!
He's heading your way!

20
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,361
Sasha!

21
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,806
Sasha, you hear me?

22
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,739
Sasha?

23
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,781
You told me
there'll be no loose ends.

24
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,456
-We got it down to one.
-Who?

25
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,352
Flint.

26
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,489
You have access to the best
technology...

27
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,068
...and yet a man with a comatose
wife in tow can elude you for--

28
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,329
For how many years now?

29
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,769
This is what he does best,
and he is the best.

30
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,933
He's also the only one outside
this room who can bury us.

31
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,305
Okay, guys, look, let's think.

32
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,640
Is Flint really that much
of a problem?

33
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,283
I mean, look, if he shows,
we can easily take him out.

34
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,048
You had a good idea to start.
Get rid of the bad guys.

35
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,420
Hire professionals for the job.
Fine. I backed you.

36
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,030
But then you two idiots got greedy
selling weapons back to criminals.

37
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,358
Hey, you got your share.

38
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,625
Shut up.

39
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,703
The U.N. hearings
about this whole mess of yours...

40
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,071
...start at the end of the month.

41
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,509
If there's any fallout,
any problem whatsoever...

42
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,139
...I promise I will land this clusterfuck
squarely on your shoulders.

43
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,049
And you both will spend the rest
of your natural lives behind bars.

44
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,682
Okay. We get it.

45
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,452
For your sake, I hope you do.

46
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,189
Because I hear they just love
cute, dirty cops in prison.

47
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,904
-Asshole.
-But he's a smart asshole.

48
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,271
And he'll waste no time burying us
to protect himself.

49
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,379
-So, what do we do?
-Find Flint.

50
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,139
Take him out.

51
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,316
How?

52
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,676
He was the best on our payroll.

53
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,879
-You said so yourself.
-We use bait.

54
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,717
You mean Polo.

55
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,762
We pay off the Ukrainians,
release Polo, put a price on his head.

56
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,556
What makes you think Flint'll show?

57
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,564
It's personal, he's obsessed.
Let's use that.

58
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,194
It's our only play.

59
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,350
Good morning, Mr. Flint.

60
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,577
I've got the morning shift
at the clinic.

61
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,119
Hang on, Mrs. Pavlescu.

62
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,122
I just wanted to give you this.

63
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,783
Oh, thank you.
You are much too kind.

64
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,624
-As always.
-Please. Anna and l....

65
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,562
We owe you a lot more than that.

66
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,567
Honestly, I don't know
what we'd do without you.

67
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,262
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

68
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,407
Oh, almost forgot.

69
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,940
I was getting groceries yesterday...

70
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,640
...and Gabi at the store
said there was a man in town.

71
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,684
-What man?
-A foreigner.

72
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,084
He's staying at the motel.

73
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,957
I thought you'd like to know.

74
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,926
Okay, thanks, Mrs. Pavlescu.

75
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,729
Bye.

76
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,078
How did you find me?

77
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,609
-Good to see you too.
-How did you find me?

78
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,182
I'm not gonna ask you again.

79
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,448
It was just a hunch.

80
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,918
There's no way
I could have been followed.

81
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,314
Anna....

82
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,226
Anna told me how much you two loved
coming up here when you first met.

83
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:21,457
I've been driving through every village
between here and the Austrian border.

84
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,534
What do you want?

85
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,503
-There's a job.
-I'm out of the business.

86
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,539
-Ticket's a million.
-I don't need the money.

87
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,301
I see you again...

88
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,877
...I'm sending you home in a box.

89
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,550
Target's Polo.

90
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,510
He's being released.

91
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,217
Released?

92
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,255
The Ukrainians are letting him go.

93
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,917
I'm willing to bet he either cut a deal
or snitched on someone. Whatever.

94
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,632
-Or he's bait.
-For you?

95
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,768
New administration.
Maybe lnterpol cleaning house.

96
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,370
They still want their money back.
I mean, you did--

97
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,137
Roland, don't.

98
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,140
Why not?

99
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,171
Because I wasn't followed.
Because I'm not setting you up.

100
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,850
I just thought we could make
a few bucks together, you know?

101
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,350
Turn on the music.

102
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,680
-What?
-The radio.

103
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,154
Louder.

104
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,602
Roland, come on.

105
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,104
Close your eyes.

106
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:40,042
-You've been in these woods too long.
-Close your eyes now.

107
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,416
Roland, think about
what you're doing, man.

108
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,982
Just think about it, will you?

109
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,609
I mean, I'm not setting you up.
All these years I didn't say nothing.

110
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,884
I mean, come on, man, just think.
We've got a history here.

111
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:57,986
Roland?

112
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,685
Welcome, my friend.

113
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,495
The Russian project
went perfectly.

114
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,761
The Bulgarians send their thanks.

115
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,802
-Chocolate?
-Too fattening.

116
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:19,033
Very well, but I have goodies
you cannot refuse.

117
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,479
Your usual.
South African, special cut.

118
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,985
Today's value exactly...

119
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,986
...550,000.

120
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,190
The extra 50 is a bonus.

121
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,300
The clients are extremely happy.

122
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,359
I aim to please.

123
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,538
And even better news,
another potential contract.

124
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,198
Double your usual fee.

125
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,505
Who's the mark?

126
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,341
Polo Yakur. A well-connected
gentleman of some reputation.

127
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,917
He's in prison.

128
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,856
-lt will be a difficult job.
-He's being released today.

129
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,551
I'll have more details shortly.

130
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,888
-And the client?
-Wishes to remain anonymous.

131
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,535
I'll take it.

132
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,834
I was hoping you'd say that.

133
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,701
I wonder if one day you'll feel
you've made enough money...

134
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,207
...to move to a better neighborhood.

135
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,770
I like my neighborhood.

136
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,380
People mind their own business.

137
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,248
Of course.

138
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,628
Hey, boys.

139
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,598
Welcome home.

140
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,006
Where's my brother?

141
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,538
-Sorry, boss. He got picked up.
-When?

142
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,839
Last week.
Some guy talked too much.

143
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,616
Let's drive.

144
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,893
Roland.

145
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,330
Roland.

146
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,368
Roland, help. Roland!

147
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,504
Roland.

148
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,409
Roland. Roland.

149
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,943
Roland, help!

150
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,722
Roland.

151
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,855
Roland.

152
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,753
Bullshit. When I'm back all this shit
better be inside, unpacked.

153
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,587
And you'd better be dressed
to go to work, understand?

154
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,785
Do you understand?

155
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,666
Hey, how you doing?

156
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,066
We're your new neighbors.
October and me.

157
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,707
That your place?

158
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,611
Yeah.

159
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,141
See, I'm looking
into expanding my business...

160
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,911
...and I'm thinking
about buying the whole floor.

161
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,653
I'd make it worth your while, huh?

162
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,885
I doubt it.

163
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,266
What the fuck you looking at?
Move the boxes.

164
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,766
-Hello.
-It's me. I want in.

165
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:54,235
-I'll take the Polo job.
-It's off the market.

166
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,567
A million bucks
is a tough ticket to keep open.

167
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,471
I don't care about the money.

168
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,736
Just get me the intel,
maybe some gear.

169
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,073
It's a bad idea.

170
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,079
We don't want to get
in someone's way.

171
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,878
This type of money,
there's serious people involved.

172
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,453
Culley. You owe me.

173
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:16,224
Look, I'm sorry
for looking for you, all right?

174
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,453
Just lay low.

175
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,597
You're safe. Anna's safe.

176
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,255
How long is that gonna last?

177
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,492
I took out half his outfit
and put Polo away.

178
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,659
He's gonna come after me
to finish the job.

179
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,135
No, it's better if I hit him first.

180
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,472
Come on, man.
I need your help here.

181
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,982
All right, all right.

182
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,648
-You can come stay here.
-That's good.

183
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,782
-See you soon.
-Yeah.

184
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,150
I should have my head examined.

185
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,326
Here. Looks like
Polo's brother, Danzo...

186
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,265
...is gonna walk
at the trial tomorrow.

187
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,701
The prosecution's witness
is mysteriously missing.

188
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,502
That's our shot. Now, if we're lucky,
Polo comes to get him in person.

189
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,904
Okay, let's leak it out.

190
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,074
Good idea. Flint'll have
his ears to the ground.

191
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,089
My sources say our friend
might be visiting...

192
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,893
...a downtown courthouse tomorrow.

193
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,893
Checkmate.

194
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,302
You are full of surprises, my friend.

195
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,485
Municipal courthouse.

196
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,589
Yup.

197
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,628
-How good's the intel?
-Solid.

198
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,959
Double-blind, the usual.

199
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,768
Could be your old friends
from lnterpol.

200
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,242
Sure you wanna go through with it?

201
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,345
Don't worry about me, Mom.

202
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,971
I've done this once or twice before.

203
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,429
You see something you like?

204
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,885
Danzo.

205
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,112
Danzo. Danzo. Can you hear me?

206
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,116
Look at me. Look at me, Danzo.
Danzo.

207
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,487
Shooter in the van.
Shooter in the van.

208
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,320
The motherfucker shot my brother.

209
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,556
Please settle down.

210
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,462
What the fuck you mean
"settle down"?

211
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,602
Fuck.

212
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,283
Danzo. Careful. Watch his head.

213
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,517
Come on. Where's the ambulance?

214
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,484
Come on. Come on.

215
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,435
Gun.

216
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:57,274


217
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,488
Stop. Hey you, freeze.

218
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,134
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Stop, stop.

219
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,144
Move, move, move.

220
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,864
-We're dead.
-No, we're not.

221
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,130
It's working. We drew Flint out.

222
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,672
-You don't think we spooked him?
-You see his face?

223
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,538
We've got him hooked.
He won't quit till Polo's dead.

224
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,110
We need more guns, hardware.

225
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,444
-We can't do this alone.
-Good point. Time to call Herrod.

226
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,326
I talked to the doctor.

227
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,130
It was poison-tipped.
Very fast-acting.

228
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,536
He said whoever did this
knows his toxins.

229
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,737
Keep it safe...

230
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,911
...so when I find the animal
that killed my brother...

231
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,847
...I can use it to carve out his eyes.

232
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,088
I don't believe in fairy tales.

233
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,996
The minute they told me
I was being released...

234
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,827
...I smelled something rotten.

235
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,334
I don't think either
the sniper that missed...

236
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:50,270
...or Robin Hood
was there by coincidence.

237
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,072
Maybe you should lay low.
We could be on a boat tonight.

238
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,043
I'm not going anywhere
until I find who killed Danzo.

239
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,948
Come on, we have work to do.

240
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,923
Now we know it was a setup.

241
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,651
I'll make calls,
have you out of the country by tonight.

242
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,818
-I'll handle it.
-No.

243
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,958
Find out if Polo's cousin
still owns those factories by the docks.

244
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,630
You sure about that?

245
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,001
-Yeah.
-All right. I'll make some calls.

246
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,461
Nobody talks shit to me.

247
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,098
You always got something to say.

248
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,408
Talk some more shit to me.
Stupid bitch.

249
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,638
-Stop it.
-That's enough.

250
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,256
You still got something to say?

251
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,532
You're disturbing me.

252
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,206
Go and cool off.

253
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,615
Go.

254
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,350
You okay?

255
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,853
No.

256
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,560
Excuse me.

257
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,835
I'm trying to practice.

258
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,406
I'm locked out.

259
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,211
Sit.

260
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,201
Put this on. It will help.

261
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,742
-Hello?
-Despite your unforeseen difficulties...

262
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,855
-...the contract remains open.
-Wait.

263
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,695
Don't move. Stay there. Okay?

264
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,066
There was another shooter.
I thought it was exclusive.

265
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:43,105
It is. The client has confirmed
that a third party may be involved.

266
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,573
A third party with personal issues.

267
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,339
I also have a possible location
for our polo-playing friend.

268
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,693
You need to leave now.

269
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,359
I'm locked out.

270
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,098
You can wait in the hallway.

271
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,758
Please.

272
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,765
Come on, you have to go now.

273
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,773
Please, can I stay here
just for tonight?

274
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,076
Come on, out.

275
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,679
It'll take him till tomorrow
to calm down.

276
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,442
He sees me now,
he'll put me in the hospital again.

277
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,997
You need to be gone
in the morning, okay?

278
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,110
And don't touch anything.

279
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,282
The Polo contract is mine.
Exclusive.

280
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,325
I don't care about the money.
It's personal.

281
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,530
You lose me my fee,
it's personal to me.

282
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,979
Sure those antiques still work?

283
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,823
-One way to find out.
-You're the guy from the courthouse.

284
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,963
-Blocked my shot.
-You made me miss.

285
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,496
Touch?.

286
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,637
Look, we're both professionals.

287
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,300
Sure we can come to some sort
of understanding.

288
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,637
What I understand
is you're getting in my way.

289
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,211
Exactly my point.
We keep chasing the same target...

290
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,245
...we'll keep getting
in each other's way.

291
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,610
Then stay out of it.

292
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,516
After that mess at the courthouse,
Polo's gonna be on full guard.

293
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,850
The best way for us to get him
is if we work together.

294
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,083
You get the money
either way, pal. All right?

295
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,423
The whole million.
And a free pair of hands.

296
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,829
Nothing in life is for free.
What's in it for you?

297
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,334
I got history with Polo.

298
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,962
Oh, great. A partner with a vendetta.

299
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,631
Just what I need.

300
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,971
You'll never find him. I will.

301
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,205
I've been doing this
for a long time, my friend.

302
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,180
Oh, you'll find him eventually.
I'll find him tonight.

303
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,045
Like I said, I got history with Polo.

304
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,555
I spent two years of my life
infiltrating his crew.

305
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,454
He's never gonna come back here.

306
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,061
He will sever all his usual contacts
except for one.

307
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,494
-Who?
-We got a deal?

308
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:12,301
If your intel's for real.
Who's your lead?

309
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,167
The guy who makes his hardware.

310
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,567
Polo loves his toys.

311
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,019
I read about these things.

312
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,352
Very cool.

313
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,488
Careful.

314
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,625
Careful, that's a half-a-million-dollar
piece of equipment.

315
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,857
Spoken like a true businessman.

316
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,060
But the question
you should be asking...

317
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,029
...is whether the weapon is loaded.

318
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,607
Wait, wait, wait. No, don't.

319
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,477
God, okay. Hey. Okay.

320
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,814
What do you want?

321
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,329
Holy shit.

322
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,756
Roland Flint.

323
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,158
You remember me, that's good.

324
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,596
And you know what I want.

325
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,864
You're the one who called.

326
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,136
-So there's no job?
-Quit stalling.

327
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,071
I have no idea where he is.

328
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:09,918
You know, I read these things
can even memorize a pattern.

329
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,960
No, no, stop. Hey, stop.
No, hey. Stop.

330
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,326
All right, all right. Calm down.
I'm not gonna kill you.

331
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,471
Just gonna blow you apart
limb by limb.

332
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,007
Please, I have a family.

333
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,144
I had a family too, you piece of shit.

334
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,279
Okay, okay, hey. I'll tell you.

335
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,539
Talk fast.

336
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,240
I'll tell you.

337
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,714
He knows he's got a price
on his head.

338
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,616
He's moving around hotels
he once used as a front.

339
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,417
-Give me an address.
-I don't know where he is right now.

340
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:53,291
But Thursday and Friday
he'll be at the Royal Grand.

341
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,391
If you're lying to me....

342
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:01,294
I understand. I know what you do.
Please.

343
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,134
Good.

344
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,880
What the hell was that?

345
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,612
What the hell was what?

346
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,816
Why did you kill him?
I wanted the guy alive.

347
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,152
I had a plan.

348
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,023
I was gonna introduce you.
He was gonna run off to Polo...

349
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,668
...with a line on the guy
that killed his brother...

350
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,270
...and I was gonna use that
to lure him in.

351
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,835
You didn't tell me that.

352
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,609
Because it was a new idea,
all right?

353
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,406
I was thinking on the fly.

354
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,979
If you want a partner...

355
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,084
...you've got to learn
how to communicate better.

356
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,890
You know, you're lucky
we have a lead.

357
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,287
-You trust him?
-As much as I trust you.

358
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,625
I'll get my people
to confirm his info, okay?

359
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,134
Yeah, you do that. I'll get
the layout for the Royal Grand.

360
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,568
We'll meet, figure it out.

361
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,071
Half a million for this?

362
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,111
You know, we should just take that.

363
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,272
Probably better to make it look
like a break-in anyway.

364
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,675
Can we take something lighter?

365
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,112
What?

366
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,184
I reached out to a guy
at the courthouse.

367
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,452
Got this off a security camera.

368
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,337
Get this out to everybody.
I mean everybody.

369
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:27,107
Let's find this fucker and bury him.

370
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,978
Wake up.

371
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,326
-Come on. Get out.
-Sorry.

372
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:47,295
You left the door open.
I saw the fruit.

373
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,091
I got hungry.

374
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,667
Okay, you ate, you slept.
Now you're going out. Come on.

375
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,566
Come on. Get out.

376
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,139
-Get out.
-Fine.

377
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,247
What are you doing?

378
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,715
Have a good life, turtle.

379
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,094
How did you do that?

380
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,390
-Do what?
-How did you get him to come out?

381
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,664
Come here. I'll show you.

382
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,240
You just have to pet him right here.

383
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,991
Amazing.

384
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,974
Wait.

385
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,930
You should put something
on your back.

386
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,605
It hurt?

387
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,709
What?

388
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,675
Go get Anna.

389
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,215
Get out of the country.

390
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,711
Better yet, go to the States.

391
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,588
I gotta see this through.

392
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,624
You gotta see it through?

393
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,989
Or you wanna be the one
who pulls the trigger?

394
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,700
I mean, you said this other
guy's good, right? Good.

395
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,233
He's got the contract.
He's a pro, he's motivated.

396
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,893
Let him take care of Polo.

397
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,699
It's not just Polo though, is it?

398
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,673
It's those dirty lnterpol cops that set
me up. They want my head on a stick.

399
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:24,143
They want their money back. They're
gonna keep coming till they get it.

400
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,680
So, what are you gonna do?
You take them all on?

401
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,109
You're insane.

402
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,189
You can sit there
insulting me or you can help.

403
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,492
What's it gonna be?

404
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,155
All right. What?

405
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,751
I'm going to bed. You coming up?

406
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,453
In a minute.

407
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,637
I know you like
to keep your hands clean.

408
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,604
But I promise...

409
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:29,211
...if you don't get your pit bulls off my
back, I'm gonna come back here.

410
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,846
I'll carve your wife's heart out
and make you eat it. Understand?

411
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,041
I'm not....

412
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,982
No, you're not listening.

413
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,848
-Goodbye.
-Don't.

414
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,172
In my home!

415
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,777
He threatened me in my own home
with my family upstairs!

416
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,077
Well, he's just trying
to psych you out.

417
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,839
You want resources, fine.

418
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,041
I'll give you extra men,
weapons, whatever.

419
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,948
But I want him dead.
I don't care what it takes.

420
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,749
I just want him dead
in the next 48 hours.

421
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:18,293
Or I will personally turn
the two of you in.

422
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,160
You know, maybe the problem
with our plan is that...

423
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,966
...Polo isn't in on it.

424
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,202
You wanna make that headcase
our partner?

425
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,340
I've been expecting you.

426
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,777
You Nalbandian?

427
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,377
At your service.

428
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,613
I want to know who
the players are. Who set it up.

429
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,157
Who the hitters are. Everything.

430
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,625
And I know that you know.

431
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,759
Let's imagine
that you are right. Now what?

432
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,700
Now you tell me
before I start hurting you.

433
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,007
Your reputation is well-deserved.

434
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,004
So is mine. Gentlemen.

435
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,392
Agent Godfrey.

436
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,865
I see that your schemes
aren't getting any smarter.

437
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,561
Which is why we need your help.

438
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,034
Really?

439
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,333
Why would I help you?

440
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,170
Immunity. Lifetime guarantee...

441
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,403
...by both the E.U.
and the U.S. governments.

442
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,547
No strings attached
except a one-way ticket...

443
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,183
...to anywhere outside
of Europe and North America.

444
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
In exchange for...?

445
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,849
Helping to intercept Roland Flint.

446
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,854
Flint.

447
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,429
Things begin to make
a little more sense.

448
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,761
It's a limited-time offer.
We need to know.

449
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,262
Now.

450
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,939
-One condition.
-What?

451
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,923
I want the man
who killed my brother.

452
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,553
Impossible.

453
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,898
Unless the price is right.

454
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,956
You feel better?

455
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,670
I guess I got new Tellys now.

456
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,772
What?

457
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,509
My scars.

458
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:58,610
I name them after the man
who gave them to me.

459
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,283
You're judging me.

460
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,422
Like you're so much better.

461
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,130
Would you kill me if someone
offered you enough money?

462
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,090
What do you want?

463
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,797
Nothing.

464
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,107
People choose their death
when they choose how they live.

465
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,971
Does that let you sleep at night?

466
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,818
I sleep fine.

467
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,814
I'm a weapon.

468
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,552
I don't choose where I'm pointed.

469
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,318
Of course. You just follow orders.

470
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:49,992
I'm not different
than a doctor or a waiter.

471
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,690
I serve a function.

472
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,460
I get it.

473
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,997
I'm in the service industry too.

474
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,834
You calling me a whore?

475
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,737
A service provider.

476
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,342
Actually I'm nothing like you.

477
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,346
I don't have a choice.
I have nothing and no one.

478
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,514
You have money, power.

479
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,718
You can get out of the life
anytime you want.

480
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,420
You choose not to.

481
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,297
I'm going out.

482
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,345
Hey. You cost me business.

483
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,077
She's done with you.

484
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,449
You don't want me as an enemy.

485
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,258
I bet that scares the girls.

486
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,633
Who is he?

487
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,834
Some guy we found snooping
around, asking about you.

488
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,344
I don't think he's a cop.

489
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,821
Who are you?

490
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,056
Santa Claus.

491
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,630
Oh, good.

492
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,396
A comedian.

493
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,266
Once more.

494
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,069
Who are you?

495
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,570
Are you deaf? I'm Santa Claus.

496
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,042
Deaf.

497
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,384
What's going on?

498
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,454
We have a new offer.

499
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,194
The client will double your usual fee
for a fraction of the work.

500
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,427
What you need to do
is bring your new friend...

501
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:43,561
...to a specific place
at a specific time.

502
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,873
It will never work.

503
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:51,008
-He will smell the trap.
-Polo would be there as an incentive.

504
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,045
You will lead him in.
Put him at ease.

505
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:57,016
That's all you have to do.
Once it starts, you're out.

506
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,026
It's good to have friends.

507
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,855
But this is a dangerous friend
to have.

508
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:15,600
He's a loose cannon.
For him, it's personal.

509
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,903
Flint did a lot of damage
to Polo's organization.

510
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:25,104
But his mistake was leaving
the snake's head for last.

511
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,873
Polo got Flint where it hurt most.

512
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,044
Family. Wanted to send a strong
message to his enemies.

513
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,817
So he made Flint watch...

514
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,618
...while he and his men
gang-raped his wife...

515
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,227
...and beat her into a coma.

516
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:43,257
Lucky for your new friend, the local
gendarmes had a tail on Polo...

517
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,197
...and intervened
before Flint was killed.

518
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,098
Then Flint vanished.

519
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,798
Along with a sizable chunk
of lnterpol's dirty money.

520
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,912
So this whole job on Polo
is a smoke screen.

521
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:03,077
It's dirty cops using Polo
as bait to get Mr. Flint, right?

522
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,779
The money is real.

523
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:13,021
A third now. The rest on completion.

524
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,112
Good.

525
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,820
I was worried Mr. Flint's
personal vendetta was infectious.

526
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,859
-Where do I take him?
-City hall.

527
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,296
Tomorrow, 9:00.

528
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,638
City hall tomorrow at 9:00.

529
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:09,615
My source says Polo's meeting
a councilman he's got on his payroll.

530
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,617
Trust your source?

531
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,345
As much as I trust you.

532
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,495
-I worry about you.
-What?

533
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,189
I'm worried
because for you it's personal.

534
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,691
You care too much.

535
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,701
It's going to get you dead.
Maybe me too.

536
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,071
Ask yourself this:

537
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:36,511
If you never really cared about
anyone or anything...

538
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,471
...then were you ever really alive?

539
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,985
You sound like someone I know.

540
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,188
Yeah, city hall's good.

541
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,262
The only way in is through the main
lobby. Lots of high vantage points.

542
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,231
-I like it.
-Okay. Let's take a look.

543
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,768
Here you go.

544
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,098
I'll take it.

545
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,606
Cheers.

546
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,409
Do you ever pray?

547
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:46,740
Been a long time. No one answered.

548
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,140
I gave up.

549
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,715
That's sad.

550
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,257
Where I come from, priests
and crooks, they're all the same.

551
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,799
Do you dream?

552
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,106
No.

553
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,606
Ever think about your future?

554
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:20,641
No, it will come soon enough.
And you?

555
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:26,511
I just want out. Out of the city.

556
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,291
Out of the life.

557
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,422
With someone I can trust.

558
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,056
Trust to do what?

559
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,068
Light a candle for me
when I'm gone.

560
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,127
Our selection for the evening.

561
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,232
I'm busy.

562
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,740
I think you wanna see this.

563
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,510
I need the room. Please.

564
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,497
You don't trust the African
to come through.

565
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,997
So I got us a backup.

566
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,996
Our friend here runs girls
for Benny Black in the district.

567
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,733
He saw the picture. He says he
knows the guy with the crossbow.

568
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,041
You know the animal
that killed my brother?

569
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,350
Yes, sir. We're neighbors.

570
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,336
Wait.

571
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,321
Be careful.

572
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:05,692
Excuse me, what's going on here?

573
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,896
Police, madam. Police.

574
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,939
The situation's under control.
You can step back into your office.

575
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,006
Get back into your office.

576
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,783
You can come quietly,
or I can use this again, okay?

577
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,281
Move it.

578
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,411
Your fat friend tried to hold out.

579
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,284
He really did. But finally...

580
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,623
...he sang like a fucking soprano.

581
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,359
Told me all about you
and your little country hideaway.

582
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:18,029
Who knows?
Maybe I pay our girl a visit.

583
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,950
Excellent work.

584
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,557
The client is very pleased.

585
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,132
You're not going to examine them?

586
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,994
I trust you.

587
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,000
I have another prospect.

588
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,140
I'm going to take some time off.

589
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,748
Hello?

590
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,583
My friend. It's for you.

591
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:27,171
-Hello.
-Your friend has been a lovely hostess.

592
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,405
Here she is.

593
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,050
I hear you are a hard man.

594
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,849
But even hard men like us
have something we care about.

595
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,426
For example...

596
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,560
...I loved my brother very much.

597
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,960
The brother that you murdered.

598
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,497
I suggest an exchange.

599
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,228
You for her.

600
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,809
You don't really have a choice.

601
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,407
As a wise man once said:

602
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,311
We are all prisoners
of our own passions.

603
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,685
You're wrong about me.

604
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,985
I'm not a prisoner of anything.

605
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,935
He wanted to gamble.

606
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,735
I told him it was impossible
to get to you.

607
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,643
You went behind my back.

608
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,978
-It's done between you and l.
-Oh, come.

609
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,414
You're overreacting.

610
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,921
If I overreacted, you'd be dead.

611
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,867
Tell me where the money is
and I'll make it quick.

612
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,844
Just let me go right now.
You'll never see me again.

613
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:12,938
And if we don't?

614
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,181
Then I'll fucking kill you.

615
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:18,677
Easy.

616
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,145
Let's get our money back first.

617
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,618
Okay, last chance.

618
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,458
Now, Gabor here, he's an expert.

619
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,120
He can make this last quite a while.

620
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:32,995
Where's the money?

621
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,366
I don't know
what you're talking about.

622
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,849
He's expecting you?

623
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,993
I was hoping you'd reconsider.

624
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,371
I need to know
where they took Flint.

625
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,840
You're breaking your own code.

626
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:55,135
Risking your life
because of feelings.

627
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,272
If I don't feel, am I really alive?

628
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:04,484
And all this time,
I thought I understood you.

629
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:07,622
You and I understand
each other perfectly.

630
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,321
We speak the same language.

631
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,155
I need to know where Flint is.
We're losing time.

632
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,668
I don't want payment.

633
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:25,334
I do this in hopes
of repairing our partnership.

634
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:29,603
Which I'm certain will have
a long and profitable future.

635
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,679
If memory serves me correctly,
Mr. Polo suggested...

636
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:37,649
...his cousin's old factory as a suitable
place to question Mr. Flint.

637
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:04,869
Where's the money?

638
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:44,942
Roland.

639
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,089
Roland. Roland, help!

640
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:53,718
Okay.

641
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:08,072
Where's the money?
I won't ask again.

642
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,239
It's where?

643
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,151
Spent it.

644
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,182
Finish it.

645
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:27,952
Gabor.

646
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:30,822
Gabor.

647
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,070
-Shit.
-Okay, hold it together.

648
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,437
Just hold it together.

649
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,875
-You go check that way.
-I'm not going out there.

650
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:47,547
-What?
-I'm not going out there.

651
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,845
What? Jesus Chri--

652
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,781
Okay, do something
useful then, yeah?

653
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,420
Take care of--

654
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:18,839
Come out now,
or I'll shoot him right here.

655
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,012
Show yourself or I swear to God
I'll blow his fucking head off.

656
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,571
Should have let me be.

657
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,393
You set me up.

658
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:15,462
It was a mistake. I came back.

659
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,229
Yeah, you did.

660
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,756
-Yes.
-Sorry to interrupt, sir. Still no word.

661
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:48,664
-Keep trying.
-It's Flint, isn't it?

662
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:51,965
They went to finish him
and now they're missing.

663
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,732
It's no concern of yours.

664
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,504
Oh, no, I think Mr. Flint
is a shared concern of ours.

665
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,840
We have both caused him
a great deal of grief.

666
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,778
And left to his own devices...

667
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,976
...he will stop at nothing
to return the favor...

668
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,313
...to both of us.

669
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,650
What can you do
that we're not already doing?

670
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,132
You're pretty good with the AK.

671
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,096
Thought you were more
of a knife man.

672
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,539
-Use the best tool for the job.
-You got that right.

673
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,545
It was one of yours, actually.

674
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:57,534
-Hello?
-Mrs. Pavlescu, it's me, it's Roland.

675
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,140
I need you to get Anna
out of the house now.

676
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,641
What? Hello?

677
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,205
Hello?

678
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:12,547
Line was cut.

679
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,412
Hello?

680
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,362
-Turn around.
-Okay.

681
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,820
-Hello?
-Goodbye.

682
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,301
They drew the curtains.

683
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,963
Cutting off lines of sight.

684
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,670
At least two at the front.

685
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,977
All right, we're gonna have
to draw them out.

686
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:53,611
Grenades.

687
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:56,351
My wife's in there.

688
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:05,655
I guess I'm not too good
with hostage situation.

689
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:16,267
Welcome home, Mr. Flint.
Check your webcam.

690
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:26,945
So beautiful.

691
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,214
Don't you fucking touch her.

692
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,154
What? Connection not too good.

693
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,689
I'm gonna make this real simple.

694
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,633
If you and your friend...

695
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,368
...don't surrender to us
unarmed in 1 5 minutes...

696
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:49,103
...first, I will let each of my men
take turns with her.

697
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,213
Then I'll let you watch
while I skin her alive.

698
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:57,841
And if that doesn't wake her up,
nothing will.

699
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:01,279
Fifteen minutes.

700
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,822
What do you want to do?

701
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,428
The thing about fairy tale endings...

702
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,430
...is that they're bullshit.

703
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:29,601
You got me. Just leave her alone.

704
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,412
I tell you what.

705
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,273
I do her last.

706
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:40,285
That way you don't have
to watch this time.

707
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,183
I have money.

708
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:49,926
No money
can bring my brother back.

709
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,963
But you will pay in a different way.

710
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,692
And slowly.

711
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,861
I have 1 2 million.

712
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,800
Bullshit.

713
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,168
Show him.

714
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,228
That's about 1.2 million.

715
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:24,392
I got 1 0 times more hidden inside.

716
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,460
Bullshit.

717
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,126
You let me leave
and I'll show it to you.

718
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,136
-What the hell are you doing?
-What?

719
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:38,744
What the hell is this?

720
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,574
That's life.

721
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,979
That's life? That's fucking life?

722
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,352
That's my wife over there.

723
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:51,991
You're telling me that's fucking life?

724
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,693
Wait.

725
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:17,139
He's yours.

726
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:25,279
Get up.

727
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:32,450
Now beg.

728
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,157
Fuck you.

729
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:44,835
-Beg.
-No.

730
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,205
Beg her.

731
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:55,839
Please forgive me.

732
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:59,552
You can do better than that.
Louder.

733
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,120
Forgive me!

734
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,726
-Again.
-Please forgive me!

735
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,195
That's good.

736
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,734
There's just one problem.

737
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:24,072
She can't hear you.

738
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:51,769
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

739
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,639
I'm sorry.

740
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,268
It's over.

741
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,468
Not yet.

742
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:41,806
There's no guarantee of success.
It's a new procedure.

743
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,348
And it is quite expensive.

744
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:45,246
Oh, don't worry about that.

745
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:46,886
I've got the money.

746
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:50,080
Okay, then,
we should start right away.

747
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:45,909
I just want out.

748
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:51,909
Out of the city. Out of the life.

749
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,188
With someone I can trust.

750
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:00,287
Trust to do what?

751
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:05,126
Light a candle for me
when I'm gone.

752
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:10,151
