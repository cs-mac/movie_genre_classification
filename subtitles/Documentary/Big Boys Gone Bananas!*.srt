1
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:24,947
We have a media that is corrupted by power,
mostly by corporate power.

2
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:32,948
To go after your film is just a little tiny part
of a big investment they're willing to make.

3
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,749
Dole is a company with deep deep pockets.
I'm sure they're hiring the very best.

4
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,189
I think it would be a little bit naive
if you think that you can take

5
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:49,270
 a pop at a big multinational and
expect to walk away without some

6
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,070
sort of fight on your hands.

7
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:59,431
It was beyond belief to think that that
counld be done to a participant in a film festival.

8
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:07,432
I think that Dole succeded in planting doubt
about the credibility of the story.

9
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:22,594
As a Swedish director and editor.

10
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:26,315
I take freedom of speech for granted.

11
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:31,155
Now I know that freedom of speech
depends on what you want to say.

12
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:34,916
In 2009 I made a film about a
lawsuit in Los Angeles

13
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:38,236
where Nicaraguan banana workers

14
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:43,757
challenged Dole's use
of banned pesticides.

15
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:49,518
According to the workers,
the poison made them sterile,
and a host of other problems.

16
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,478
This is about the battle.

17
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:58,919
Hopefully, the penalty will
wake their conscience.

18
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,360
Workers have waited for their
rights for over a decade.

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,041
In November 2007, Los Angeles-based
Court of Justice handed down a
judgment :

20
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:15,001
Dole had acted deliberately wrong.

21
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,321
And was ordered to pay
a substantial fee.

22
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:29,883
Leading to the judgment,
I was hoping for better working
conditions in banana plantations.

23
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,643
The Dole case, however,
turned out to be was extremely frustrating.

24
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:39,524
Presentation of the film
was anything but easy.

25
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:59,527
In early May 2009 we were expecting
a premiere of the film "Bananas!*"

26
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,607
One morning, a big package
arrived from the United States.

27
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,128
We published about the premiere on
our website a couple of days earlier.

28
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,688
Our film participated in the

29
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,529
Los Angeles Film Festival's
competition series.

30
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,609
Margarete.

31
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:26,610
We received a warning letter from Dole
Food Company law firm.

32
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,331
Dear Mr.
Gertten, Mrs. Jangaard, Mr. Simpson.

33
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,691
If we persisted, Dole would
challenge us in the court of law.

34
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:41,372
A number of blatantly false and
defamatory statements...

35
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:44,412
... facts concering our client,
Dole Food Company

36
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,773
Our company has only four employees.

37
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:52,053
Dole employs over 75000
people in 90 countries,

38
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:56,614
their turnover is over
seven billion dollars a year.

39
00:03:56,774 --> 00:04:00,535
It's the world's largest
fruit company.

40
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:09,496
"The movie about Dole is based on deception"

41
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:12,456
"and the banana workers lied."

42
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,537
The tone of the letter was very
aggressive.

43
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:22,417
It was 200 pages of court documents
and newspaper clippings.

44
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,178
And they haven't even see the movie !

45
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:31,379
What is this thing?
We're attacked by the Dole?

46
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:38,219
We were sure that this was 
just a misunderstanding.

47
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,980
When they will see the movie, all will be fine.

48
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,541
"We urge you to stop immediately."

49
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:52,461
"... false and defamatory
statementsabout our company"

50
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:57,462
"Otherwise, we will take legal action."

51
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,222
When the cease and desist letter came in
from Dole I was also mentioned.

52
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,343
And, I guess in come way,
I was kind of flattered.

53
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,183
It was, kind of, wow, ok, nice,
I'm on the radar of Dole, that's
really nice to see.

54
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:13,864
But my wife, really,
brought me back to reality,
and said

55
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:18,905
this is quite serious, you know,
we could lose the house, a lot
of thing could happen.

56
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:26,946
The same package was sent to the
festival's sponsors.

57
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,746
David, the press agent of The
Los Angeles Film Festival said

58
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:34,787
that if we want the film to be
included in the competition category,

59
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,347
we needed to keep it quiet.

60
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:42,588
The organizers felt pressured
We didn't get to talk to the press.

61
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:48,069
What happened was, Dole decided to go
after everybody so they could stop the film.

62
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,469
And so, in doing so, they threatened everybody.
They threatened me, they threatened the LA Film Festival,

63
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,830
by going to all of the major sponsors,

64
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,150
including the L.A. Times.

65
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,431
And I think it was important that we all had a united front,
as we started to step towards the screening at the film festival.

66
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:13,232
I wanted to tell the whole world, but
I didn't do it.

67
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:19,513
I didn't reveal everything when I was
interviewed on Swedish TV.

68
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,713
I didn't speak about the letter,

69
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:25,913
or about the fact that maybe we
won't be able to show the film.

70
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,954
I wrote a story about a documentary,

71
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:33,274
which competes int the
Los Angeles Film Festival.

72
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:39,355
A few days later I received an e-mail message.
A long e-mail message,

73
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:42,836
submitted by Dole's public
relations office in Washington.

74
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:48,316
They said the film is based on
errors and lies.

75
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:53,637
At the beginning I was scared.
My first reaction was fear.

76
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,557
The situation was very uncomfortable.

77
00:06:56,717 --> 00:07:01,438
I made a small story for a small
local broadcaster.

78
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,159
How did Dole found about it?
Do they have eyes everywhere?

79
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,799
Then I got annoyed.

80
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,040
The message seemed to be
a hidden threat.

81
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,760
When I replied to the message,
I received a call from Dole's lawyer.

82
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,321
"I have made it very clear to this producer,
and to the L.A. Film festival."

83
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:30,442
"Given that, they're on notice as to the
absolute inaccurate basis on wich they built this film,"

84
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:32,522
"and they're going forward with it :
one, they're going to get sued,"

85
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:36,323
"and two, they're going to be exposed
to punitive damages"

86
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:41,163
I asked Carter what that
erroneous information was

87
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:44,724
that's the basis on which the film is built.

88
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:51,445
Then he tried to run over me and
continued to exert pressure.

89
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,005
I became annoyed.

90
00:07:54,685 --> 00:08:00,366
But you haven't seen the film.
- The film is based on a sham, that's the point.

91
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:04,206
But have you seen the film?
- I already told you, no Charlotte.

92
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:09,527
We didn't tell about the threats to anyone.

93
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:13,207
Dole self- initiated media furore.

94
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,208
Is that, therefore, the front page of?
- Yes.

95
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:20,968
I told you yesterday that this will be
a big deal.

96
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:26,409
This is a los angeles business journal
home page.

97
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,289
Note Dole banana character.

98
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,890
The document creates Dole enemy hero,
-.

99
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,811
While this is demonstrably forged a
lawsuit facts.

100
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,891
The author of the story has not even
seen the movie!

101
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:48,972
I wanted to tell the impact of
pesticides on workers,.

102
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:52,612
But the dole managed to divert
attention elsewhere.

103
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,373
Appeared in the new magazine articles
and blog posts.

104
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:02,734
Dole was the main target of attacks by
workers represented by juan dominguez.

105
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:10,855
He was made slippery Cuban born a
cheap lawyer,.

106
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:15,455
Which tightened the beloved American
companies.

107
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:20,816
Now, a naive Swedish film director
made ??a konnasta hero!

108
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,417
It means that the Film Festival
afraid.

109
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:29,417
They admitted it directly.

110
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,018
The President said very clearly.

111
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:37,058
Not to see the film in the competition
category.

112
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,579
Is it, therefore, that.

113
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,019
That it is presented in a special
presentation, or not at all?

114
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:47,420
So, he said.
- It is all about?

115
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,580
That 's right.
And the response time is five minutes.

116
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,861
Film Festival was informed that the
matter has been discussed a lot.

117
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:01,781
The best way to proceed would be to
remove the film competition series.

118
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:07,502
We have been driven into a corner,
when we have to decide quickly.

119
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:11,903
Do we want to participate in the film
festival in the first place or not.

120
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:15,583
Dole's lawyers have used us,.

121
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,424
Since we have not found a movie out
of.

122
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,464
If we withdraw now, because we can not
race series,.

123
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:27,345
Dole looks a winner, and I do not want
to.

124
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:31,785
I became angry indeed.
What an insult!

125
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:37,626
We have been working hard.
This thing could destroy the film.

126
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:42,627
I think the film speaks clearly for
itself,.

127
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,707
So it is easy to defend.

128
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:48,187
In this respect it is not a concern.

129
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:54,908
We do not know if I can no longer
other than to cancel the participation
of.

130
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,869
Prevents dolea summoning you to court.

131
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,069
Dole to draw a clear line as
aggressive.

132
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:08,190
Most likely, you will be given a
challenge, when you come to Los
Angeles.

133
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,070
I would be surprised that that
happened.

134
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:26,232
If I stay in Sweden, the film would be
uncertain,.

135
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:29,713
But if you suggest a movie in Los
Angeles,.

136
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:35,154
Up to Dole would be forced to admit
that it is fair and balanced.

137
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,396
If the dole, however, sue me, I wanted
everything on film.

138
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:54,196
So we hired Los Angeles for the film
crew.

139
00:11:56,356 --> 00:12:00,317
Hi, I'm Dave, and this is Jason.

140
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,639
I have an expensive law firm had just
received a victory in court.

141
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,879
Now, the added sulfur found.

142
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,519
That dominguez was probably guilty of
fraud.

143
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,640
Were based on anonymous testimony,.

144
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,081
That no supplier had not been able to
check.

145
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:36,241
What if as soon as premiered a
documentary.

146
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,762
Based on the central delusion?

147
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:43,562
Fredrik Gertten documents show.

148
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:47,243
Third world people,.

149
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:52,204
By multinational corporations exploit.

150
00:12:53,924 --> 00:13:00,365
The problem is in the fact that Juan
Dominguez and a group of Nicaraguan,
-.

151
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:05,925
Among whom were lawyers, began a
project that.

152
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:10,566
They want to play a role in dolesta.
- Right.

153
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:15,807
Either you have seen the movie?
- To admit that I have not.

154
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:23,728
Justice was denied access to public
dominguez statements.

155
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,328
Thus, the press constantly demanded of
me,.

156
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:33,449
Why can not I change the movie now
that dominguez has unveiled a fraud.

157
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:37,249
I replied that the court proceedings
were still pending,.

158
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:40,010
I do not believe the allegations.

159
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,930
Juan Dominguez has not sprayed
insecticide on the workers.

160
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,011
Still, he made ??a villain now, which
is infuriating.

161
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:55,492
Dole went as well as you, movies that
Tom's attack.

162
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,972
Everything became personal.

163
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:01,653
It was no longer just a movie, only
the target was you.

164
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:09,654
Dole took the heat off of themselves
and CNY to you and your movie.

165
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:13,574
The film is detrimental to Dole,.

166
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:18,975
Since the law of the company's general
manager admitted directly to the
guilty.

167
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:25,056
Did not it ever occur to the
aloittaisitte dbcp: the use of N,.

168
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,696
Until you were sure of the safety of?

169
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:34,257
Instead, you waited evidence of its
dangers.
- Yes came from.

170
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,779
At the beginning of the festival we
still do not know.

171
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,499
The prospectus of film.

172
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:57,260
We were invited to an emergency
meeting.
Dole had sent a new letter.

173
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,980
This way?
- Come after me.

174
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,141
We heard that the organizers could no
longer defend the film.

175
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,782
I'll call you a spokesman.
This is absurd.

176
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,622
The meeting just ended.

177
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,303
The fact is.

178
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:25,903
That the organizers are afraid of such
a big court case.

179
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:29,184
That the entire organization would be
in danger because of it.

180
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:35,505
For us, it was suggested that we could
put parts of the movie.

181
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:39,585
The organizers are trying to gloss
over the situation by suggesting,.

182
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:43,226
That we could gather together the
money for it,.

183
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:49,186
Of returning the movie on the
operating table, would you describe
more,.

184
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:54,187
And would you do next year version,
which should be a handsome reception.

185
00:15:56,107 --> 00:16:00,628
This year, with a secluded ourselves
by showing only clips.

186
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:08,269
Available options were not in the
movie in terms of cost.

187
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:13,470
We could show the film next year and
bring it to the distributor.

188
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,190
Or to just now breaking up and have
the opportunity to debate.

189
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,831
Pr-side view, see it,.

190
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:29,072
That it would have told us to be
afraid of difficulties Dole.

191
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:33,952
It is insane that the world's largest
democracy.

192
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:38,153
Can not be shown as a movie.

193
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,473
Two weeks ago, the movie was good
enough, and now.

194
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:45,114
What is this?
- Intimidation tactics.

195
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:49,354
Dole sent the first letters of the
festival organizers,.

196
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,875
But they had not abandoned the movie.

197
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:57,235
Then the Swedish ambassador, but the
organizers held their ground.

198
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,916
Although solicitors withdrew.

199
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,996
And the Swedish Consulate withdrew
their support,.

200
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,357
The organizers intend to ever put to
film.

201
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:13,117
Now the dole has become more severe
the inputs, and the organizers for
getting scared.

202
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:16,918
Organizers have said the last word.

203
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,238
According to them, the film screenings
are these two.

204
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,399
After this, none of the distribution
company is not afraid to touch the
film.

205
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:32,640
Now we need to decide how much risk
you want to take tomorrow.

206
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,000
After all, just like you are in danger
of being taken to court.

207
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,723
We decided to continue the fight.

208
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,803
We do not know yet, shown in the film.

209
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:01,724
Organizers constantly changing
conditions,.

210
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,604
And the situation gets more and more
absurd.

211
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:09,405
Venue changes to the suburbs.

212
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:14,165
Where?
- UCLA's campus, far away from
Westwood.

213
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:19,686
There is no bus transportation.
I hope viewers will still be.

214
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:25,167
Or maybe not.
- This makes the situation really
awkward.

215
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,167
This is insane, bart.

216
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:34,208
Bart is still trying to negotiate with
the organizers.

217
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:37,448
The film must be routed competition
series.

218
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:43,809
In addition, prior to the presentation
should be read Dole's vision of the
film.

219
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:49,090
If we do not agree to the terms, the
film's not going to.

220
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,731
Two hours before the world premiere.

221
00:18:56,811 --> 00:19:01,331
The film will be shown.
I just spoke with Down's.

222
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,572
He said that the film will be shown.

223
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:08,732
Yay, we are involved in!

224
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:14,053
Dawn said that handled this one.

225
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:20,054
At 17 05 - But there we are!

226
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:27,895
The organizers consider before the
show floor, and I agreed to it.

227
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:32,215
They will consider more precise
wording.

228
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,936
These go.
Now we need to iron the shirt.

229
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:41,417
Dawn said that the organizers are
standing behind us.

230
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:45,617
I replied that we must remain united.

231
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,697
This is a sad situation,.

232
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:53,658
But still a pretty good movie, and
this hot topic.

233
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:58,339
The most important goal he had, that
the film is shown.

234
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,260
I got a call just before the final
text of entry into the theater.

235
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,261
The organizers had bowed to pressure
Dole.

236
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:18,221
And right now, said that the banana
workers lied.

237
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,902
The organizers of the letter is
disgusting.

238
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:29,383
Among them, the main character is a
villain.
They have chosen the side, period.

239
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:34,103
Controversial points in only three.
Is not compatible with the tone now.

240
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:37,944
They say the movie based on
exploitation.
- True.

241
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,904
It is a version of the Dole.

242
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:47,625
I tried not to read this, because I
knew I get angry.

243
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,706
Is that michael carter?
He is.

244
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:56,826
Dole lawyer michael carter alaisineen
its premiere.

245
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,667
It is this gang has put pressure on us
-.

246
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:02,707
Six weeks to withdraw the proposal.

247
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:06,428
Docs Film Festival.

248
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:11,068
The story is told almost always
something controversial subject,.

249
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,549
As for war crimes, or corporate
wrongdoing.

250
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,469
Document authors seek unto bad things.

251
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,990
I've seen a lot of documentaries,.

252
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,510
But this explosive premiere I have not
experienced.

253
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,911
Is it?
Good.

254
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:38,792
The fun that you have submitted your
representative.

255
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:43,752
Welcome to the Los Angeles 15 Film
Festival.

256
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:47,873
I am the dawn hudson, independent film
director.

257
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:52,554
Welcome to watch bananas!
Movie.

258
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:58,394
It offers independent film in Los
Angeles Film Festival.

259
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:03,675
Both the director of Frederick the
Gertten that comes here.

260
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:07,676
Want me to call me?

261
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,236
I'll read this later.
- Read it first.

262
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:17,917
We talked about this.
- No, read it first.

263
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:21,517
Do not presenting the movie?
- Yes, but please read it first.

264
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:25,598
So I was told.

265
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:30,919
I have rarely seen anything so
shocking.

266
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,799
Gettoonsa document was isolated
exclusively,.

267
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:39,000
All sets are excluded.

268
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,960
It seems as if the audience were
observed,.

269
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,161
When we read the text, which denies
the whole document.

270
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:52,001
I felt ashamed indeed.

271
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,762
Los Angeles, the film industry and
film festival on.

272
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,202
It was totally incomprehensible,.

273
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:02,883
That the festival attendees were
treated that way.

274
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:05,563
You need to know,.

275
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,804
That the film 's credibility is called
into question.

276
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,564
Judge cites the decision, in
particular,.

277
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:15,964
That seen in the movie bound by the
oath of the witnesses.

278
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:21,765
Lying and submitted false employment
and health information.

279
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,926
This movie is not being told.

280
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:30,246
Therefore, it is clear that the
reality of the movie.

281
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:33,527
Does not correspond to the reality
seen in the courtroom.

282
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,087
We do not want to have to go right,.

283
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,648
So the movie will be shown outside the
category of the competition.

284
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:44,848
This study, as a responsible
documentary created.

285
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,409
And where it is not formed.

286
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,809
Organizers said the practice.

287
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:53,809
Eye-catching movie as a precedent.

288
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:58,570
Among them, the movie was not true and
they do not believe in leaders.

289
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,450
The public is warned that it sees just
crap.

290
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,251
Why should such a movie even presented
to?

291
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:08,491
The situation was strange.

292
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:12,652
I heard later near the organizers of
the borrower,.

293
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:15,132
That they really feared.

294
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:19,093
The organization in charge.

295
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:24,173
Fear of being right, and the collapse
of its economy.

296
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,254
Challenge for the right to be touched
by them personally.

297
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:35,295
They decided to defend their jobs
instead of Frederick.

298
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:40,575
And now I present to you The director
Fredrik Gertten.

299
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:52,377
Hello everyone, and sorry for this
delay.

300
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:56,938
This has been a special time.

301
00:24:57,098 --> 00:25:01,058
And a unique experience in my life.

302
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,699
I believe in democracy and freedom of
expression.

303
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:11,139
I believe that a society can exist a
balance between the various sounds.

304
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,660
Also, independent films are needed.

305
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,380
I like to talk after the movie.

306
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,781
Of life and the complexity of
film-making,.

307
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:27,822
As well as the truth, in the courtroom
as the movie when making.

308
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,502
Make yourself comfortable and enjoy.

309
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:08,787
Discharge the organizers of the speech
was a lousy thing.

310
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,947
It works just like the dole wanted,.

311
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:16,388
So created a gap between the
organizers and film -makers.

312
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:21,468
Practices connected to the discharge
voice.

313
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:27,069
And the subsequent panel discussion
with colleagues and legal counsel.

314
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:30,110
Seem to perpetrators.

315
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:36,870
They seem to be props, which would
ensure that,.

316
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:41,071
That have not been attacked by the
organizers.

317
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:44,511
The organizers action feels really
strange.

318
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,792
They made a pariah of the director,
not dolesta.

319
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:59,073
The festival is almost over, and we
have not been a challenge.

320
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:02,794
Had all been plain intimidation?

321
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:07,594
Just before the trip home.

322
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:11,755
I heard Dole brought the organizers of
the court's decision,.

323
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:15,075
That the organizers had to give up on
Dole.

324
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:19,316
All my film of the correspondence, and
other materials.

325
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,597
It seems that this is not over yet.

326
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,678
I returned to Sweden in early July.

327
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:39,719
I was quite tired out of Los Angeles
after.

328
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,599
One night I search the web for
children with a suitable holiday.

329
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,640
Then I received a call from Los
Angeles.

330
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,200
A journalist asked me for my comments,
-.

331
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,161
Since the dole had been summoned you
to court.

332
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,241
That's what we were afraid of, had now
taken place.

333
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:06,882
I called Bart, Margaret, publicist and
legal counsel.

334
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,923
We began our first move to consider.

335
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:14,163
I am quite surprised to bring an
action,.

336
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:17,324
Likewise, the selected law firm,.

337
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:21,324
Known as the defenders of freedom of
speech.

338
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:25,125
I was at the computer three in the
morning.

339
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:28,285
Then only the first phones and went to
sleep.

340
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:37,246
Dole Foods to sue the Swedish
filmmaker's right,.

341
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:41,047
As this film shows the company a
twisted light.

342
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:47,167
Malmö in the director Fredrik Gertten
has been summoned to court.

343
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:50,928
I think the movie bananas!
Based on exploitation.

344
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,808
We have raised our actions,.

345
00:28:53,968 --> 00:29:00,009
As Gertten the film is clearly the
company and employees libelous.

346
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,889
Claims have been three.

347
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:06,010
Me, and Frederick the wg film has been
summoned separately.

348
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,570
Why is all this?
What Dole's strategy is?

349
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,451
Meko do we Dole target?

350
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:20,532
Or is there something else behind
this?

351
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:23,972
We have become a part of our own in
our film.

352
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:28,653
The film appeared in the forces trying
to zap us now.

353
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:34,253
Have you thought to go against any?

354
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,854
It is impossible.

355
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:40,374
Dole calls for the film and its
website to destruction,.

356
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:43,175
And for me, the ban never to talk
about it.

357
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:48,135
Of course, I wonder how far this can
lead to.

358
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:55,056
My family asked, can we lose our
house.

359
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:02,217
I said, of course, that we can not,
even though I did not know it for
sure.

360
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,378
It is really strange,.

361
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:11,338
Thats a huge fruit company to sue a
small Swedish firm to court.

362
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:14,059
It does not make sense.

363
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:17,419
So it has become.
How does it feel?

364
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,900
Dole wants to prevent the presentation
of the film.

365
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,740
We want to present it.

366
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,741
How does the movie now?
- The Swedish premiere of 9 10,

367
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,821
Do you believe it?
- Yes.

368
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,822
The challenge was on the shoulders of
us toil nights through and through.

369
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:43,662
We could not perform any other film
projects.

370
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:48,463
Fortunately, the insurance policy
covers the legal proceedings,.

371
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:51,744
So the matter is handled by top
lawyer.

372
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:59,305
I'm Dole just send us threatening
letters.

373
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:03,625
I would have thought to take their
story justice.

374
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,345
I never thought it would come to this.

375
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:11,986
I think they make it so, as it is for
them a good public relations move.

376
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:17,507
The film is part of Dole's much larger
pattern.

377
00:31:17,947 --> 00:31:23,228
Dole wants to get rid of billions of
dollars in court cases.

378
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:26,828
Those who are waiting for it because
of the use of poison.

379
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,548
So this is a low-cost investment Dole.

380
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:33,389
Your movie attack on another is a
small investment in.

381
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:39,390
Compared to the billions of dollars in
judgments.

382
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,910
Dole intends to use this a lot of
money.

383
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,591
It is an expensive law firm, and a lot
of lawyers.

384
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:51,991
It makes it all possible.
This is an investment in a larger
container.

385
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:57,912
That's it.
- This is depressing, I know.

386
00:31:58,072 --> 00:32:01,633
My mood to go to a roller coaster
ride.

387
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,473
Mostly I'm in a good mood,.

388
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,554
But things continued contemplation
absorbs the forces.

389
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:13,154
That is what is meant, undermining
your confidence.

390
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,074
You will be trying to watch out for
what you say.

391
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,235
The aim is to get you and others to
understand.

392
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,635
That large companies attacked worth to
visit,.

393
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:27,436
As touching the hot potato gets
himself into the fire.

394
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:31,436
Do not go by the feeling.

395
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,838
My situation was, of course, easier,
-.

396
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:44,278
Since I do not have a challenge,.

397
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:48,919
But I still wanted to participate in
my part.

398
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:53,079
Surely we have friends.

399
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:03,041
I was worried and I tried my best to
help.

400
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:09,401
I found in the United States and
kanadastakin suppliers,.

401
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:12,162
Which I hoped to infectious matter.

402
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:16,882
I sent them all the material, but they
are not enthusiastic about.

403
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:24,483
Did you find fault in the way I
presented the matter?

404
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:28,204
Did not I make it clear enough?

405
00:33:28,364 --> 00:33:32,164
What else can you do as a newspaper to
provide facts?

406
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:56,007
I have been a foreign correspondent.

407
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,928
Korea, Chile and South Africa.

408
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,689
I learned then to respect American
suppliers.

409
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:10,329
Now, I figured, why do they tell the
story of Dole's point of view only.

410
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,330
Why do not they dig deeper?

411
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,890
Most surprising was the media when
writing,.

412
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:24,771
How you were seen as a charlatan and
dole rights defenders.

413
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:31,052
The supplier should not swallow the
story without checking.

414
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:36,493
Americans on the supplier is a
shocking bit of curiosity.

415
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:39,773
They are not sufficiently skeptical.

416
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,254
These suppliers have failed in their
work.

417
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:48,334
By making the case directly to the
press release.

418
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:52,215
It is even more embarrasing than the
festival activities.

419
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:57,895
Media has the power to corrupt,
especially in the corporate world
power.

420
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:02,456
It is a business owned and funded by
advertising.

421
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:09,937
Media, advertising, financial and
corporate influence are fully working
days.

422
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:16,978
The fact is that the media is much
more inclined to.

423
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:20,898
To leave the issue aside, if anybody
says,.

424
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:25,739
That the writing will only ridicule.

425
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:28,859
The company says they deny everything
-.

426
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:32,580
And iskevänsä the media attacked the
house.

427
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:38,581
I know the big companies, which have
threatened to hack advertising.

428
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,861
The Wall Street Journal or the New
York Times,.

429
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,261
Because they do not like their style.

430
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:50,182
Investigative journalism does not go
far as it was before.

431
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:53,703
Journalism itself is threatened.

432
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,824
Journalism is a sacred thing.

433
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:07,905
It is the only fish that is mentioned
in the constitution.

434
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,945
Freedom of the press is guaranteed
constitutional Appendices.

435
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:17,626
Journalism still does not work in the
public interest.

436
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:24,027
Shooting the messenger is a common
occurrence.

437
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:27,667
The most striking example is the year
1998,.

438
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:32,188
When Chiquita's home in the Cincinnati
Enquirer published.

439
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:39,189
Published a history of the company
include the unveiling of a great
article.

440
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,789
It was discovered by exploitation of
the workers, allegations of drug
smuggling,.

441
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:49,790
Pollution of the environment, no
matter what, and all based on facts.

442
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,310
Chiquita, however, had a strong back,
when it was discovered,.

443
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,711
That one of its journalists had hacked
into the message system.

444
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:01,191
The Enquirer denied then the whole
series of articles,.

445
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:03,992
A little bit like Film banned you.

446
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:06,312
Reporters were fired,.

447
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:11,873
And the NY Times, Chiquita oversaw the
delivery of the decade.

448
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:15,553
The magazine also paid Chiquita less
than 15 million dollars.

449
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:18,594
Write a story about it does not exist,
-.

450
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:23,074
For the Cincinnati Enquirer agreed to
destroy it completely.

451
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:29,515
We downloaded it, however, the overall
recovery.

452
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:32,716
So here it is.
A little later it was destroyed.

453
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:38,836
The case of an American journalist
focus areas in our shameful.

454
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:43,997
Very few people would dispute the
veracity of the story, except for
Chiquita.

455
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:49,478
Thing would have won the Pulitzer,
but.
So is then fermented.

456
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:55,398
We ask for forgiveness Chiquita.

457
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,319
Cincinnati journalists say about the
same story as me.

458
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,560
Their careers were destroyed.

459
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,080
I was greeted by Chiquita akin bigger
company.

460
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:19,122
In Finland, our case got a lot of
attention.

461
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:23,282
Sweden dolella not have the same power
of the press,.

462
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:28,923
So here in a big American company is
the Swedish director's bouquet.

463
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:35,084
The fact that a large American
multi-national company.

464
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:38,324
Suing a small Swedish film-maker,.

465
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:43,285
Aroused my curiosity, because this is
a David and Goliath battle.

466
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:47,165
Following the publication of the story
only took an hour or two,.

467
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:51,486
So I got an email the office of public
relations.

468
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:55,886
It was asked if I would like to
communicate with Dole attorney.

469
00:38:56,046 --> 00:39:00,207
It seems, therefore, be read across
the pond in the back of Swedish.
Another

470
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:06,208
They had found time for a little story
time in a small on-line journal.

471
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:11,008
I called the sender, and soon I was
already in contact with legal counsel.

472
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:14,649
Then I started to think about how
strange was,.

473
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:18,169
To be contacted by a public relations
agency,.

474
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,410
Sending e-mail and I'll call you and
we are very friendly.

475
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:27,170
They held the phone to me at this Los
Angeles huippujuristille.

476
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,251
This person called and spoke to
exactly half an hour.

477
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:37,652
Realized well that the customer had
paid him half an hour.

478
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:41,252
Then I realized how hard the pressure
of the Dole.

479
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,213
It is investing big money in order to
maintain you properly.

480
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:50,933
I do not think I'm the only supplier
that we have been contacted.

481
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:56,734
Good Bernt!
I am writing on behalf of Dole Food
Company.

482
00:39:56,814 --> 00:40:01,135
Fredrik Gertten the film is revealed
to be a lie.

483
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:04,415
The film portrays Juan Dominguez hero.

484
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:08,256
In fact, he has an extensive fraud in
the back of the brain.

485
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:13,016
If you write more about, please feel
free to contact me.

486
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:16,577
Dole to invest big money for this
story.

487
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:21,537
The public relations office to contact
suppliers around the world.

488
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:25,938
Gibraltar is a washington prominent
public relations offices.

489
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:30,139
It is located in the heart of the city
close to the White House.

490
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:35,219
It is difficult to know what makes a
gibraltar or who those customers are,
-.

491
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:38,140
Since it does not need to tell it.

492
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,180
John Procter worked for the Coalition
Provisional Authority in Iraq,.

493
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,981
With the United States set up after
the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.

494
00:40:49,141 --> 00:40:54,742
He has been creating strategies to
sell the war in Iraq.

495
00:40:54,902 --> 00:41:00,583
Part of the strategy was to attack the
anti-war attack.

496
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:02,863
And blacken their reputation.

497
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:07,903
Did you look at any of the washington
significant public relations agency,
-.

498
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:14,304
In the teeming former politicians,
civil servants and the CIA people,.

499
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:17,465
And now more and more suppliers.

500
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:25,866
It is easier to manage a bad
conscience than a bad reputation.

501
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:42,428
After working for 16 years in the
Financial Times.

502
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:46,829
I was lured into a number of other
suppliers like public relations
industry.

503
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:50,429
So I changed the camp.

504
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:54,830
Now I speak on behalf of businesses,
-.

505
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,110
Which is taken before the hostility.

506
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,831
It's no wonder that there is talk of
going to the side of evil.

507
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,871
We live in a time.

508
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:12,912
That leading companies are extremely
accurate reputations.

509
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,713
They know that for decades built a
reputation.

510
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:22,193
Can be destroyed in an instant.

511
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,434
So when a company feels threatened,.

512
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:30,794
It is trying to divert attention from
the real story.

513
00:42:30,954 --> 00:42:36,795
Provides a pile of alternative good
information,.

514
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:41,116
Or it may be trying to discredit
critics.

515
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:47,476
It is, therefore, tells reporters how
its reputation threatens to.

516
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:51,677
One of the notorious Swedish
film-maker,.

517
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:55,637
Which represents deceit conferred by a
lawyer.

518
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:59,878
Supplier of the exclusive right, and
all the necessary background
information,.

519
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,158
As long as the story notes into
circulation.

520
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:05,639
This is a los angeles business journal
home page.

521
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,119
Note Dole banana.

522
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,360
The document makes the Dole enemy
hero,.

523
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,000
Although this is a fabricated facts.

524
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,760
The author has not even seen the
movie!

525
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,721
The most important thing is to get its
own version of the public first.

526
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,401
And to surround it with adhesive
story.

527
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:31,162
It may be other suppliers to see the
same point of view.

528
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:37,123
If I get frederick is the bad guy, the
story of the first leaves,.

529
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:42,524
And I get to talk to people about my
story will live on.

530
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:48,084
Swedish documentary filmmaker went to
Nicaragua.

531
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:53,925
And made ??a film of pesticide effects
on health workers.

532
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:56,725
Thing just was not true.

533
00:43:56,805 --> 00:44:00,646
For the men had a lawyer to recruit.

534
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:04,846
This lawyer was something
hampaankolossa dolea against.

535
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:09,487
So he recruited employees to lie,.

536
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,447
That they had lost their health.

537
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:18,168
Documentaries in the fraud was
revealed by the film is completed.

538
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:24,089
He still wants to make films.
- Of course, he is an artist.

539
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:26,809
My advice is.

540
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:32,050
That he might want to add the movie
dolea satisfactory period,.

541
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,931
Where the recruiter will be revealed
villain.

542
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:42,771
That's a great solution.
Why not contact supervisor.

543
00:44:48,492 --> 00:44:54,093
I'm not saying that your version would
have been enough column space.

544
00:44:54,173 --> 00:44:58,373
On the other side is only improved
relations with the leaves as you,.

545
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:03,134
And the public relations office would
be stupid not to use the relationship
advantage.

546
00:45:05,614 --> 00:45:08,975
I realize the huge machinery of
fighting against.

547
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:11,495
Which uses a strategy of intimidation,
-.

548
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:15,296
Media Control, public relations
gimmicks and the Ugly extracts.

549
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:20,536
Lobbying and public relations agencies
offer a wide range of services.

550
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:23,097
One form of service is.

551
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:29,777
Sneak the experts opinion articles in
newspapers.

552
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:38,139
Public relations agencies are working
special letter to the editor writers.

553
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:43,539
Then, from think tanks or universities
looking for someone.

554
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:48,580
Which is enough for the name, and he
will sign a thing.

555
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,980
Finally, the article introduced
through the newspaper.

556
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,901
I was able to hit a bonanza.

557
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:01,141
It's not pretty to pursue a career
studying,.

558
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:04,342
What is of interest to the media,.

559
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:07,582
And then to turn against it.

560
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:10,063
Here it is.

561
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:15,823
UCLA's media legislation, the head
nurse.

562
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:22,464
I was surprised to actually David
Ginsburg 's opinion to the
counterparty.

563
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:26,345
Ginsburg is a member of the Copyright
Association,.

564
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:29,545
Which I chair, before yourself.

565
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:33,906
Members are primarily of the defense
lawyers,.

566
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:38,946
Representing the filmmakers just such
a dispute cases.

567
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:42,507
Why not, therefore, sought the opinion
of him?

568
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:46,707
Ginsburg has made a summary of the
movie,.

569
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:49,788
Where is he actually agrees with Dole
's view.

570
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:52,668
Movie perspectives falsehood.

571
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:56,709
One piece is startling.

572
00:46:56,869 --> 00:46:59,869
Ginsburg compares the document.

573
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:03,110
After the Second World War propaganda
film.

574
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:08,110
A classic example for this movie is.

575
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,711
He, therefore, refers to your movie.

576
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:16,111
It is the Nazi anti-Semitic movie der
ewige jude.

577
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:21,232
Ginsburg, therefore, to combine your
movie propaganda film,.

578
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:24,672
Who tried to justify the Holocaust.

579
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:28,793
In one scene shown first swarm of rats
in sewers,.

580
00:47:28,873 --> 00:47:33,193
And since then, a number of Jews in a
congested street.

581
00:47:33,593 --> 00:47:35,834
This is a Judas - like madness!

582
00:47:35,914 --> 00:47:41,835
Ginsburg was enlisted by offering
words of my mouth and the payment in
your hand.

583
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:46,395
Because he is known as a defender of
film-makers,.

584
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:50,236
His words carry weight when he bites
one of their own.

585
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,836
This is really depressing.

586
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:15,079
Money talks, and apparently also on
the internet.

587
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,560
I noticed that the dole had bought my
name on Google.

588
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,440
When I did a search by my name, next
to the fire Dole ad.

589
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,520
Facts and dolesta dbcp to.

590
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:32,121
Even the movie trailer link next to
the Dole.

591
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:39,642
Online articles appeared after the
aggressive comments.

592
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:44,163
Can fake grass-roots online comments
when you buy?

593
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:49,843
It is clear that the strategic
communications of people.

594
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:54,404
Appearing in the virtual world of
bogus identities.

595
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:57,884
In order to draw attention to the
questions you want.

596
00:48:58,164 --> 00:49:03,245
Company may hire dozens of people to
present the brand supporters.

597
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:08,286
Such an artificial grass-roots
campaign.

598
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,206
Called the astroturffaukseksi, which
is against the rules.

599
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:16,527
As the authors are not really excited
about this.

600
00:49:16,607 --> 00:49:22,208
And may not be aware of it, just keeps
saying mechanical opinions,.

601
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:27,448
Things really aware of the often
recognize us quickly.

602
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,730
Strategic communication, now people
are hired,.

603
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,811
With no traditional communications
background.

604
00:49:46,891 --> 00:49:51,611
They come from intelligence services,
the field of psychology companies.

605
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:55,852
Or human behavior intended to modify
the fields,.

606
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:59,172
Which have so far worked in silence.

607
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:04,173
Communications is beginning to blur
boundaries,.

608
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:08,534
For these people provide different
from traditional solutions.

609
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:17,455
For example, black painted man trying
to be the case.

610
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:23,015
Look for ways to drive a wedge between
him and his support network between.

611
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:26,816
You as a producer you respond to the
veracity of the film.

612
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:33,217
One way to assess the sustainability
of the battle in.

613
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:36,377
It is to examine his financial
situation.

614
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:41,938
The second is to look at his situation
in life.

615
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:45,898
Is there alcoholism or intense stress?

616
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:49,699
It is important to assess the
opponent's forces.

617
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:53,499
Is the skeletons in your closet?
Has he done this before?

618
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,340
Do you need this time private
detective services.

619
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,700
Or perhaps a phone or e-mail hackers?

620
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,581
These services are bought and sold
everywhere.

621
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:11,382
With hundreds of millions of dollars
of the company will keep its
reputation,.

622
00:51:11,462 --> 00:51:17,823
A few million worth investing in a
campaign.

623
00:51:21,463 --> 00:51:25,144
Gertten bananas!
Spread lies.

624
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:34,305
The arguments prove the reality of the
movie.

625
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:39,185
Financial situation indicates that wg
film is desperate.

626
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:43,466
It is a little naive to think.

627
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:47,746
That the attack on the multinational
attack.

628
00:51:47,826 --> 00:51:52,507
Lead to some sort of confrontation.

629
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:56,588
I do not have connections to Dole,.

630
00:51:56,748 --> 00:52:02,588
But I am opposed to such Gertten
instructors publicity stunts.

631
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:06,629
Dole spends millions of brand
polishing.

632
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:10,669
Then you're going to stain it.

633
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:13,270
What do you think about the following?

634
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:18,710
You as a producer you respond to the
veracity of the film.

635
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:27,312
Good luck with firm financial matters!

636
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:30,632
The letter was addressed to me,.

637
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:34,112
But really it was intended to
frederick,.

638
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,633
In particular, it contained anger.

639
00:52:37,713 --> 00:52:43,234
I'm mostly shawls, when I did not
understand well, you own.

640
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,674
I would not have to worry if I would
just discard Frederick.

641
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:57,195
Frederick said that they can pull out
of this, if I want to.

642
00:52:57,596 --> 00:53:00,716
Yes, he would do on my own.

643
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:04,236
How are you, Margaret?
- Well, how about yourself?

644
00:53:04,396 --> 00:53:08,237
Alan adapted to be back in Los Angeles
at the time.

645
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:15,558
How could I look at myself in the eye
if I were to leave the ship now?

646
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:18,358
I just can not do that.

647
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:24,159
We did a movie together and we will
continue together until the end.

648
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,480
Lincoln, whether the counterparty
reply to you.

649
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,600
Nothing dangerous or unexpected?

650
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,241
No, it's just an action play.

651
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,722
We decided to respond by striking
back.

652
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,922
We challenge the right of Dole.

653
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:54,043
The limitation of the right to freedom
of expression through the story.

654
00:53:55,523 --> 00:54:00,604
We wished us a favorable decision as
soon as possible.

655
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:11,485
Here, frederick Gertten Sweden.

656
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:15,286
I have some exciting news.
Is Lincoln 's New?

657
00:54:15,446 --> 00:54:21,246
He is in fact the law to take care of
juttuasi.

658
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:33,728
Hi, Richard.
Fredrik here in Sweden. - Hey!

659
00:54:33,888 --> 00:54:38,569
Dole gave me a call.

660
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:43,529
She was the assistant Michael Carter.

661
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:49,810
Carter wants to come to Sweden to meet
with me.

662
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:56,131
Interesting.
Carter is Dole's lawyer.

663
00:54:56,291 --> 00:55:01,252
It was he who praised the leaves of
the dole will challenge us to court.

664
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:03,452
That's interesting.

665
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:07,332
Perhaps the dole trying to buy you
before you raise the action.

666
00:55:10,013 --> 00:55:14,693
What is the price?
- I do not know.
It is a difficult question.

667
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:20,614
The agreement is likely to mean a ban
on the film distribution.

668
00:55:20,974 --> 00:55:25,135
Dole is most important to prevent the
presentation of the film.
- It is clear.

669
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:30,015
Keep in mind that their lawyer was not
allowed to speak with you.

670
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:33,296
Without my permission, and entomology.

671
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:43,657
I was wondering why carter wanted to
come and see me.

672
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:47,017
He would offer reconciliation?

673
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,578
Stop the dole brutality?

674
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:57,179
Someone days to get the carter was in
the local newspaper website,.

675
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:59,779
And his message was very clear.

676
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,579
He loses the case.

677
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,460
I wrote a story sydsvenskaniin.

678
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,741
Then I got an email, which offered a
contact.

679
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:14,221
Dole's lawyer, Michael Carter.

680
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:16,781
Ol late in the evening.

681
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,262
I waited for his plane landing in Los
Angeles,.

682
00:56:21,422 --> 00:56:24,382
So she can get the phone.

683
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:27,823
I called him and we talked for about
40 minutes.

684
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:33,023
He was really nice and I like Swedish,
-.

685
00:56:33,183 --> 00:56:35,904
As had been working at Securitas.

686
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:41,305
He felt the Swedish culture and knew
how little Swedish.
Another

687
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:45,665
He said the decision to bring an
action to have been difficult,.

688
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:48,906
For he knew it would bring bad
publicity.

689
00:56:49,066 --> 00:56:52,346
He still can not just stand by.

690
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:55,746
The company's reputation for black
out.

691
00:56:56,466 --> 00:57:02,867
Carter's view, a broad - leaf
scribbling turns against you.

692
00:57:03,427 --> 00:57:09,668
He said the time directly, you do not
have opportunities,.

693
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,829
And the fact that the dole was
correct.

694
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:18,469
Provides Gertten fight, but I know he
negligible.

695
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:24,790
The supplier, it was delicious quote.

696
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,591
Take a look at how the challenge has
brought him publicity.

697
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:34,311
Now he is on TV and all over the
place.

698
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:40,912
Gertten does not help the matter by
doing so.

699
00:57:41,032 --> 00:57:45,433
He urges people to boycott the Dole
products.

700
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:52,794
I was hoping to finish his senses, but
it is not the case.

701
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:57,354
Instead, he's going to fight back.
Tapelkoon ago.

702
00:57:57,434 --> 00:58:00,995
A few days later I found a blog
online.

703
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:04,555
Local blogger had been following our
meeting.

704
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:09,516
He told how he ordered a fast food
place fruit salad.

705
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:15,717
The blog has no ads and earn money
with it.

706
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:20,317
I'm only interested in politics.

707
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:23,278
At the time when the document was
controversy,.

708
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,878
I went to a nerd with a friend of the
city.

709
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,479
Computer Shops on a discovery tour.

710
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,960
We got hungry and decided to go to
MAX.

711
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,960
It is a Swedish company, and the
burgers are good.

712
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,001
I ordered a fruit salad instead of
French.

713
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:51,881
I picked up the package in my hand and
saw that it said dole.

714
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:54,882
I was like, what the hell is that?

715
00:58:55,882 --> 00:59:01,283
I said, cashier girl, I do not want to
eat I products.

716
00:59:01,923 --> 00:59:06,163
However, I took a cell phone picture
of the jar.

717
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:11,684
At home I wrote a message to Max.

718
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:18,085
I asked how environmentally conscious
profiled max.

719
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:22,605
Can not sell something as unethical as
I am a fruit salad.

720
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:28,286
Alfonso referred to the film, and the
right thing.

721
00:59:28,446 --> 00:59:33,567
I was not aware of the whole thing, so
I study it online.

722
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:38,568
I also asked the marketing people do
not look into it.

723
00:59:38,728 --> 00:59:44,648
During this time, a few other customer
asked us the same thing.

724
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:50,169
We studied the case, and it does not
feel good to us.

725
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:53,409
We asked for an explanation dolelta,
-.

726
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:57,370
But the Swedish market pushed the
issue for Americans,.

727
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:00,330
And they, in turn, will never be
answered.

728
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,971
We decided to simply stop selling the
product immediately.

729
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:10,972
Max's communications manager said to
me,.

730
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:17,173
They talked, and I finished with the
co-operation.

731
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:20,133
Pan got the answer on my website,.

732
01:00:20,213 --> 01:00:24,814
And I attached the picture of fruit
salad and a ban on the mark.

733
01:00:25,894 --> 01:00:28,134
That's what it is, then the circus
began.

734
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:34,055
In the morning, then played a
journalist,.

735
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:38,255
Even though we were not informed of
this matter in any way.

736
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,456
He told me that he has read the blog
of our decision.

737
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:47,136
I answered his questions, and I
thought about it after that.

738
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:52,137
Couple of hours to get the phone rang
constantly.

739
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:56,178
Reporters from all over the Swedish
began to strum.

740
01:00:57,978 --> 01:01:00,658
Large newspapers took up the story.

741
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:05,539
Suddenly we were in the financial
section of the cultural pages instead
of.

742
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:08,339
And the financial pages lies the
power.

743
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,981
Then I came across a block trade in
cheese.

744
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:22,381
The parliamentary representative
Luciano Astudillo.

745
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:26,902
He had read about the battle and asked
if he could be of help.

746
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:31,662
I said that would be great to look
like a movie parliamentary
representatives.

747
01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:34,983
Luciano is a social democrat,.

748
01:01:35,143 --> 01:01:38,703
So I called the Moderates.

749
01:01:38,783 --> 01:01:41,183
And I suggested to him the same thing.

750
01:01:45,504 --> 01:01:51,545
Good morning!
You look stylish.
- Good that even one of us.

751
01:01:58,906 --> 01:02:04,386
Dole and Frederick the dispute between
the Gertten began,.

752
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,067
When the film was chosen Gertten.

753
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,947
Los Angeles Film Festival's
competition series in June.

754
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,708
It is, however, closed tenders,.

755
01:02:13,868 --> 01:02:16,988
When the dole threatened the
organizers the right to visit.

756
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,588
The film was still,.

757
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:24,269
And in July the director and the
company have the right to challenge.

758
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:28,150
Now, therefore, the film shows the
Reichstag representatives.

759
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:32,630
Why do film sets, Luciano Astudillo?

760
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:37,471
Basically, it is the right of authors
to describe the events.

761
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:41,711
We would like to support the
filmmakers right here.

762
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,192
It's about freedom of speech.
- Yes.

763
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:48,552
When politics and economics will be
cross-border,.

764
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:51,192
Freedom of speech must be it, too.

765
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:56,193
We should have the right to document
important events.

766
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:59,594
What if the dole to be successful in
their intentions?

767
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:03,114
How it would have a devastating impact
on the whole world,.

768
01:03:03,194 --> 01:03:07,395
If the film-makers or suppliers would
not be able to describe the events?

769
01:03:07,475 --> 01:03:10,635
How can we no longer require anyone
held accountable?

770
01:03:11,315 --> 01:03:17,156
We will consider with my colleagues
Astudillo, what we could do.

771
01:03:17,316 --> 01:03:19,716
For us, it was quite clear,.

772
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,357
That if the film can not be produced
anywhere in the world,.

773
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:25,437
It is presented here.

774
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:29,037
What movie presentation here mean to
you?

775
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:34,878
I am on the day of the state and the
representatives of the initiative
extremely proud of.

776
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:39,479
It says that the Swedish freedom of
speech is an important issue.

777
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:43,359
It's great that it can foster this
cross-party.

778
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:48,200
I have not been to the state before
the day in the house.

779
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:55,321
At first I was excited, but then I was
afraid of being disappointed,.

780
01:03:55,401 --> 01:03:59,121
If you came here only a few
journalists and politicians.

781
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:05,122
I saw you on TV.
- 's Great that you could come.

782
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:10,723
Nice to see you again.

783
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:15,203
This is Margarete, which has also
received the challenge.

784
01:04:16,484 --> 01:04:20,884
The participants, however, was a
lovely lot!

785
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:29,725
It's great that so many people have
come to the site.

786
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:34,006
This is about freedom of speech, which
is a global issue.

787
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:38,406
Freedom of speech is always under
attack, every moment, everywhere in
the world.

788
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:43,327
Therefore, in such cases as clear as
day to respond.

789
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:46,847
It is a Democratic politician's most
important tasks.

790
01:04:47,288 --> 01:04:51,648
It is said that the films are at their
best movie theater,.

791
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:56,089
But it is great to be able to film the
Swedish Parliament House.

792
01:04:56,249 --> 01:05:01,689
I am extremely proud of this and I
really hope.

793
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:04,730
That the output signal from sweden.

794
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:10,931
I can also be reached on the other
side of the world.

795
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:16,091
The idea of freedom of speech is that
it belongs to everyone.

796
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:20,052
It is one of the bad guys.

797
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:23,972
It belongs to those who want to
eliminate freedom of speech.

798
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:29,133
In Sweden, the freedom of expression
is a very ancient origins of the law.

799
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:33,214
Already in 1766 a law was passed.

800
01:05:33,294 --> 01:05:38,494
Speech, thought and opinion, freedom
of the formation.

801
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:42,015
We will continue to Machete attacks.

802
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:47,415
We have eaten them hard, and they
bleed.

803
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:52,216
Now sharpen a large machete, which
becomes sharper,.

804
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:55,296
And they know it.

805
01:05:57,977 --> 01:06:01,897
How do I go from here?

806
01:06:03,097 --> 01:06:06,138
How to proceed in your case?

807
01:06:08,418 --> 01:06:13,139
As well as they do now, we will buy
new actions.

808
01:06:15,859 --> 01:06:20,860
This is a war, and war is long.

809
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,300
It must be very patient.

810
01:06:37,862 --> 01:06:41,142
The hall was dark, and perhaps a
comfortable,.

811
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:43,583
But the popcorn missing,.

812
01:06:43,783 --> 01:06:48,223
When the bananas!
Were presented today at the Swedish
Parliament House.

813
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:52,824
Piittaako dole day, however, the state
representatives thoughts?

814
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:57,224
The film was made in Europe and mainly
in a Swedish -based resources.

815
01:06:57,384 --> 01:07:01,905
It is outrageous that other countries
lack of freedom of speech.

816
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:04,385
Take on the elements to justice.

817
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:11,186
It is important that in addition to
signing the petition.

818
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:16,027
We will ensure the dissemination of
the film in Sweden, and we will be
presenting it.

819
01:07:16,347 --> 01:07:20,307
I hope as many joins in the appeal,.

820
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,308
By the mats and I have waited for
today set in motion.

821
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:28,108
We hope as many parliamentary
representative signature.

822
01:07:28,268 --> 01:07:32,389
We call it dolea to abandon the
action.

823
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:36,189
Gertten support to the right than the
left.

824
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,230
After the show, we got the support of
all parties.

825
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:45,551
Almost all parliamentary
representatives signed the petition,
-.

826
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:48,671
Where dolea required to give up the
action.

827
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:53,512
In the worst case, such a generated
global model,.

828
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:59,632
Where governments, companies or people
to challenge the critics right.

829
01:08:00,113 --> 01:08:03,033
We do not want the kind of development
to Swedish.

830
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,434
Dole's public relations office was
activated further.

831
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:11,954
It took me to contact each of the
interviewees ry in the supplier.

832
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:15,034
And approached the letter of
parliamentary representatives.

833
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:17,795
What do you think you received a
letter?

834
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:21,515
It would have made me most,.

835
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:26,116
If it would have cleared things up,
which is accused of dolea movie.

836
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:31,837
At first, the letters did frighten and
provoke people,.

837
01:08:31,997 --> 01:08:35,397
But when they found out the other
receiving the same,.

838
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:37,517
The atmosphere changed.

839
01:08:38,718 --> 01:08:41,398
The letters started to become a joke.

840
01:08:41,478 --> 01:08:45,038
Can I have a copy of the letter?
- Without a doubt.

841
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:49,079
Who has signed?
- Michael carter dole States.

842
01:08:49,519 --> 01:08:53,079
The courier brought it a few days ago.

843
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:57,040
It is said that the dole strongly
supports freedom of expression,.

844
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,560
And the rest of the letter is
frederick Gertten slander.

845
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,761
Authors chose to ignore the truth,
misrepresent the film.

846
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:09,882
Dole's campaign reacted aggressive
tone.

847
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:14,402
In politics, it is always better to
tell my argument.

848
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:16,883
Like black paint other.

849
01:09:16,963 --> 01:09:19,763
Gertten is to defend freedom of
expression.

850
01:09:19,843 --> 01:09:25,484
Maybe we can get this thing a comma
after the letter dolelta.

851
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:29,084
Yesterday I found my own e-mail box.

852
01:09:29,244 --> 01:09:35,245
Dolea should hear to understand, and
the film tell the truth.

853
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:46,206
Since the spring touring bananas!
Today the Swedish premiere.

854
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:48,847
Bananas!
- Need we say more?

855
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:53,247
We know how they tried to stop the
presentation in Los Angeles.

856
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:57,128
It has got a huge amount of advance
publicity.

857
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:01,408
It has been seen in Parliament House
and discussed.

858
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,249
It spreads surprisingly many copies
of,.

859
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:07,569
So viewers can have a lot already in
theaters.

860
01:10:07,649 --> 01:10:12,250
It is a decent thriller lawyers, a bit
like Philadelphia.

861
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:16,690
How many of you let the sun?
- Four.
It is a very good documentary.

862
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:26,852
Week day the state of the house after
the show is a Swedish premiere.

863
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:30,052
We get a tremendous amount of support.

864
01:10:30,212 --> 01:10:32,772
We do not know any more how to react
dole,.

865
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:37,013
But this is a great moment for us,
which we enjoyed really.

866
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:43,014
Most of the text messages read simply
:

867
01:10:43,174 --> 01:10:45,734
Good Luck!
Keep up the fight!

868
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:50,175
Karin Gothenburg by asking the
countries in which the film is shown.

869
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:53,815
Does it present in the United States?
- We do not know yet.

870
01:10:53,975 --> 01:10:57,656
We will not allow themselves to be
intimidated Dole,.

871
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:02,256
But the journey is just beginning, and
we do not know how it will end.

872
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,857
What would be the worst outcome?

873
01:11:05,017 --> 01:11:12,498
I have decided not to waste any energy
pondering it.

874
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:16,058
It's what dole wants us to do.

875
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:22,779
Now it is better to present the film,
viewers meet and talk about the issue.

876
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:28,020
Thus, we all dolelta we ask : what the
heck are you doing?

877
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:46,702
All of a sudden people are talking
about the banana workers' treatment.

878
01:11:46,862 --> 01:11:48,862
And freedom of expression.

879
01:11:56,823 --> 01:12:02,024
Shopping customers complained that
they did not want Dole bananas.

880
01:12:05,304 --> 01:12:09,105
Bananas are among the sales of
products,.

881
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:12,225
So the stores held her meetings.

882
01:12:12,385 --> 01:12:15,066
They feel the pressure on his neck.

883
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:24,387
We follow the discussion from day to
day.

884
01:12:24,547 --> 01:12:29,948
The issue received new dimensions in
July of action.

885
01:12:30,028 --> 01:12:33,348
The transaction is dolelta
negotiations with the proceedings.

886
01:12:33,428 --> 01:12:36,668
We asked the dole europea to come to
the meeting.

887
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:41,389
Let you know about our customers a
huge reaction.

888
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:45,350
And the fact that we do not accept
claims by victims.

889
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:52,871
Finally, pressure was on and I will
dole.

890
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,271
Me and my new friend of a politician
-.

891
01:12:56,351 --> 01:13:00,712
We called the major food chains to
meet the Reichstag to the house.

892
01:13:02,272 --> 01:13:06,032
Two hours prior to the meeting,
reporters began to strum.

893
01:13:06,112 --> 01:13:08,713
Dole had given up the action.

894
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:11,833
Dole today announced suddenly.

895
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:16,274
Withdrew its action against Frederick
the Gertten.

896
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:18,554
David defeated Goliath.

897
01:13:18,634 --> 01:13:22,554
The banana giant Dole discontinued the
proceedings against Frederick the
Gertten.

898
01:13:22,634 --> 01:13:26,235
Dole cancels the action against the
documentarist.

899
01:13:26,395 --> 01:13:29,035
This is fantastic.

900
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:32,996
Although we are only a small Swedish
company,.

901
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:36,316
And the dole is a billion-dollar
American company,.

902
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:40,477
We have been able to tell what is
right and what is wrong.

903
01:13:40,637 --> 01:13:45,077
We are delighted with this, but the
air is still a lot of questions.

904
01:13:45,157 --> 01:13:48,198
We have not yet talked with the
lawyers.

905
01:13:48,278 --> 01:13:51,398
We have only seen the Dole press
release.

906
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:54,719
We played the Dole representative.

907
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:08,720
Swedish reactions and a strong concern
for really touched us.

908
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,001
We felt it was important to tell the
people,.

909
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:15,801
That we respect the freedom of
expression.

910
01:14:15,961 --> 01:14:18,602
This is the way it looks.

911
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:23,402
It was fantastic to see how the movie
will be supported.

912
01:14:23,482 --> 01:14:26,043
The same is unlikely to happen in
Canada.

913
01:14:26,123 --> 01:14:29,163
I was encouraged to follow it far from
here,.

914
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:34,484
And at the same time frustrating to
know that if the same would happen
here,.

915
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:37,084
Things could be subject to change.

916
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:40,484
When you face a really severe
pressure,.

917
01:14:40,645 --> 01:14:43,165
Familiar with ease himself small.

918
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:47,205
Then the need for friends.

919
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:51,366
They have received.
I have been supported by the very
great.

920
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,846
How much is the toll on the forces?

921
01:14:55,006 --> 01:14:59,247
We got our first letter dolelta 8 May.

922
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,807
It's been more than five months.

923
01:15:01,967 --> 01:15:04,968
During this time, I do not have any
days off.

924
01:15:05,048 --> 01:15:09,728
Does this work in the future?
- I do not think so.

925
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:13,249
I was afraid that if we would lose,.

926
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:17,889
Nor are the other would not dare
anymore to explore large companies.

927
01:15:18,049 --> 01:15:20,730
Therefore, it was important to win
this thing.

928
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:26,170
Profit is a good sign for people who
want to make movies.

929
01:15:27,331 --> 01:15:29,931
Dolessa may be calculated incorrectly.

930
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:33,891
Their technique might have to bite
very well.

931
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:37,452
U.S.
newspapers with a.

932
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:41,172
But in Scandinavia it had the opposite
effect.

933
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:45,893
There's viewed with suspicion the
American company,.

934
01:15:45,973 --> 01:15:48,413
That the use of such methods.

935
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:57,134
Now I feel a lot better to be a film
director.

936
01:15:57,214 --> 01:16:00,215
The film will tour the world, and so I
do.

937
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:04,015
I know, however, that the war with
Dole's not over yet.

938
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:11,976
Charity Gala attendees glittering on
the red carpet,.

939
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:15,617
When ex - President Gorbachev and
activist Bob Geldof.

940
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:18,177
Welcome you.

941
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:22,858
This is happening only in Berlin.

942
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,778
This is the ninth Cinema for Peace
event.

943
01:16:26,938 --> 01:16:32,339
Although Leonardo DiCaprio girl
friends gets a lot of attention,.

944
01:16:32,419 --> 01:16:37,380
Gala, focus on films such as bananas!.

945
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:43,060
The film after seeing the Germans
should ask their retailers.

946
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:47,261
How their own banana or tomato is
grown.

947
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:52,422
The banana company tried to stop
displaying this document,.

948
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:55,222
That should startle the consumers.

949
01:17:03,223 --> 01:17:06,703
What were celebrated as winners, but
it seems wrong.

950
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:13,704
The film was presented in Europe, but
not in the United States.

951
01:17:15,585 --> 01:17:19,105
Dole was smartly giving up the action
-.

952
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:21,465
Before the court decision.

953
01:17:21,545 --> 01:17:25,266
This meant that the dole was able to
challenge us again.

954
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,666
That in turn means the risk,.

955
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:32,467
Which is why the film did not get the
insurance distribution.

956
01:17:32,627 --> 01:17:37,947
The only way to get it was to win the
dole distribution law.

957
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:47,549
Hello!
What to Los Angeles are you?

958
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:51,229
Here is as sunny as ever.

959
01:17:51,309 --> 01:17:53,950
All want to know how the morning went.

960
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,310
The morning was all in all a
disappointment.

961
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:07,111
The judge has referred a case to 24.6.
Until now.

962
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:11,872
What!
- As he has done.

963
01:18:11,952 --> 01:18:14,192
In the background is I guess the idea
-.

964
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:17,833
When the application has been
withdrawn, so what's errand no longer
is.

965
01:18:17,913 --> 01:18:20,953
I told that to us it makes a lot of
matter,.

966
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:23,913
As the situation to prevent the
dissemination of the film.

967
01:18:23,993 --> 01:18:28,954
For us it is important that the matter
can no longer bring a new action.

968
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:32,635
Judge Dow replied only,.

969
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:36,475
Perhaps, that the parties should talk
about reconciliation.

970
01:18:37,275 --> 01:18:41,356
The fact is that the story is no
longer in your power.

971
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:43,596
We do not have a choice.

972
01:18:43,756 --> 01:18:50,077
Dole has reached its destination, and
shut your mouth.

973
01:18:53,197 --> 01:18:57,398
God, this will never end.
I imagined this to be over.

974
01:18:57,558 --> 01:18:59,918
Even if you win the case,.

975
01:18:59,998 --> 01:19:03,839
Dole appeal to a higher court.

976
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:08,319
That would mean at least a year of
additional delay.

977
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:12,720
Dole could also pay for warranties,.

978
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,640
In which case it does not have to pay
court costs immediately.

979
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,441
Although we would win in June,.

980
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:24,321
This thing is not over yet for a long
time.

981
01:19:27,002 --> 01:19:29,362
All right.

982
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:36,643
In general, I admire very much the
legal system,.

983
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:39,443
But today does not seem to like it.

984
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,164
Also in June the hearing was canceled.

985
01:19:45,324 --> 01:19:48,324
Plagued has been going on for over a
year.

986
01:19:48,524 --> 01:19:54,765
In late August, michael carter asked
us to abandon the action.

987
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:59,246
He is ready to come to Sweden to
negotiate an agreement,.

988
01:19:59,326 --> 01:20:02,446
If you just cut a movie a few points.

989
01:20:02,526 --> 01:20:05,087
These guys do not ever give up.

990
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:08,567
They do not give up, even know that
they are wrong.

991
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:23,329
This thing is not over yet for a long
time.

992
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:27,329
In two recent reading dole made ??it
clear.

993
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,730
It does not agree to compensation.

994
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:32,970
No one knows when this will end the
litigation.

995
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:38,331
Half years, Lincoln has become like a
brother to me.

996
01:20:38,411 --> 01:20:41,611
Here is your thing.

997
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:44,692
So all of this, so that I could make
movies.

998
01:20:44,772 --> 01:20:47,492
Here are the juttuusi Statements.

999
01:20:47,812 --> 01:20:51,853
Self- defense of the law is not a
cheap thing.

1000
01:20:55,693 --> 01:20:59,574
Two months later, on my way to the
film festival.

1001
01:20:59,774 --> 01:21:04,134
On the same day lincoln face Dole in
court in Los Angeles.

1002
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:07,295
This is the moment we've been waiting
for.

1003
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:18,536
I was really excited.

1004
01:21:18,696 --> 01:21:25,737
Initial Decision is exactly the way I
wanted.

1005
01:21:25,817 --> 01:21:31,658
It is a point that sums up everything
perfectly.

1006
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:37,339
Watching a movie is not supported by
Dole 's arguments about it.

1007
01:21:37,419 --> 01:21:40,099
That's what we have experienced.

1008
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:44,459
The judge ruled Edelman couple of
times to the sidelines,.

1009
01:21:44,539 --> 01:21:47,220
Thats what movie are you talking
about.

1010
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,780
Edelmann just went on and on,.

1011
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,821
Until the judge said that, now, this
should suffice.

1012
01:21:55,901 --> 01:22:00,542
The filmmakers won a libel case
brought by Dole.

1013
01:22:00,742 --> 01:22:05,502
Dole was ordered to pay for freedom of
speech 200 story $ 000.

1014
01:22:05,582 --> 01:22:10,983
Dole 200 $ 000 contribution to the
film story.

1015
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:14,863
I did not think I could read the legal
text with a smile,.

1016
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:18,184
But this is a complete victory for us.

1017
01:22:18,344 --> 01:22:21,184
The big boys are gone.

1018
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:40,467
Now we can present the film in the
United States.

1019
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:45,027
At least I hope, because those guys
can not ever be sure.

1020
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,228
Lincoln wrote a few days later :

1021
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:55,029
Fredrik and Margarita, sit firmly for
sure?

1022
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:58,549
Dole gave me a call today.

1023
01:22:58,709 --> 01:23:03,390
The caller was not a lawyer, but the
financial department.

1024
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:08,430
He made only one question: where the
money is sent.

1025
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:11,711
It's over.
Dole did not choose the verdict.

1026
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:17,031
We won.

1027
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:25,433
Dole's action is based on allegations
that the juan dominguez was a fraud
and a traitor.

1028
01:23:25,713 --> 01:23:31,233
In March 2011, California Bar
Association set aside the doubts
connected to Dominguez.

1029
01:23:36,914 --> 01:23:41,235
I returned to Nicaragua to show the
film for the workers.

1030
01:23:41,635 --> 01:23:47,595
Dole had spent millions to silence
this story.

1031
01:23:48,956 --> 01:23:53,436
These stories of poverty and injustice
-.

1032
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:57,077
I have to tell you again and again.

1033
01:23:58,477 --> 01:24:02,437
It was very good to me, and can you
guess why?

1034
01:24:02,597 --> 01:24:07,878
Because it told the truth, and the
truth can never be silenced.

1035
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:41,882
Gibraltar associates.
- Can I get John Proctor.

1036
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:44,803
Just a second, I connect.

1037
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:54,404
This guy took us to every Swedish
supplier,.

1038
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:58,165
Who interviewed me, I'm under attack.

1039
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:05,206
Hey, John!
Here, frederick Gertten, bananas! -
Filmmaker.

1040
01:25:05,406 --> 01:25:09,006
Good morning.
How are you?
- Very good.

1041
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:13,767
I would like to film this evening here
in Washington.

1042
01:25:13,927 --> 01:25:17,047
I read it in the Washington Post.

1043
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:21,088
You are welcome to take a look at it
if you can.

1044
01:25:21,248 --> 01:25:28,449
Thank you for the invitation, but I
have agreed to relocate.

1045
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:35,529
I read all of the articles of course,
if it is written in the press.

1046
01:25:35,609 --> 01:25:38,810
Tell me you'll meet me now that I'm
here?

1047
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,650
I beg your pardon?

1048
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:44,971
Tell me you'll meet me now that I'm
here?

1049
01:25:45,131 --> 01:25:47,931
That's a big deal.

1050
01:25:48,091 --> 01:25:52,172
Here, the distances are so short.
- True.

1051
01:25:52,692 --> 01:25:58,492
Produce.
I do not know.

1052
01:25:58,572 --> 01:26:02,413
I do not know what we were talking
about really.

1053
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:06,013
I appreciate very much indeed for this
call and the offer.

1054
01:26:06,854 --> 01:26:10,614
I will get back to you.
- Done so.

1055
01:26:10,694 --> 01:26:15,215
And good luck tonight.
- Thank you.
