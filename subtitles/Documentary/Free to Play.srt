1
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:19,214
In August 2011 a tournament
featuring the popular

2
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,809
online strategy game Dota 2 was
held in Cologne, Germany.

3
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,692
It offered the largest prize pool to date

4
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:30,500
attracting professional players
from all over the world.

5
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:36,083
Yes, it is actually confirmed.

6
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:39,800
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

7
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,203
I'm double-checking to make sure
they haven't changed any details

8
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,300
since they told us last time.

9
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:46,750
1 million in US dollars for First Prize.

10
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:46,855
That is for the winner.

11
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:49,751
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

12
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,447
It's going to be huge. Dota2.com

13
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:54,117
The tournament tab is up, too.

14
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:57,632
Our website will actually change
for the next 24 hours as well...

15
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:02,389
The day I transformed into an adult was
the day I started playing Dota.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,839
It's times like, when you
go up on the stage,

17
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:10,320
you represent your country for something.

18
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,527
You get the prize.

19
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:14,660
It's the amount of satisfaction and achievement
that nothing else can give you.

20
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,361
It's something I definitely
don't regret ever doing.

21
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:20,100
Gaming is simply the proudest
thing in my life.

22
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:29,393
It can be called "gamer," but for me,
it's something different.

23
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:36,474
One way to forget about pain is to do
something that you will be in completely.

24
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:38,288
So...

25
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,976
computer games.

26
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:43,004
For me, it was...

27
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,941
everything.

28
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,284
This is my career.

29
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,800
I've chosen to do it for so long.

30
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:56,847
Success in my eyes is always based
on how other people see you.

31
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,607
In the eyes of the public,

32
00:01:58,062 --> 00:01:59,945
it's up to them.

33
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:09,155
It's important to be doing things
that you love and you really appreciate.

34
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,080
Because that's your passion, man.

35
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:13,944
You should really work for your passions.

36
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,340
Ok, guys, you have 7 minutes
to set everything up

37
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,346
and then we go.

38
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,815
This is the first time I really
wanted to take something seriously

39
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,000
and do something good for my life.

40
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,780
FREE TO PLAY

41
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:45,010
10 years ago, competitive gaming
wasn't even really a thing.

42
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,039
You would play for fun
against your friends.

43
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,826
Maybe you would play for a cup of coffee or
whatever you wanted.

44
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:55,406
When I started playing,
we'd been fighting for

45
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,681
24 bottles of beer as a first place.

46
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:59,180
I'm not joking.

47
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:02,000
From there, though, online happened.

48
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:05,748
And, all of a sudden, you weren't
just trying to be the best on your block.

49
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,582
Now you're trying to be the best
in the world.

50
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,899
And that opened up competitive
gaming to a whole new landscape.

51
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:15,429
And one of the games really
leading the way is Dota.

52
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:30,622
Dota is sort of a combination of football
(or soccer for the Americans)

53
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:31,657
and Chess.

54
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,000
This is probably how I would try
to explain Dota

55
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,400
to someone who's not familiar with it.

56
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,500
At least, that's what I did to my parents.

57
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,646
Dota is a game of momentum.

58
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,583
You as 5 players

59
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,130
try and battle against the other
5 players for momentum.

60
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,663
Every single player controls one unit.

61
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:57,120
And the main objective of the game is
to destroy the final enemy building

62
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,000
which is called the "Ancient."

63
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,947
Everything else that happens
in the meantime

64
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,954
is your amazing filler of a game.

65
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,460
You could play 100 heroes

66
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,561
in conjunction with 99 other heroes.

67
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:18,075
It's just nonstop possibilities

68
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,900
and it's so much fun.

69
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,062
And you know, it's like the same
map every single time

70
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,941
but it literally never gets boring.

71
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,168
I would say Dota is a way of life.

72
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,040
When the prizes started coming

73
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:38,343
I was like, well we have tournaments

74
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,772
so obviously some people are going
to come and say,

75
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:43,576
"This is a great game. Let's play it.
Like, let's put money in it."

76
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,100
And it started progressing each year.

77
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:48,101
Those at the top level,

78
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:52,100
they just do like lots of
calculations in their head.

79
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,930
Something like "A Beautiful Mind"

80
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,550
where you see like all kinds of things.

81
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:57,964
And using all this information

82
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,008
make your next move.

83
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,012
I see it in a lot of ways
similar to basketball.

84
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,800
Just like a 5 on 5 game

85
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,208
where you kind of have to work together

86
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,140
and utilize each other's strengths and
synergizing everything together.

87
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,057
The teamwork, and the trust,
and the sacrifice

88
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:14,589
those are all true for every
single team sport.

89
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,770
Dota is a game that unites everybody.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,092
It doesn't matter what country
you're from or race you are.

91
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,672
It's kind of like a bond that is shared

92
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:26,489
and when you're part of this
tight-knit group of people.

93
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,345
It's like having a second family.

94
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,698
That's something you never let go.

95
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,995
Everyone's searching for something.

96
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,056
Fulfillment.

97
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,362
Fame.

98
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,772
Satisfaction.

99
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,782
It gives you the ability to
become someone else.

100
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,119
A someone who is powerful.

101
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,399
Who can take down 5 opponents.

102
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,920
Express their creativity.

103
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,477
Break the rules without actually
getting arrested.

104
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:55,811
All of these reasons are
in there somewhere.

105
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,200
The player himself might not even know.

106
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,931
He might not even understand it himself.

107
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,462
But it's there.

108
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,094
Medford, Oregon

109
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,950
Gaming fulfills my competitive need.

110
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:18,763
I'm a very competitive person.

111
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,360
When it comes to sports,
I consider gaming a sport.

112
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,500
So I use my competitiveness

113
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,800
and I fuel it with Dota.

114
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,100
So it fulfills that side of me completely.

115
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:31,009
Fear's one of the best
in America, if not the best.

116
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,521
He has a lot of experience.

117
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,190
He's one of the old hogs, basically.

118
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,090
And he's generally just a calm guy.

119
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,200
So, in my opinion, that's his strength.

120
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:39,504
Really good basketball player.

121
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,595
I remember my coaches watch him playing

122
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:43,437
and just talk about picking him up
the next year when he came in.

123
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,425
Always had nothing but good things to say,

124
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:46,137
but he wasn't picked on the team.

125
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,288
The reason was, yeah, he just
wasn't tall enough, I guess.

126
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,000
So, I know that, yeah, he found the game.

127
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,942
He got really devoted in that and stuff

128
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,980
and just found something else that worked.

129
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,466
I was your typical parent.

130
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:01,563
"Clinton, you're spending too
much time playing computer games."

131
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,017
"You need to go to school."

132
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,565
"You need to go to college."

133
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,750
and he would tell me,

134
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:08,832
"I want to be able to play
games and get paid for it."

135
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,692
Now he said this at a very young age

136
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:14,241
before Dota ever came along.

137
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:16,010
And I thought, well, you know,
he's going to grow out of it.

138
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,900
He's going to get sick and
tired of sitting there

139
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,162
in front of that computer and playing.

140
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,175
Never did. Never did.

141
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:30,116
Singapore

142
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:33,216
In Singapore the families actually
put a lot of stress on us

143
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,587
in terms of our education.

144
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,328
I would say it's been tough on me
trying to juggle

145
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:41,200
both studies and gaming at the same time.

146
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,918
My grades have dropped for
two years already.

147
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,861
And my parents have treated
the gaming as the cause of it.

148
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:51,046
I mean there was this phrase that
they used. They said,

149
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,574
"Gaming will be the death of you one day."

150
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,824
He's a great player and a great captain.

151
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:00,864
I would say he's the top player
in Singapore.

152
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,317
Easily.

153
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:05,342
My parents and my family,

154
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,801
they don't actually speak much
of my gaming career.

155
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,465
They don't tell their friends
and my other relatives

156
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,699
that I'm actually that good at my games.

157
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,727
All along they have only been
bragging about my studies.

158
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,311
Because I used to be an "A" student.

159
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,718
Yeah, they go on and on. And...

160
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:23,830
And it seemed like that was the only thing
they could ever be proud of.

161
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:26,005
Actually, there has only been one person

162
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,143
that has always been very
supportive of me gaming.

163
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:31,736
And that was my ex-girlfriend, Huayan.

164
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,082
She's from the female Dota team
in Singapore.

165
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,097
There are a lot of things
that we share in life.

166
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,067
So many things.

167
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,198
In my case, it felt really good,
you know, to have someone

168
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,140
who truly appreciated what you did best.

169
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,740
And loved you for it.

170
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:47,738
She was aware of what I'm doing
and what I'm passionate about.

171
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:52,490
The breakup was her decision
and I respected it.

172
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,970
We'd been together for close to three years

173
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,540
and ever since the breakup,
I haven't gotten over it.

174
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,334
I recall the last time she spoke to me

175
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:01,918
she named me as a bastard so...

176
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,595
*Laughter*

177
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,552
We're not in contact anymore,
yeah, but...

178
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:09,163
life goes on.

179
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,696
L'viv, Ukraine

180
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,713
I'm from Ukraine.

181
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,960
My nickname is Dendi.

182
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,270
I finished my university, and

183
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,371
I'm just playing computer games right now.

184
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,280
He was doing music.

185
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,250
He played the piano.

186
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
He was doing dancing.

187
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:43,419
At school, he had musical plays in
which he played the main role.

188
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,364
Audiences were always
impressed by his artistic ability.

189
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,435
When their kids' group was showing,

190
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,420
Danil would always stand out.

191
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,785
When we were growing up

192
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:58,632
it wasn't a good time financially
for our family.

193
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:04,425
But my grandma helped us
to get our first computer in 1997.

194
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:08,012
Early, compared with other kids in Ukraine.

195
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,280
We got visitors every day.

196
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:13,939
The friends of my older brother
used to come to visit us

197
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,057
and we were playing games.

198
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:19,793
And Danil, every time looked at what we do.

199
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:21,819
Every time we would try to push him away

200
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:23,626
but he would come back and look again.

201
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:30,742
It was more prominent with him
than with other kids.

202
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,082
During all his conscious life

203
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:35,612
we were trying to stop him from playing.

204
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:39,675
We were hiding our computer cord
everywhere in our apartment

205
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,574
but he always found it.

206
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,818
I always wanted to understand him better.

207
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:48,311
Including that hobby, I wanted
to understand him better.

208
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:50,225
There were certain reasons.

209
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,455
I'm not going to mention them now.

210
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:57,170
I think somewhere deep
inside he's a little bit sad.

211
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,436
She stopped preventing him
from playing Dota.

212
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,495
She gave Dendi the freedom to choose

213
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,794
what is the best for him and his life.

214
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:17,860
Tournaments back then were
really low prizes.

215
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,678
And a lot of prize money didn't
even get to the players.

216
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,934
There's been a lot of scams with
the managers and stuff like that.

217
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:29,792
There were, like, some rumors that
it's going to be $50,000 first place,

218
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,562
and everyone was going, like,
"Nah, it's not going to be like that."

219
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,054
August 10, 2011

220
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,517
Watch the forums go nuts, guys.

221
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:40,515
Watch the forums go nuts.

222
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,222
It is actually confirmed.

223
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:45,122
It is off the fricking hook.

224
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:49,094
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

225
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,099
That is for the winner,

226
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,806
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

227
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:59,600
Dota, the game I've played for 5 years now.

228
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:01,470
Which I played for fun.

229
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,500
For some food money or whatever, you know.

230
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,090
Ok, it's actually getting big.

231
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:09,858
It's the largest prize pool of any
gaming competition to date.

232
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:13,558
It just felt like the start
of something big.

233
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,566
Like a revolution.

234
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:17,333
You know, we had everything we needed

235
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:20,646
for the game to become big and
respected as an E Sport.

236
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,665
It would kind of like vindicate us.

237
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,963
We're not just playing
because we're addicted.

238
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,441
There's a goal, a motive.

239
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:33,722
That we can actually reach out and
grab if we are good enough.

240
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:45,094
Beijing, China

241
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:59,762
Over in Asia, professional gamers
are treated like rock stars.

242
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:03,268
It's a viable career opportunity.

243
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,370
They actually live in gamer houses.

244
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,860
So it's set up to be a thing all year long.

245
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:12,221
I think their approach to practice
is that it's like a day job.

246
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,031
The fan base is immense.

247
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:18,132
It probably is as big as the
whole western audience together.

248
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,160
Or even more than that.

249
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,872
So now you really have to play good.

250
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,492
You really have to try hard.

251
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,799
It's first place. It's go big or go home.

252
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,201
The big teams get big money.

253
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,960
But the 9th to 16th place earn nothing.

254
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,980
And their salaries are not
worth considering.

255
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,299
While in sports, you have a salary
that you can live on.

256
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,570
With pro gaming, I think that's
one of the toughest parts is

257
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:39,790
living game to game.

258
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,260
It's like living paycheck to paycheck.

259
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,860
Like, I have to win.
If I don't win, I don't get paid.

260
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,891
That's a tough living for anybody.

261
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,486
It doesn't matter what you're doing.

262
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,261
When your child wants
to be a professional gamer

263
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,514
you don't have any history to look back on

264
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:55,235
like other sports.

265
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:58,458
I don't know anyone who's
made a living at gaming.

266
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,472
So it's kind of a scary thing

267
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,976
when you see your kid putting
their whole life into gaming

268
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,040
and not college and
not the traditional things.

269
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,039
What if nothing comes of it?

270
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,145
Regarding the age

271
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,146
I think, yes,

272
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:18,894
25, 26 years.
It's absolutely maximum for E Sports

273
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,343
because 27, 28, 29, 30

274
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,838
your reaction time is lowering

275
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,736
and you can't click so much, you know,

276
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,037
as the kids do.

277
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:32,099
A lot of financial responsibilities
are laid upon me right now.

278
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,932
Require me to be successful
in something or have a job.

279
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:41,334
So it's pretty critical that
I am successful

280
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,868
if I want to continue the gaming career.

281
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:48,561
He's an "A-Star" student, you know?

282
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:52,154
Because of this gaming,
it pulled him right down.

283
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,600
It's very sad for me.

284
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:57,870
So here the bad one is Auntie.

285
00:14:57,878 --> 00:14:59,842
Auntie is the one that always
comes here and

286
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:02,515
nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

287
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:05,009
-Am I right?
-It's tough being a gamer.

288
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,229
Sorry?

289
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:09,032
-Am I right?
-I said, it's tough being a gamer.

290
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,338
Huh, hy? Multi-millionaire.

291
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:13,742
*Laughter*

292
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,930
For gaming, huh?

293
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:19,910
Sorry, you are not.

294
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:23,133
Huh? What is your view?
What is your plan?

295
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:26,100
That is more important.

296
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,570
I mean, we speak ourselves.

297
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:30,528
We speak our frank opinion.

298
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,264
This is your choice now.

299
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:35,989
What do you want in life?
That is more important.

300
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,120
If I'm going to win this tournament

301
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,490
my first thought would be...

302
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:43,840
I will call my ex-girlfriend.

303
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,504
Things got real bad between us and...

304
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,830
but right now, for me, if I'm going
to win this tournament,

305
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,830
my first thought would be,
yeah, I would call her.

306
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,301
I would tell her about it and...

307
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,471
I would want to share this moment with her...

308
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:54,800
yeah.

309
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:03,030
This tournament is going to be
a moment in every gamer's life.

310
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:06,030
Everything that you've been
doing has been building up

311
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,908
and is going to happen over one week.

312
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:10,003
And then it's not one week anymore.

313
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,100
It's one game.

314
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,500
And then it's not that one game.

315
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,077
it's that one moment in the game.

316
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,301
And then that one moment in the
game is where it's going to finish.

317
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,455
And how's it going to finish?

318
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,104
Are you going to be holding up a trophy?

319
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:27,103
Or are you going to be the most
disappointed that you've ever been?

320
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:37,620
Cologne, Germany

321
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,590
It's Tuesday.

322
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:39,950
So one day before the event.

323
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,580
We already have a lot of setup.

324
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,410
We have a lot of computer setup right here.

325
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,493
The whole booth construction
pretty much finished.

326
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,403
So five players per side.

327
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,003
They can see each other through the glass.

328
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,500
They can't hear each other.

329
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:53,001
This booth is soundproofed up.

330
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,989
Plus, the whole setup here

331
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,500
if you look from above looks
exactly like a Dota map.

332
00:16:58,505 --> 00:16:59,720
And this is the mid.

333
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,028
This is where it all happens.

334
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,800
A few teams have already
arrived this morning.

335
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:03,970
We had a lot of teams

336
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:04,870
from Singapore.

337
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:04,943
We have China.

338
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,238
We had Malaysia coming in

339
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:07,943
and Russia.

340
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:11,360
And tomorrow it's finally happening.

341
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,560
DAY 1 of 5

342
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,640
TEAMS WITH TWO OR MORE WINS
ADVANCE TO THE WINNERS BRACKET

343
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:21,999
We're here live at Gamescom
2011 in beautiful Cologne.

344
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,193
It's the first day of the event.

345
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,626
We've got some of the world's
best teams here in Dota.

346
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:30,999
And they're handing out a tournament
prize of 1.6 million dollars!

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It is massive here.

348
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,000
A tournament of 1.6 million dollars.

349
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:36,619
That's the future of gaming.

350
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,620
This is awesome!

351
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:48,800
It's the first time we're going to see teams
of this caliber assembled in one location.

352
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,700
These guys are not just nameless faces.

353
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,964
They're the best in the world.

354
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,547
The bunch of teams we have here,

355
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:04,194
there's a few teams that have individual
skill that's unbelievable.

356
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,478
And then there's a big group of other teams

357
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,410
that have good individual skill,
not top-notch,

358
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,980
but who win through good
strategy and team play.

359
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,049
Fear is a great player, for example,

360
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:16,146
but he is not comparable
to good players in Asia.

361
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,976
And that's nothing against Fear,
because he's still an excellent player

362
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,774
but he's not them.

363
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:40,646
Over in Asia, they take gaming
so much more seriously.

364
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,261
Just to give you an example,

365
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:46,245
the Korean soccer team were
playing in the World Cup.

366
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:49,835
To motivate the Korean soccer
team to play better,

367
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:54,782
they brought in Starcraft Brood War
professional gamers

368
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:57,492
into their locker room before they went out

369
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,480
so that they got to meet
what were their heroes.

370
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,428
Shanghai, China

371
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:06,436
In China, Dota is to the people
there what Starcraft is to Korea.

372
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:07,009
It's televised.

373
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,010
The girls like their boyfriends
to be Dota players.

374
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:17,023
After a game, when they're walking around

375
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,652
you can see fans running up to them

376
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,005
asking them to sign on their shirts.

377
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,388
It's like a real sport.

378
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,440
The third time I was in China,

379
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,449
I was playing with fans for two days.

380
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:28,232
They made a video of me,

381
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,714
filming me walking in some mountains

382
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,946
and I had to say some sentences and stuff.

383
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:38,041
And I was like, yeah, "In Dota,
there's always a new mountain to climb."

384
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,300
Stuff like this, you know.

385
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,575
I walked up and down these stairs

386
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,011
and started running and
lifting some weights,

387
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:49,008
just to compare this with Dota
like some metaphor and stuff.

388
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,236
Fuzhou, I am coming!

389
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:54,037
E Sports in China is already a sport

390
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:58,563
that is recognized by the
General Administration of Sport.

391
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,576
It is the same as tennis, ping pong, chess.

392
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,084
The only thing is that it is
not an Olympic sport.

393
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,036
I will say that China teams are all great.

394
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,501
Every player in the team is strong.

395
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,028
You don't recognize China
players as a player.

396
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,343
You just recognize them as a whole team.

397
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,875
You just fear the whole team.

398
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:17,069
The Chinese teams that have
come to this competition

399
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:20,829
are scaring the shit out of everyone else.

400
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,294
We had two of the top
Chinese teams in our group.

401
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:31,358
Online Kingdom has not been
regarded as one of the favorites to win it.

402
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,781
In fact, they were considered bottom four
or just bottom eight for sure.

403
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,876
This is our first time on LAN together.

404
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:40,893
The team together has only been
around for around 4-5 months

405
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,512
so it's a relatively new team,

406
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:45,661
and Pajkatt, our newest addition,
playing Carry for us,

407
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,649
he's only been on the team for
three weeks now actually.

408
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:52,049
We were really nervous going
against a Chinese team

409
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,038
especially the top Chinese teams.

410
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,916
There are going to be players that choke

411
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,011
handling this kind of pressure
at such a young age.

412
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:02,978
1437, this is the first time he's
ever been on LAN.

413
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,417
It's not easy, like, this is a
million dollar tournament.

414
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:06,037
First time he's been on LAN.

415
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:08,145
LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) A TOURNAMENT WHERE ALL
THE TEAMS COMPETE IN THE SAME LOCATION

416
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:10,062
This stage. This prize money.
This prestige.

417
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:11,032
This is real competition.

418
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,066
We tried to keep our cool together

419
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,621
and we just played our game.

420
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:16,927
ONLINE KINGDOM VS VIRUS

421
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,285
ONLINE KINGDOM 1-0

422
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,742
ONLINE KINGDOM VS NIRVANA.CN

423
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,145
ONLINE KINGDOM 2-0

424
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:44,175
We were super hyped.

425
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:46,471
Everyone was surprised
we were doing so good.

426
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,793
Even we couldn't believe it.

427
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,132
Online Kingdom dominating right now.

428
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,703
ONLINE KINGDOM VS TYLOO

429
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:03,000
ONLINE KINGDOM
3-0

430
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:06,943
After the match against TyLoo,
everyone was very excited, you know.

431
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:10,216
We just beat one of the teams that was
actually favored to win the competition.

432
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:12,799
So everyone's spirits were, like,

433
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,625
"Oh, we may be actually
able to do this, you know."

434
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:18,809
Beating the Chinese teams,

435
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,801
some people just, you know
for fun, they started,

436
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:24,807
"Ok, hey, it's OK.Nirvana.Int.
They're the China slayers."

437
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,469
DAY 2 of 5
DOUBLE-ELIMINATION BEGINS

438
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,325
A few little bit surprises that
we had yesterday.

439
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:33,766
Quite a few upsets.

440
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,424
OK.Nirvana.International managing
to beat two Chinese teams in a row,

441
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,378
beating out TyLoo and OK.Nirvana.CN.

442
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:42,006
They're currently on a roll now.

443
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,032
And Chinese teams are not unbeatable.

444
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:45,845
But on the other hand,

445
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:49,862
EHOME are just proving that they are
the strongest of the four Chinese teams

446
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:51,818
having a clean 3-0 record.

447
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,886
They are the favorites to win
the whole tournament.

448
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,871
So they come in with the confidence

449
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,859
that they've won so many
championships already.

450
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,082
It's always a little bit of
national pride at stake.

451
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:02,952
So, of course, they want to prove that
Chinese Dota is still a little bit above the rest.

452
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:09,470
EHOME is one of the oldest
Chinese Dota organizations.

453
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,125
They've always been at the
top of competitive gaming.

454
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:15,113
Most memorably at ESWC 2010.

455
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,124
Before ESWC 2010,

456
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,108
I thought, like, yeah ok,

457
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,084
the Chinese, they're probably pretty good,

458
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:23,026
but like how good can they be?

459
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,985
And then we played EHOME who won that
tournament without losing a single match.

460
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,033
Like, they just crushed every team.

461
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:28,877
1st PLACE

462
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:32,853
EHOME finished the year as
the best team in the history of Dota.

463
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,386
They were just like on a
totally different level.

464
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,427
Like, they had their manager
sitting behind them.

465
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:38,424
He was making their calls.

466
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,680
He was running around with this
little black book.

467
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:43,664
And they were the first team
I heard of who did that.

468
00:23:44,113 --> 00:23:47,367
The EHOME manager copying down
the draft, doing the prep work.

469
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:48,532
He was their coach.

470
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:50,935
There was a great interview that was done.

471
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,035
And it lined up all the top European
captains who attended

472
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,136
and the topic was EHOME.

473
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,170
If you want to ever play good

474
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,269
you don't need to invite Chinese teams

475
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:00,168
because they are too strong.

476
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:02,135
So EHOME won...

477
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,036
What do you think of the Chinese guys?

478
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:08,058
I never felt this outplayed
in my entire life.

479
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:10,244
It's unbelievable how good they are.

480
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,792
Like, their timing, their discipline...

481
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:13,569
They're really in control
of the game, the whole game,

482
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:14,458
and they keep this control all the time.

483
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:16,914
This is really crazy to see, actually.

484
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:20,241
It's because when we are at
any international tournament,

485
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:25,024
when all of the foreign team managers
and team members see us,

486
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,083
everyone will all yell out, "EHOME!"

487
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:30,059
EHOME! EHOME!

488
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:32,293
Do you know how spectacular that is?

489
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:34,556
Actually, this is a story. It's a custom.

490
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,301
Which is when everyone sees EHOME,

491
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:40,778
they naturally think the king is entering.

492
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:46,937
During this trip to The International,

493
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:50,273
it's actually the same period
as my exam periods.

494
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:54,355
So I treated it as a sacrifice
that I've made

495
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:55,598
for the team and for myself.

496
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,200
And I find that

497
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,390
when it comes to pursuing your passions

498
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:01,826
it's really up to you to decide
if it's worth the...

499
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,036
worth the sacrifice.

500
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,859
SINGAPORE

501
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:14,239
When they're having exams,
they don't allow him to leave the school

502
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:18,040
So I told him really I said,
"Mind yourself."

503
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:23,001
Setting out on a career in gaming
is risky. It's very risky.

504
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,672
Because the examinations actually
clash with the competition

505
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:29,390
and missing the exams without
a proper explanation,

506
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:32,923
the school didn't recognize the Dota
competition as a valid reason.

507
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,187
It's kind of breaking school rules.

508
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:38,558
The school is very determined
to stop him from pursuing

509
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,555
his chance of going for this contest.

510
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:47,326
So I think this has created
a big stress for the family.

511
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:51,293
Gives his mother very headache, you know?

512
00:25:57,034 --> 00:26:00,503
It's quite difficult for us
to pull him out right now, I think.

513
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,480
You know he's so adamant about it.

514
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:05,238
So that's why when he told me
he's going in August,

515
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,632
I said, "Then how about your school exams?"

516
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,712
"What are you going to do?"

517
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,049
I think my mother,
she was kind of at her limits,

518
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:17,300
telling me about how much gaming
has been weighing me down.

519
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,637
That was really the talk when I really
opened my heart and I...

520
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:21,807
shared with her my passion for the game

521
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:22,825
and how much I believed that

522
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,674
my team actually has the potential to win,

523
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:26,675
to be the best in the world.

524
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,139
So we are stopping at nothing
less than first.

525
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,312
This is how I tried to put it
across to my mom.

526
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,150
By giving up so much to come here

527
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,407
I have absolute confidence
in my team that we will win.

528
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:37,342
SCYTHE VS EHOME

529
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:39,184
Alright the draft is under way.

530
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:41,193
EHOME, they will select up their heroes.

531
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:42,758
Scythe will start selecting theirs.

532
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,394
Looking now at both the teams,

533
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,142
it looks like EHOME they're fairly relaxed

534
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:47,750
while Scythe, you know they're eager.

535
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,818
They're all gathering around hyhy to pick.

536
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:52,393
If you have a losing draft,
you will lose the game.

537
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:53,843
This is what I think of Dota.

538
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:57,300
So it's really a lot on drafting.

539
00:26:57,404 --> 00:27:01,379
Drafting is where two captains will
select what they want to play with.

540
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,017
What heroes are selected
and what heroes are taken out.

541
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,717
You can select five heroes
out of a pool of over a hundred.

542
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:09,718
And can also remove four of those heroes.

543
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,804
So four heroes you think
your opponent will want to use,

544
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:13,907
you can remove.

545
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,515
Before any game, any match,

546
00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:18,083
we will decide our bans and picks

547
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:20,092
according to which team we are fighting.

548
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:23,445
Usually we would come up with
a very impromptu strategy

549
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:25,059
to try and fight their strat (strategy).

550
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:27,444
You really have to spend a lot
of time thinking of the draft.

551
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:30,466
The draft actually decides
a lot of the game itself.

552
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,823
EHOME. They're a team
with so much experience.

553
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,209
They already know the way
they want to roll this one out.

554
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,115
The only thing that's really going to
make it or break it for them

555
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:40,138
is if they can get their execution right.

556
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:42,507
In that particular match-up

557
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,603
we felt that we needed something
that could instill the fear in them.

558
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:49,581
And Tiny looks to be the last pickup
here from Scythe.

559
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:51,691
A bit of an interesting pickup
there by Scythe.

560
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:54,411
It's going to start to change around
their lanes completely now.

561
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:56,507
With Tiny, it is good as
a surprise strategy.

562
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:00,854
If another team doesn't realize where
he fits into the whole lineup,

563
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,309
then you can really throw
the opposition off balance.

564
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,935
He's moving away, but no, hyhy,

565
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,929
he'll just turn around and
just pops the Lina.

566
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,948
I want to point out right now that EHOME,

567
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,805
they are not noobs (new to the game).

568
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:15,716
This is just Scythe playing
an amazing game.

569
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,249
When you have such a huge audience and

570
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:20,054
you know that everyone is at home
watching the game...

571
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:21,074
they have their hopes pinned on you and

572
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:23,387
I feel that...

573
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:24,749
there's so much at stake.

574
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:27,854
And they should be able to
clean it up right now.

575
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:31,226
Tiny, he's gonna toss, he's gonna launch
and he definitely gets the kill.

576
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:34,640
We got 357 getting nailed out there.

577
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:37,266
Nature's Prophet going to get
the last hit in as well.

578
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,561
It's the entire team down for EHOME.

579
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:40,972
This is GG.

580
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,648
This is now a double-rax, at least.

581
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,693
And EHOME, they're going to disconnect.

582
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,491
We have our first
Winner's Bracket Finalist.

583
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,514
Scythe will advance.

584
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,356
EHOME will drop down into
the Loser's Bracket,

585
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:53,692
and Scythe will now finish up this game.

586
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:55,702
SCYTHE WINS

587
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:59,229
EHOME CALLS "GG" ("GOOD GAME")
CONCEDING THE MATCH

588
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:02,227
Yeah, the one million is...

589
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,385
yeah, one million.

590
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:06,634
That's a lot.

591
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,599
It's going to make my time
playing this game all worth it.

592
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,589
Didn't think smoking would do me any good.

593
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:20,371
When did you start smoking?

594
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:26,423
Two years back.

595
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:27,258
Two years back.

596
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,375
Bad move.

597
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,889
That seems to coincide with when you
and your ex-girlfriend broke up.

598
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,509
On bad terms...

599
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,770
Seems like she's moved on already.

600
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,904
Back then when she was playing the game

601
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:52,741
it felt like we had something we shared.

602
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:54,474
Yeah, but right now, it's like...

603
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,781
I think she's following this event, but...

604
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,536
probably...

605
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:04,538
This event's big.

606
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:15,122
I hope I will get to make that phone call.

607
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:19,916
Finally I'll have something I'm proud of
to tell her about.

608
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:21,068
Finally.

609
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:31,108
DAY 3 of 5

610
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,137
When you played the Russians
and the Ukrainians,

611
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,911
they were just the unpredictable teams.

612
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,487
I had no idea what the Russians
were thinking.

613
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,140
That was their best weapon.

614
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:47,135
Well, we're having fun.

615
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,394
We're trying to relax.

616
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,368
We're trying to scare our opponents.

617
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,128
Mind games. Mind games.

618
00:30:55,663 --> 00:31:00,000
I turn off my brain in the way
of being scared of someone.

619
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:03,710
One of the things I really
admire about him is how

620
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:05,382
he hasn't really had an easy life

621
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:09,190
but he's always so upbeat.

622
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:10,842
He's always so cheerful.

623
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,531
When he first came on the Dota scene,

624
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:14,513
he looked like a 12-year-old boy.

625
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,225
Everyone was just, like, "Who is this kid?"

626
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,297
There's no way you can
take this guy seriously.

627
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:21,274
And then he would destroy you in games!

628
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,138
I saw somewhere on the internet

629
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:28,955
how he works with the keyboard.

630
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:32,479
It really is mesmerizing.

631
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:49,616
I think Danil benefited
from his piano playing

632
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,620
because his hands are absolutely amazing.

633
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,709
He can make really good moves.

634
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:58,030
His moves, I think are unique,

635
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:00,391
and they might win you the game.

636
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,047
But he wants to rely completely on skill.

637
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,967
He wants, like, an enemy against him

638
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,762
and he wants to kill him through skill,
nothing more.

639
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:09,194
He wants to win the game.

640
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,813
His disadvantage is that
he doesn't have patience.

641
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:12,885
He wants to make those moves.

642
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:15,766
He can get a little bit too silly in games.

643
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,240
He will try new and different things.

644
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,410
He will overextend in team fights

645
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,996
because he believes he can get the kill.

646
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:23,921
And his impatience can go too far

647
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:25,507
and he might lose the game for us.

648
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:29,070
INVICTUS GAMING VS NA'VI

649
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,406
Oh, Nature's Prophet, he's going to go in.

650
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:35,794
This should be the First Blood.

651
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,588
They got the Sprout on Sansheng as well.

652
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,840
There's probably going to be a double.

653
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,885
Dendi's ulti, it hits!

654
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,012
Dendi, Dendi, no, no.

655
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:44,724
He's not...he cannot be.

656
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:45,799
This is Dendi through and through.

657
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,595
Starts with the Hex, goes to Cold
Snap, he locks him in place!

658
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,655
Weaver really close to death!

659
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:53,408
Manages to Timelapse back out again.

660
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,299
Dendi will TP (teleport) back to safety.

661
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:59,324
So GG being called by iG.

662
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:01,353
Na'Vi, they will take the game.

663
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,684
NA'VI CLINCHES QUARTERFINALS

664
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,521
Our Winners Bracket Finalists are
going to be Na'Vi versus Scythe.

665
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:16,355
Most teams that you see that have
the most fan bases are full nationality.

666
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,902
Our team is all spread out
across the world.

667
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,468
He does have it a little harder than us

668
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,280
because he doesn't really have
this human support

669
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:29,110
that we do.

670
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:38,294
Medford, Oregon

671
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,400
The hardest thing that I've had
to really deal with in my life

672
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:49,239
is just trying to convince my family
about my gaming career.

673
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:52,324
It's really, really difficult especially
when you start out slow

674
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,786
but you know there's a future for something

675
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:55,880
and you put a lot of time into it,

676
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:57,975
and they keep telling you,
"You should probably get a real job."

677
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:10,139
I was born in the Los Angeles district
in Lancaster, California.

678
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,016
I lived there with my dad and my mom.

679
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,550
Around 2 years old, my dad left my mom.

680
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:18,811
He didn't really say anything.
He just kind of...

681
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:20,140
He just packed up and left.

682
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:26,723
She's had to raise us both while
going to law school at the same time.

683
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:31,218
It wasn't real easy as far as
just got out of law school,

684
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:35,445
didn't have a job, had huge
student loans to pay back.

685
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:39,696
This job came up and so
we moved here on our own.

686
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:42,547
So I've been raising them by myself
ever since.

687
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:50,166
So this is a photo album
that I made for Clinton.

688
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:54,124
As he was growing up, I put pictures
in it as we went along.

689
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,544
My sons were both really active into sports

690
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:58,130
and they wanted to do a lot

691
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,633
so I had to limit them.

692
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:00,730
They could choose two per season.

693
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:05,348
That was maximum for me being
able to get them to practice

694
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:07,057
and go watch their games.

695
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,515
That was tough.

696
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:13,238
And Clinton sitting on Santa's lap
- his brother Santa.

697
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:18,397
My brother's more angry at my father
for leaving than I am.

698
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:19,820
He thinks about him.

699
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:21,222
He gets upset.

700
00:35:21,678 --> 00:35:25,766
Compared to me, I just block him out
and pretend he doesn't exist.

701
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:30,499
Clinton already starting video games here.

702
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,713
He was sitting at his house,
you know, playing Dota.

703
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:37,759
Doing it competitively, had a sponsored
team and everything like that.

704
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,039
But I think that's when it started
getting on his mom's nerves.

705
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,106
I have a crazy sleeping schedule.

706
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,647
I'm on a European team so sometimes I
have to stay up pretty ridiculous hours

707
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,483
or wake up at ridiculous hours.

708
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:55,034
So the standard day for me is
not so standard.

709
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:58,560
All the nights he'd be up and stuff,
the dog would be up too with him

710
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,230
and that would keep her awake
most of the nights

711
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:04,735
and this is kind of where
the tension got pretty high.

712
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:06,914
You know, this went on for years

713
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,501
and it came to the point
where I just told him

714
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:12,880
I said, "You know what, you just
need to go somewhere else."

715
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:18,999
So I got kicked out of my house because
of my gaming career, basically.

716
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,391
When Clinton first moved in here,

717
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:29,480
he was looking for a desk and
there wasn't anything in the room.

718
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:33,568
And I had a lot of stuff we were
getting ready to take to the dump.

719
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:37,607
And Clinton went out there and he
came back in with this green desk.

720
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,554
And he goes, "This is perfect!"

721
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:41,838
So I didn't have a monitor,
so I went to my friend

722
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,674
and he had a spare CRT monitor.

723
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:48,013
So I got that, and then, obviously,
I have two books here to hunch that up

724
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:49,515
so I can actually see the monitor.

725
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:50,562
So it's kind of a ghetto setup.

726
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:56,005
Even when I go to competitions, I don't think
I play any differently on the nice setups

727
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,675
compared to this one.

728
00:36:57,772 --> 00:37:00,775
Clinton's like the Rocky Balboa of Dota.

729
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:03,973
He's definitely one of
the first big US players

730
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,852
and honestly, I didn't even know
he was that big.

731
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:11,916
In the North American scene, there weren't many
good American players known back then.

732
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,088
Everybody respected Fear.

733
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:19,390
A lot of the people I knew,
they quit the game.

734
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:20,892
They moved on, stuff like that.

735
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:24,355
But I stuck with it so I ended up
being like one of the oldest players.

736
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,273
With all his years of experience,

737
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:29,151
and all his constant commitment
to the game,

738
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,280
he's really shown that he doesn't give up.

739
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,330
Growing up without my father,

740
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:38,563
I think in the end, not having someone
there and teach me the guy side

741
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:40,399
and having a father to help you up,

742
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:43,341
I think that it's actually probably made me
the person I am today.

743
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:46,497
You know, I just make sure everything's
running smoothly on the team.

744
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,959
I kind of play, like,
the father figure, I guess.

745
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:52,768
As a captain, I guess he felt
he had that responsibility as well.

746
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:55,091
He was like pretty much my mentor.

747
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,328
He did tell me one time,

748
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,748
"Hey if you need someone to talk to,"
he would be here.

749
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:02,294
So I kind of see him as a Dota brother.

750
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:05,136
I've never had an ego thinking that
I'm better than anyone else.

751
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:08,474
I'm always there willing to help people
who are new to the scene.

752
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,743
And that's always been kind of
my role in the game

753
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:13,830
by just helping players get up
for the most part.

754
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,379
Fear actually broke me
into the scene, you know.

755
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,624
It's very hard to get yourself out there.

756
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,034
I mean, back then, I was kind of
like a fan boy of him.

757
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,473
You know, watching his games and what-not.

758
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:30,409
And he gave me a shot to play
at a high level.

759
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,250
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Fear.

760
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:36,086
I can guarantee you that.

761
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,304
ONLINE KINGDOM VS MUFC

762
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:39,556
ELIMINATION MATCH

763
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:44,644
Going into the match, we were all thinking,

764
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:46,712
MUFC didn't do so well earlier, but...

765
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:50,454
If we lost that game,
we wouldn't win anything so...

766
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,384
it was a high risk game.

767
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:58,183
36 minutes in, almost a 7,000 gold
advantage in favor of MUFC

768
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,657
Toward the end of the game,
we made a couple of mistakes

769
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,873
that put two heroes on the sideline for us.

770
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,929
And they had all five still up and decided that
they were going to go for our Throne (Ancient).

771
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,164
They're probably just going
to push for the base.

772
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,184
They're going GG!

773
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,554
They want to go for the GG!

774
00:39:11,555 --> 00:39:12,564
No Fortification anymore!

775
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:14,947
We were really close to losing our Throne.

776
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,974
It's below 20 percent HP

777
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:21,967
And Online Kingdom, they are so close to
getting eliminated from this tournament!

778
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,553
We just needed to do something.

779
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,867
Alright, I'm going to go on them!
I'm going to initiate on them!

780
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:28,006
So I ran in first and then
they all went on me

781
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:30,373
instead of focusing on the Throne,
which is good.

782
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,139
Again by Silvercross.

783
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:34,434
Fear, he's trying to retreat.

784
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,312
He turns into a pig.

785
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,857
How the hell is he still alive?!!

786
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:41,784
Go, go, go! Go, go!

787
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:44,791
They push MUFC back!

788
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:49,020
We made this huge comeback where
we killed all of their heroes.

789
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:50,333
You know, started pushing.

790
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,169
Silvercross is down!

791
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,769
Morphling! He's out of this!

792
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:55,597
The Top Rax (barracks) will go!

793
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,734
There is no way now that
MUFC can come back!

794
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:03,571
But it will be Online Kingdom
eliminating MUFC!

795
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,877
Our whole team just went crazy.

796
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:10,965
Fear leading Online Kingdom
to do the impossible.

797
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,812
I've never seen anything like that.

798
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:14,856
And stay tuned.

799
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,028
We'll be back here with more
exciting gameplay coming up.

800
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:18,918
"ONLINE KINGDOM CELEBRATE MUFC DEFEAT"

801
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,173
"SECURE 7th PLACE AT INTERNATIONAL"

802
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:28,790
DAY 4 of 5

803
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:33,579
Scythe.

804
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:37,236
They are the 2008 ESWC winners.

805
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:39,369
One of the best Asian teams

806
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,966
but we aren't afraid of them.

807
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:42,024
We're gonna fight them.

808
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,378
I don't know about my teammates,

809
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:47,314
but I don't feel scared at all.

810
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:51,313
I feel like I want to crush my enemy.

811
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,009
That's how I feel.

812
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,412
That's it.

813
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:56,619
NA'VI VS SCYTHE

814
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,105
Welcome to the Winners Bracket Final

815
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,757
where Scythe goes up against Na'Vi.

816
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:01,924
WINNER ADVANCES TO THE GRAND FINALS

817
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,302
The winner gets a slot in the Grand Final.

818
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:07,733
The crowds were all cheering for them.

819
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,153
And their draft was very scary.

820
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:11,197
We were, like, caught off by surprise.

821
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:13,380
But, we were like,
we've gotta win this, man.

822
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:14,924
We've gotta win this and
show them who's boss.

823
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,912
Scythe has managed to take all
the best players from Singapore

824
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:21,206
and put them in their lineup.

825
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,835
One million!

826
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,868
Na'Vi, they look cool calm and collected.

827
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,685
They know exactly what they gotta do.

828
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,688
It all comes down to gameplay right now

829
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:31,502
and I gotta say like, Na'Vi's lineup,
it is not unbeatable.

830
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,338
NA'VI GOES AFTER SCYTHE
AGGRESSIVELY IN EARLY GAME

831
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,630
Now they're gonna look for the initiation
and possible kill.

832
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,758
hy is gonna get caught.

833
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,001
Now bottom lane. Held in place.

834
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:42,456
Sven stunned. Sven will go down.

835
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:45,524
LighTofHeaveN, he helped out but
Ancient Apparition gets the last hit.

836
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,296
Na'Vi are dominating this final.

837
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:52,449
Now Na'Vi, they're gonna
take the chance here.

838
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,588
They're gonna go in for the GG.

839
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:57,247
And GG is the call from hy first.

840
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,500
Na'Vi are already off their computers.

841
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:00,547
They're not even sticking around.

842
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,630
They've got the GG.

843
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:05,636
Na'Vi are into the Grand Finals and
will play for the one million dollars.

844
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:06,753
NA'VI GOES TO THE FINALS

845
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:09,882
Scythe will go down. They will face
the winner of the Loser's Bracket.

846
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:12,677
ONE MORE LOSS AND SCYTHE IS
ELIMINATED FROM THE TOURNAMENT

847
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:15,139
We had just lost our confidence match
against Na'Vi.

848
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,442
It was actually quite a blow to us.

849
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:21,001
The game was really
the turning point for me

850
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:25,789
because I actually learned that in life
you can only trust in yourself, actually...

851
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,132
not in the sense that
you can't trust people

852
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:30,886
but, yeah, like I said, the one who will
never let you down is yourself.

853
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,474
Medford, Oregon

854
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:42,924
Within the gaming world...

855
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,967
You know, it's like I'm following behind
my mother's footsteps basically.

856
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:48,598
She worked really hard to get where she is,

857
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,892
and I kind of want to be the same way.

858
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,770
I want to work hard for whatever I do.

859
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:56,097
For me, I mean I've never really had a dad.

860
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:58,976
So if I had any questions about anything

861
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,479
the person I was most comfortable
talking to was my mom.

862
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:04,644
She definitely had
the most influence on my life.

863
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:08,925
When she comes home from work

864
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:13,543
she's always anxious to bring up
the subject how she won a big case.

865
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:15,565
And I'm always proud of her
when she wins these big cases

866
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:17,382
because I know it means a lot to her.

867
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:21,579
I mean, in the back of my head,
I'm always, like,

868
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:23,102
If I do well and if I win this tournament,

869
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:28,397
I'll finally be able to prove that
I'm getting something out of this.

870
00:43:30,928 --> 00:43:32,211
ONLINE KINGDOM IS FACING ELIMINATION

871
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:35,490
And whoever wins this match will be
facing up against EHOME,

872
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,832
but whoever will lose it, is going
to be eliminated already.

873
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,752
Like, EHOME, they're looking
really strong right now.

874
00:43:40,753 --> 00:43:42,171
We had the stronger late-game heroes,
the better team fight.

875
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:43,715
WINNER CLINCHES 6TH PLACE AND $35,000

876
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:46,744
Just all we had to do was just
control the pushes.

877
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:48,288
Now, Online Kingdom, they're split!

878
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:50,333
The stun on Santa! The splash as well.

879
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:51,376
They're gonna claim a Windrunner.

880
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:52,795
Will they? Yes they do!

881
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,924
It's 2-0 for Online Kingdom.

882
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:58,094
Moscow 5, not the start they wanted.

883
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,056
But Online Kingdom having an amazing start...

884
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:05,070
We were so close to winning until some few
mistakes that occurred in the late game.

885
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:06,397
They might go right now.

886
00:44:06,398 --> 00:44:08,734
There's four heroes standing
right next to each other.

887
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:10,111
The timing is wrong!

888
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,388
There's communication problems
because we're an international team.

889
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:17,393
So I think full-nationality teams have
an advantage over most teams.

890
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:19,563
Almost there! Big try!

891
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:20,842
Fear's in trouble though.

892
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:22,678
He's shackled and Lacoste is in.

893
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:24,474
He casts his ulti as well.

894
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:26,642
And it just fell apart from there.

895
00:44:26,941 --> 00:44:28,567
They just slowly beat us down.

896
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:32,280
Eventually they just broke our base and took
every single one of our raxes (barracks).

897
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:35,375
This is really hurting Online Kingdom.

898
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:36,543
They've lost three.

899
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:37,796
Enigma pops.

900
00:44:37,797 --> 00:44:40,591
The team is wiped for Online Kingdom.

901
00:44:40,592 --> 00:44:46,626
The base will be taken and Moscow 5 will now
play EHOME and advance in the tournament.

902
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:51,296
Now, Online Kingdom, they are out.
So much promise...

903
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:52,493
It didn't happen in the end for Fear
and the rest of Online Kingdom,

904
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:55,520
ONLINE KINGDOM IS ELIMINATED
TAKING HOME $25,000

905
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:58,315
and it will be Moscow 5 that will advance...

906
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:04,719
I think everybody on the team
was very emotional.

907
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,818
I could only imagine how he was feeling.

908
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:15,681
Some people take it more personally
and they give everything to win.

909
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:20,390
It was very satisfying knowing
that we reached that Top 8,

910
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:23,627
but he had better expectations
for our team,

911
00:45:23,628 --> 00:45:25,720
and we'd come a long way
and it's all thanks to Fear.

912
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:31,640
If you don't go as far as you
thought you were going to be,

913
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:35,814
I guess you end up in tears or something.

914
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:44,297
All of us are really disappointed, but...

915
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:46,381
I guess that's just how it goes.

916
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:52,257
When I get back home, I need to
make a big decision in my life.

917
00:45:52,258 --> 00:45:54,594
Like, just the benefits of
playing Dota professionally,

918
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:55,762
how much I can make from it,

919
00:45:56,583 --> 00:46:00,379
and how much time I really need to put
into it to be one hundred percent, so...

920
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:03,750
The only way I would ever do that is if
I move in with my teammates

921
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,595
and have like a training house with them

922
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:07,942
so I know for sure that
we're all dedicated.

923
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,535
I think things happen for a reason,

924
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,913
and when things happen,
you just do your best,

925
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:15,875
and continue going forward with it.

926
00:46:16,602 --> 00:46:21,440
I mean, deep down inside, I know this career
is going to work out for me in the end.

927
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:28,972
As for the Chinese teams I hope and know that
they're capable of coming out of the Losers Bracket.

928
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:35,188
The top three teams are likely to be
Na'Vi, Scythe, and a Chinese team...

929
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:38,067
which I personally hope will be EHOME.

930
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:44,837
Emotionally, I would hope
that EHOME would win.

931
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:45,839
Turning him into a pig!

932
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:46,418
They need to get this kill.

933
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:50,303
The stun! The Weaver Wave!
It's a little piglet!

934
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:52,223
And it's dead! Slardar!

935
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:54,351
820, he's almost dead!

936
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:56,980
Burrow Strike! Epicenter!

937
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,985
357! It's a double-kill by the Weaver!

938
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:04,114
EHOME, they'll lose FCB as well.

939
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:07,132
Moscow 5, casualties of war.

940
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:10,045
Holy Hell.

941
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:13,225
In China, this game is
a professional career.

942
00:47:13,556 --> 00:47:15,183
We are stressed because we have to win.

943
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:19,688
If we don't win or we lose
to foreign teams,

944
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:22,357
Chinese fans will have doubt in us.

945
00:47:23,052 --> 00:47:25,096
Now Lion though is going to find him.
Hexes him up.

946
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:26,598
Finger's already started. There's the stun.

947
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:27,620
Maelk in a lot of trouble.

948
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:27,873
Really caught out of position.

949
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:30,397
AA ulti will fly in but hits on nothing.

950
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:32,024
Mania with the SK ultimate...

951
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,777
The situation is China against the world.

952
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:38,613
If we win the championship,
it is what we are supposed to do.

953
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:42,233
I tell them, if you are coming here,
you are here for the first place.

954
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,947
I will tell them every day, we must
accomplish this. We must achieve this.

955
00:47:48,504 --> 00:47:49,678
Our tradition is

956
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,681
anything other than the champion trophy
we will not bring home.

957
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:54,300
They will go ahead
and trash it at the airport.

958
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:57,272
Now PLT. Support Teleporting in.
FCB gets the first stun.

959
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,509
Misery over-commits on the top lane.

960
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:10,398
GG!

961
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:16,695
I can feel they really want to beat us,
the foreign teams.

962
00:48:17,345 --> 00:48:18,262
PLT, he's had enough of this.

963
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:21,580
FCB! What a time for a Frog!

964
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:23,096
Misery will pop!

965
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:28,858
But when they watch us play, they feel...

966
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:31,265
that there is no way to beat us.

967
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,487
Singapore

968
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,362
This is where my dad works.

969
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:47,747
For as long as I remember,

970
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:51,162
he's doing the logistics
for the company here.

971
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:56,552
So it involves the shipping of the containers
from one place to another.

972
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:02,287
When I was younger, he used to work, like,
15 to 16 hours a day.

973
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,105
He's pretty much given up
on everything else in his life.

974
00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:13,093
He's always made it clear to me that
I should focus on my life, focus on my studies

975
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:15,096
so as to not follow in his footsteps.

976
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:19,379
He doesn't want me to be slogging
as hard as he is right now.

977
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:26,858
But the chance to be the best
in the world at something...

978
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:28,110
you don't get it much in life.

979
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,260
FINAL DAY

980
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:39,937
THREE TEAMS REMAIN

981
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:45,138
I heard my son say

982
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,776
he's working at this, what, Dota.

983
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:53,326
He spends a lot of time and he gets nothing.
For me, it's very disappointing.

984
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,347
Never goes to school.
He wants to play computer.

985
00:49:56,348 --> 00:50:01,395
Then in the morning, sleep. Then computer
until the next day morning. Then he sleeps.

986
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:04,438
The whole day at least 15 hours
at the computer a day.

987
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:09,912
His life, my son's life is like that.

988
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:16,858
For me, I hope for my son to study more.
Not like me. I never studied.

989
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:21,960
When I was young, I was also the same as
Han Yong (hy), always spent a lot of time to play.

990
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:24,302
But now I also regret, why I don't study.

991
00:50:24,303 --> 00:50:26,389
But now I'm hoping my son
continues to study

992
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,540
to get an education better than me.

993
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,004
This is my hope.

994
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:36,579
Having reached the final day
of the tournament,

995
00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:40,042
Benedict has missed two exams and
must repeat his last semester of school.

996
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:43,594
His team is one win away
from the Grand Finals.

997
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:46,511
I want to win this badly.

998
00:50:47,325 --> 00:50:49,577
Are you ready for EHOME?

999
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:54,023
We'll do whatever we can.

1000
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:57,734
For hy, I feel it was a great choice
- a brilliant choice.

1001
00:50:57,903 --> 00:50:59,529
Because he was considering
that we could have won.

1002
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:02,565
It's an opportunity that
you shouldn't miss out.

1003
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:07,379
So, get ready, sign in, log in,
play around, test a little bit,

1004
00:51:07,038 --> 00:51:09,207
and then join the lobby in about 4 minutes.

1005
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:13,277
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

1006
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,444
If you miss it, it might be gone forever.
You might not experience it again.

1007
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:18,030
SCYTHE VS EHOME

1008
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:18,652
SEMIFINALS

1009
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:20,071
And we have a rematch.

1010
00:51:20,198 --> 00:51:21,825
EHOME versus Scythe.

1011
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:23,661
EHOME facing up against the team
that forced them into the lower bracket.

1012
00:51:23,662 --> 00:51:25,664
WINNER ADVANCES TO THE GRAND FINALS

1013
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:30,211
The psychological pressure is immense,
especially upon the drafter.

1014
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:35,387
Because he is the one who is in the end
responsible for the team's picks.

1015
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:41,044
HYHY GAMBLES AND PICKS "SHADOW FIEND,"
HIS BEST PLAYED HERO

1016
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:42,143
No, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,619
No, no. Don't say no!

1018
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:44,159
No, no. Trust me. No.

1019
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:46,812
Wait, wait, wait.

1020
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,150
Tell me this. You really want it?

1021
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,152
I really think...

1022
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:53,631
It's the Antimage and SF (Shadow Fiend).

1023
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,633
That's what I think.

1024
00:51:55,112 --> 00:52:00,451
Shadow Fiend? Alrighty then.
It's hyhy as SF.

1025
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,704
Everyone knows how to
counter a Shadow Fiend.

1026
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:05,833
It's a very bold pickup here by Scythe.

1027
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:10,172
The fact, if Scythe wins the early game,
they're going to gain so much momentum,

1028
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:14,261
but if they don't, then EHOME will basically
roll themselves into the Grand Final.

1029
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:17,743
hyhy, BKB (Black King Bar) is going
to wear off pretty soon,

1030
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:19,287
Venomancer, great strike!

1031
00:52:19,288 --> 00:52:20,289
hy's dead!

1032
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,294
Stay in the trees now!

1033
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:24,384
And he wants xy-, he catches up to him.

1034
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:26,270
And he brings him down.

1035
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:29,082
Hey! I told you to stay in the trees!

1036
00:52:29,743 --> 00:52:31,036
Why'd you come out?

1037
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,908
Stay in the trees! I told you.

1038
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:37,787
What an ulti! He Cogs!

1039
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:41,907
Chawy, he wants to leap,
but there is just no Mana!

1040
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:43,490
I already told you.

1041
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,834
I told you. Do you understand?

1042
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,279
It's ok. Take it easy.

1043
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:56,322
If he can pop off an ulti like that, he doesn't
have to reveal himself to his opponent.

1044
00:52:56,575 --> 00:52:58,244
He can really just initiate.

1045
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:00,509
Oh, there he goes! hyhy doesn't manage
to pop off an ultimate.

1046
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:00,818
Nice!

1047
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:03,833
Nice!

1048
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:07,733
There are already three gone.

1049
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:08,568
Make that four.

1050
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:09,640
It's a double-kill for the Anti-mage.

1051
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:11,099
And they're headed for the tower right now.

1052
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:16,329
There is a GG—Good Game called by hyhy.

1053
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:17,090
Scythe have had enough now.

1054
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,235
EHOME will advance.

1055
00:53:19,236 --> 00:53:21,168
The Chinese hopes will stay alive

1056
00:53:21,169 --> 00:53:25,493
as they will go up against Na'Vi
with a one game disadvantage...

1057
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:30,403
SCYTHE IS NOW ELIMINATED
TAKING HOME $150,000

1058
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,551
The first-placing was very important to me.

1059
00:53:49,866 --> 00:53:54,204
And to add on to that, my studies were also
at the same time affected by everything.

1060
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:55,767
So everything was related.

1061
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,491
When everything comes falling down
at the same time

1062
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:01,717
it's quite hard to handle.

1063
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:04,195
Things are all changed.

1064
00:54:04,972 --> 00:54:06,068
So you gotta plan your life again.

1065
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:07,684
All over again.

1066
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:11,216
I've learned a lot.

1067
00:54:12,004 --> 00:54:13,631
You've gotta realize your flaws.

1068
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,543
That's the toughest part, I feel.

1069
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:18,397
I don't do things as well alone.

1070
00:54:18,524 --> 00:54:20,735
So if you try to do everything by yourself,

1071
00:54:20,736 --> 00:54:22,362
it's not going to be possible, you know.

1072
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:25,394
I'm actually a believer of fate, and

1073
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,898
I told myself that winning isn't necessary

1074
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:29,651
because there are so many
more things in life.

1075
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:31,701
How you take care of the people you love.

1076
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,316
I think that's a very big thing.
That's a very important thing.

1077
00:54:37,729 --> 00:54:40,231
It's the most important thing ever.

1078
00:54:46,337 --> 00:54:47,338
Catch these guys.

1079
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:49,322
It's not fair.

1080
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:50,818
Catch these guys.

1081
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,131
I just woke up. It's not fair.

1082
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:56,885
My haircut...

1083
00:54:56,886 --> 00:54:58,012
still...

1084
00:54:58,013 --> 00:54:58,681
crazy.

1085
00:54:58,682 --> 00:54:59,307
No?

1086
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:01,956
But I don't care.

1087
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,082
Ok, I have everything with me.

1088
00:55:04,993 --> 00:55:06,119
Let's go.

1089
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,650
We are now at the final day

1090
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:13,279
of The International Dota 2 Championships.

1091
00:55:13,028 --> 00:55:14,029
It is Na'Vi.

1092
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:15,408
They have a one game advantage.

1093
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,704
Sitting very, very sweetly
in the Grand Final.

1094
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:22,042
Who will get a shot
at the one million dollars?

1095
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:25,675
Na'Vi was running the same strategy
the whole time

1096
00:55:25,676 --> 00:55:27,803
and no one seemed to be able to counter it.

1097
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:31,461
Na'Vi loves pushing from minute 10

1098
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:32,558
and trying to end the game at minute 15.

1099
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:36,175
Those strategies are very sensitive

1100
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:37,761
because if you fail even once

1101
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:40,307
it can become a very
difficult game for you.

1102
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:43,776
EHOME has been known for how well
they defend their base

1103
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,844
So if there was a team that could stop
Na'Vi's push it would be EHOME.

1104
00:55:47,672 --> 00:55:48,718
And let's get this game underway.

1105
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:50,229
The players will start to
pick up their heroes

1106
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:53,013
with one million dollars at stake.

1107
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:54,560
Na'Vi need to win two.

1108
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:56,954
EHOME need to win three.

1109
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:06,528
Running a very, very old school strategy
with three core heroes.

1110
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,658
EHOME managed to survive
Na'Vi's onslaught early.

1111
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:11,113
It's all on Dendi.

1112
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:12,740
PLT TP's himself in.

1113
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:14,419
Dendi on the retreat back out to the tower.

1114
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,335
Will he get himself away?

1115
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:16,632
X!! Yes, there it is.

1116
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:20,790
Last hit, 357, the Venomancer
brings down Dendi in the middle.

1117
00:56:21,823 --> 00:56:24,614
Every time you see Dendi perform
he's always playing very well

1118
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,507
and he usually doesn't lose his lanes.

1119
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,062
So, Dendi, his impatience is that

1120
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:31,274
Chinese teams, they are patient.

1121
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:35,529
They look out for the fact that
you might cross a line

1122
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:38,557
and they will take you and kill you
and win the game through those situations.

1123
00:56:39,288 --> 00:56:41,537
Trouble in the mid lane again.
There's already the Gush.

1124
00:56:41,538 --> 00:56:44,583
357, PLT, everyone is right
on top of Dendi.

1125
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:45,630
He's in the wrong place.

1126
00:56:46,045 --> 00:56:49,333
And the way Na'Vi played,
they really gambled basically.

1127
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:53,714
Dendi's really been ganked, just shut down.

1128
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:56,343
And not a single kill to his name as well.

1129
00:56:56,924 --> 00:56:59,802
Now Na'Vi going to assault inside the base

1130
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,379
Watch Artstyle. Tier 3 tower. VS Swap!

1131
00:57:02,038 --> 00:57:03,206
Artstyle's in the wrong place!

1132
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,308
Doom there as well!
BKB's both popping off!

1133
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:07,698
Ravage will pop from LighTofHeaveN
unable to affect EHOME.

1134
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,918
Pudge will go down.

1135
00:57:08,919 --> 00:57:09,878
They want to be initiated on.

1136
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:12,638
Na'Vi, they need to fall back.

1137
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,644
They take your little upsets

1138
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:16,571
and just win the game
through those mistakes.

1139
00:57:17,193 --> 00:57:17,998
NA'VI IS FORCED TO CALL "GG"

1140
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:19,876
"GG" from Na'Vi!

1141
00:57:20,044 --> 00:57:25,562
EHOME are celebrating right now
inside the booth.  Na'Vi cannot believe it!

1142
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:31,169
They've dominated this tournament up till now,
and EHOME takes the first match so convincingly.

1143
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:33,837
That was the first loss of Na'Vi
during the whole tournament.

1144
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:36,561
They went undefeated until the Grand Final.

1145
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:39,623
We're going to have a 15-minute break
and be right back here soon.

1146
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,418
Na'Vi, they need to compose themselves.

1147
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:45,409
EHOME, well, they just need to be awesome...

1148
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,774
What a play by them!

1149
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:49,303
Any loss actually makes me pretty sad.

1150
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:02,526
Dendi's Home

1151
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:04,738
L'viv, Ukraine

1152
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:07,992
We tried to put family pictures here.

1153
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,093
This is our mom and dad.

1154
00:58:11,094 --> 00:58:14,555
And I think that this one
is our favorite actually.

1155
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:20,984
My childhood, we lived a poor life

1156
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:25,114
and Dad was working for all our lives.

1157
00:58:26,172 --> 00:58:29,175
But he helped us every time
and every problem.

1158
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,971
I just ask him and he'll do everything

1159
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:35,608
for me, for Katya, for Danil as well.

1160
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:41,165
But Danil and Father were like friends.

1161
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:44,166
Indeed my husband was

1162
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:46,415
simply a fanatical fisherman.

1163
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:53,928
Danil was, I would say, his best student.

1164
00:58:54,415 --> 00:59:00,939
Danil has the same patience
and control as his dad.

1165
00:59:00,094 --> 00:59:04,898
He could sit for hours and watch the bobber

1166
00:59:05,745 --> 00:59:07,622
that wouldn't even twitch.

1167
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,607
They could sit with no speaking for hours.

1168
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:15,402
And just enjoy each other's company.

1169
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:18,405
They understood each other without words.

1170
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:25,035
One day I was going fishing, but

1171
00:59:25,036 --> 00:59:27,664
Dad never showed up.

1172
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:29,753
When I came home it was already super late.

1173
00:59:30,972 --> 00:59:33,558
He was feeling bad.

1174
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:37,646
He went to the hospital. He decided to...

1175
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:43,496
stay for a few weeks, you know,
so we watch everything, stuff like this.

1176
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:45,584
And...

1177
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:46,315
cancer.

1178
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,210
It was a very big shock for me

1179
00:59:52,211 --> 00:59:54,087
because he was very thin.

1180
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,115
I cannot understand that this is my father.

1181
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:00,442
We were all sure that it must be okay.

1182
01:00:00,953 --> 01:00:04,081
But it was a very short time.

1183
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:08,065
I was really sad and was

1184
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:11,203
crying a lot.

1185
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:12,573
I was upset about

1186
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:17,203
I couldn't say to him, many times,
how much I loved him.

1187
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:23,601
After his dad passed away,

1188
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:25,563
he hasn't gone fishing once.

1189
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:26,639
Not even once.

1190
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:32,513
For now this is all in the past.

1191
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,576
Actually I spent more time near
the computer because

1192
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:40,608
I could not think about it.

1193
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:42,894
It's like a distractor.

1194
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:45,175
It was like a start time, actually.

1195
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:47,770
The push to play more.

1196
01:00:48,553 --> 01:00:51,556
And that's maybe one of the reasons
why I'm playing now.

1197
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:53,845
Maybe I wouldn't play at all.

1198
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:59,630
The relationship of Danil and my mom
grew stronger these days.

1199
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,787
They support each other.

1200
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:04,541
and they are very good friends.

1201
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:07,504
I think that this is very important
for Danil.

1202
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:11,745
You know, five years ago,
I wouldn't care about many things.

1203
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:15,637
Now, I'm thinking about it a lot.

1204
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,191
Something knocks you down,

1205
01:01:19,192 --> 01:01:20,860
you need to learn to get up.

1206
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:24,821
So I'm trying to research this.

1207
01:01:27,847 --> 01:01:29,306
To learn to get up.

1208
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:34,560
This is the most important moment
in my life

1209
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:37,606
because everything I worked on
wasn't useful.

1210
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:42,782
And now I have a chance to win
this tournament for my family.

1211
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:48,597
So we have currently EHOME and Na'Vi
playing the Grand Finals.

1212
01:01:49,362 --> 01:01:51,823
Na'Vi just lost one game versus EHOME

1213
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,769
and it's 1-1.

1214
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:56,859
So both teams have to win two matches
in order to win the one million dollars.

1215
01:01:59,109 --> 01:02:02,237
Because our picks looked completely different,
we were like passive and stuff.

1216
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:04,036
People thought we lost the first game,

1217
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:05,246
we're going to lose the second game.

1218
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,784
We were maybe a little bit demoralized.

1219
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:10,954
We really needed to change
to a different pick.

1220
01:02:10,955 --> 01:02:12,332
We were missing something.

1221
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,100
We picked Enigma just

1222
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:15,959
to have a strong teamfight

1223
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:16,924
a five versus five combat.

1224
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:21,720
It was, like, the last hero left

1225
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:23,515
and I never played it before.

1226
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,458
Then, we're, like, "Dendi, you go!"

1227
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:29,053
And he's, like,
"Guys, I've never played it!"

1228
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:30,431
"But, I can do it!"

1229
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:32,635
So we took the risk of taking him

1230
01:02:32,636 --> 01:02:35,097
and risking maybe playing him badly.

1231
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:38,972
So it looks like down on that bottom lane,
Dendi will be taking the Enigma.

1232
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:41,517
It is going to be a very, very rough lane...

1233
01:02:41,695 --> 01:02:42,723
Na'Vi lost the game.

1234
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,788
And they're playing something now
that they're not as confident with.

1235
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:48,036
EHOME figured out Na'Vi.
Figured out how to play against it.

1236
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:51,008
And I'm going to stick to my word
and I'm going to say EHOME will win it.

1237
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:53,590
It was incredibly ballsy from Dendi
to do that

1238
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:56,928
on the verge of winning the million dollars
for your team.

1239
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:06,015
That's very, very stupid. That's suicidal.

1240
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,124
Dendi really now caught out.

1241
01:03:08,863 --> 01:03:09,781
He's in trouble.

1242
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:10,854
Rockets to fly in.

1243
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:13,733
FCB long way in on the tower,
lands the stun.

1244
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:15,486
Tinker just lasers him to death.

1245
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:17,250
It will cost FCB his life.

1246
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:19,487
Then we made some little mistakes.

1247
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:22,643
We played a really semi type of, like,
"turtle" strategy.

1248
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:24,095
Really passive. Really passive.

1249
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,167
We don't play like that.

1250
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,207
Puppey and Dendi just want
to retreat back out.

1251
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,062
820! What a Fissure!

1252
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:30,272
PLT is there!

1253
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:31,691
Echo Slam as well!

1254
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:33,848
Beautiful play there by EHOME.

1255
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:36,055
But I know if I die,

1256
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:37,641
I die not for nothing.

1257
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:38,946
X!! in the middle lane...

1258
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,866
Force, Rocket, Laser.

1259
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:41,993
It's enough!

1260
01:03:41,994 --> 01:03:44,038
Dendi goes down in the middle lane.

1261
01:03:45,664 --> 01:03:48,000
Sometimes it can be like, you dying

1262
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:50,170
but your teammates picking up more.

1263
01:03:50,046 --> 01:03:51,117
EHOME, they still want
to push out that mid...

1264
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:54,715
They weren't ready for Dendi Enigma.

1265
01:03:54,716 --> 01:03:56,643
It was a patient Enigma.

1266
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:58,335
That was the most patient
Enigma in the world.

1267
01:03:58,336 --> 01:03:59,102
Puppey is here.

1268
01:03:59,103 --> 01:03:59,196
Dendi as well.

1269
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,869
Going to look for the Hole.

1270
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,089
BLACK HOLE!!!!

1271
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,249
Three are going to go down for EHOME

1272
01:04:07,025 --> 01:04:09,992
Currently, Na'Vi, they have
the advantage now.

1273
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:13,350
That really impresses me
how he's able to make that transition.

1274
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:15,292
You just have to have the balls, basically.

1275
01:04:15,524 --> 01:04:16,775
He was scared of losing.

1276
01:04:16,776 --> 01:04:19,112
That's why he was so patient
and he did everything right.

1277
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:23,169
Their strategy is kind of similar
to how EHOME won.

1278
01:04:24,022 --> 01:04:26,066
Na'Vi defeated them "Late Game."

1279
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:28,159
And I think this really shattered
EHOME's confidence.

1280
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:32,170
And "GG" is the call from EHOME.

1281
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:34,340
Na'Vi, they take the game.

1282
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:38,679
And they are only one win short
of taking home one million dollars.

1283
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:43,526
We hardly won the second game.

1284
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:45,187
Chinese teams generally are feared
for their "Late Game" potential.

1285
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:48,592
So we hit the point now.

1286
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,032
The gloves come off.

1287
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:55,046
EHOME, they will master their knowledge,
their experience, their calls

1288
01:04:55,164 --> 01:04:56,623
up against Na'Vi.

1289
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:58,805
And Puck will be the last hero for Na'Vi.

1290
01:04:58,806 --> 01:05:00,725
The nimble hero there already.

1291
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:02,729
Once again a lot of aggressive heroes
for themselves.

1292
01:05:03,027 --> 01:05:05,689
Na'Vi LighTofHeaveN playing
as the Beastmaster again

1293
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,904
with Dendi playing as the Puck this time.

1294
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:09,772
If Na'Vi wins this,

1295
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:12,062
they win the whole tournament.

1296
01:05:12,426 --> 01:05:14,845
This Clash of the Titans right here

1297
01:05:14,846 --> 01:05:15,917
is something we will not want to miss.

1298
01:05:16,823 --> 01:05:17,869
X!! will come in closer.

1299
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:19,493
They will be able to get that kill.

1300
01:05:19,713 --> 01:05:20,734
Doom now on Dendi.

1301
01:05:20,924 --> 01:05:25,315
Pulled in by X!!
The entire EHOME team turns on him.

1302
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,200
Lich will go down.

1303
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:28,327
FCB is on the run.

1304
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:29,996
XBOCT after the chase of him.

1305
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:31,373
Might be enough. Needs some more damage.

1306
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:33,441
Storm! X!! Long jump in.

1307
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:35,463
Dendi Orbing up to the high ground.

1308
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,549
FCB! Puts on the Rift.

1309
01:05:37,055 --> 01:05:38,724
Will he be able to get the kill?
He's on the retreat.

1310
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,648
Yes, it is.
Dendi with the last right click.

1311
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:43,407
EHOME now, they're gonna
rotate themselves down.

1312
01:05:43,408 --> 01:05:44,993
Na'Vi already in the pit.

1313
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:47,663
They're trying to bring down Roshan
- all 5.

1314
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:48,735
Dendi! He's gonna jump out!

1315
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,127
He goes for the Dream Coil! He gets them!

1316
01:05:51,128 --> 01:05:53,881
He gets EHOME!
Holds them in the middle lane.

1317
01:05:53,882 --> 01:05:56,134
Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.

1318
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:58,220
They're coming in to help out Dendi.

1319
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:01,183
Then we just went in and demolished them.

1320
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:05,360
Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.

1321
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,873
They're going to bring it down.
Yes, it does go down.

1322
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:11,580
EHOME, they're trying desperately to defend

1323
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:14,054
but Na'Vi, the onslaught will continue.

1324
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:15,892
The mid tower's already being pushed.

1325
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,830
The Tier 4 tower is going to go down.

1326
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:20,419
And running in right now
is the rest of Na'Vi.

1327
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,408
They are running forward
to one million dollars.

1328
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:23,984
And they will get it!

1329
01:06:23,985 --> 01:06:26,530
The "GG" is the call from EHOME.

1330
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:31,012
Na'Vi have just won one million dollars.

1331
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:36,078
EHOME do take home $250,000
in second place.

1332
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,791
But Na'Vi are the champions!

1333
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:42,805
There's moments of E Sports
that are landmark,

1334
01:06:42,806 --> 01:06:45,134
and this is one of them. In Cologne.

1335
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:47,179
And Na'Vi, the winners.

1336
01:06:47,018 --> 01:06:49,353
You guys have just made history.

1337
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:01,234
I was jumping on the sofa.

1338
01:07:01,235 --> 01:07:04,697
And screaming like a crazy girl

1339
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,230
because I was the happiest
girl in the world.

1340
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,483
And my brother just won
one million dollars!

1341
01:07:20,368 --> 01:07:21,745
I think in 10 years time

1342
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,673
all the gamers which we currently have
showing themselves,

1343
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:26,837
they're going to be the guys
we will look back at and say

1344
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:27,815
this was the beginning.

1345
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:28,837
This is where it all started.

1346
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:31,173
These are the guys that worked hard

1347
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:32,817
and they took the risk.

1348
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:34,713
They proved themselves.

1349
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:38,144
And they forwarded the entire industry
to the point where

1350
01:07:38,145 --> 01:07:39,229
we could have a kick-start.

1351
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:40,817
We could show the world what we do.

1352
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,614
And then who knows how big
we could get at that point.

1353
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:48,925
We've come far already.

1354
01:07:49,396 --> 01:07:50,834
When more and more people support it

1355
01:07:50,835 --> 01:07:52,333
and it becomes more and more normal,

1356
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:56,642
it's going to go from a niche
to becoming accepted in societies.

1357
01:07:57,354 --> 01:08:00,941
I think in 15 years,
E Sports will be bigger than football.

1358
01:08:01,265 --> 01:08:02,600
Than basketball. Than everything.

1359
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:06,184
That kid who you thought played
too many video games

1360
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:08,646
is potentially going to be on a path

1361
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:13,136
where he's earning $250,000 a year, salary.

1362
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:14,555
He's flying the world.

1363
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:16,350
He's going to be endorsed.

1364
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:19,591
Gaming's the biggest entertainment
industry in the world.

1365
01:08:19,843 --> 01:08:20,914
So if you're a star,

1366
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:24,892
you are potentially one of
the biggest stars in the world.

1367
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:29,766
So, if that, like everything else with computers
grows exponentially or whatever

1368
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:32,478
then 5 or 10 years could be
a big step actually.

1369
01:08:33,118 --> 01:08:34,953
Changing mindsets is never easy.

1370
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:36,294
So it's going to take awhile.

1371
01:08:36,934 --> 01:08:39,812
When the gamers now become parents,

1372
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,590
we will be supportive of our kids playing,

1373
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:45,322
and I think that's really when
everything will boom.

1374
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:56,137
"The only thing achieved in life
without effort is failure"

1375
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:01,129
After weeks of training,

1376
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:04,600
a local man has led his
online gaming team to the top,

1377
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:08,222
placing seventh in an international
gaming competition held in Germany.

1378
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:10,502
Yeah, she's definitely proud of me.

1379
01:09:10,503 --> 01:09:12,096
I mean just, she had her camera out...

1380
01:09:12,097 --> 01:09:15,642
like, "Why are taking a photo
of the television?"

1381
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:19,467
I know she's really smart.
She's a lawyer so...

1382
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:22,603
But in the end, I think
she'll be more understanding

1383
01:09:22,681 --> 01:09:24,433
and be willing to support me more

1384
01:09:24,434 --> 01:09:26,019
so it worked out.

1385
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:30,970
Fear now lives in San Francisco, CA
and captains US-based team, Evil Geniuses.He no longer trains alone.

1386
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:36,060
And after the tournament,
he bought a new desk.

1387
01:09:36,408 --> 01:09:37,753
We were disappointed with our loss.

1388
01:09:38,171 --> 01:09:40,078
And, yeah, it's a mixture of both,

1389
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:41,497
we're happy and sad that we got third.

1390
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:43,165
Because of all the emotions

1391
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:45,352
I felt like she was the one
I wanted to share them with.

1392
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:47,761
And it got pretty clear only then
that I had to get her back.

1393
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:50,651
After the tournament I actually
went back to look for her,

1394
01:09:51,094 --> 01:09:52,345
and talk things out,

1395
01:09:52,346 --> 01:09:54,438
and we have actually begun dating again.

1396
01:09:55,672 --> 01:09:57,633
And things are actually going great.

1397
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:01,210
I love her, you know.

1398
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:06,919
She played a huge role, a very huge part

1399
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:09,044
in...

1400
01:10:09,045 --> 01:10:10,254
in the me today.

1401
01:10:11,557 --> 01:10:16,521
hyhy is pursuing his Masters in Business.
He pays for his university expenses through tournament winnings.

1402
01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:20,380
One week ago it was 3,000 followers .

1403
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:21,632
I was happy.

1404
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:24,232
Then it's boomed. 8,000 followers.

1405
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:25,981
It's not about the number.

1406
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:29,203
Even if it's one or two, I'm fine.

1407
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,940
So you don't need to show numbers actually.

1408
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,207
I think.

1409
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:37,143
My father, I think,

1410
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:41,503
didn't have time to understand
what Dendi's doing.

1411
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:46,369
"Dendi the Dota 2 Millionaire"

1412
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:48,311
We lost him too early.

1413
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:51,527
And if now he could see Dendi,

1414
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:55,070
I'm sure that he's proud of his son.

1415
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:11,000
Dendi has become one of the most recognized
professional gamers today.

1416
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,657
He has more followers on Twitter
than the Ukrainian national soccer team.
