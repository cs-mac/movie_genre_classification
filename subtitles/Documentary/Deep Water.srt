1
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:20,606
We are all human beings,
and we have dreams.

2
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:29,526
This voyage is Don's.

3
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:35,925
For him, it was the adventure.

4
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:41,695
There may have been an element
he wanted fame and glory.

5
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,054
He wasn't averse to taking risks.

6
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,340
But, when you're alone...

7
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:51,549
just you...

8
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,175
and the ocean...

9
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,504
it's the whole of your universe.

10
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,424
It's totally indifferent.

11
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,500
It's there waiting for you.

12
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,771
If you make a slip...

13
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:08,412
then imagination is the danger.

14
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,892
It's no longer about heroes...

15
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,960
and adventures at sea.

16
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,764
It's about isolation...

17
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,788
and the delicate mechanism

18
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:28,441
of the mind.

19
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:15,772
It was the Beatles.
It was sexual freedom...

20
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:18,973
freedom of the seas.

21
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,795
It caught the imagination.

22
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,997
Francis Chichester aboard Gipsy Moth IV

23
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:25,439
is now in sight of home.

24
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,262
He's merely 15 miles from Plymouth,

25
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,275
at the end of his epic
round-the-world voyage.

26
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,485
Thousands of people have been
pouring into the city.

27
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,310
They're waiting for their
first glimpse of a man

28
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:36,441
who set out nine months
and 33,000 miles ago.

29
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,094
Hynds:
There were signs, there was noise.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,075
It was mayhem.
You stood and watched

31
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,253
and let it wash over you.

32
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,090
Chichester had done a single-handed
circumnavigation

33
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,269
and brought his vessel back home.

34
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,669
Stirring stuff, boys-only stuff.

35
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,796
Chichester had started the ball rolling.

36
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:24,251
People were looking for
"What was the new challenge?

37
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,326
What's the next frontier?"

38
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Chichester stopped halfway.

39
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:36,156
He pulled into Australia
and did quite-serious refits.

40
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:39,741
I thought, "That's it.
One thing left to be done...

41
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:42,939
go around the world,
single-handed, but nonstop."

42
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,319
The general public
got into the spirit of it,

43
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,558
and newspapers as well.

44
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,115
And of course "The Sunday Times"
came up with the idea

45
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:57,013
of a nonstop race around the world.

46
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,821
There could be no greater challenge.

47
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:10,138
The first part, down to
the South Atlantic, was fairly kind,

48
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,123
but then your troubles started.

49
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,204
Once you rounded the Cape of Good Hope,

50
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,283
you were into the Roaring 40s,

51
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,207
that endless band of storms

52
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:20,186
that circled the world.

53
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,300
Then, thousands of miles later,

54
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,223
you pass south of Australia,

55
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,486
New Zealand, and across
the rest of the Pacific,

56
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,823
to Cape Horn.

57
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,061
The seas became narrow there,

58
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,983
and as they fall together,

59
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,839
they grew wilder.

60
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,174
Then up past the Falkland Islands,

61
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,619
cross the equator,
back into the North Atlantic,

62
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,694
and you were on your way home.

63
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,549
In the spring of 1968,

64
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,692
some of the world's most
experienced sailors

65
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,998
began to gather
in the ports of Britain.

66
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:06,556
They were stepping forward
as contenders

67
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:10,971
in the greatest
endurance test of all time.

68
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:14,077
This wasn't a race in
the normal sense of the word.

69
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:16,123
You could leave whenever you liked,

70
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,910
but you had to leave
before October the 31st,

71
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:22,492
to avoid the really severe
winter weather

72
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:24,698
at Cape Horn.

73
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,011
The first man to do it
would get the Golden Globe.

74
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,350
The boat that went round fastest

75
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:35,481
would get the big prize of £5,000.

76
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,253
This was something
that a human hadn't yet

77
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,429
attempted to do.

78
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:45,565
First of all, we didn't know if
a boat could take it.

79
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,701
Secondly, there was considerable doubt
if a human could take it.

80
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,901
Psychiatrists said
that a human would go mad

81
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,500
if they tried to do it.

82
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,734
We're talking about
10 months of loneliness.

83
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,909
But the more people
told me it wasn't possible

84
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,818
and I couldn't do it, the more I was
convinced I could do it.

85
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,340
The one I thought would
prove real competition

86
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,069
was Bernard Moitessier.

87
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,918
He was highly experienced.

88
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:37,278
The French adventurer,
Bernard Moitessier,

89
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,542
and the British Merchant Marine Captain,
Robin Knox-Johnston,

90
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:43,677
were among nine men
announced in the final line-up.

91
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:47,935
Each knew the winners would
earn their place in history.

92
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:51,743
They were proper seamen,
experienced sailors,

93
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,397
and then...

94
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:58,078
there was the mystery man:
Don Crowhurst.

95
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,830
What sort of attitude of mind

96
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,317
does a single-handed
sailor have to have?

97
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:09,207
I think one's psychology
has to be fairly stable...

98
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,340
and one has to be constantly aware

99
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,614
of the risks one is running,

100
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,398
which...

101
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:22,142
Nee... need not necessarily
be much greater.

102
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:33,597
I just thought, "lt's too enormous
to take on something"...

103
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,285
I thought... I didn't
give it some serious thought.

104
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,259
But there is a moment

105
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,372
when an opportunity arises,

106
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,710
and if you don't grasp it,

107
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,630
that's it.

108
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,623
The first time I saw him,

109
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,829
we were at a party at my flat.

110
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:55,199
I thought what a wonderfully warm,

111
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,235
vigorous and lively person he was.

112
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,860
I had a red dress on,
and he immediately said,

113
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,166
"Who's husband did you arrive with?"

114
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:05,535
He started telling my fortune,

115
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,383
and he said, "You're going
to marry an impossible man,

116
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,199
but you're going to be greatly loved."

117
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:13,437
That was a ploy, I'm sure.

118
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:17,118
He may have used it
with several others.

119
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,223
But it worked.

120
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:25,439
Don started his own
small electronics firm

121
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,806
making navigational aides.

122
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,674
They were very very slow-selling,
but we were able to eat from it.

123
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,748
It didn't bother us very much
that we couldn't have

124
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,671
a very exotic life.

125
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,506
But really,
we were skint, as it were.

126
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:43,547
Things were difficult
and the business was struggling.

127
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:46,172
My father was at
a stage of his life where

128
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,893
he needed to take on
a challenge that would show

129
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,452
the skills that he had
and the abilities that he had,

130
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,148
which he had somehow felt frustrated,

131
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,190
unable to show in his business.

132
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,342
My father had grown up
with the Kipling stories of adventure

133
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:04,407
and of heroes overcoming challenges.

134
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,877
Chichester had achieved
something on a heroic scale

135
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,853
and was recognized for it.

136
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:17,019
He had performed a tremendous feat

137
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:19,989
that everybody could see and admire.

138
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:24,890
In a sense, my father wanted
to take on that role

139
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,162
and take on that persona.

140
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:31,165
This was the greatest
challenge possible.

141
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:34,204
It grabbed my father,

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,856
made him, almost compelled
him to take part.

143
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,411
He asked me how I felt about it,

144
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,334
and I said, "Well, if you
can raise the money,

145
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,122
I think you deserve it."

146
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,381
I didn't think he would
raise the money,

147
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:52,025
but all of a sudden the thing took on
its own momentum.

148
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,621
Many of the competitors
didn't have that long

149
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,220
to get a boat ready.

150
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:02,650
But Crowhurst was
starting from scratch.

151
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,372
Don chose a trimaran.

152
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:08,157
He started off purely concentrating

153
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,357
on the idea that a multi-hull was fast

154
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,850
and that he could win.

155
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:17,085
The idea was he could win.

156
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:19,610
His head was full of ideas,

157
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:23,579
advanced technology,
what he could do "if."

158
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:27,099
This was part of his
great visionary dream, really.

159
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:31,100
It was going to be an
innovative and advanced vessel,

160
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:33,503
equipped with all
the latest electronic devices

161
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,774
that would make it better,
would make it safer

162
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,879
and would enable him to sail faster.

163
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,850
That was the idea. And then Don went off

164
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:44,061
to find some money.

165
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:47,742
Donald had tried a number of careers,

166
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,852
but they had come to nothing,

167
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,898
and he wanted more.

168
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,492
He believed in himself.

169
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:58,361
He was inventive,
he had real brains,

170
00:11:58,457 --> 00:12:00,286
he had a great deal of charm.

171
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,565
...sort of blown up...

172
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,703
It's all right.
No, I don't mind.

173
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:09,149
He'd read avidly of these
long-distance exploits,

174
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:11,194
and he could talk the talk.

175
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,234
The nearest you get to
a tranatlantic route is the southern...

176
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,924
All he needed was someone
to put up the money,

177
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,339
and he carried along
an entrepreneur, caravan-dealer...

178
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:23,581
Stanley Best.

179
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,781
It really was an exciting adventure,

180
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:30,941
and I'm not an adventurous person,
so far as I'm concerned.

181
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:34,935
But it was interesting,
compelling, to join in.

182
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,762
The... the paddles of
sponsorship are enormous.

183
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:43,933
Stanley Best knew
nothing about sailing,

184
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,101
but as a hard-headed businessman

185
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:49,142
he wanted a contract.

186
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:55,550
Stanley Best made my father
sign an agreement.

187
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,354
If he dropped out before the race began

188
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,597
or dropped out early on in the race,

189
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:05,078
he would be forced
to buy the boat back.

190
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:09,659
In effect, my father would be bankrupt.

191
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:16,214
The house we lived in
would have to be sold.

192
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,955
He was gambling everything.

193
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,846
He had staked everything

194
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,766
on being successful in the race.

195
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,903
Everything depended on it.

196
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,775
As the construction of Crowhurst's

197
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,501
revolutionary boat began,

198
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:36,572
his rivals, one by one,
were setting sail.

199
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:38,846
With the prize for the fastest voyage

200
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,793
as well as the first man home,

201
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,257
the men were free to leave at any time,

202
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:45,819
so long as they sailed
by the race deadline...

203
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:48,221
October the 31st.

204
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:56,089
I think there were
some similarities between us

205
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,651
and astronauts.

206
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,658
People were just beginning
to go round the moon

207
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,901
at that time, in fact the first trip
around the moon.

208
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:06,459
There was a lot of interest
in what happened to people

209
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,596
when they're suddenly
shoved up clear of the earth.

210
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:11,162
And I suppose they looked
upon us the same way.

211
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,470
You know, we're basically
in a small capsule,

212
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,475
we're setting off to go round the world.
It's extremely dangerous.

213
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,906
Anyone who goes to sea

214
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,019
and says they don't
feel fear is a liar.

215
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,962
Of course you're frightened.

216
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,006
When I left Plymouth,

217
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:48,565
Françoise was onboard
the launch following me.

218
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,837
She was not very happy with that.

219
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,034
It's always a case of having
to sacrifice one thing for another.

220
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:58,683
You have to choose between
your life and a woman,

221
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,893
and it's got to be
your own life, hasn't it?

222
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,426
Without hesitation.

223
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,348
Around the world without stopping,

224
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:19,290
single-handed...
it's an enormous challenge.

225
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,142
It's incredibly demanding.

226
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,508
No one had done it before.

227
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,358
Anyone who tries it

228
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,662
just for the money or the prestige

229
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:32,247
is going to break his neck.

230
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,516
There was this extraordinary
pretty ribbon

231
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,862
that I had to pull.

232
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,310
And it would swing
the bottle into the hull.

233
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:05,338
It had to be smashed by hand.

234
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:10,110
And of course, that's got all sorts
of connotations in sailing circles.

235
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:13,563
But Donald wanted this thing.

236
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:16,765
He wanted to have a go.

237
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:20,412
I thought, "Well, if
anybody has a chance,

238
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:24,281
he has a chance
because he is so innovative

239
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,489
he'll do it."

240
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,193
This was a classic tale
of English derring-do

241
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,730
on a shoestring,

242
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,654
the homegrown British hero.

243
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,204
There will be TV deals,
there will be newspaper deals.

244
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,372
I mean, it's... sort of that
feeding frenzy start.

245
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,092
Rodney, my boss,
was a businessman

246
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:56,091
as well as a journalist.
He was a Dickensian character...

247
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,502
the Artful Dodger,

248
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,099
perhaps even a Fagin.

249
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,723
He immediately saw the potential

250
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,516
to make a lot of money.

251
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:06,555
A press agent's job
is to get hold of the package

252
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,886
which could be as dull
as an old tin box.

253
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,314
Many people who do
great things are often,

254
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,134
as personalities, rather dull.

255
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,691
So you got to dress it up...
a bit Christmassy...

256
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,420
so that it appears attractive.

257
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,979
Donald decided originally

258
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,285
to start down beyond Penzance.

259
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,641
But here in Teignmouth,
we have a fairly active publicity setup,

260
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:31,098
and we've persuaded him to
come 150 miles backwards

261
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,204
to start here and enjoy
the delights of Teignmouth.

262
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,658
All the hoteliers immediately
saw the potential,

263
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:40,028
publicitywise.

264
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,676
Crowhurst's journey to Teignmouth

265
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,299
was the first outing
for his revolutionary boat.

266
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,597
It should have taken
three days to get there.

267
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,030
It took two weeks.

268
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,572
It was pretty embarrassing.

269
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:05,083
We'd been promoting Crowhurst
as "the dark horse of the sea."

270
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,122
We initially thought
that this was a man

271
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:11,162
who had made transatlantic voyages.

272
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,397
He wasn't.
He'd messed about in boats,

273
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,950
but he was almost a weekend sailor.

274
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:22,648
But everyone loved the idea
of this boy's own hero.

275
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,197
We wanted him to succeed.

276
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,629
The public,
the town of Teignmouth,

277
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,933
and Fleet Street

278
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,525
wanted this to work.

279
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:43,225
But Crowhurst was now
dangerously behind schedule.

280
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,755
All but one of the other sailors
were underway.

281
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:49,501
He'd lost any chance of winning
the trophy for first man home.

282
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:52,155
And to win the £5,000 cash prize,

283
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,078
he'd have to sail the world faster

284
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,090
than any of the racers ahead of him,

285
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,803
through a southern ocean
that was already claiming casualties.

286
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,514
Chay Blyth and John Ridgway

287
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,757
had been knocked out of the race.

288
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,802
Big seas had seen them off.

289
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,492
It was the first inkling

290
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:13,310
that this was not just an adventure,

291
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:16,605
but a very dangerous undertaking.

292
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:19,130
Don was showing a lot of courage.

293
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,885
He was well aware of the risks.

294
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:25,878
But he felt he was capable of...
of getting through it.

295
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:35,546
Here now was a publicity
machine at full blast.

296
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:39,325
I was there as a journalist.

297
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,019
I was producing a film.

298
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,676
I could see that
the schedule was tight,

299
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,690
and when I got to Teignmouth,

300
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,121
it was chaos...
total chaos.

301
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,690
It took far longer for you

302
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,582
to come around from the east coast

303
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,022
than you had originally planned.

304
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,611
What sort of pressures has
this put on you as a result?

305
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,909
Well, it's a week less.

306
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,278
It means less time,
you know.

307
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,646
The schedule is that much tighter.

308
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,012
Telephone!

309
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,078
Telephone!

310
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:16,187
I thought, "There's chaos here,
you know, and that's worrying."

311
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,787
Can you bring the dinghy
around this side?

312
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,118
The BBC people were watching it.

313
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:25,884
You could see that they saw that
this wasn't how it should be.

314
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,105
I told the cameraman,

315
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,900
"This is a voyage
that's not gonna happen.

316
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,499
It's not gonna succeed.

317
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:37,148
Just film what is really happening...
film the chaos of it all."

318
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:38,491
Which he did.

319
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,843
With three or four days to go,

320
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,572
there was so much still to be done

321
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,683
by so many different people

322
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,731
who got in each other's way.

323
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:52,062
He had lost track of what
was happening on his boat.

324
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:55,356
Of course you realize I've got to have
the equipment tonight.

325
00:20:57,118 --> 00:21:00,156
It won't be on the boat
if it's not put on tonight.

326
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,811
At that stage,
people were beginning to say to him,

327
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,955
"Are you sure everything's all right?

328
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:08,502
Have you really considered
what you're doing?"

329
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,817
He was getting more and more exhausted

330
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,419
and more rattled.

331
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,466
He was bright and cheerful
for the interviews,

332
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:19,417
but the minute the cameras stopped

333
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,083
his face dropped.

334
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,195
'Cause they sense
that it's a personal story.

335
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,356
And if I can ask you...
do you feel you're up against it

336
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,332
with the time limit?

337
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,067
I don't think there are too many things

338
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:41,885
that are of any importance
that remain undone.

339
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,766
Um...

340
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:47,225
most of it is...
is taken care of.

341
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,714
And I think that...

342
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,332
I'm not lacking in any great...

343
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:55,742
respects.

344
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:58,173
You know, there's nothing
essential that's missing.

345
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,365
The last day in Teignmouth,

346
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:14,524
Clare and I took him off for a walk
along the seafront.

347
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,277
He just sat there,

348
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,484
withdrawn and trembling,

349
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,938
saying, "lt isn't ready.
The boat isn't ready."

350
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:25,978
And as we walked back

351
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:29,277
we met Stanley Best,
the sponsor,

352
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:32,094
and Rodney Hallworth
who stood to make a lot of money

353
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,372
if he succeeded

354
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:35,354
and nothing if he failed.

355
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,532
So when he told them

356
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,454
he couldn't go,
the boat wasn't ready,

357
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,717
they said, "Donald, tomorrow
it's October the 31st,

358
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,698
the very last day to go.

359
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,525
You have to go."

360
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:50,684
What do you think of
the weather tomorrow?

361
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,638
I don't know.

362
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,043
I would think at this time of year
the southwestern winds...

363
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,446
Yes, very nice.

364
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,237
It was unstoppable.

365
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,730
There was so much at stake.

366
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,965
How could he say,
"I can't go"?

367
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:12,157
At the least, he faced ridicule
and embarrassment.

368
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:15,545
What would he be,
in his own eyes,

369
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,981
if he didn't go?

370
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,700
Now we turn
to Teignmouth in South Devon,

371
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:30,941
on the last day in which
Donald Crowhurst could start

372
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,765
on his round-the-world voyage.

373
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,323
The rules of "The Sunday Times" race
said that all competitors

374
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:37,726
must have started
by the end of October.

375
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:40,924
And at 3:00 this afternoon,
after innumerable delays,

376
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,096
start Mr. Crowhurst did.

377
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,953
How many can you manage?

378
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,438
- What about...?
- The kids? Yeah, all right.

379
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,650
We're terribly short of time.
The pilot is waiting.

380
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm awfully sorry.

381
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:07,739
I remember going on a small rowboat

382
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:10,396
with my brothers and my sister,

383
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:14,654
and my father kissing us goodbye.

384
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,666
It wasn't a feeling of sadness

385
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,228
so much as excitement.

386
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:24,185
But I suppose there was a feeling also
in the back of my mind,

387
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,872
"Well, you don't quite know
what's going to happen next."

388
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,105
The children were oblivious
to the danger,

389
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:36,667
without any doubt.

390
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,995
And it's just as well,
really.

391
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,301
Well, she's left Teignmouth at last.

392
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:57,754
The 41-foot trimaran,
"Teignmouth Electron,"

393
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,867
at the helm...
Donald Crowhurst,

394
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,817
this 36-year-old engineer

395
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:03,899
who even at this last stage

396
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:07,354
hasn't given up the idea of recording
the fastest time.

397
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,206
Yes, he's got this yellow
one-piece suit on,

398
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:14,171
and still his tie.
And out here too is his wife Clare

399
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:16,730
and four young children.
They're all very small,

400
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,358
chanting,
"Bye-bye, Daddy."

401
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,323
Oh, something's gone wrong out there.

402
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,298
He's taking a tour again.

403
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:29,500
Something I think has
gone wrong with the sail.

404
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,325
She's being towed back.

405
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,273
Oh, this is a tragedy.

406
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:36,093
The buoyancy bag at the top
of the mast was fouled.

407
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,723
The sails wouldn't go up.

408
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,699
Yeah...

409
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,338
Well it was a delay of only two hours.

410
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:48,540
By 5:00, Mr. Crowhurst's trimaran was
being towed out a mile from the shore,

411
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:52,152
and a cannon shot marked the official
start of his race around the world.

412
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,764
All I could see was this tiny figure

413
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,133
on what seemed to be a minute boat,

414
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,685
disappearing over the horizon.

415
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:22,360
Nowadays with GPS

416
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,785
you can pinpoint your position
to within a few feet

417
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,737
on any portion of the globe.

418
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,741
In the '60s, that just wasn't the case.

419
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:35,449
Don Crowhurst sailed over the horizon

420
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:39,827
and effectively into oblivion.

421
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,398
I don't think people understand

422
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:48,221
what it was like in those days...

423
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:50,746
pre-special foods,
pre-weather forecasts,

424
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,021
pre-satellites.

425
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:50,204
You can't imagine
how intensely I was living,

426
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,086
how good it is to be on your own.

427
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:56,187
You climb up
and you look back at your boat.

428
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:59,767
There is the sea, the wind,
the sound of the water...

429
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:05,082
above all, the beauty of the boat
surging forward.

430
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:08,859
On your own you can discover
who you really are.

431
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,661
Bernard Moitessier had now been at sea

432
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,323
for two months.

433
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,661
He was sailing faster
than any of his rivals,

434
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:36,380
averaging speeds of 120 miles a day,

435
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:38,681
and closing rapidly
on the race leader...

436
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,828
Robin Knox-Johnston.

437
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:44,761
Behind them, at the back
of the field of seven men,

438
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,874
was Donald Crowhurst.

439
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,467
The voyage he'd staked his future on

440
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,639
was finally underway.

441
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,006
I've been at sea now
very nearly 14 days.

442
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,627
And I'm on my way

443
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:12,445
to a rendezvous with Cape Horn.

444
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,026
That explains why I'm here,

445
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,715
in the North Atlantic
in the middle of November

446
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,749
making tape recordings in a small boat.

447
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,994
I wanted film of him at sea

448
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,398
and I wanted his thoughts,

449
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:33,246
so I got him a 16mm camera

450
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:35,066
and a tape recorder.

451
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:39,165
Like in Teignmouth,
when the camera was on,

452
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:42,973
he was the bold,
outgoing confident figure.

453
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:45,148
He was playing the character

454
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,907
of the long-distance sailor.

455
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,563
The thing about single-handing is,

456
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,017
it puts a great deal
of pressure on the man.

457
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:55,098
It explores his weaknesses

458
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,210
with a penetration

459
00:29:57,306 --> 00:30:00,507
that very few other
occupations can manage.

460
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:04,955
Winspear:
Don was always totally positive

461
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,684
and confident...

462
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,019
on the surface.

463
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:15,197
But the log revealed
a totally different story.

464
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,972
"November 5th, Tuesday:

465
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,050
Rachael's birthday.

466
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:23,227
Happy birthday, Rachael.

467
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,043
Hell of a morning for me, though.

468
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,405
I was feeling pleased with myself

469
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,669
when I noticed bubbles were blowing
out of the port forward hatch.

470
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:36,596
All the evidence was
that the compartment was full of water.

471
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,298
November 7th,
Thursday:

472
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:46,299
Saw that more screws had fallen out
of the self-steering gear.

473
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,241
That's four gone now.

474
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:51,068
The cockpit hatch has been leaking,

475
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:54,333
and it's flooded the engine
compartment and electrics.

476
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:57,629
This bloody boat is
just falling to pieces."

477
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:01,918
There were a lot of hatches
on these outer hulls,

478
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:04,349
and they were all leaking.

479
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:07,900
While he was in these calm waters,

480
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:12,281
he could walk out
to them and bail them out with a bucket.

481
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:14,907
But once he got into the southern ocean

482
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,857
the boat would be swept by waves.

483
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,100
There was no way he could empty them.

484
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,178
The hulls would fill

485
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:23,482
and he would drown.

486
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:28,251
"November 15th:

487
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,914
Racked by the growing awareness

488
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,409
that I must soon decide
whether or not I can go on

489
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:35,707
in the face of the actual situation."

490
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:39,929
Winspear:
I think doubt started to set in...

491
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,799
When reality started to set in.

492
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,594
And that reality wasn't quite
as perfect as the idea.

493
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:53,109
This is why ideas are dangerous.

494
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,443
"As the boat stands:
In its present condition

495
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,521
my chances of survival would not,

496
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:04,761
I think, be better than 50-50."

497
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,466
He knew the risk of going
to the southern ocean

498
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,436
was very very high indeed.

499
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,805
Crowhurst was now heading
into that ocean

500
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,257
in a leaking boat
he had to bail by hand.

501
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:34,681
And confirmation of just how dangerous
those seas could be

502
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,860
came later that November.

503
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,801
I'd heard about Ridgway and Blyth.

504
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:42,523
Next news I got was off New Zealand.

505
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,570
And I learned about King and Fougeron.

506
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:46,909
Bill King got turned over by a big wave

507
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:48,916
off South Africa and lost his mast.

508
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,644
There was the Italian.

509
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,242
The stress made him so ill,

510
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,165
he had a stomach ulcer.

511
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:57,241
There was another French sailor.

512
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:59,931
He had 27 days
of the most appalling weather,

513
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:01,691
and he packed it in.

514
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,964
It came down to the last four:

515
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,937
Tetley, Knox-Johnston, Moitessier

516
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,724
and Don Crowhurst.
Only four.

517
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,411
The odds were shortening on Crowhurst

518
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,043
all the time.

519
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,861
But his progress was painfully slow.

520
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:18,841
His only communication with land

521
00:33:18,937 --> 00:33:20,636
was through occasional telephone calls

522
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,617
patched by radio operators

523
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:24,989
and through Morse code cables,

524
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,707
and the cables catalogued the problems.

525
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:31,004
Crowhurst was averaging
barely 60 miles a day,

526
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,373
half of the speed of Moitessier,

527
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,733
in a boat that would not
stay afloat in heavy seas.

528
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,865
The pressure was building.

529
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:46,490
If Don went forward,

530
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:48,412
he was committing suicide.

531
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,907
But the financial
situation was desperate.

532
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:58,810
If he came back,
he was ruined.

533
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,450
"Time and money:

534
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,042
If one considers time only,

535
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:09,017
the thing to do is turn back now;

536
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,968
but money...

537
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,432
this area is the most worrying.

538
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,838
If I stop, I will disappoint
a lot of people...

539
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:18,076
Stanley Best...
most important...

540
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:21,723
Rodney Hallworth,
the folks at Teignmouth.

541
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,548
In the final analysis,

542
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,275
if the whole thing goes quite sour,

543
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,157
the business bankrupt
and the house sold,

544
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:31,091
I would have Clare
and the children still.

545
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,459
What a bloody awful decision,

546
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,920
to chuck it in at this stage.

547
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:39,444
What a bloody awful decision."

548
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,849
This was the point in mid-November

549
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,890
at which his instincts
should have told him

550
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,405
that it was right to give up
and he should come back to us.

551
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:56,505
But...

552
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,679
somehow he couldn't
bring himself to do that.

553
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:10,297
Donald was brought up in British India.

554
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:12,793
Home was wonderful.

555
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:16,177
The house full of animals.

556
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:23,482
He loved his father dearly.

557
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:27,962
But I think he had quite
a nice little childhood.

558
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:30,107
There were always people around,

559
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:32,083
but he was isolated.

560
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:36,796
His mother regarded
England as El Dorado,

561
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:40,025
and they came back and found
they didn't like it at all.

562
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,242
They had little more than £5,000

563
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,738
and they thought they'd be able to live
off that for a while.

564
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,290
But as things turned out,
the money went in weeks

565
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:55,132
and they literally found
themselves destitute.

566
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,995
One day his father just
keeled over with a heart attack

567
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,134
and that was it.

568
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,811
Donald was about 15.

569
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:10,717
He had seen the consequences
of financial disaster

570
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:12,891
on his own family.

571
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:16,410
He knew what the implications
might be for us.

572
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:19,196
He would have had a real
emotional gut reaction

573
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:22,681
to do whatever
he possibly could to avoid that.

574
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:26,164
Maybe he could find a way
out of this situation.

575
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,624
Every time he woke up,

576
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,995
it was the same problem.

577
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,864
He got no peace.

578
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,028
He couldn't walk away from it.

579
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,747
If he came back,
he was ruined.

580
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:53,464
If he went forward,
he was dead.

581
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:03,163
Is there a third option?

582
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,114
There was a third option...

583
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,283
a very interesting third option.

584
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:44,093
Suddenly, everything changed.

585
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:46,331
Now we were all excited.

586
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:48,474
Here was a man who was going so slowly,

587
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,675
and now he was setting record speeds.

588
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,739
People who had been cynical,
people who had been disinterested

589
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,531
felt differently now.

590
00:37:57,627 --> 00:38:00,057
We just had this enormous
confidence in my father.

591
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,812
He could do what he set out to achieve.

592
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,051
And then suddenly,
there he was,

593
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:06,973
and it was really coming true.

594
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,938
This is vindication on a grand scale.

595
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,201
243 miles in one day...

596
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:16,540
the new sailing record.

597
00:38:16,636 --> 00:38:21,115
And of course, Rodney is,
"Yes, I've always believed in my boy,"

598
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,810
all that sort of stuff.

599
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:26,492
Rodney Hallworth is a good
Fleet Street journalist...

600
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:29,017
"Never let the facts get
in the way of a good story."

601
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:33,018
He would add a little color
and add quite a distance

602
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:35,955
to the records Crowhurst was setting.

603
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,322
So Donald was passing messages

604
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,792
to Rodney,

605
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:43,480
and Rodney was
embellishing them for Fleet Street.

606
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:49,821
In the middle of December,

607
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,833
a month and a half into his journey,

608
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:56,314
Crowhurst's reported position advanced
rapidly towards the southern ocean.

609
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,873
Suddenly it seemed
that Donald Crowhurst

610
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,108
was a contender in the contest
for the fastest voyage.

611
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:04,412
Nigel Tetley,
Bernard Moitessier,

612
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,754
and Robin Knox-Johnston were
now his only remaining rivals.

613
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:46,396
I wonder what you'll do
when the voyage is over?

614
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,668
Hot bath.

615
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,004
- Anything else?
- Steak, egg and chips

616
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,308
with new-boiled potatoes,

617
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:56,826
fresh peas, a beautiful,
juicy, sirloin steak.

618
00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:58,808
But first thing,
a pint of English beer.

619
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,438
Christ, I miss English beer.

620
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:31,738
I think it might have started as a game.

621
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,459
Knowing Don,

622
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,251
he had a playful nature...

623
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,292
And game playing would
come naturally to him.

624
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:46,393
He started playing games.

625
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:51,868
Maybe he just thought,

626
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:54,490
"Right, give them some boost back home.

627
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,899
Lift their spirits..."

628
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:01,241
"and they'll all think
something's happening here."

629
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:07,257
My father was starting to claim

630
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:09,688
that he had sailed further
than he actually had.

631
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,093
He took the decision

632
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:14,169
to begin charting his actual positions

633
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,730
in a second logbook.

634
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:19,612
Crowhurst knew the race
judges might ask to see

635
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,137
the logbook of any sailor
who made it home.

636
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,185
So in this second log,

637
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,387
he began to keep a secret
record of his true journey,

638
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:30,237
while gradually the cables
he sent back to London

639
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,955
mapped out the story of a fake journey.

640
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:37,433
I suspect that he might have said,

641
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,837
"Well, let's carry on a bit,

642
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,803
let a little water
pass under the bridge."

643
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:46,425
And then the game develops.

644
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:51,675
Crowhurst may only have intended

645
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,786
to exaggerate his progress

646
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:57,017
before retiring from the race with
a little pride restored.

647
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:02,038
But that first decision
became a trap of its own.

648
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,488
The option of pulling out of the race

649
00:42:06,584 --> 00:42:08,828
became even more formidable.

650
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:12,540
Because the difference between where
people thought my father was

651
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:14,202
and where he actually was

652
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,346
became greater and greater.

653
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:18,458
So to pull in at a port

654
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:20,537
would bring home the fact that

655
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:23,922
he was not at all where
he was supposed to be...

656
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:29,112
that he was much much further behind.

657
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,954
That's where he got trapped, wasn't it?

658
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,916
He'd made a mistake.

659
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:46,203
Whatever fears he had,
he had to go through with it.

660
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,653
He couldn't go back.

661
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:52,856
He couldn't go home.

662
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,954
Around Christmastime,

663
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,195
my father managed to get
through on the telephone

664
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,858
to my mother.

665
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,833
He couldn't tell her
the problems that he was facing.

666
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:13,784
She thought he was doing well,

667
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,891
and that her job was to convince him
that she was coping.

668
00:43:16,986 --> 00:43:19,804
They were trying to protect each other.

669
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:27,385
We tried to have a good Christmas,

670
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,652
but there was still a great sense
of something missing.

671
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:33,533
I remember one of the children

672
00:43:33,629 --> 00:43:35,545
sitting on the staircase crying

673
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:38,300
that he wanted his daddy.

674
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:40,377
And that...

675
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,171
I think brought it home to me

676
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:44,626
what a dreadful thing we had done.

677
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:50,715
"There is a spirituality
about this place,

678
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:55,674
and about the time...
Christmas...

679
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,616
that does tend to make one
a little bit melancholy.

680
00:43:58,712 --> 00:44:03,162
And one thinks
of one's friends and family,

681
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:06,676
and you know that
they're thinking of you.

682
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:10,587
And the sense of separation

683
00:44:10,683 --> 00:44:13,944
is somehow increased

684
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,762
by the loneliness."

685
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:20,824
What about the children?
How are they reacting?

686
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,268
They're all right.

687
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:24,027
They're healthy enough about it.

688
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:27,227
One of them has nightmares,
and this is a bit worrying.

689
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:29,148
He walks in his sleep

690
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:31,068
and he shouts and he sees his father.

691
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:32,665
And because he can't...
he sees him,

692
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:34,745
but he can't communicate with him,

693
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:37,979
and he can't feel the warmth
of his personality about,

694
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,928
he worries about this, of course.

695
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:42,332
But the others are very blasé about it,

696
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:45,910
and they think of "Daddy's going to win
the Golden Globe," you know.

697
00:44:57,213 --> 00:44:58,745
Early in the new year,

698
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:00,825
a newspaper photographed
Clare with the wives

699
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,360
of Tetley and Moitessier.

700
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:05,625
They were christened "The Sea Widows."

701
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,723
For weeks now,
Crowhurst's publicity agents

702
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:11,801
had tried to report
news of his progress.

703
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:14,711
But after the cable claiming
the world's speed record,

704
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:17,753
his messages were rare
and hard to decipher.

705
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,898
There were many telegrams from him

706
00:45:19,994 --> 00:45:21,977
where we couldn't put out a story

707
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:24,602
because even stretching
our imaginations,

708
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:27,991
we couldn't decipher...
we couldn't figure out

709
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:29,555
what he was talking about.

710
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,201
They were cryptic beyond belief.

711
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:37,884
One came through "off Brazil."

712
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,672
Well, where off Brazil?

713
00:45:47,357 --> 00:45:49,850
Sometime in the middle of January...
I think it was the 18th or the 19th,

714
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,579
we got a message saying

715
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:53,657
he was having trouble

716
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:55,899
and, in future,
we would not be receiving

717
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:57,723
any messages from him.

718
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,345
Um...

719
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,038
panic.

720
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:05,049
Rodney was facing the prospect

721
00:46:05,144 --> 00:46:07,511
of no information

722
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:10,450
at a crucial stage in the race.

723
00:46:12,124 --> 00:46:14,487
Crowhurst's last cable claimed
he was 500 miles

724
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,122
into the southern ocean,

725
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:18,045
and closing on Tetley.

726
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,569
Ahead of them,
Moitessier and Knox-Johnston

727
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:23,479
were approaching the most
dangerous part of the course...

728
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,723
the last stretch of the southern ocean

729
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:28,124
before Cape Horn.

730
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,713
Cape Horn becomes fixed in your mind.

731
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,696
"Once I'm round Cape Horn,

732
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:34,362
I can turn north.

733
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,732
I can get out of
this bastard of a place."

734
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,837
'Cause it is a bastard of a place.

735
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:49,751
Imagine yourself in something about

736
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:52,728
the size of a small truck,

737
00:46:52,824 --> 00:46:55,930
and coming towards you is
a 12-story high building.

738
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:58,964
That is the size
of the waves down there.

739
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:20,632
A great cape has a soul

740
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:23,323
with very soft,

741
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:26,684
very violent shadows and colors.

742
00:47:28,285 --> 00:47:31,100
A soul as smooth as a child's,

743
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:33,750
as hard as a criminal's.

744
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,305
And that is why we go.

745
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:41,209
One forgets everything,

746
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:44,411
seeing only the play
of the boat with the sea,

747
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:46,715
the play of the sea around the boat,

748
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:51,161
leaving aside everything
not essential to that game.

749
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:53,241
One has to be careful, though,

750
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,672
not to go further than necessary

751
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:57,753
to the depths of the game.

752
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,410
And that is the hard part...

753
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:03,030
not going too far.

754
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:27,608
"You look out on this wild landscape

755
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,064
stretching away as far
as the eye can see,

756
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,469
streaks of spume

757
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:36,500
blown down the face
of these immense waves...

758
00:48:38,396 --> 00:48:40,506
and froth-white foam

759
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:43,447
sending a great flurry
of spray and heavy water

760
00:48:43,543 --> 00:48:45,109
all over everything.

761
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:48,634
And it's all tremendously exciting,

762
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,635
and a tremendous challenge, of course."

763
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,033
Crowhurst was drifting off
the coast of South America,

764
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:01,852
preparing a record
of his false journey,

765
00:49:01,948 --> 00:49:05,688
film and audiotapes
that would be broadcast on his return.

766
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:09,499
In two months' time,

767
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:12,732
the race route would
bring the other sailors around Cape Horn

768
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:14,232
and past him.

769
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,612
At that point,

770
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:19,097
he could slip in beside them,
and sail for home.

771
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:22,137
Until then,
he could only wait.

772
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:25,883
He'd stopped all radio communication
to avoid detection.

773
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,730
His isolation was complete.

774
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:33,178
There you are,
you're alone on your boat,

775
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:35,192
just you...

776
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:36,919
and the ocean.

777
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,996
It's the whole of your universe,

778
00:49:40,092 --> 00:49:42,553
it stretches to the horizon.

779
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,379
It's totally indifferent.

780
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:46,904
And it just accentuates

781
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,980
the isolation.

782
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:53,074
From that moment,
the time bomb was ticking.

783
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,056
He had no longer one enemy

784
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:01,787
which was the sea,

785
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,544
he had himself...

786
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:08,507
this problem of imagination

787
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:11,448
and the delicate mechanism

788
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:13,561
of the mind.

789
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:27,771
Keeping a sort of watch
on sails by night.

790
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:30,329
Alone.

791
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:32,889
The rigging sighs a sigh
of cosmic sorrow

792
00:50:32,985 --> 00:50:37,116
for weeping doves that die
maybe tomorrow.

793
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,984
On 12.7 by 10-to-the-five

794
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,343
irradiated olive trees.

795
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:48,922
A sigh to fill man's
soul with melancholy.

796
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:53,396
Waves, sweep away my melancholy.

797
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:58,458
Then in the last week of February,

798
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:01,081
Crowhurst discovered
he had another problem.

799
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:04,153
His float splits.

800
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:06,524
He needs help.

801
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,594
But he's not where he's supposed to be.

802
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,225
He's not in the southern ocean.

803
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,628
He's just off the coast of Brazil.

804
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:16,028
This is the trap he's in.

805
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:19,609
If Crowhurst broke radio
silence to call for help,

806
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:23,637
his radio transmitter would
give away his true position.

807
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:36,085
For seven weeks now,
his family had heard nothing.

808
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:41,369
It just became more and more apparent

809
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,675
that something should have
been heard by now,

810
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,398
and it hadn't been.

811
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:48,762
And people began to fear for the worst.

812
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:56,472
as I should have done."

813
00:52:00,476 --> 00:52:02,618
The last night at Teignmouth,

814
00:52:02,714 --> 00:52:04,858
he did weep for a long time

815
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:07,030
in our bedroom.

816
00:52:08,636 --> 00:52:11,225
I knew that it would be very easy

817
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:14,108
to say, you know, "Don't go."

818
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:16,088
That's the awful thing,
you know?

819
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:18,201
You know you could stop it,

820
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:21,498
and yet you know that it could be
disastrous if you did.

821
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,945
It's a bit like children

822
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:29,400
who know that if you
squeeze them too tight,

823
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:31,890
they'll do the exact opposite.

824
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:36,220
But you can't ever know at the time

825
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:39,732
which road is going
to be the right one.

826
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:44,220
I remember in...
in Teignmouth,

827
00:52:44,316 --> 00:52:47,770
shortly before my father set sail,

828
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:50,488
listening in the hotel
to the sound of a gale.

829
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:08,346
I hadn't realized before,

830
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:12,373
just how dangerous the sea could be.

831
00:53:15,036 --> 00:53:18,008
And I remember lying
in my bed in the hotel,

832
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,984
and listening to these huge winds

833
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,474
and great waves crashing...

834
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,481
and thinking,
"That's the sort of weather

835
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,745
that he's going to have to be coping
with in his boat."

836
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:41,977
"March 4th:

837
00:53:42,073 --> 00:53:43,987
Immediate problems:

838
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:49,788
One, establish visual contact

839
00:53:49,884 --> 00:53:54,009
Rio Salado entrance,
30 miles;

840
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,464
Two, repair float...

841
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,447
mo proper materials...

842
00:54:03,543 --> 00:54:05,243
large sheet ply,

843
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,164
screws, glue;

844
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,564
Also require oats, meths,

845
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,443
rice, vindaloo paste."

846
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:02,234
He knew what it was like

847
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,954
to come in contact with people again.

848
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:08,764
And they responded to him with warmth.

849
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,631
And yet, why he didn't telephone home

850
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:15,451
is an overwhelming question.

851
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:19,195
He must have known
we were desperate for news,

852
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,305
but he didn't.

853
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,832
He didn't communicate at that stage,

854
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:27,381
which is, to me,
quite a shattering blow.

855
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,979
I think if you were in the real world,

856
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:37,497
at that stage you would have
picked up the telephone...

857
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:40,433
and said, "Look,
I've had to stop."

858
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,562
Because landing was a flagrant act

859
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:47,865
for disqualifying himself
from the race.

860
00:55:49,692 --> 00:55:52,632
He was slowly but surely
getting himself exposed.

861
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:55,738
He had made his first mistake.

862
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:59,898
That mistake was very likely
to be revealed,

863
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:03,579
particularly if the coastguards
had noted his presence.

864
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,714
Why didn't he stop then?

865
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,103
Why did he go back out to sea?

866
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:29,624
I can only assume he was
half-in and half-out

867
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,027
of the real world at this stage.

868
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:39,287
As Crowhurst sailed away from land,

869
00:56:39,383 --> 00:56:41,562
the other sailors were
coming round the Horn

870
00:56:41,658 --> 00:56:44,889
and racing north for Europe and home.

871
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,538
Bernard Moitessier
had now been alone at sea

872
00:56:52,634 --> 00:56:54,460
for nearly six months.

873
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:58,136
And the isolation was beginning
to affect him profoundly.

874
00:57:03,772 --> 00:57:06,297
After Cape Horn, I felt I knew

875
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:08,668
I didn't want to come back.

876
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:10,842
You see, it didn't seem worth it.

877
00:57:10,938 --> 00:57:13,018
I could feel it.

878
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:15,194
I didn't say so to anyone.

879
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,116
I didn't dare to.

880
00:57:17,212 --> 00:57:19,963
I hardly dared admit it to myself.

881
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,203
Around the world without stopping...

882
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:48,507
eight months alone,
completely alone,

883
00:57:48,603 --> 00:57:50,681
with all that the entails,

884
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:52,987
it had never been done before.

885
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,472
Everything revolved around
that word, "alone"...

886
00:57:56,568 --> 00:57:59,928
the nervous tension,
the food, the exhaustion,

887
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,528
my whole outlook.

888
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:03,770
Things which mattered at the start,

889
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:05,627
didn't matter at all.

890
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:08,249
The rules of the game had changed now.

891
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:11,033
The rules within me had changed.

892
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:22,139
# I'm drunk, you circum... #

893
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:23,671
# You silly old circum... #

894
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:27,991
# You're as drunk as
a circumnavigator can be! #

895
00:58:29,623 --> 00:58:31,835
Hey, I'll tell you something.

896
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:34,652
I think the director-
general of the BBC

897
00:58:34,747 --> 00:58:39,026
is probably slipping some buckshot
into his 12-ball, as it were.

898
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,296
Oh, why should I worry?

899
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:44,156
Hee-hee!

900
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,232
He's given this lunatic Crowhurst

901
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:48,183
a tape recorder, yeah.

902
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:51,192
And 74,000 miles of tape.

903
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:54,810
What can he do?
He's got to deliver a load of gibberish

904
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:57,336
in order to fill up the space, matey.

905
00:58:57,432 --> 00:58:59,767
Do you see?

906
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:04,178
I think I'll just have
another little swig of this bottle here.

907
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:07,383
Ahh!

908
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,343
For Crowhurst, after four months,

909
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:14,360
the waiting was coming to an end.

910
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:16,154
And like Moitessier,

911
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,609
the prospect of
his return was troubling him.

912
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:22,043
Within days, the route
of his fake voyage

913
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:24,120
would come past his actual position.

914
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:26,810
He had to plan how and where

915
00:59:26,906 --> 00:59:29,815
to rejoin the race,
when to break radio silence.

916
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:33,369
Above all, he had to prepare
the written evidence

917
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:35,448
of a circumnavigation.

918
00:59:35,544 --> 00:59:37,431
Once he'd arrived successfully,

919
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:40,500
the panel of judges would
want to see his logbooks.

920
00:59:42,107 --> 00:59:45,141
They would want proof that he had
been round the world.

921
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,619
He would have to fake his position

922
00:59:50,715 --> 00:59:53,592
for every day he was supposed
to be in the southern ocean.

923
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:57,657
That was an amazingly
difficult thing to do.

924
00:59:57,753 --> 01:00:01,338
That would create enormous pressure.

925
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:04,023
He might think, "Well,
I don't think I can go through with it."

926
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:08,922
By this stage, I think
Don genuinely felt

927
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:12,566
that winning the race
wasn't part of the plot.

928
01:00:13,596 --> 01:00:15,543
All he wanted really

929
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:19,194
was to come in quietly
as the man who came forth.

930
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,434
Nobody wants to see their logbooks...

931
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,097
not too much scrutiny.

932
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:25,818
The interest in them
wouldn't last long.

933
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:29,018
Don was very much at risk
in his game here.

934
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:37,044
But he just wanted to go back.

935
01:00:38,492 --> 01:00:40,597
He was coming home.

936
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,282
One morning, Rodney
calls into the office

937
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:02,586
and said, "Ah, he's back!"

938
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:04,217
I said, "Oh, who's back?"

939
01:01:04,313 --> 01:01:06,620
And it was,
"Donald Crowhurst is back."

940
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:09,208
There's a phone call from Portishead

941
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:11,447
saying Crowhurst is back on the air.

942
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,479
Rodney Hallworth phoned me
very early one morning.

943
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:18,682
He said, "My face is covered
in shaving cream,

944
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:22,135
but I've had a message
from Donald saying he's safe and well,

945
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:24,151
and on his way home."

946
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,712
Young I... I don't know...
I just don't know what to do.

947
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,636
Quite frankly,
I'm absolutely stunned.

948
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,289
I thought that when I heard,
I would go absolutely crazy

949
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:33,336
and I would go off
buy lots of champagne

950
01:01:33,432 --> 01:01:35,675
and, you know, do all sorts
of mad things.

951
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:38,555
But at the moment,
I think I just want to keep the news

952
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:40,859
a bit to myself and sort of absorb it

953
01:01:40,955 --> 01:01:44,058
before l... I completely lose my head.

954
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,907
The feeling that the whole
world was different...

955
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,619
didn't matter there
wasn't enough money for this or that.

956
01:01:50,715 --> 01:01:53,467
Everything was different
all of a sudden.

957
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:56,472
Young Then l... I picked up
the telephone to tell a friend

958
01:01:56,568 --> 01:01:58,299
and suddenly I was
absolutely overwhelmed.

959
01:01:58,395 --> 01:02:01,369
I couldn't... I couldn't talk
for a long time.

960
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:04,090
It was as if a switch had been thrown.

961
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:06,136
Suddenly this elation...

962
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:07,996
not only was he alive and well,

963
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:11,126
but he was actually in...
still very much in the competition.

964
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:15,258
Our faith is deserved.

965
01:02:15,353 --> 01:02:17,429
He's back with us.

966
01:02:19,899 --> 01:02:21,594
Crowhurst turned for home,

967
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,672
slipping in behind Nigel Tetley,

968
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:26,773
who'd passed just
100 miles to the east of him.

969
01:02:28,252 --> 01:02:30,646
Everyone believe Moitessier
was ahead of them,

970
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:33,749
chasing Robin Knox-Johnston
to the finish...

971
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:39,419
until a message arrived in Paris.

972
01:02:48,924 --> 01:02:51,318
After seven months at sea

973
01:02:51,414 --> 01:02:53,530
and barely six weeks from home,

974
01:02:53,626 --> 01:02:57,367
Moitessier abandoned the race
and turned south again.

975
01:02:57,463 --> 01:02:59,675
He was sailing on around the world

976
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:01,528
a second time.

977
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:10,967
I do not know how to explain
to Françoise and the children

978
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:14,041
my need to continue
towards the Pacific...

979
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:15,701
to be at peace.

980
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:18,684
I know I am right.

981
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,410
I feel it deeply.

982
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:23,292
I know exactly where I am going.

983
01:03:23,388 --> 01:03:25,691
How could they understand that?

984
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:28,119
It is so simple.

985
01:03:28,215 --> 01:03:31,286
But it can't be explained in words.

986
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:37,369
The pictures of my children
blur before my eyes,

987
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:40,087
though God knows I love them.

988
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:53,016
Morning of Tuesday, April 22nd.

989
01:04:53,112 --> 01:04:55,641
Plymouth awaits the arrival
of Robin Knox-Johnston

990
01:04:55,737 --> 01:04:58,043
aboard his 32' ketch "Suhaili,"

991
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:00,795
now only a few miles
away from the finish

992
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,392
where he'll become the first man

993
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:05,594
to sail around the world
on his own, nonstop,

994
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:09,657
a journey which has lasted 312 days.

995
01:05:09,753 --> 01:05:12,761
The crowds now pouring in
all around the Cornwall Coast;

996
01:05:12,856 --> 01:05:14,775
Binoculars and telescopes are out.

997
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,311
As his bows cross the line,

998
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,236
a cannon should be fired,

999
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,410
and the voyage will be over.

1000
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:22,332
There he is.
Look at the smile.

1001
01:05:22,428 --> 01:05:24,758
He really is enjoying this.
This is tremendous.

1002
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,683
And the cannon is gone,

1003
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:29,402
and Robin Knox-Johnston and "Suhaili"

1004
01:05:29,498 --> 01:05:32,284
have sailed nonstop

1005
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,025
around the world.

1006
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:42,743
It was all a bit of a dream.

1007
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,604
You look at all these people and say,

1008
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:47,835
"I've done this, this thing that people
said you couldn't do.

1009
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:50,203
I've done this now."

1010
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:53,110
I don't have to
come yell, scream, shout about it.

1011
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:54,873
It's inside.

1012
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,871
Robin Knox-Johnston
came out onto the balcony

1013
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:00,569
to acknowledge the cheer.

1014
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,770
He's the first ever
to round the world alone nonstop.

1015
01:06:03,866 --> 01:06:05,847
He's averaged 92 miles a day

1016
01:06:05,943 --> 01:06:07,609
on this marathon voyage.

1017
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:10,297
It's not enough to
win him the cash prize

1018
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:12,667
for the fastest time,
because Nigel Tetley

1019
01:06:12,763 --> 01:06:15,002
and Donald Crowhurst
are still battling it out

1020
01:06:15,098 --> 01:06:17,075
in the Atlantic.

1021
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:20,091
All eyes now turned to the contest

1022
01:06:20,187 --> 01:06:21,947
for the fastest voyage.

1023
01:06:22,043 --> 01:06:24,504
Either Nigel Tetley or Donald Crowhurst

1024
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,539
was about to become
the most famous man in Britain.

1025
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,432
Right, the game playing is over,

1026
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,770
We're back to real life now.

1027
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:38,007
How are we gonna match the two?

1028
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:41,240
Not a very easy thing to do.

1029
01:06:41,336 --> 01:06:44,059
Whilst he was out on his own,
that's one thing.

1030
01:06:44,155 --> 01:06:47,064
But he has now got to
continue playing his character.

1031
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,631
He's got a role to play

1032
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:51,671
and he mustn't drop a line.

1033
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,523
"I think my effort will be
faster than Chichester's

1034
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:59,194
and should be quite fast enough to give
me 'The Sunday Times' race."

1035
01:07:01,303 --> 01:07:03,703
So I'm feeling fairly bucked,

1036
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:05,752
fairly chuffed with myself.

1037
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:08,695
The whole plan, in reality,

1038
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,775
depended on Tetley coming in first

1039
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:12,758
with the fastest circumnavigation.

1040
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:14,872
Then his notebooks would
be closely examined,

1041
01:07:14,968 --> 01:07:16,698
while Donald Crowhurst's notebooks

1042
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:19,639
wouldn't need to be closely examined
at all. He's just a runner-up.

1043
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:23,479
He was going strong
and it was looking great.

1044
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:26,682
Then we got the telegram
that there's no chance...

1045
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:28,890
of catching Tetley.

1046
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:31,130
We're thinking,
disappointment,

1047
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,051
but not devastation.

1048
01:07:33,147 --> 01:07:35,451
As far as we're concerned,
our boy has done good.

1049
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:37,851
He's gone through
some of the loneliest,

1050
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:39,707
toughest seas in the world.

1051
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:41,627
Even the most skeptical folk
are saying,

1052
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,704
"He has come in good
and fair play to it."

1053
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,911
It was bloody marvelous.

1054
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:51,478
And then suddenly,
out of the blue...

1055
01:08:09,372 --> 01:08:11,477
Tetley sunk.

1056
01:08:21,627 --> 01:08:25,015
I heard Nigel Tetley had been rescued.

1057
01:08:25,111 --> 01:08:28,250
I heard that before I heard

1058
01:08:28,346 --> 01:08:30,290
that his boat had gone down.

1059
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:38,805
That finished it, basically.

1060
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:42,105
He was going to win.

1061
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:45,527
Donald was not a stupid man.

1062
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:47,770
He knew what it would mean.

1063
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:51,158
He couldn't glide
into port and fade away.

1064
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:54,998
He knew that everything
would be scrutinized.

1065
01:08:55,094 --> 01:08:57,818
There was going to be
a committee of reception.

1066
01:08:57,914 --> 01:09:00,570
What did you think about
when you went round the Horn?

1067
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,971
Everything would be verified.

1068
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:06,385
Tell us about some of the problems
that you found on this voyage?

1069
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:10,073
And Don knew very well

1070
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:12,475
that it would end up
in total humiliation.

1071
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:14,929
Could you do it again?

1072
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:20,762
That's not an option you go through.

1073
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:23,099
And he's running out of options by now.

1074
01:09:37,915 --> 01:09:39,798
"When I was five years old,

1075
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:41,880
I knew all about God.

1076
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:43,577
He was an old man

1077
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:46,966
who would punish me if I was naughty.

1078
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,398
By the time I was 20,

1079
01:09:49,494 --> 01:09:51,577
I decided there was no reason to expect

1080
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:53,850
any assistance from God...

1081
01:09:53,946 --> 01:09:55,928
if he existed at all.

1082
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:58,585
Man was evading his responsibility

1083
01:09:58,681 --> 01:10:00,696
by constantly looking to God...

1084
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,840
for assistance.

1085
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:04,920
The cosmic integral,

1086
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:07,291
the sum of man...

1087
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:09,428
adds up to nothing."

1088
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:13,658
In the days after Tetley's sinking,

1089
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:17,273
Crowhurst repeatedly
tried to get a call through to Clare.

1090
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:20,441
But his radio transmitter was failing.

1091
01:10:20,537 --> 01:10:23,161
If you are, I will come back to...

1092
01:10:23,257 --> 01:10:25,531
The transmitter failing at that point

1093
01:10:25,627 --> 01:10:28,249
was something that plagued him.

1094
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:31,606
He became almost
obsessed with fixing it.

1095
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:35,705
He wanted to talk to my mother.

1096
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:39,288
Mike-Zulu-Uniform-Whiskey calling GBC-3.

1097
01:10:39,384 --> 01:10:43,126
I have heard nothing.
I have heard nothing.

1098
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:47,192
I think he just wanted human contact

1099
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:50,874
that he felt would
be warm and responsive,

1100
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,795
whatever he had to say.

1101
01:10:52,891 --> 01:10:54,618
Mike-Zulu-Uniform-Whiskey calling.

1102
01:10:54,714 --> 01:10:55,865
Mike-Zulu-Uniform...

1103
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:58,903
He could have trusted me...

1104
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:01,688
but there was nothing he could do.

1105
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:07,257
"There are close similarities

1106
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:10,522
between sailing
a small boat and living.

1107
01:11:10,618 --> 01:11:13,371
You start off unprepared,

1108
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:17,627
a long journey ahead of you that
you think will never end.

1109
01:11:17,723 --> 01:11:21,435
And you go through
a series of triumphs and disasters.

1110
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:24,407
And suddenly you realize

1111
01:11:24,503 --> 01:11:26,331
that...

1112
01:11:26,426 --> 01:11:28,952
what's done is done.

1113
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:32,816
The mistakes you've made
stand forever."

1114
01:11:44,955 --> 01:11:48,790
There were 100,000 people
expected to meet him.

1115
01:11:48,886 --> 01:11:51,929
100,000 to say hello to you
on your way home.

1116
01:11:52,025 --> 01:11:55,351
There was going to be a razmataz.

1117
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:57,275
There would be triumphant processions.

1118
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:58,553
It was euphoric.

1119
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:01,140
This almost outdoes Chichester.

1120
01:12:02,843 --> 01:12:05,179
We're hoping this
will be a great gala affair.

1121
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:06,776
Newspapermen from abroad

1122
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:09,050
have all booked in hotels.

1123
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:12,379
Over 1,000 arrangements have been made
to welcome him home.

1124
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:15,227
It was beginning to build up to be

1125
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:16,953
really lovely.

1126
01:12:17,048 --> 01:12:19,096
It was so close to the end.

1127
01:12:19,192 --> 01:12:22,168
Everybody was in such high spirits.

1128
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:25,301
All of a sudden,
everything was all right.

1129
01:12:28,603 --> 01:12:30,777
His dream, it was there.

1130
01:12:30,873 --> 01:12:33,433
It was going to come true.

1131
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:36,815
Everything a hero could want.

1132
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:41,363
But he knew it was false.

1133
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:49,754
On Tuesday, 24th of June,

1134
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,767
Crowhurst turned away from England

1135
01:12:51,863 --> 01:12:55,158
and let his boat drift through
the weed-infested waters

1136
01:12:55,254 --> 01:12:57,529
of the mid-Atlantic Sargasso Sea.

1137
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,888
Then he opened a logbook

1138
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:06,679
and began to write.

1139
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:13,590
He called it his philosophy.

1140
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:17,273
"The explanation of our troubles

1141
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:20,536
is that cosmic beings are
playing games with us.

1142
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:24,728
During his lifetime,
each man plays cosmic chess

1143
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:26,872
against the devil.

1144
01:13:26,968 --> 01:13:29,723
God is playing with one set of rules,

1145
01:13:29,818 --> 01:13:31,449
and the devil with the other,

1146
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:34,169
exactly opposite set of rules.

1147
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:35,929
The shameful secret of God...

1148
01:13:36,024 --> 01:13:38,007
the trick He used,

1149
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:40,314
because the truth
would hurt too much...

1150
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,098
is that there is no good

1151
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:45,338
or evil.

1152
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:47,286
Only truth."

1153
01:13:48,984 --> 01:13:51,992
He was in the most
extraordinary feeling

1154
01:13:52,088 --> 01:13:55,737
of "I've failed everything."

1155
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,672
There was nobody there to talk to.

1156
01:14:00,123 --> 01:14:04,439
He tried to contemplate ways
of dealing with this race

1157
01:14:04,535 --> 01:14:07,161
and the money and the family back home,

1158
01:14:07,257 --> 01:14:10,776
and eventually his brain said,
"Enough. No more."

1159
01:14:10,872 --> 01:14:14,042
"Do we go on clinging to the idea

1160
01:14:14,138 --> 01:14:16,087
that God made us?

1161
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:18,491
Or realize that it lies within us

1162
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:19,990
to make God.

1163
01:14:20,086 --> 01:14:23,641
By learning to manipulate
the space/time continuum,

1164
01:14:23,737 --> 01:14:25,687
man will become God

1165
01:14:25,783 --> 01:14:29,785
and disappear from
the physical universe as we know it."

1166
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:33,239
Somehow he just had
given up on his family.

1167
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:36,787
We had vanished from
his mind at that stage.

1168
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:39,673
Mrs. Crowhurst, unless he sinks,

1169
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:41,816
your husband is going to win the £5,000

1170
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,286
for the fastest time.

1171
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,017
What will this mean
to you and your family?

1172
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,802
Very little change
in our way of living, I should think.

1173
01:14:47,898 --> 01:14:50,834
He won't sink,
I don't think.

1174
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:55,736
"I have become a second
generation cosmic being.

1175
01:14:55,832 --> 01:14:59,159
I am conceived in the womb of nature,

1176
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:00,538
in my own mind,

1177
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:03,030
in the womb of the universe."

1178
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:05,273
You've told me that you
haven't had any fears

1179
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:07,799
during the voyage,
but what about when he returns?

1180
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:10,295
Yes, I am a bit concerned about
the change of personality.

1181
01:15:10,391 --> 01:15:13,497
I think it's inevitable that he will be
a very different person.

1182
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,575
Somebody who faced every day

1183
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:19,091
as though it was a new danger
and a new feeling of excitement.

1184
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:25,303
"I was forced to admit

1185
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:27,448
that nature forces on cosmic beings

1186
01:15:27,544 --> 01:15:29,721
the only sin they are capable of...

1187
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,759
the sin of concealment.

1188
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:36,150
It is a small sin for a man to commit,

1189
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:39,568
but it is a terrible sin
for a cosmic being."

1190
01:15:41,659 --> 01:15:45,910
He is living totally
in his internal world.

1191
01:15:46,006 --> 01:15:48,887
He's invented, in his mind,

1192
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:51,448
a relationship between him

1193
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:53,816
and the universe.

1194
01:15:57,659 --> 01:16:00,534
He's found refuge there,

1195
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,708
in a sense.

1196
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:12,121
"I am what I am.

1197
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:15,095
And I see the nature of my offense.

1198
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:17,752
I will only resign this game

1199
01:16:17,848 --> 01:16:19,961
if you will agree that
on the next occasion

1200
01:16:20,057 --> 01:16:21,624
that this game is played,

1201
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,574
it will be played
according to the rules

1202
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:26,577
that are devised by my great God.

1203
01:16:28,538 --> 01:16:30,422
It is finished.

1204
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:32,347
It is finished.

1205
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:35,319
It is the mercy.

1206
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:37,722
11 hours, 15 minutes,

1207
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:39,481
no seconds.

1208
01:16:39,577 --> 01:16:41,786
It is the end of my game.

1209
01:16:41,882 --> 01:16:43,707
The truth has been revealed

1210
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:47,415
and it will be done as
my family require me to do it.

1211
01:16:48,635 --> 01:16:52,762
11 hours, 20 minutes, 40 seconds.

1212
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:56,439
There is no reason for harmful..."

1213
01:17:39,163 --> 01:17:41,498
I'd been out for a walk,

1214
01:17:41,594 --> 01:17:43,705
and I came back with the dog.

1215
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:47,159
My sister was with the children.

1216
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:49,271
And she said,

1217
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:51,097
"The boat's been found."

1218
01:17:51,193 --> 01:17:53,655
Then I became aware

1219
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:57,045
there were several complete strangers
on the front lawn

1220
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:00,022
and a couple of police cars.

1221
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:02,778
Just my instant reaction was,

1222
01:18:02,873 --> 01:18:05,363
"Get the children out of here."

1223
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:09,208
Winspear:
You can imagine the atmosphere,

1224
01:18:09,304 --> 01:18:11,385
the feeling of shock.

1225
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,488
Clare didn't feel

1226
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:17,047
she had the courage at the time

1227
01:18:17,143 --> 01:18:19,636
to tell the children.

1228
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:23,828
So I went to them.

1229
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:28,857
My father's boat had been found,

1230
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:31,448
but he wasn't in it.

1231
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:36,218
It was so different from the homecoming
that we'd expected.

1232
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:38,166
It was just like,

1233
01:18:38,262 --> 01:18:39,896
"This is the wrong story.
This is...

1234
01:18:39,992 --> 01:18:41,689
this is not what's
supposed to be happening.

1235
01:18:41,785 --> 01:18:44,788
This is... it can't be."

1236
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:51,223
A British cargo ship
found Crowhurst's boat

1237
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:53,497
drifting in the mid-Atlantic

1238
01:18:53,593 --> 01:18:56,050
700 miles from land.

1239
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:04,539
A surprise development tonight

1240
01:19:04,635 --> 01:19:06,810
over the missing yachtsman
Donald Crowhurst.

1241
01:19:06,906 --> 01:19:08,985
Crowhurst's trimaran,
"Teignmouth Electron,"

1242
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,386
was found drifting and deserted.

1243
01:19:11,482 --> 01:19:13,625
He'd been a competitor
in the Round-the-World yacht race

1244
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:15,573
organized by "The Sunday Times."

1245
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:17,623
The pale blue weather-beaten trimaran,

1246
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,288
which was a certain winner of the race,

1247
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:20,822
was in good condition.

1248
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:22,649
The mystery of his
disappearance, therefore,

1249
01:19:22,745 --> 01:19:24,570
is still inexplicable.

1250
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:27,898
The film and his tape recordings
may provide other clues,

1251
01:19:27,994 --> 01:19:31,253
but for the moment, this lonely yacht
without her lonely captain

1252
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,040
is not giving up any of her secrets.

1253
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:42,839
When the boat was brought
ashore in the Caribbean,

1254
01:19:42,935 --> 01:19:45,626
Crowhurst's press agent
Rodney Hallworth

1255
01:19:45,722 --> 01:19:47,255
was there to meet it.

1256
01:19:47,351 --> 01:19:49,626
I went into the captain's cabin,

1257
01:19:49,722 --> 01:19:52,280
and I remember saying to him that...

1258
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,255
"I don't suppose, Captain,
we'll ever know

1259
01:19:55,351 --> 01:19:59,125
the end of this saga,
this riddle?"

1260
01:19:59,221 --> 01:20:01,848
And I thought his face dropped a little

1261
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,154
and he said, "Well, I think
we do, Mr. Hallworth."

1262
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,970
And he led me over to his desk,

1263
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:09,490
he unlocked a drawer
and took out the logs.

1264
01:20:12,218 --> 01:20:14,840
We decided there and then

1265
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:17,560
that we would never tell anybody
for the rest of our lives

1266
01:20:17,656 --> 01:20:19,062
what had happened

1267
01:20:19,158 --> 01:20:21,782
in the last hours of Crowhurst's life.

1268
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:27,319
In fact,

1269
01:20:27,415 --> 01:20:29,242
Rodney Hallworth
had already sold the logbooks

1270
01:20:29,338 --> 01:20:31,351
to a London newspaper.

1271
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:33,333
And piece by piece,

1272
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:37,367
the truth of Donald Crowhurst's
voyage was uncovered.

1273
01:20:37,463 --> 01:20:40,568
Rodney Hallworth stumped
through the front door,

1274
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:43,477
and while I was sort of
staring in amazement

1275
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:45,402
he said, "Donald didn't
sail around the world

1276
01:20:45,498 --> 01:20:47,447
and he committed suicide."

1277
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:50,487
And I think that

1278
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:54,007
is the most appalling
thing to do to anyone.

1279
01:20:54,103 --> 01:20:57,144
I will never forget those words.

1280
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,993
But that was Hallworth.

1281
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:10,969
No one likes to be conned.

1282
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:13,591
We were sharp newspapermen

1283
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:16,280
and he conned us.

1284
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,262
Kippered us.

1285
01:21:18,357 --> 01:21:19,891
I felt like a kipper.

1286
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,174
For me, it's all one regret.

1287
01:21:29,269 --> 01:21:32,344
I never did speak to Clare again.

1288
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,266
I never could face her.

1289
01:21:34,362 --> 01:21:37,336
I felt I was party to it.
We were all party to it.

1290
01:21:37,432 --> 01:21:40,537
If only I had said,

1291
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:42,680
"Don't go, Donald. It's crazy."

1292
01:21:42,776 --> 01:21:44,759
I should have said that.

1293
01:21:44,855 --> 01:21:47,766
He made the wrong decisions.

1294
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:50,619
In a way, he turned
the initial difficulties

1295
01:21:50,715 --> 01:21:52,409
into something much worse...

1296
01:21:52,505 --> 01:21:55,409
into a disaster for himself
and for the rest of us.

1297
01:21:57,466 --> 01:21:59,478
But he was trying
to do the best he could

1298
01:21:59,574 --> 01:22:01,619
to get back to us.

1299
01:22:04,602 --> 01:22:08,825
And that's all he could do, really.

1300
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,823
Everything angered me at that time.

1301
01:22:12,919 --> 01:22:14,617
Anger just boiled over.

1302
01:22:14,713 --> 01:22:17,272
And I blamed everyone

1303
01:22:17,368 --> 01:22:19,094
and everything.

1304
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:22,936
I feel that I failed.

1305
01:22:23,032 --> 01:22:25,975
I didn't stop him from going

1306
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,043
and I didn't help him
when he needed it.

1307
01:22:32,763 --> 01:22:34,873
But people need to dream.

1308
01:22:34,968 --> 01:22:38,872
I think Donald needed that,

1309
01:22:38,968 --> 01:22:41,656
and he had a right to have it.

1310
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:48,119
The crowd criticized him.

1311
01:22:48,215 --> 01:22:51,321
The crowd mocked him.

1312
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:53,939
And I didn't want that to happen.

1313
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:03,192
When somebody has risked

1314
01:23:03,288 --> 01:23:05,498
and failed,

1315
01:23:05,593 --> 01:23:07,898
and when somebody has fallen

1316
01:23:07,994 --> 01:23:11,253
from the tightrope
they've been walking on,

1317
01:23:11,349 --> 01:23:14,231
somebody has to pick them up

1318
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:16,535
and give them a burial.

1319
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:22,232
The best thing is that
a friend should do that.

1320
01:23:23,995 --> 01:23:27,639
Don wanted to make
a success of his life.

1321
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,514
He just wanted to see

1322
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:34,902
a bright future for himself

1323
01:23:34,998 --> 01:23:36,945
and his family.

1324
01:23:42,299 --> 01:23:44,759
In my mind,

1325
01:23:44,855 --> 01:23:48,538
I gave him a hero's...

1326
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:50,427
burial.
