00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:00,914
This is London.

3
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:05,233
On days like these,
many in Norway may wonder

4
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,754
what the mood must be like
in England.

5
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:12,474
Are our nerves holding up,
or are we becoming discouraged?

6
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:16,074
Allow me to reply
with full conviction:

7
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,153
Our nerves are fine!

8
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,113
Our morale is far from weakened.

9
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:24,673
It is becoming stronger
with every passing day.

10
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:48,554
Sigurd, come here!

11
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,275
Fire!

12
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,916
On your knees!
Get down on your knees!

13
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,477
They haven't seen you yet.

14
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,077
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

15
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:13,757
I'll only ask you once,
and I advise you to answer:

16
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,156
What is your mission?

17
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,557
What is that?

18
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,917
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

19
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:33,238
Hey, there's a man over there!

20
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:36,277
He's getting away!
After him! Hurry!

21
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,678
Come on!

22
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,878
Footprints.

23
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,679
Over there.

24
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,879
He's gone.

25
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,601
Over there!

26
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:57,762
Move!

27
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,043
The water can't be more
than zero degrees.

28
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,763
He won't last long.

29
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,323
It's actually colder
than zero degrees, Colonel.

30
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,042
How so?

31
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:48,962
Because it's saltwater.

32
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,803
Hello?

33
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:37,365
Can you... help me?
Please.

34
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:45,044
I'm not dangerous.

35
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:08,766
I just need to get warm.
Then I'll leave.

36
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,646
If they come here,
tell them I forced you.

37
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,285
That I threatened to kill you.

38
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,006
They're looking for someone
on Rebbenesøy.

39
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:32,845
Yes.

40
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,485
But the girls picked you up
on Vårøya.

41
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:38,967
Yes.

42
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:44,007
So you swam
from Rebbenesøy to Vårøya?

43
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:46,926
Yes.

44
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,447
What happened to you?

45
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,487
I got shot.

46
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:10,167
It's okay.
I hardly feel anything.

47
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,527
Because you're frozen stiff.

48
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:15,367
Let me get you
some dry clothes and boots.

49
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:20,128
And wool underwear.
And socks.

50
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,967
No, he's my son!

51
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,607
Sorry.

52
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,488
What's the quickest way
to Tromsø?

53
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,208
Translate.

54
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:17,248
He's Norwegian.

55
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,048
It's getting hard
to keep our spirits up.

56
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,209
Come here!

57
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,650
We have this gentleman
to thank.

58
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,890
What's your name?

59
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,370
- Sørensen.
- Sørensen?

60
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,409
Excellent.

61
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,169
This is good.
Situation descriptions.

62
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,650
But part of it appears illegible.

63
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,330
"Festung Norwegen."

64
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,970
Not much "Norwegen" left.

65
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,210
- Eleven?
- Yes.

66
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,691
There are supposed to be twelve.

67
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,652
Where is the twelfth man?

68
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:47,012
The twelfth man?
We chased him into the fjord.

69
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,371
He never resurfaced.

70
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:50,532
I see.

71
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,652
And where is his body?

72
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:03,931
Like I said,
he never resurfaced.

73
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,971
How long did you wait?

74
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:13,812
No.
The water was below freezing.

75
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,853
And the ocean there,
you know...

76
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,773
It is deep and wide.

77
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:22,133
And he was injured.
He was bleeding.

78
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:25,172
And still you failed to catch him?

79
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,173
Why are you here,
Wenders?

80
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,132
What are your ambitions?

81
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:35,612
Have you seen this?

82
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,933
Ambition is rewarded.

83
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:44,812
In my entire career
I have never lost anyone.

84
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:48,134
Search every house in the area.

85
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:52,053
Focus on people
with medical knowledge.

86
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:55,054
Doctors.
Midwives.

87
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,333
Herr Sturmbannführer.

88
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,974
I cannot emphasize it enough.

89
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,333
The man is dead.

90
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,254
And I'm telling you,

91
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,613
until we find his body,
he's alive.

92
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:30,535
No one's ever swum that strait,
even in summertime.

93
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:36,895
- Tromsø is swarming with Germans.
- I still have to go there.

94
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:42,254
You trying to save the others?
The ones you came with?

95
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,975
Yes. And some
who haven't been caught yet.

96
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,574
Are we close?

97
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,614
We're almost there.

98
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,256
What will happen to us?

99
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:22,695
- They'll only send us to a camp, right?
- Don't worry about it.

100
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,256
It's impossible
not to worry about...

101
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,855
Shut up!

102
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:32,456
That doesn't help.

103
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:37,897
Bjørn.
It's okay to be afraid.

104
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,816
And now
it's your turn.

105
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:59,817
No! He hasn't done anything!
Leave the boy alone!

106
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,056
No!

107
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:05,936
Hey!

108
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,697
Right over there.

109
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,498
Thank you.

110
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,938
All for Norway.

111
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,218
All for Norway.

112
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,338
You startled me!

113
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,099
Sorry.

114
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,338
- I heard your husband could...
- No, he isn't here now.

115
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,099
Sorry.

116
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:01,938
Wait, let me look
at that foot of yours.

117
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:05,139
There.
That's the best I can do.

118
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,098
You need a doctor.

119
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,979
I have more urgent matters.

120
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,658
If you get gangrene,
nothing is more urgent.

121
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,859
If you see it turning red here,
get to a hospital.

122
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,020
Or you won't have many days left.

123
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,139
Where are you headed?

124
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,980
I have to get to Tromsø.

125
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,819
I thought I'd cross over here.

126
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,220
No, don't go that way.
Go to the Hansens at Karanes.

127
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,339
I delivered Margareth, their daughter.
They're good people.

128
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,580
Hurry!

129
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,461
She's a midwife.

130
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:13,821
We're looking for a runaway soldier.
Have you seen him?

131
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,180
No.
I've seen nothing.

132
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,900
Our apologies, ma'am.
Let's continue northward.

133
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,781
Thank you for your help.
Goodbye.

134
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,982
Onward!

135
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:52,821
- The briefcase?
- It's been helpful.

136
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,141
Operation Martin Red
was to strike

137
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:58,662
the control tower and seaplanes.

138
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:01,142
- Any news on the twelfth man?
- No.

139
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,423
But we found the names
of two local contacts here in Tromsø.

140
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,662
Bring them in.

141
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,582
- Any news?
- Be patient.

142
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,382
I'm trying something new here.

143
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:20,743
Hey!
You're supposed to feel the pain.

144
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:24,182
What a waste of time!

145
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,983
But nobody's asking me,
of course.

146
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:34,822
Tell me where he is.

147
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:53,864
Do I really need to remind you
that Heinrich Himmler,

148
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,264
Reichsführer of the SS,

149
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:58,463
is expecting a report from us?

150
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:03,704
Herr Wenders, a man can easily survive
twenty minutes in ice water.

151
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:09,343
He may experience hypothermia.
But his heart will be beating.

152
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:14,144
He will be able to move.
His brain will still function.

153
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:19,265
And that means
the twelfth man is not dead.

154
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,265
Damn!

155
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,225
Security Police!
Open up!

156
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,584
Come with me.
Don't try to resist.

157
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,265
Come on!

158
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:33,187
He's too frail.
Get me another.

159
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,627
Get in!

160
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:07,468
Keep going.
Keep going!

161
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,707
Down!

162
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,908
I need someone stronger.

163
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,348
Damn it!

164
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,110
Shit!

165
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:46,952
Who the hell are you?
Margareth, go inside.

166
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,952
- Don't shoot.
- Who are you?

167
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,591
Is this Karanes?

168
00:24:55,993 --> 00:25:00,312
The Germans claimed victory.
Said they caught all twelve.

169
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:03,872
- There were twelve of you, right?
- Yes.

170
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:08,592
I'm not stupid.
I heard the rumors.

171
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:10,352
Something didn't make sense.

172
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,392
So I asked them:
If you caught all of them,

173
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,713
why are you still searching?

174
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,112
Now I know why.

175
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:22,393
- Did they mention the others?
- No.

176
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,832
I just heard they were caught.

177
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:29,273
Most were imprisoned.
A few are in the hospital.

178
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:34,433
Ragnhild helps out there sometimes.
She knows some of the nurses.

179
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,914
And?

180
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,674
I'll fill you in later.

181
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:14,555
Are you a soldier?

182
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:20,035
No, not really.
I'm an instrument maker.

183
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:23,915
Do you make pianos?

184
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:29,874
No, I make instruments
that you can use to draw maps.

185
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:33,755
Understand?

186
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,674
So I draw maps.

187
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:43,355
And once I rode my bike
from Sweden to Norway.

188
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:46,635
To draw a map of an airport.

189
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,155
But when I returned to Sweden,

190
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:54,276
a policeman said I was
no longer allowed to draw maps.

191
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:56,755
So I had to leave Sweden.

192
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:03,435
Then I went to Russia,
the Ukraine, Turkey,

193
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:07,195
India, Kenya,
and South Africa.

194
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,756
And then...

195
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:15,595
...I took a boat over to Brazil.
And went up to Trinidad,

196
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:18,637
the United States,
and Canada.

197
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:23,997
And then I took another boat.
To England.

198
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,717
And finally I came to Shetland.

199
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,356
Where I met my friends.

200
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,517
And then I came here.

201
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,477
Why didn't you go to Australia?

202
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:41,917
You sure know your geography.

203
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:46,276
A bookworm.
She loves geography.

204
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:50,757
Farm work, not so much.

205
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:58,077
Are you ready to go?

206
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,397
Tell me what you know.

207
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:04,398
All I know is what I heard
at the hospital.

208
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:05,278
Which is?

209
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:08,558
There have been mass arrests.

210
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:12,077
The Germans
found your secret documents.

211
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:14,238
And the men I came over with?

212
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:17,157
I heard about one man
called Sigurd.

213
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:21,998
They say he was tortured
to death.

214
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:28,999
But another one, Erik Reichelt,
is still alive.

215
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,878
He's in the hospital.

216
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,519
And the others?

217
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,838
They're being executed.
Tonight.

218
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,521
Here you go.

219
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:54,360
Wow.

220
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,801
This is my entire life.

221
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,761
I'm going to take good care of this.

222
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,041
What are you looking at?

223
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,722
Have the Germans stolen
our northern lights?

224
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:21,002
No, that's not possible.

225
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,321
My mother used to say
if you can see the northern lights,

226
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,282
you're never far from home.

227
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:32,762
If you like the northern lights,
you can hide here with us.

228
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,962
We have lots of northern lights
and lots of good hiding places.

229
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:53,483
My God!
What have they done to you?

230
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:58,563
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say anything!

231
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:02,403
No, I believe you.
I believe you.

232
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,362
They haven't found him.
The man who was with you.

233
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:10,203
They haven't found him.

234
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:12,643
He's still alive.

235
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,322
He's alive.

236
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,883
I have a wife.

237
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,724
And a daughter.

238
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:30,524
Give them my best.

239
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,204
I need to go.

240
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:20,485
How can I help save our country
if I'm in hiding?

241
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,725
Are you going to Tromsø?

242
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:33,045
No.
It's too late.

243
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:36,406
I'm going to Sweden.

244
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,845
Why?

245
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,966
Because Sweden is what we call
a neutral country.

246
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:45,806
I'll be safe there.

247
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,806
That's good.

248
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:51,125
Since you're so good with maps,

249
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,845
maybe you can show me
where Sweden is?

250
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,526
We are there.

251
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:06,126
And there... is Sweden.

252
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,726
That's a long way.

253
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:20,967
All the prisoners out!
Faster!

254
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:27,886
You disappoint me.
None of them talked.

255
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,767
One was promising,
but he died on me.

256
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,806
Well, well.
What can you do?

257
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:42,486
Maybe they didn't talk
because there's nothing to say.

258
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:45,727
Because your man is dead.

259
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:49,647
I was contacted
by the Reich Main Security Office.

260
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:53,247
They are waiting for a report.

261
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,808
No.
Not until I am sure.

262
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,127
Fine.

263
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,888
Keep moving!

264
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,687
Know what I think?

265
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:22,008
I think you are chasing a ghost.

266
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,809
There is no trace of him.

267
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:30,368
We have searched
every farm and house.

268
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:36,448
We have spoken with every person

269
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:40,049
who could have known anything.

273

274
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,210
Want to go to the Eastern Front?

275
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,169
Himmler will read that report.

276
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:16,689
And what Himmler reads,
Hitler reads.

277
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,609
You don't want to lie to Hitler,
do you?

We've been expecting you.

281
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:58,134
Jan Baalsrud.

282
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:06,535
We're almost there.

283
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,495
- Good.
- Here. Size 42.

284
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:12,214
How did you know?

285
00:38:12,294 --> 00:38:15,575
A tiny fellow like you?
They were the smallest I could find.

286
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:16,535
Thank you.

287
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:19,495
Peder.

288
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:21,854
Peder.

289
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,416
Here, take this backpack.

290
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,416
Some food and extra clothes
for your trip.

291
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:58,655
You need to hide your uniform
when you get to Lyngseidet.

292
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,896
- And here are my skis.
- I can't take your skis.

293
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:06,096
I can't keep them.
I'd never forgive myself.

294
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:09,817
Okay.
Let's go over the plan again.

295
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,656
- I'm going to Sweden.
- Right.

296
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:16,616
Then to England.
Then change socks.

297
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:19,216
And come right back here.

298
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:22,337
Okay.
Look at this.

299
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,377
Here is Lyngseidet.

300
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:28,497
It's an important hub.
Full of Germans.

301
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,497
But you can't get around it.

302
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,696
The mountains are too steep
on both sides.

303
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:36,776
They're mostly searching
along the coast.

304
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:40,378
They won't expect to see you
in Lyngseidet.

305
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:45,737
Look.
That is Kurt Stage.

306
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:50,858
He heads the Gestapo up here.
We think he knows you're alive.

307
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:56,097
They say no one
has escaped him before.

308
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:59,298
So for him, this is personal.

309
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:02,658
He'll never let a saboteur
like you get away.

310
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:07,458
If you make it over to Sweden,
it will be a crushing defeat for him.

311
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,219
Type this up and send it
to Berlin immediately.

312
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,539
Yes, sir.

313
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:05,859
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.

314
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,419
Excellent.

315
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:13,899
- Thank you.
- Sure.

316
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,901
This is as close as we can get.

317
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,300
I can wade ashore.

318
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,941
You'd never get dry again.
You'd die.

319
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,940
Give me those skis.

320
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:53,501
Now you.

321
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:55,780
No.

322
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,741
Come on.

323
00:41:58,021 --> 00:42:00,701
Wait. There.

324
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,982
Now you look like
a real Northerner.

325
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:07,462
There's a boat waiting
on the other side.

326
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:10,261
Just leave it adrift.

327
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:13,422
So no one knows
where you go ashore.

328
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:17,262
Once you cross the mountain
you'll reach the border.

329
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:22,502
If the weather holds up,
it should take two or three days.

330
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:27,261
At least you have skis now.
So you stand a chance.

331
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,102
Good luck.

332
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:48,823
To the commander in chief
of the SS and police in Norway.

333
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:54,063
Provisional report
on the sabotage cutter Brattholm.

334
00:42:54,142 --> 00:42:57,622
On March 29, 1943,

335
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:01,142
units from the Navy and Abwehr

336
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:04,742
detained a fishing boat
with Norwegian saboteurs

337
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:08,342
who had been trained
in Great Britain.

338
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:11,823
There were twelve saboteurs
on board.

339
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:15,464
Ten were arrested and interrogated.

340
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:19,143
And according to the Führer's orders
of October 18,

341
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,423
they were promptly executed.

342
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:26,743
One saboteur was killed on site.

343
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,703
The final man was last observed

344
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,984
swimming in a Norwegian fjord.

345
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:38,144
I have personally
made it a priority

346
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:42,504
to thoroughly investigate
and establish with certainty...

347
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,704
that he could not have survived
in these Arctic waters.

348
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:03,467
Hey!
Hey, you!

349
00:45:13,306 --> 00:45:15,426
I thought Norwegians
knew how to ski.

350
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:24,987
Thank you.

351
00:48:58,232 --> 00:49:02,752
I followed his tracks
straight into the avalanche.

352
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,433
I lost him... here.

353
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:09,113
Are you sure?
Wenders here thinks he's a ghost.

354
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:14,393
If he survived, there are three ways
down from the mountain.

355
00:49:14,474 --> 00:49:17,713
Here, here and here.

356
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:23,113
I am quite sure it was him.
And that he may be alive.

357
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:31,994
Don't just stand here.
Get out!

358
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:44,515
- Did you send that report?
- Of course. Immediately, sir.

359
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,075
Excellent.
I just wanted to be sure.

360
00:51:27,757 --> 00:51:29,558
Broken skis.

361
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,837
What is that?

362
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,397
A backpack.

363
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:51,358
Hey!
Hello?

364
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:57,078
Can you hear me?
Baalsrud?

365
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:00,879
Race you to those rocks?

366
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:05,158
I'm not up for that... right now.

367
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:08,118
- Please leave.
- Feeling sorry for yourself?

368
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:09,678
Come on!

369
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:11,599
Be quiet.

370
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:14,358
I am quiet.
You're the one talking.

371
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:18,599
Come on.
Ready... set ... go!

372
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,602
Marius Grønvoll?

373
00:53:47,482 --> 00:53:49,201
Marius Grønvoll?

374
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:54,522
Seen anything suspicious lately?

375
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:56,082
No.

376
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,641
No suspicious people?

377
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,281
- Good.
- I was wondering...

378
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:09,201
I was wondering...

379
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:11,762
How do you become
a Nazi sympathizer?

380
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:15,882
They don't admit just anyone.

381
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:18,201
No, that's true.

382
00:54:20,002 --> 00:54:23,202
You must have
real faith in your cause?

383
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:25,162
Yes.

384
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:29,443
That patch
on your arm.

385
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,483
Are you proud of it?

386
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:39,202
How you get one of those,
do you just put your name on a list,

387
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:40,962
or do you actually
have to accomplish something?

388
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:46,722
We have checked everywhere.

389
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,642
The man we are looking for
is around 1.75 meters.

390
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:56,244
Dark hair.

391
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:59,523
Most likely wearing
a Norwegian uniform.

392
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:02,204
And he walks with a limp.

393
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,084
Okay.

394
00:55:05,323 --> 00:55:08,203
To help, hide,
or in any way assist

395
00:55:08,283 --> 00:55:11,643
an enemy of the Third Reich
is punishable by death.

396
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,683
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

397
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:19,963
Right. Good.

398
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:25,203
We're done here.
Let's go.

399
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:29,723
We need to keep looking.
On to the next farm.

400
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:01,244
Yes, one more bite.

401
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:33,926
Ottar, get out!

402
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:36,086
If anyone comes,
anyone at all, let us know.

403
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:37,966
Come. Here.

404
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,286
- We have to get these off.
- We have to get his circulation going.

405
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:49,007
Do you know who this is?

406
00:56:50,087 --> 00:56:51,087
Yes.

407
00:56:54,726 --> 00:56:56,886
Get all our bandages,
woolen underwear, and blankets.

408
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:01,126
Hanna!

409
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:05,646
Hey... you'll be fine.

410
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:09,206
Everything will be okay.
You're safe here.

411
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:14,846
I followed his tracks all the way up
to the avalanche.

412
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,968
- The avalanche?
-The one from three days ago?

413
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:19,488
Yes.

414
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:25,968
There are posters everywhere.
We can be shot on sight.

415
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:27,048
We know that.

416
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:28,847
They'll burn our house
to the ground.

417
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:31,368
Like in Telavåg.
They torched everything.

418
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:36,768
His feet.
You saw them.

419
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:38,928
He needs a doctor.

420
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,767
- And Ottar...
- We can't call a doctor now.

421
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,247
It's too dangerous.

422
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:47,848
Why risk our lives
for a man dying of gangrene?

423
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,568
- He could die at any moment.
- We won't let him.

424
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,649
We'll help him.

425
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:54,408
Use mother's ointments.
Do everything we can.

426
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:58,168
What if it was me?
If that was me in there?

427
00:57:58,248 --> 00:57:59,648
Hanna.

428
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:02,449
This is how we prove who we are
and what we believe in.

429
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:08,609
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

430
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:13,288
Ottar has kept guard for six hours.
I'll relieve him.

431
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,248
He won't be walking anytime soon.

432
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,410
We found something.

433
00:58:36,689 --> 00:58:38,010
Come here.

434
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,890
Obersturmbannführer?

435
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,850
Sorry to interrupt,
but you need to see this.

436
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:49,849
We found it in the avalanche.
Above Grønvoll farm.

437
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,810
Give me that.

438
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,170
We found this hat
in the same area.

439
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:32,891
Easy, easy. Careful. Here.
Take this.

440
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:36,331
There.
Lie back down.

441
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,211
I told you I'd be here
when you woke up.

442
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:14,372
I've changed your clothes.
And bathed you.

443
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,732
You got Marius' underwear.

444
01:00:21,332 --> 01:00:24,052
Marius?
Is he your husband?

445
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:27,132
No.
He's my brother.

446
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:33,772
Who are you?

447
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,172
Gudrun.

448
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:39,172
Gudrun?

449
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:43,132
- What was that?
- Just the animals.

450
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:48,532
I never used to be this jumpy.

451
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:50,693
Me neither.

452
01:00:54,094 --> 01:00:56,733
- Where is my uniform?
- I have washed it.

453
01:00:58,853 --> 01:01:02,213
Did you find a map,
or a drawing?

454
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:03,933
No.

455
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:12,454
How are your eyes?

456
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:18,054
Much better.

457
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:23,014
And your name is Jan.
Jan Baalsrud.

458
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:26,934
You were talking in your sleep.

459
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:31,534
Did I say anything else?

460
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:36,095
Yes, you said a lot.

461
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:38,294
Sorry.

462
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:43,334
I have vital information
the Germans must never get.

463
01:01:43,415 --> 01:01:46,215
It would be better
if you didn't know anything.

464
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:52,895
Bombay.

465
01:01:56,854 --> 01:01:58,334
In India?

466
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,135
Have you been there?

467
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:02,976
Yes.

468
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:07,135
You talked about the elephants.
And birds.

469
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,775
And you talked about...

470
01:02:10,016 --> 01:02:13,096
About dancing in London.

471
01:02:20,456 --> 01:02:23,016
And you called out.

472
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:27,616
For someone named Per.

473
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:31,895
Sigurd.

474
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:37,017
Erik.
And a lot for Gabriel.

475
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:46,296
Listen...

476
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:53,656
There's a reason
you've survived, Jan.

477
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:57,296
There's a reason for all this.

478
01:03:04,776 --> 01:03:07,496
- Who is that?
- Don't move.

479
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:09,216
Where is my gun?

480
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,137
- I've ruined everything for you.
- Not a sound!

481
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:31,498
Everyone out!

482
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,777
We have been here twice before.

483
01:03:44,257 --> 01:03:46,579
We found nothing.

484
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,779
You.
What's your name, son?

485
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,060
No-- No German.

486
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:34,139
I am... not so
good at Norwegian.

487
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,500
Have you seen the soldier?

488
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:48,500
- Thank you.
- Candy.

489
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:51,459
Good?

490
01:06:43,223 --> 01:06:46,423
We have three more farms
to search before dark.

491
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:50,864
Before dark?
You're funny.

492
01:07:06,104 --> 01:07:08,143
Let's get you out of here.

493
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:10,863
- Watch his foot.
- Careful!

494
01:07:11,783 --> 01:07:13,624
There's a cabin on the other side
of the fjord.

495
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:19,184
You'll be safe there until we find
a way to get you to Sweden.

496
01:07:20,505 --> 01:07:21,545
Pull!

497
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:24,784
Careful!

498
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:34,505
Pull!

499
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,424
Come on!
You'll be fine.

500
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:38,505
Quiet!

501
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,025
- Halt!
- What?

502
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,025
Come back here!

503
01:07:57,105 --> 01:08:00,545
I know someone in there.

504
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:09,028
Potato.
Here's something to keep you warm.

505
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:14,747
And here's my knife.

506
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:17,347
Don't lose it.

507
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:21,028
This is better than the Savoy Hotel.

508
01:09:21,268 --> 01:09:22,628
What?

509
01:09:23,987 --> 01:09:27,427
The best hotel in London.
But it can't compare to this.

510
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:32,787
Marius, we have to head back before
someone notices we're gone.

511
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:34,307
Yes.

512
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:39,268
It encourages people
that the Germans haven't found you.

513
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:44,349
- I'll be back on my feet soon.
- Take your time.

514
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,748
You won't get kicked out
of the Savoy Hotel.

515
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:50,748
Comfortable?

516
01:09:50,988 --> 01:09:52,228
Yes.

517
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,788
Your feet?

518
01:09:57,349 --> 01:09:58,909
Yes.

519
01:09:59,349 --> 01:10:02,589
Give me a couple of days, and I'll find
a way to get you across the border.

520
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:09,229
Savoy Hotel...

521
01:10:30,869 --> 01:10:33,149
One Esquire, please.

522
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:42,752
Nothing here.

523
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,512
Let's check the cellar.

524
01:13:03,194 --> 01:13:05,274
There are tracks in the snow.

525
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,035
Here he is!
We have him!

526
01:13:51,755 --> 01:13:54,115
Here he is!

527
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:02,325
Jan?

528
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:04,846
It's me.

529
01:20:05,206 --> 01:20:07,246
It's Marius.

530
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,685
I've found a way to get you
to Sweden.

531
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:16,926
That's good news.

532
01:20:33,846 --> 01:20:35,607
What happened here?

533
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:41,327
Gangrene.
It was eating its way up.

534
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:43,327
I had to stop it.

535
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:45,166
How does it feel now?

536
01:20:45,766 --> 01:20:47,726
It feels better.

537
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:53,008
Put him down here.

538
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:00,568
Okay!

539
01:21:09,767 --> 01:21:11,047
- Here.
- Thank you.

540
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,608
Here, it's cold.
Put this on.

541
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:21,648
And now this.

542
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:27,049
No, around there.
There.

543
01:21:27,128 --> 01:21:29,248
Move your hand.

544
01:21:31,048 --> 01:21:32,728
And pull!

545
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:34,569
The other one.

546
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:43,208
Give him that.

547
01:21:43,289 --> 01:21:45,809
Here.
Eat some of this.

548
01:21:45,888 --> 01:21:47,409
Thank you.

549
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:03,210
I think we got everything
out of there.

550
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,290
Except the smell.

551
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,969
You'll get plenty of fresh air
up in the mountains.

552
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:13,570
Someone from Manndalen
will meet us.

553
01:22:13,809 --> 01:22:15,849
They'll get you across the border.

554
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,610
Does this sled stop in Sweden?

555
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:22,170
We'll see.

556
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:26,729
Wait, wait.

557
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,930
Hold it there!

558
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:02,850
Can you turn the sled around?

559
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:05,690
Stop. Let's switch ropes.
Hold there.

560
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,331
- Okay, I've got him.
- Pull!

561
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:13,771
Come on.

562
01:23:16,051 --> 01:23:17,652
Plane!

563
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:43,452
He's passed out.
Turn him back around.

564
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:47,892
Pull!

565
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:15,853
I told them to meet us by the big rock.
We'll have to leave you here.

566
01:24:16,213 --> 01:24:20,213
We need to hurry back home.

567
01:24:20,733 --> 01:24:23,973
If they find me,
they'll find you too.

568
01:24:25,174 --> 01:24:26,774
It's okay.

569
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:30,853
This new sleeping bag
is dry and warm. I'll be fine.

570
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:34,693
The Manndalen boys
will be here soon.

571
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:37,813
They'll use the code word
"Hello, gentleman."

572
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:40,733
Gentleman?

573
01:24:41,053 --> 01:24:44,173
Yes.
We felt that suited you best.

574
01:24:47,133 --> 01:24:49,093
Focus on Sweden.

575
01:25:29,774 --> 01:25:32,015
Isn't it fascinating?

576
01:25:32,256 --> 01:25:36,256
Why don't they like us,
these Norwegians?

577
01:25:36,536 --> 01:25:38,895
And our fugitive...

578
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:42,216
He has turned
Operation Martin Red

579
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:44,735
into a complete success!

580
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:48,376
There.
See that?

581
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,176
Did you see that?
The monogram?

582
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,576
Their king.
Him they love.

583
01:25:56,656 --> 01:25:58,935
They're getting bolder by the day.

584
01:25:59,015 --> 01:26:02,455
The last thing we need now

585
01:26:02,536 --> 01:26:05,216
is for them to find a new symbol.

586
01:27:35,778 --> 01:27:37,738
Where do you think he is now?

587
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:43,098
I hope he's in Sweden
surrounded by cute, Swedish nurses.

588
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:48,058
So do I.

589
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,738
Do you?

590
01:27:52,138 --> 01:27:53,499
Marius Grønvoll?

591
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,300
That's me.

592
01:28:03,099 --> 01:28:06,179
- Where can we speak in private?
- Right here.

593
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:12,819
- Who are you?
- Better if you don't know.

594
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:15,019
Our gentleman
hasn't been found.

595
01:28:15,099 --> 01:28:18,419
We've searched
both day and night.

596
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:22,580
But... it's been four days.

597
01:28:23,059 --> 01:28:25,019
Why didn't you come sooner?

598
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:28,621
Just mark that stone
in Olmmaijarvi better and we'll find him.

599
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,180
- Where?
- Olmmaijarvi.

600
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,820
It wasn't Olmmaijarvi.
It was Olmmaivaggi.

601
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:40,820
I'll go mark the stone.

602
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,461
I'm coming with you.

603
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:47,621
- What about Hanna and Ottar?
- They'll be asleep.

604
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,421
- And the animals?
- I've fed them.

605
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:53,341
- What if the Germans come?
- Then you should be here.

606
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:54,740
- Ottar can talk to them.
- He's ten years old.

607
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,860
Hanna can talk to them.
I'm going.

608
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,940
You're too fond of him, Gudrun.

609
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:01,820
No.

610
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,221
We don't know what to expect.

611
01:29:04,622 --> 01:29:06,101
- If he's dead...
- He's not dead!

612
01:29:06,182 --> 01:29:08,662
If you lose it up there,
I don't know what I'll do.

613
01:29:08,741 --> 01:29:10,342
He isn't dead!

614
01:29:13,662 --> 01:29:15,141
I'm bringing Agnete.

615
01:29:17,182 --> 01:29:19,062
She has nursing experience.

616
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,022
Here!

617
01:30:06,862 --> 01:30:08,822
Hello, gentleman?

618
01:30:21,544 --> 01:30:26,023
Hey... it isn't your fault.

619
01:30:45,224 --> 01:30:47,264
Marius... Marius!

620
01:30:52,425 --> 01:30:55,345
What are you doing here?
Someone else was supposed to come.

621
01:30:55,425 --> 01:30:57,985
There was a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

622
01:30:58,064 --> 01:30:59,944
- I promise. Can you take over?
- Yes.

623
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:06,984
I'll go mark the spot.

624
01:31:08,585 --> 01:31:11,145
Warm soup.
Hope you like peas.

625
01:31:18,784 --> 01:31:20,744
Marius is a good man.

626
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:29,945
- When did you run out of food?
- I'm not out of food.

627
01:31:34,825 --> 01:31:38,825
Here. One lick for breakfast.
Dinner, one lick.

628
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:44,065
Supper.
And a little extra for the weekend.

629
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,226
Let me tell you something.

630
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,785
You're this close.
This close.

631
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:03,067
You've brought us hope.

632
01:32:05,746 --> 01:32:07,746
Give my best to Gudrun.

633
01:32:20,986 --> 01:32:23,066
He's alive.

634
01:32:25,826 --> 01:32:27,547
And he says hi.

635
01:32:51,987 --> 01:32:54,548
He's here.
Come!

636
01:32:54,628 --> 01:32:57,027
Hello... gentleman?

637
01:32:57,107 --> 01:32:59,547
- Marius?
- No. I'm Nigo.

638
01:32:59,628 --> 01:33:02,027
Me and these boys
are bringing you to Sweden.

639
01:33:02,268 --> 01:33:07,468
You must be lousy skiers,
since you took so long.

640
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:08,628
Had I known you were this skinny,

641
01:33:08,707 --> 01:33:10,549
I would have come alone
and carried you myself.

642
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:19,948
- We can't make it!
- Yes, we can!

643
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:22,549
We have to keep going!

644
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:06,670
Are we in Sweden?

645
01:34:06,749 --> 01:34:07,989
No.

646
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:11,510
We hit a blizzard
and had to turn back.

647
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:18,789
- Turn back?
- Yes.

648
01:34:21,471 --> 01:34:24,311
- You turned back?
- Just a few kilometers.

649
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:28,910
- Have we backtracked?
- We're in Manndalen.

650
01:34:31,671 --> 01:34:34,511
- You promised to take me to Sweden!
- And I will.

651
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,750
- You said you'd get me across the border.
- Listen!

652
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:40,511
- Why did you turn back?
-There was a blizzard!

653
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:42,351
I continued to the border
to scout our route.

654
01:34:42,431 --> 01:34:43,830
And it was good we turned back.

655
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,310
There are Germans everywhere.

656
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:52,790
There are so many guard posts,
each is within sight of the next.

657
01:34:56,272 --> 01:34:58,992
- Then there's no hope.
- Yes, there is!

658
01:35:00,392 --> 01:35:02,352
Look at me, Nigo.

659
01:35:03,272 --> 01:35:05,232
I'm skin and bones.

660
01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:10,432
It will be a miracle if I survive.
Do you understand that?

661
01:35:12,392 --> 01:35:16,392
That's why I'm going to help you.
Because we need a miracle.

662
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:50,993
Are you taking my gun?

663
01:35:51,072 --> 01:35:52,952
Yes, I think that's best.

664
01:35:54,513 --> 01:35:56,473
But I need to protect myself.

665
01:35:56,553 --> 01:35:58,792
Promise not to use it on yourself?

666
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:32,674
Get moving!

667
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:35,233
All hands on deck!

668
01:36:35,314 --> 01:36:37,274
Down!

669
01:36:37,354 --> 01:36:38,354
The briefcase!

670
01:36:38,434 --> 01:36:39,833
Hold the fuse.

671
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:11,434
It wouldn't light!

672
01:37:30,955 --> 01:37:32,235
Jan!

673
01:37:34,755 --> 01:37:36,596
Jan!

674
01:37:49,516 --> 01:37:51,116
Who are you?

675
01:37:51,755 --> 01:37:53,796
I'm Aslak Fossvoll.

676
01:37:54,357 --> 01:37:56,437
Eat your soup while it's warm.

677
01:37:57,116 --> 01:37:59,396
I brought you a fresh pair of socks.
You sure need them.

678
01:38:27,036 --> 01:38:28,717
See anything?

679
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:30,958
No.

680
01:38:31,997 --> 01:38:34,717
Don't tell me the Germans have stolen
our northern lights as well.

681
01:38:40,837 --> 01:38:42,518
Binoculars, Jan.

682
01:38:53,518 --> 01:38:55,278
Kill the engine.

683
01:39:00,198 --> 01:39:01,918
I found it.

684
01:39:03,838 --> 01:39:05,878
We are... here.

685
01:39:06,118 --> 01:39:09,158
- They are everywhere.
- Do we have a local contact?

686
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,998
Our mission
was to destroy strategic targets.

687
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:22,238
There were twelve of us.

688
01:39:25,519 --> 01:39:27,718
We had eight tons
of explosives on board.

689
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:33,718
But we couldn't land
where we first planned.

690
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:36,798
So we had to find a new contact.

691
01:39:39,759 --> 01:39:41,360
What's the contact's name?

692
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,320
Anaton Pedersen.

693
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,000
Anaton Pedersen?

694
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,480
He's dead.

695
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,879
And you are?

696
01:39:52,959 --> 01:39:55,480
Håkon.
Håkon Sørensen.

697
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,200
The information we had
was outdated.

698
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:07,479
And the person we talked to
couldn't be trusted.

699
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,280
Get me the police.

700
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:13,120
Start the engine!
Start the engine!

701
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,721
When we returned,

702
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:19,040
we had no time
before we were discovered.

703
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,120
Then everything fell apart.

704
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:43,440
We had a briefcase
full of information.

705
01:40:43,521 --> 01:40:44,760
Get going!

706
01:40:46,601 --> 01:40:49,041
We tried to destroy the evidence.

707
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,321
I was the last man overboard.

708
01:40:57,562 --> 01:40:58,921
They took everyone.

709
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,362
I was the only one who got away.

710
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:09,081
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

711
01:41:11,881 --> 01:41:14,361
Everyone who helps me...

712
01:41:17,121 --> 01:41:18,721
is risking their life.

713
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:24,962
I don't know if anyone
has been killed because of me.

714
01:41:28,483 --> 01:41:33,403
The worst part is not knowing.

715
01:41:47,203 --> 01:41:52,563
These men have battled
in the trenches for months.

716
01:41:52,643 --> 01:41:56,163
And they continue fighting
to defeat the enemy.

717
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:59,564
Giving everything
for the fatherland.

718
01:41:59,644 --> 01:42:03,883
The bloodthirsty Soviets
have met their match.

719
01:42:04,883 --> 01:42:07,803
In Norway,
a successful operation

720
01:42:07,883 --> 01:42:11,484
led by Lieutenant Colonel
Kurt Stage,

721
01:42:11,564 --> 01:42:14,444
intercepted a fishing vessel.

722
01:42:15,163 --> 01:42:19,323
Stage reports that twelve saboteurs
were captured.

723
01:42:19,564 --> 01:42:23,484
And that the operation
was a complete German success.

724
01:42:39,124 --> 01:42:40,484
Damn it!

725
01:42:50,245 --> 01:42:51,525
What is this?

726
01:42:53,044 --> 01:42:54,844
Halt!

727
01:43:56,846 --> 01:44:00,607
This is London, transmitting
on a 1,500-meter long wave,

728
01:44:00,687 --> 01:44:04,287
one wave at 19 meters,
two at 31 meters,

729
01:44:04,367 --> 01:44:06,527
and one at 41 meters.

730
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:10,886
I sit by this microphone
not to report accidents,

731
01:44:10,966 --> 01:44:15,046
but to bring greetings
to all compatriots listening.

732
01:44:15,126 --> 01:44:18,366
I make myself the spokesman
for everything we achieve together.

733
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:22,727
And I hope every listener
at this moment

734
01:44:22,807 --> 01:44:25,927
feels how strong every man's heart

735
01:44:26,288 --> 01:44:28,608
is beating along with his own.

736
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:33,488
Someone was just here.

737
01:44:33,887 --> 01:44:36,367
No one's been here for two days.

738
01:44:46,488 --> 01:44:48,847
We still can't move him.

739
01:44:49,288 --> 01:44:51,368
This doesn't look good.

740
01:45:12,008 --> 01:45:14,248
Have you lost the map?

741
01:45:17,928 --> 01:45:20,649
I know you'll find your way.

742
01:45:24,449 --> 01:45:27,449
Make sure this wasn't all in vain.

743
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:34,930
- Congratulations!
- Today is a special day.

744
01:45:35,009 --> 01:45:40,009
Happy Constitution Day.
Hooray for Norway.

745
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:50,729
May 17.
And no aquavit?

746
01:45:57,490 --> 01:46:00,969
The eggs are from Olaf.

747
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:05,450
And the syrup is from Ludvig.
The cream is from Peder.

748
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:08,930
Even though the Germans
have raided his place four times lately.

749
01:46:10,691 --> 01:46:12,651
And Signe baked it.

750
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:17,011
Their eight-year old
made the flag for you.

751
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,611
Happy 17th of May, Jan.

752
01:46:20,411 --> 01:46:23,091
God bless our dear fatherland.

753
01:46:26,571 --> 01:46:29,251
- Is the snow melting?
- Yes.

754
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:37,651
Then how will you pull me
across on a sled?

755
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,930
We aren't sure
you're strong enough, Jan.

756
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:46,731
I'm sure.

757
01:46:48,532 --> 01:46:50,731
This isn't about me anymore.

758
01:47:10,811 --> 01:47:15,532
These Northerners are useless.
But the Sami are even worse.

759
01:47:20,413 --> 01:47:23,053
May I ask what
you were talking about?

760
01:47:23,132 --> 01:47:25,492
Yes, you may.

761
01:47:27,373 --> 01:47:29,053
What were you talking about?

762
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:34,852
He asked when the snow
normally melts on the plateau.

763
01:47:34,932 --> 01:47:36,412
And you told him?

764
01:47:36,493 --> 01:47:39,852
I told him the truth.

765
01:47:40,613 --> 01:47:41,852
Which is?

766
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:47,933
Only the gods know.

767
01:47:48,972 --> 01:47:53,773
But I'd move him pretty soon
if I were you.

768
01:47:54,053 --> 01:47:56,654
I know for a fact this snow

769
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:59,453
isn't going to last.

770
01:48:00,374 --> 01:48:03,014
The Baal brothers
are moving their herd

771
01:48:03,093 --> 01:48:06,773
across the border
in a few days.

772
01:48:27,774 --> 01:48:29,575
My name is Aslak Baal.

773
01:48:29,655 --> 01:48:31,615
Jan Baalsrud.

774
01:48:31,695 --> 01:48:34,014
There's still one bullet left.

775
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:37,454
Sorry I lost my temper.

776
01:48:37,535 --> 01:48:39,415
Good to see you're human too.

777
01:48:44,134 --> 01:48:46,214
You need to go.

778
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:54,054
Marius, you know that kerchief
mother gave me?

779
01:48:55,415 --> 01:48:57,375
I gave it to Jan.

780
01:48:58,375 --> 01:49:00,814
Did you check that nothing
was left behind?

781
01:49:02,695 --> 01:49:04,496
Did you check?

782
01:49:04,576 --> 01:49:08,935
I was focused on Jan.
I don't know if anything was left.

783
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,855
- Why is that so important?
- It has my initials on it!

784
01:49:43,056 --> 01:49:48,456
How do you intend to hide
a fugitive like me in broad daylight?

785
01:49:52,537 --> 01:49:54,417
We have a plan.

786
01:50:13,777 --> 01:50:15,418
Once near the border,

787
01:50:15,498 --> 01:50:18,578
I'll go ahead and steer the herd
in the right direction.

788
01:50:22,017 --> 01:50:26,538
We'll give you our strongest animal.
One that knows the route well.

789
01:50:29,658 --> 01:50:32,218
It won't give up
until you're across.

790
01:50:36,258 --> 01:50:40,378
If things go wrong
and they capture me,

791
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:43,618
I'd rather die
by a Norwegian bullet.

792
01:50:46,658 --> 01:50:48,298
Deal.

793
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,420
Guard change!

794
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:58,460
He seems to have spent weeks
in this cabin.

795
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,740
We found leftover food.

796
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,860
Fuel and candles.
We have long suspected this.

797
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,980
We think he stayed here a while.

798
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:13,100
Ready? The border is coming up.
Not far to go now!

799
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:06,981
Is this yours?

800
01:53:10,623 --> 01:53:14,183
Answer the question!
Is that your toe?

801
01:53:46,823 --> 01:53:48,384
I want to know where he is!

802
01:55:17,185 --> 01:55:19,905
Careful!
He may be armed.

803
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,467
Stop!

804
01:55:45,627 --> 01:55:46,627
This is Guard Tower 6.

805
01:55:54,227 --> 01:55:56,147
Yes, what is it?

806
01:56:33,067 --> 01:56:35,387
There's a reason for this.

807
01:56:37,107 --> 01:56:40,147
There's a reason
you've survived, Jan.

808
01:58:21,311 --> 01:58:23,311
What?

809
01:59:52,434 --> 01:59:54,634
Jan.
It's over now.

810
02:00:00,474 --> 02:00:02,234
You can let go, Jan.

811
02:00:04,314 --> 02:00:06,354
It's over now.

812
02:00:07,753 --> 02:00:10,033
You're safe.

813
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,715
You can let go.

814
02:02:26,638 --> 02:02:30,077
Listen.
Don't be afraid.

815
02:02:33,518 --> 02:02:35,838
We'll put an end
to this madness.

816
