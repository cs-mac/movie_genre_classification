- Welcome to ACT UP!

11
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,800
We are the AIDS Coalition 
 to Unleash Power,

12
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,470
a diverse, nonpartisan 
 group of individuals

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,810
united in anger

14
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,150
and committed to direct action 
 to...

crowd: End the AIDS crisis!

16
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,820
- Less than 12 hours 
 from now,

17
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,820
we are going to be taking over 
 city hall!

18
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,330
[applause] 
 all: Act up!

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,700
Fight back! 
 Fight AIDS!

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,700
- Yes?

21
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,960
- Mr. Mayor, in campaigning

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,730
for the lesbian and gay vote 
 in an election year,

23
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,570
a bit of historical context 
 is necessary

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,830
in dealing with the AIDS crisis 
 in New York City.

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,340
It wasn't until 1983 
 that you met with people

26
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,740
to deal with 
 the AIDS crisis.

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,300
How do you respond 
 to these criticisms?

28
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,680
- That is a falsehood.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,180
- Please, anybody who's 
 thinking about being arrested,

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,840
fill out a support sheet.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,510
Make sure that 
 your support person

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,850
knows who you are 
 and what group you're in.

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,320
Yeah?

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,350
- If we end up in the Tombs,

35
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,420
is there, like, 
 a queer tank there,

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,590
and would you recommend 
 that we ask to be there?

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,860
- There is a homo-tank, 
 and I've been there.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
And it's better 
 than the straight tank,

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
Iet me tell you.

40
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,000
- Who else? 
 Yes?

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
- In the past, you've described 
 ACT UP as fascist.

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,370
Yet in the press release,

43
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,210
you called them 
 "concerned citizens,"

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,210
and I was wondering 
 what changed your mind.

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,870
- I don't think 
 that you can't use both.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,210
Fascists can be 
 concerned citizens.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,880
And I don't believe 
 they are fascists.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,410
I think they have used 
 a fascist tactic.

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,390
- Let us celebrate together 
 tonight

50
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,730
the end of the last day

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,630
on which Ed Koch 
 can tell himself

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,720
that the communities

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,890
which are being decimated 
 by this epidemic

54
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,230
are so weak and so divided 
 among themselves,

55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,240
that he can keep serving us 
 this kind of bullshit.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Tomorrow morning, he will begin 
 to learn the truth!

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,750

- We're talking to Jim Eigo

69
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,630
from the Treatment lssues 
 Committee in ACT UP.

70
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,530
Jim, what specific 
 treatment issues

71
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,690
are being brought into 
 this demonstration this week?

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,970
- The municipal hospitals 
 are totally falling apart.

73
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,130
More than half the people

74
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,140
who get diagnosed 
 with AIDS today

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,170
get diagnosed in 
 the emergency rooms of our city.

76
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,370
You're going to find yourself

77
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,310
waiting four days 
 in an emergency room

78
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,650
before you get a bed.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
- Pretty scared,

80
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,720
but being HlV-positive,

81
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,240
I don't have much choice 
 in the matter.

82
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,650
- I just love 
 all these people,

83
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,820
and I think that what 
 we're doing is really right.

84
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,320
And, I mean, listen to this, 
 and look at all the people.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,830
It's just really wonderful,

86
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,830
and it's worth putting yourself 
 on the line for.

87
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,160
- There is no 
 accurate diagnosis.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
There are incentives 
 in the city hospitals

89
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,010
not to diagnose people 
 with AIDS.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,510
And therefore, 
 people don't get treated.

91
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,510
We are angry 
 at the way this city

92
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,010
has handled this crisis,

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,340
and we demand that Ed Koch 
 exert leadership

94
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,680
and declare 
 a state of emergency.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,850
[cheering]

96
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,290
- Go in the street now 
 or wait;

97
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,690
those are the options.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,690
One, he says go.

99
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,690
- Two now.

100
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,190
- Says "now." 
 Three.

101
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,130
Tom? 
 "Go now," Tom says.

102
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,030
- We're standing here 
 with Larry Kramer.

103
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,620
What is ACT UP 
 trying to say today to Ed Koch?

104
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,530
- We're sending a message 
 to public officials,

105
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,200
to closeted public officials,

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,210
that we won't be shat on 
 anymore

107
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,900
and obviously 
 all the AIDS issues.

108
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,340
- I would love to see, like, 
 more cameras or something,

109
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,240
you know, 
 for our own protection.

110
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,470
- Did everyone hear his concern?

111
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,540
- People die every day.

112
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,310
Friends get sick every day.

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,210
I don't...  
 It's like being in the trenches.

114
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,150
There's such anger 
 in the community,

115
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,210
and it is coalescing 
 in a way

116
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,220
that has never been done 
 before.

117
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,230
- Okay, which way do we face, 
 girlfriends,

118
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,160
this way or that way?

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,240
As difficult 
 as the time is for us,

166
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,690
I... l like being alive.

167
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,520
And I love my friends,

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,030
and I love my family.

169
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,690
I love the people around me.

170
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,360
- I'm going to die from this.

171
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,530
This isn't going to be cured

172
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,700
for years and years 
 and years.

173
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,970
- Doctor's office.

174
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,770
- Hi, it's Peter Staley.

175
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,140
It's like living in a war.

176
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,540
All around me, 
 friends are dropping dead,

177
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,640
and you're scared 
 for your own life

178
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,980
all at the same time.

179
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,540
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

180
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,890
I was diagnosed 
 with AIDS-related complex

181
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,380
while I was working 
 as a bond trader on Wall Street.

182
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,990
I had night sweats.

183
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,900
I began to get dry, patchy, 
 scaly, itchy skin on my face.

184
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,060
And I would get sick 
 constantly.

185
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,440
Colds would lay me up 
 for weeks.

186
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,240
I started to look around 
 in desperation

187
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,240
for ways that 
 I could find treatments

188
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,910
to help save my life.

189
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,750
Um...

190
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,920
And there was nothing coming out 
 of our government's efforts,

191
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,650
I quickly realized.

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
Everything I read

193
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,600
said I had about two years 
 to live,

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,930
at most.

195
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,940
- What do we want?

196
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,940
crowd: A cure!

197
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,270
- When do we want it?

198
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,270
crowd: Now!

199
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,430
- What do we want?

200
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
crowd: A cure!

201
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
- When do we want it?

202
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,870
crowd: Now!

203
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,880
- What do we want?

204
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,880
crowd: A cure!

205
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,880
- When do we want it?

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,900
crowd: Now!

207
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,080
- I was on my way to work,

208
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,950
and I got handed a flyer 
 about ACT UP and AIDS.

209
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,790
My mentor says, 
 "lf you ask me,

210
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,290
"l think they all deserve 
 to die

211
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,450
because they took it 
 up the butt."

212
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,460
I was deeply closeted,

213
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,160
and I had to just stew about it 
 for the rest of the day.

214
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,140
I got myself to the very next 
 ACT UP meeting.

215
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,470
They could just tap into that 
 immediate anger

216
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,670
and get stuff done.

217
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,640
We will not leave until 
 an administrator meets with us

218
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,650
and tells us 
 that St. Vincent's

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,480
is willing to make 
 a public statement

220
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,650
condemning gay and lesbian 
 violence.

221
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,680
[cheers and applause]

222
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,860
All those in favor?

223
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,830
All those opposed?

224
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,330
- They're coming!

225
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,840
You see them right there.

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
You've heard about ACT UP.

227
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,510
You've seen our flyers.

228
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,340
The kiss-in happens tonight.

229
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,350
Act up! 
 Fight back!

230
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,350
Make love! 
 Act up!

231
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,540
Whoo, whoo!

232
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,350
- I'll deal with the cameras... 

233
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,620
- Are you the security guard 
 that was beating people up?

234
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,990
- Out with the cameras.

235
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,020
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

236
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,530
- Members of the mainstream 
 media were thrown out,

237
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,040
as we were earlier on,

238
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,200
but Steve Zabel and l 
 came back in,

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,180
and we're bringing you 
 this exclusive footage.

240
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,440
- Don't destroy property! 
 You're destroying property.

241
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,450
- Well, actually you damaged 
 some human property last week.

242
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,500
- You damaged people.

243
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,850
- You will not 
 beat up on faggots,

244
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,410
and you will not 
 beat up on lesbians

245
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,320
in hospitals 
 in our own communities.

246
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
- Two gay women 
 were beaten up,

247
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,160
and when her lover 
 came to respond... 

248
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,390
you know the story.

249
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,330
And another story 
 was when two gay guys came here,

250
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
and one was sick with AIDS.

251
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,990
The security guard told him to, 
 "Get the fuck out of here"

252
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,330
and called him "faggot."

253
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,490
I think 
 if you're gonna work,

254
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,900
especially 
 in Greenwich Village,

255
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,770
you should have 
 some sensitivity training,

256
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,030
'cause we're not gonna have it.

257
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,560
- I'm willing to meet 
 with three people

258
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,630
if the rest of you leave.

259
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,230
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

260
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,900
- Okay, one at a time. 
 One at a time.

261
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,070
- It's unclear how to play it.

262
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,370
My own instinct would be 
 to say,

263
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,710
"We'll be glad 
 to meet with you.

264
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,880
And when the meeting's over, 
 we'll leave."

265
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,910
Not to leave 
 before the meeting takes place.

266
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,180
- Gregg?

267
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,780
- We've shown 
 the kind of power we can have

268
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,580
by immediate action, 
 by sticking together,

269
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,060
by reaching a consensus 
 together.

270
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,360
We should take this in steps, 
 and we should be coolheaded.

271
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,360
- I'm gonna take a straw poll, 
 okay?

272
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,660
And we agreed 
 to leave the waiting room

273
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,600
while he met with 
 three of our representatives... 

274
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,030
Gregg, Jerry, and Neil... 

275
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,040
in that public space 
 right there.

276
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,040
And then we would 
 stick around out here

277
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,100
and wait to see 
 what the outcome was.

278
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,440
- So I said, "Enough of this.

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,950
This job is gonna kill me."

280
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,280
So I went on disability

281
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,280
and decided to become 
 a full-time AIDS activist.

282
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,640
- In the beginning,

283
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
what drugs did we have?

284
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
We had nothing.

285
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,310
And the pneumonia 
 could come on like that

286
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,320
and be gone,

287
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,480
and a person is dead.

288
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,650
The skin lesions,

289
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,990
the Kaposi's sarcoma was...

290
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,000
People would be coming in 
 with a purple spot.

291
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,660
Everybody was coming in with,

292
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,720
"What is this spot?

293
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,100
What is that spot?"

294
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,000
You'd have some guys come in 
 with KS on their face,

295
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,830
and they'd be putting makeup 
 on their face.

296
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,000
And they'd be...  
 it was... 

297
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,840
And they were lucky

298
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,500
if it just stayed 
 in the skin,

299
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,010
if it didn't 
 go into their lungs.

300
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,480
And then if it 
 went into their lungs,

301
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,750
chemo didn't work, 
 and then they were gone.

302
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,580
You were grasping at straws 
 for everything,

303
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,080
because these are young, 
 vibrant people.

304
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,490
And all of a sudden, 
 they're being snatched.

305
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,890
I think everything 
 has to be put in perspective.

306
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,570
- Larry? 
 - Hello.

307
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,660
- [chuckles]

308
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,840
- lris Long is lifesaving.

309
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,580
If you can't hear in the back 
 and you want to,

310
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,520
just shout it out, please.

311
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,920
- This is a report

312
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,590
from the American Society 
 of Microbiology,

313
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,430
a conference I went to 
 at the end of May.

314
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,270
- Quiet!

315
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,930
- There were many infections 
 talked about... 

316
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,600
including AIDS...  
 at this conference,

317
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,600
and it was overwhelming 
 to know how many pathogens,

318
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,280
bacteria, fungus,

319
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,450
protozoas, and viruses 
 that are out there

320
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,790
that can really, uh...

321
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,480
make you very sick.

322
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,290
- One day, this woman 
 just showed up,

323
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,290
this housewife, who had been 
 a scientist and still was,

324
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,460
and said, "You guys don't know 
 diddly about what this is.

325
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,630
"And anybody who wants to learn 
 about the system,

326
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,970
"how it works,

327
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,640
"how grants are made, 
 how the science works,

328
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,140
"how everything works,

329
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,310
"how the NlH works,

330
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,810
"how the FDA works,

331
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,150
"how you can deal with

332
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,480
"all this 
 enormous amount of material,

333
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,820
I'll teach you."

334
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,650
- There should be much more 
 funding than there is

335
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,490
for infectious diseases.

336
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,650
- lris was not gay,

337
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,990
but she could not see,

338
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,660
with what was going on 
 around her and what she knew,

339
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,960
not reaching out to the 
 affected communities of AIDS.

340
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,840
- I waited 
 and went up to lris afterwards

341
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,330
and said, "I'm interested 
 in what you were saying.

342
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,850
"I'd like to know more. 
 I'd like to help."

343
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,350
- And a few people 
 joined her,

344
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,180
and that became 
 a bigger and bigger group,

345
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,020
and that became the Treatment 
 and Data Committee: T&D.

346
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,020
- They're still getting 
 a hell of a lot more money

347
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,180
than actually getting 
 those treatments to anybody.

348
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,690
It was kind of 
 a dorky activity

349
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,350
for a bunch of East Village 
 hipsters and artists

350
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,090
to sit around reading 
 medical journal articles.

351
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,430
We called it science club,

352
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,370
Iike it was chess club 
 or something.

353
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,530
- There aren't drugs.

354
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,440
- lndividual after individual

355
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,600
had to come to grips 
 with the fact that,

356
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,870
"l will survive 
 the longest,

357
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,210
the most I know about 
 what I'm putting into my body."

358
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,980
So they all 
 had to be become scientists,

359
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,080
to some degree.

360
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,520
- And what I would like 
 everyone to do

361
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,050
would be to keep on thinking 
 of ways to refine these things

362
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,720
to make them more clear 
 to people

363
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,520
that don't necessarily 
 know the issues, like Ol.

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,030
No one knows what Ol is.

365
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,220
Okay, so I wrote it here, 
 just 'cause it's shorthand.

366
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,390
Only 17% of people 
 in their trials

367
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,560
have been taking drugs

368
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,400
for opportunistic infections 
 or cancers.

369
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,070
- Mark wasn't, like, 
 the big, beefcakey guy.

370
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,910
He was super smart, 
 smoked nonstop.

371
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,740
- Right away, 
 Mark digested,

372
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,580
as by osmosis, 
 everything.

373
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,910
And within a few weeks,

374
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,910
he had come up with a glossary 
 of AIDS treatment terms,

375
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,120
and we started giving it out 
 in our meetings.

376
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,590
- Next we have an announcement 
 by Tom Dwayne

377
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,260
regarding housing.

378
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,600
- This is Bernard Braverman,

379
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,430
who's in danger 
 of being evicted

380
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,100
from his apartment that 
 he shared with his life partner

381
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,610
for many, many years.

382
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,940
His life partner died,

383
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,770
and the landlord wants Bernard 
 out of his home

384
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,210
because his name 
 was not on the lease.

385
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,770
- What's his landlord's address?

386
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,080
[laughter] 
 - We'll find him.

387
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,780
- There are cards here 
 to fill out,

388
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,290
to write to the governor.

389
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,790
Let's make sure that our voices 
 are heard in New York City

390
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,950
to save the homes of PWAs

391
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,790
and other 
 nontraditional families.

392
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,130
Thank you very much.

393
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,160
[cheers and applause]

394
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,140
- I just want to say something 
 about what's just happened.

395
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,470
I realized we haven't done 
 anything yet for him

396
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,980
and we haven't been effective

397
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,410
and we haven't been powerful,

398
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,420
but we will be.

399
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,650
It's very inspiring to know 
 the power in this room

400
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,150
is potentially available 
 to each and every one of us.

401
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,180
[cheers and applause]

402
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,500
- One, two, three.

403
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,160
[girl laughs]

404
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,170
Good?

405
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,330
How was it?

406
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,670
Is that as good as Daddy's 
 or better?

407
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,330
- You're better.

408
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,670
- Yay!

409
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,840
- Would you like Daddy 
 to try it?

410
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,850
Are you ready?

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,510
- [laughs and shrieks]

412
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,180
That's not very good.

413
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,020
[laughter]

414
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,680
- One, two, three.

415
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,520
- I know this sounds ironic,

416
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,860
considering that 
 it ended in divorce,

417
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,520
but I think 
 it is fair to say

418
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,400
it's the only really successful 
 love affair of my life.

419
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,040
I came out at age 40.

420
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,870
It was very bad timing 
 to come out

421
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,040
in the middle 
 of an epidemic.

422
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,210
The question is, 
 what does a decent society do

423
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,580
with people who hurt themselves 
 because they're human,

424
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,110
who smoke too much, 
 who eat too much,

425
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,210
who drive carelessly,

426
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,380
who don't have safe sex?

427
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,220
I think the answer 
 is that a decent society

428
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,060
does not put people 
 out to pasture

429
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,590
and let them die because 
 they've done a human thing.

430
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,170
- For the first time today,

431
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,970
the government approved 
 prescription sales

432
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,570
of a drug to treat AIDS.

433
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,410
The drug, AZT, 
 is not a cure for the disease,

434
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,280
but it has prolonged the lives 
 of some AIDS victims.

435
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,580
It's the only 
 government-approved AIDS drug

436
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,920
in America.

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,920
But even 
 this most promising of drugs

438
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,590
is a source of frustration 
 and anger.

439
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,430
At $10,000 a year cost 
 per patient,

440
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,760
it's prohibitively expensive 
 for most

441
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,660
and not widely available.

442
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,260
all: Out of the bars 
 and into the streets!

443
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,430
Out of the bars 
 and into the streets!

444
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,100
- AZT was the most expensive 
 drug in history.

445
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,270
They charge $10,000 a year.

446
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,440
We need to get a substantial 
 price reduction

447
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,950
out of this company.

448
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,880
- The incident began 
 at 10:0 this morning

449
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
when four AIDS activists

450
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,720
took over an office 
 at Burroughs Wellcome,

451
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,720
saying they had enough 
 food and water

452
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,950
to stay holed up 
 for a long time.

453
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,620
The activists are demanding 
 that Burroughs Wellcome

454
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,560
Iower its price of AZT.

455
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,620
- Burroughs Wellcome 
 is profiting off of our lives.

456
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,130
That's why we did today 
 what we did.

457
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,470
And if they don't see to 
 start listening to my community,

458
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,630
to our community, 
 the AIDS community,

459
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,840
then we're gonna be back.

460
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,850
[solemn music]

461
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:00,880
? ?

462
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,850
- One of the worst, 
 worst things was,

463
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,160
when people died 
 in the hospital,

464
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,720
they used to put them 
 in black trash bags.

465
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,360
It was...  
 [scoffs]

466
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,370
It was really awful.

467
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,370
And not every funeral parlor

468
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,400
would take patients 
 who had died of AIDS.

469
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,540
- But... so the least 
 we could offer

470
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,210
is sympathy 
 and moral support,

471
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,210
you know, and kindness 
 and so forth.

472
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,710
And that, they deserved, 
 in any case.

473
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,560
And when even that 
 became denied,

474
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,730
you know, by the totalitarian 
 rules of organizations,

475
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,070
of institutions,

476
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,900
it was really horrifying.

477
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,070
- It is the most frightening 
 medical mystery of our times.

478
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,580
AIDS victims must deal 
 with the trauma

479
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,910
of being both a patient 
 and a pariah.

480
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,580
- I hate to use the word "gay"

481
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,420
in connection with sodomy.

482
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,420
There's nothing gay 
 about these people

483
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,420
engaging in incredibly offensive 
 and revolting conduct

484
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,190
that has led to 
 the proliferation of AIDS.

485
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,320
- There is a feeling 
 among members

486
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,930
of any of a number 
 of professions

487
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,100
or just the general population

488
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,440
that patients with AIDS,

489
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,170
many of whom are homosexual,

490
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,610
are a little bit different.

491
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,270
I think that that has led to 
 a little bit of a complacency

492
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,880
about the approach 
 towards this disease.

493
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,440
- In the absence 
 of adequate health care,

494
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,580
we have learned to become 
 our own clinicians,

495
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,210
researchers, lobbyists,

496
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,120
drug smugglers, pharmacists.

497
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,520
We have our own libraries,

498
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,030
newspapers, drugstores, 
 and laboratories.

499
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,460
- Some of the medications 
 that were made available

500
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,020
were not effective.

501
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,190
They were in this category

502
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,700
that we called 
 "what the hell" drugs,

503
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,800
which is, "There's some evidence 
 it could be useful.

504
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,710
It's unlikely to be harmful. 
 What the hell?"

505
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,510
- Should I type?

506
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
[laughs] 
 - Yes, type.

507
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,080
Take your time.

508
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,450
Where are we?

509
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,610
- We're at the People With AIDS 
 Health Group,

510
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,150
the largest 
 underground buyers' club

511
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,490
in the United States.

512
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,820
- And what do you do here?

513
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,820
- We help people import drugs 
 from other countries,

514
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,490
um, that are unapproved here:

515
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,500
Peptide T, Albendazole,

516
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,770
Oral Amphotericin B.

517
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,570
We have a whole 
 variety of things

518
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,510
for your treatment pleasure.

519
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,340
[chuckles]

520
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,670
None of which work, 
 by the way.

521
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,740
[laughter]

522
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,910
Put that in.

523
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,280
- People with AIDS,

524
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,780
what they were 
 mostly thinking about was,

525
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,510
"Oh, drugs, 
 how do I get it off-market?

526
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,850
"How do I ... 

527
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,020
"Will we ever get 
 a black market for this drug?

528
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,690
I hear this is good and"... 

529
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,850
It was lris 
 who helped us see;

530
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,700
we don't want 
 a black market.

531
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,200
We want to make 
 the real market work.

532
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,700
[static buzzing]

533
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,710
- Try it.

534
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,730
[match strikes]

535
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,880
Hi, I'm Mark Harrington 
 from ACT UP New York.

536
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,220
Recently, a lot of activists 
 have been asking

537
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,550
why ACT UP is going...

538
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,820
Uh. 
 You've got to start over.

539
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,450
I got to do that...  
 I've got to do that over.

540
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,860
- You can just 
 start yourself over.

541
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,990
- But I ... but I won't get

542
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,660
that wonderful 
 cigarette-lighting thing.

543
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,630
- I think the cigarette 
 maybe is not going to work.

544
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,960
- I shouldn't use the cigarette 
 at all, really?

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,970
- I don't think so. 
 It's too, um... too much.

546
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,560
- Too much?

547
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,940
[inhaling]

548
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,240
Hi, I'm Mark Harrington 
 from ACT UP New York.

549
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,580
A lot of people 
 have been asking,

550
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,010
"Why are AIDS activists 
 going to the FDA?"

551
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,520
First of all, 
 you have to understand

552
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,020
that the FDA is one of the many 
 federal AIDS bureaucracies

553
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,920
which we're angry with 
 for not doing enough

554
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
in the fight against AIDS.

555
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,750
Half the people who take AZT

556
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,420
can't take it 
 'cause of side effects.

557
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,090
And therefore, the FDA has 
 to take a more activist stance

558
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,560
in the experimental process.

559
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,430
And only the FDA 
 has the power

560
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,300
under existing laws 
 and regulations

561
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,570
to release the drugs 
 that we want released now.

562
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,940
[static buzzing] 
 How's that?

563
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,070
crowd: AZT is not enough!

564
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,080
Give us all the other stuff!

565
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,100
AZT is not enough!

566
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,050
Give us 
 all the other stuff!

567
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,050
AZT is not enough!

568
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,450
Give us all the other stuff!

569
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,290
- It takes nine months 
 to test a drug in Europe,

570
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,520
in Belgium, in France,

571
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,960
in Germany, in England.

572
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,620
We are not asking the FDA 
 to release dangerous drugs

573
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,130
without safety or efficacy.

574
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,730
We are simply asking the FDA 
 to do it quicker.

575
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,330
crowd: Drugs for sale!

576
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,600
Drugs for sale!

577
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,440
- Dextran sulfate for sale.

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,640
Get your dextran here.

579
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,510
You can't get it inside.

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,570
[indistinct chanting]

581
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,010
- FDA...  
 but we're selling it anyway.

582
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,570
- $30 for dextran sulfate!

583
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,480

- Start fighting!

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,390
- Come on, tell us why 
 you got arrested.

615
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,330
Where are they taking you? 
 What's going on today?

616
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,560
- We don't know what's...  
 where they're taking us.

617
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,160
We're here 
 because this government

618
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,230
has the resources 
 to deal with the AIDS epidemic,

619
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,330
and they won't do it 
 unless we force them.

620
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,400
- I .J. Hutchins 
 reports live from Rockville,

621
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,240
where the massive protest 
 is wrapping up.

622
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,400
I.J.?

623
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,880
- Well, Jim, 
 it's being billed

624
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,040
as one of Montgomery County's 
 biggest demonstrations

625
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,810
in recent history, 
 and it went off smoothly.

626
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,180
185 arrests,

627
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,190
as a coalition of gay groups 
 came to Rockville

628
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,690
to shut down the FDA.

629
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,890
- Tonight, from Washington, 
 Crossfire: Against All Odds.

630
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,860
On the left, Tom Braden.

631
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,800
On the right, Pat Buchanan.

632
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,700
In the cross fire, 
 Peter Staley

633
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,030
of the New York AIDS Coalition 
 to Unleash Power.

634
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,270
- Peter Staley, 
 you have the AIDS virus,

635
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,110
and I am sorry.

636
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,440
But don't you think that 
 the Federal Drug Administration

637
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,440
has a responsibility 
 not to let people,

638
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,250
such as you, have quacks

639
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,780
that could cause even more harm 
 than you already have?

640
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,220
- The problem is,

641
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,230
is that the FDA 
 is using the same process

642
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,130
to test a nasal spray

643
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,290
as it is to test AIDS drugs,

644
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,390
and it's a seven- 
 to ten-year process.

645
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,300
- You have the FDA 
 giving you a drug.

646
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,310
So far, you've got AZT. 
 Why... 

647
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,470
- Which I can't take

648
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,840
because it's too...  
 far too toxic.

649
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,710
And over half the people 
 that have HlV can't take it.

650
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,720
- Okay, but the FDA says

651
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,520
there is nothing else 
 that is worth anything.

652
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,320
- Mr. Staley, 
 this is gonna astonish you,

653
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,760
but I agree with you 100%.

654
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,980
I think if someone's got AIDS

655
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,490
and someone 
 wants to take a drug,

656
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,260
it's their life, 
 and if it gives them hope,

657
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,590
they ought to be able 
 to take it.

658
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,690
What I want to ask you

659
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,530
is whether you know 
 of anything

660
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,660
that you think might be 
 some kind of miraculous cure

661
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,670
that you think 
 they're sitting on at FDA.

662
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,170
- There are over 140 drugs 
 out there

663
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,840
that the FDA has identified 
 as possibilities

664
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,680
and are in some stage 
 of being looked at right now.

665
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,840
- Why are they holding back?

666
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,180
- Among that 140,

667
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,010
there's got to be one 
 or a combination thereof

668
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,850
that can...  
 that can slow down this virus

669
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,480
or halt it in its tracks.

670
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,920
- You're just simply 
 carrying the virus.

671
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,980
Is that correct?

672
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,360
- I have a few 
 very minor symptoms,

673
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,490
and my immune system 
 is virtually shot.

674
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,930
- What would you 
 like to take?

675
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,530
- I would like to be able to 
 take dextran sulfate legally.

676
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,760
- How would that hurt you?

677
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,570
- I'm taking it 
 on the underground right now.

678
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,800
- Well, why not, Mr. Braden?

679
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,810
- Because...  
 well, I don't know anything

680
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,860
about dextran sulfate.

681
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,000
- Well, I'll tell you this.

682
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,810
It's an over-the-counter drug 
 in Japan

683
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,540
and has been for 20 years.

684
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,740
- But...  
 - Over-the-counter, yes.

685
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,410
- But if the FDA says... 

686
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,040
- I'm only asking 
 that they be released

687
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,050
after there's a minimal amount 
 of efficacy,

688
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,560
not a 100% test.

689
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,890
- You've got the pink triangle 
 on your shirt,

690
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,090
"Silence equals death."

691
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,720
I gather that means 
 you're a homosexual.

692
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,750
- Yes.

693
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,790
- Looking in the camera,

694
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,990
what would you tell some kid... 

695
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,730
say you had a younger brother, 
 21 years old,

696
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,830
who also might 
 have homosexual tendencies;

697
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,930
what would you tell him

698
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,400
if you wanted him 
 to live a long life?

699
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,570
- Use a condom

700
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,730
and also to use a lubricant, 
 by the way,

701
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,240
that has the medicine... 

702
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,140
- This is Russian roulette.

703
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,650
- It is not Russian roulette.

704
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,580
It is Russian roulette to 
 not give people this information

705
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,250
when human nature dictates 
 that they're gonna go out there,

706
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,380
and they're gonna have sex.

707
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,820
- You mean 
 celibacy is impossible?

708
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,950
- It's just not gonna work.

709
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,480
People aren't gonna do it, 
 and lots... 

710
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,820
Iots of people 
 are gonna die.

711
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,420
Now, would you rather have

712
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,430
a lot of people 
 cheating on their celibacy

713
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,930
with thousands of people 
 dying,

714
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,530
or would you rather 
 save those lives

715
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,930
and let them have sex?

716
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,100
- I think that, uh... 

717
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,110
Well, thank you very much, 
 Peter Staley.

718
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,470
Thanks for being 
 in our studio.

719
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,530
Mr. Braden and l 
 will be back in a minute.

720
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,270
- One of the things 
 we wanted

721
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,110
was a drug 
 that you gave to people

722
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,450
who had cytomegalovirus 
 and advanced AIDS,

723
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,790
because people who had both 
 tended to go blind.

724
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,490
It was called DHPG.

725
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,500
[somber music]

726
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:53,530
? ?

727
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,660
In a way similar to AZT,

728
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,990
it was highly toxic,

729
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,830
but it was known 
 to be effective

730
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,660
because 6,000 people 
 had already used the drug

731
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,000
but never in a clinical trial.

732
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,030
crowd: Hey, hey, FDA!

733
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,340
How many people 
 did you kill today?

734
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,170
- We are with Jim Eigo 
 from ACT UP,

735
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,010
and there's a major protest 
 going on here in Bethesda

736
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,670
over the drug DHPG.

737
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,680
Tell us what's happening.

738
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,680
- Well, 
 this is the second meeting

739
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,690
of the Bush commission 
 for reviewing procedures

740
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,350
for approving AIDS 
 and cancer drugs.

741
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,190
And we thought, 
 since the non-approval of DHPG

742
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,030
is such a perfect example

743
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,190
of how regulation 
 has gone wrong,

744
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,360
we'd bring it home 
 to the commission itself

745
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,700
by showing up here in force,

746
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,030
and that's what we've done.

747
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,200
- Okay, also inside 
 at the hearing itself.

748
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,830
And I understand 
 there's going to be

749
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,140
an action 
 in just a little while

750
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,200
when Ellen Cooper speaks.

751
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,900
- I guess so.

752
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,710
- What about DHPG?

753
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,050
- What about DHPG?

754
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,380
- What about DHPG?

755
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,410
[overlapping voices]

756
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,720
- Without the objective data,

757
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,050
we feel that we would indeed 
 be on... 

758
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,720
on treacherous grounds

759
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,730
in defending that decision

760
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,060
and, in fact, 
 would be wide open

761
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,730
to the charge of arbitrary 
 decision-making.

762
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,060
Although, uh, we certainly

763
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,000
wouldn't be accused 
 of being inflexible.

764
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,270
- You did it with AZT.

765
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,400
I don't see 
 why you can't do it with...

766
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,910
- I mean, I have to say

767
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,740
that the difference 
 in the data

768
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,250
between AZT And DHPG

769
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,910
is the difference between 
 night and day, as far as... 

770
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,510
- Sight and blindness.

771
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,580
- You're just as blind... 

772
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,590
- Lose your life 
 and lose your sight.

773
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,990
- People have died 
 since this meeting started,

774
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,580
and four more are gonna die 
 before it's over.

775
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,320
- Who represents the patient 
 on this panel?

776
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,590
- Where is a person of color 
 on this panel?

777
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,930
- FDA relooks at the DHPG data 
 and suddenly, "Oh!"

778
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,100
Agrees with ACT UP.

779
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,800
- Ready for a vote?

780
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,780
All in favor, 
 raise your hand.

781
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,570
One, two...

782
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,510
Well, that's everyone.

783
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,110
[cheers and applause]

784
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,950
- It was really 
 an amazing encounter,

785
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,790
but it sort of felt like 
 reaching the Wizard of Oz.

786
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,550
Like, you got to the center 
 of the whole... 

787
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,890
of the whole system,

788
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,790
and there's just this schmuck 
 behind a curtain.

789
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,630
There was no guiding agenda.

790
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,790
There was no leadership.

791
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,560
There was no global strategy

792
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,430
for how to deal with AIDS 
 in the U.S.

793
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,330
And so on the bus 
 back from Bethesda,

794
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,970
we decided 
 to write a treatment agenda,

795
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,530
because nobody was dealing 
 with the entire map of AIDS,

796
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,810
the entire constellation 
 of opportunistic infections,

797
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,900
the gaps in research,

798
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,610
the underrepresented 
 populations,

799
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,710
the fact that the diseases 
 and the drugs

800
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,380
might be different 
 in those populations.

801
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,390
How would we ever find out?

802
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,680
They weren't even being studied.

803

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,650
- ? In the dark of night ?

806
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,820
? I laid myself ?

807
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,920
? To rest ?

808
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,200
? Step out of the strange... ?

809
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,430
- Bye, Ron!

810
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,930
Bye, Bobby!

811
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,370
- Come on, Catherine, 
 let's go.

812
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,430
- It's time to go. 
 - Yeah.

813
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,640
? ?

814
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,010
- ? Again ?

815
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,950
? Come to life ?

816
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,480
crowd: 
 Crisis knows no borders!

817
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,510
The AIDS crisis 
 knows no borders!

818
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,080
The AIDS crisis

819
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,530
knows no borders!

820
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,090
The AIDS crisis

821
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,620
knows no borders!

822
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,330
The AIDS crisis

823
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,700
knows no borders!

824
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,230
The AIDS crisis 
 knows no borders!

825
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,870
- I'd just like to say

826
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,810
that the reasons 
 I can't get any of these drugs

827
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,040
is 'cause, 
 for nine years now,

828
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,700
the leadership 
 in this country

829
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,510
has failed to come up 
 with a plan of action.

830
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,710
They've failed to come up with 
 a plan of research,

831
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,220
a national research agenda.

832
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,050
People with AIDS 
 and their advocates

833
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,560
have finally done this 
 for them.

834
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,220
This is it.

835
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,230
This is the plan 
 we're presenting.

836
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,230
We need our government 
 to read this plan.

837
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,890
We need them 
 to work with us.

838
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,730
If they want to change it 
 a little,

839
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,070
we'll talk to them.

840
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,730
But I want them to adopt it.

841
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,240
I want them 
 to get started on it.

842
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,900
I want them to save our lives. 
 Thank you.

843
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,170
[applause]

844
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,110
- I snuck around 
 and grabbed... 

845
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,010
uh, grabbed 
 one of those copies.

846
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,880
And it was very interesting.

847
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,580
- We believe that 
 the United States

848
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,080
has a global responsibility

849
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,250
to quickly develop 
 effective treatments

850
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,760
not only 
 for HlV infection itself

851
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,690
but for all of 
 the opportunistic infections,

852
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,350
which actually 
 cause suffering and death

853
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,590
in people living with AIDS.

854
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,600
- This is not a new agenda,

855
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,430
and it is not an agenda 
 of only ACT UP.

856
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,930
Scientists agree with this.

857
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,090
Why can't we have it?

858
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,760
- The researchers 
 and regulators

859
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,290
are going to have to 
 come up with

860
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,200
a parallel release program

861
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,570
that will get drugs 
 to the people who need it

862
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,240
before the five years 
 down the pipe

863
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
where they may be approved 
 by the FDA.

864
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,280
- I was scribbling madly 
 in this copy of their... 

865
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,110
their AIDS Treatment 
 Research Agenda.

866
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,450
I would go back and forth 
 between saying, "No, no!

867
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,120
They don't understand!"

868
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,090
To saying, 
 "Whoa, you mean

869
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,090
"this isn't the way 
 we're doing trials?

870
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,890
You mean people aren't allowed 
 to do this or that?"

871
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,800
But I have to tell you 
 that I was still not ready

872
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,630
to sort of go up to them

873
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,190
and try...  
 try and engage.

874
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,970
I brought this copy back,

875
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,800
and I distributed it to 
 a small group of statisticians

876
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,640
that was meeting regularly

877
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,270
to talk about 
 trial design issues.

878
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,750
The people sitting 
 around that table

879
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,410
got as excited as I did.

880
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,470
This had clearly been written 
 by people

881
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,990
who were very knowledgeable,

882
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,650
very, very intelligent,

883
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,990
and really wanted

884
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,650
to do the trials 
 the best possible way.

885
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,160
They were not against trials.

886
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,660
They wanted 
 to get the right answers,

887
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,490
but they wanted 
 what they called humane trials.

888
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,970
- It all came together 
 in Montreal,

889
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,700
but what was new 
 for ACT UP...

890
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,370
We went to a drug company.

891
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,340
- There is renewed hope 
 for people infected with AIDS.

892
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,900
A new experimental drug, ddl,

893
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,670
will be distributed 
 on a limited basis

894
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,580
for free this fall 
 by its developer,

895
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,410
the giant 
 Bristol-Myers company.

896
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,010
This marks the first time

897
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,680
an anti-AIDS drug 
 will be available

898
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,920
even before safety testing 
 is finished.

899
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,620
Full AZT treatment is too much 
 for patient Peter Staley.

900
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,030
For nine months, 
 he's been limited

901
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,320
to a quarter-dose of the drug

902
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,520
and wants ddl 
 as soon as possible.

903
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,620
- Do you need ddl to live, 
 do you think?

904
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,030
- Yes, I need...  
 I need ddl.

905
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,730
I probably need some other 
 antivirals beyond that.

906
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,570
- It is historic.

907
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,540
It is because 
 the AIDS activist community

908
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,200
has obtained this drug.

909
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,210
It is not the government.

910
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,540
No one has given it to us.

911
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,710
We have fought for it,

912
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,270
and for the first time, 
 we have won.

913
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,050
[indistinct chanting]

914
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,880
- So by '89, less than a year 
 after our FDA demo,

915
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,220
they had approved a drug

916
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,880
to prevent blindness 
 in people with AIDS.

917
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,720
And we had gotten 
 expanded access to ddl,

918
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,390
and that was 
 a very powerful feeling.

919
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,560
We felt like 
 we were taking direct action,

920
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,590
and we were helping 
 make people's lives better.

921
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,500
I wasn't sure that AZT or ddl 
 were all that great,

922
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,410
but we were beginning 
 to get letters from people

923
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,570
that said, "Thank you 
 for saving my eyesight."

924
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,080
"Thank you, ACT UP, 
 for getting me access to ddl

925
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,450
and helping to save my life."

926
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:31,590
- At Merck, HlV was an important 
 scientific target.

927
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,690
HlV, of course, is a virus.

928
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,760
In order for the virus 
 to infect an uninfected cell,

929
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,140
it needs to construct itself 
 in a particular way.

930
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,440
First, the viral RNA 
 needs to transform itself

931
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,610
into a DNA copy

932
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,110
in order to knit itself

933
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,610
into the nuclear DNA 
 of the newly infected cell.

934
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,280
This occurs by a process 
 called reverse transcription.

935
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,950
AZT and ddl were both 
 originally developed

936
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,620
to try to inhibit that process 
 of establishing infection.

937
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,630
A number of other researchers

938
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,460
began to focus on 
 another portion

939
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,800
of the viral life cycle:

940
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,270
after the cell 
 is already infected.

941
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,100
One of the steps 
 that it takes is that... 

942
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,480
is, it makes a viral protein.

943
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,810
It has to snip 
 that viral protein

944
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,750
in very specific places.

945
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,310
The resulting pieces 
 self-assemble

946
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,320
to make the viral particle.

947
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,980
And what does the snipping

948
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,990
and what in fact 
 controls the snipping

949
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,150
is a viral protein 
 called the protease.

950
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,320
If you genetically modify 
 the viral protease

951
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,660
so that 
 it can no longer snip,

952
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,500
the virus no longer 
 has the ability

953
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,330
to make those component pieces 
 that it needs to make

954
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,670
in order to self-assemble

955
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,040
and make 
 an infectious viral particle.

956
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,170
- We solved the structure 
 of HlV protease in 1989

957
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,680
and published it 
 pretty quickly.

958
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,180
I think...  
 I think we saw the structure,

959
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,380
and within a few weeks, 
 it was in the literature.

960
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,650
- And then the question 
 became,

961
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,950
"All right, 
 can we prove it?"

962
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,020
Can we prove it that 
 that is, in fact, the case?

963
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,530
And most importantly,

964
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,690
can we prove that 
 if you inhibit that protease,

965
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,530
if you knock out 
 its activity,

966
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,190
that the virus 
 can no longer replicate

967
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,530
and therefore 
 make new progeny viral particles

968
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,700
that would then go on

969
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,370
and establish 
 a new cycle of infection?

970
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,710
[heartbeat thumping]

971
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,440
- AIDS is now 
 the leading cause of death

972
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,710
for men under 44

973
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,380
in New York 
 and a half dozen other cities,

974
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,890
surpassing homicide 
 and all other diseases.

975
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,320
Yet Roman Catholic bishops 
 are meeting this week

976
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,550
to publicly oppose 
 the use of condoms

977
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,530
as morally unacceptable.

978
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,720
This puts them 
 in direct opposition

979
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
to U.S. public health policy.

980
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,900
- The new church position

981
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,060
condemns not only 
 the immorality of condoms

982
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,230
but their effectiveness 
 as well.

983
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,070
The draft under consideration 
 in Baltimore this week

984
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,310
says it is, 
 "A virtual certainty

985
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,580
"that reliance on condoms

986
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,810
will result 
 in transmission of AIDS. "

987
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,680
Of the bishop's 
 proposed new policy,

988
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,190
New York City health 
 commissioner Stephen Joseph

989
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,280
says...

990
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,420
- This would be 
 a public health disaster.

991
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,260
It would undoubtedly 
 lead to more transmission,

992
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,590
particularly in high-risk areas 
 of the city,

993
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,070
more disease and more death.

994
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,760
- Catholic conservatives say

995
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,270
not just physical death

996
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,100
but spiritual death 
 is at issue here.

997
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,770
As New York City's 
 archbishop,

998
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,610
John Cardinal O'Connor 
 put it...

999
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,440
- The use of prophylactics 
 is immoral

1000
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,570
in a pluralistic society 
 or any other society.

1001
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,950
- I think that's it, except,

1002
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,950
of course, 
 we have Ann Northrop

1003
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,620
giving her sound bite 
 technique.

1004
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,650
[cheers and applause]

1005
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,620
- Uh, we want everybody 
 to join us,

1006
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,140
to support us,

1007
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,300
to destroy the power 
 of the Catholic Church,

1008
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,100
to make our side 
 the strong one.

1009
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,370
And to do that,

1010
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,470
we must put out the message 
 that we are the ones

1011
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,780
who are fighting 
 for people's lives,

1012
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,150
and they are the murderers.

1013
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,660
Don't be afraid of the media.

1014
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,990
You're talking through them 
 to the public.

1015
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,160
We are trying to arouse, 
 to anger an action.

1016
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,830
And hone it down to, yes, 
 a three-second bite,

1017
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,840
a five-second bite,

1018
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,500
just a phrase 
 that will have an impact,

1019
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,670
that will say something 
 specific

1020
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,680
and that will be 
 understandable.

1021
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,010
So...

1022
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,040
[laughter and applause]

1023
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,020
- Thanks for the advice.

1024
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,180
- I don't have 
 a phrase worked out,

1025
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,130
and so you're all 
 gonna have to create your own,

1026
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,690
so this is empowerment.

1027
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,720

? Won't you help me? ?

 you're interfering with us.

Step back.

I'm in front of St. Patrick's 
 Cathedral on Sunday.

1037
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,380
We're here reporting on 
 a major AIDS activist

1038
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,720
and abortion-rights activist

about the position 
 of lesbians and gays.

about this large vision 
 that you've visited upon us.

- Well, we've decided 
 to rename the cardinal.

He's now Cardinal O'Condom.

1049

This is our message to him 
 that condoms are safe.

It's no sin.

believe that 
 the protests will result

in some change of environment,

some change of attitudes, 
 perhaps.

The church will be teaching

00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,340
that homosexual activity 
 is sinful,

before you jump off

 off the edge of the porch.

I will jump up and down.

1095
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,380
I think 44 
 is a very fine age.

1096
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,890
It has a nice symmetry 
 to it.

1097
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,720
It has a nice feeling 
 to it.

1098

It's, uh, better than 22 
 and possibly better than 88.

We'll see.

What we want to do

is run this like 
 a Treatment and Data meeting.

1104

A number of times, 
 we've had people

00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,570
come to 
 a Treatment and Data meeting

1106

and speak on certain issues.

1107

We try to get in depth.

1108

We try to nail issues down.

This isn't a free-for-all.

Let's call it

So why don't we start?

This is Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Bob Rafsky.

1114
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,250
- I may be wrong, 
 Dr. Fauci,

1115
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,590
but it's my understanding

1116
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,090
that thousands of people 
 died from pneumonia

1117
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,260
because there was no priority 
 within the government

1118
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,930
or within the medical system 
 as a whole

1119
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,600
to push the known 
 preventative treatments

1120
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,200
for a long time.

1121
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,940
Now, those thousands of people 
 are dead.

1122
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,770
It would seem to me 
 that someone

1123
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,040
who was within the government 
 while that took place,

1124
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,450
as you were,

1125
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,220
must have on their conscience 
 these deaths.

1126
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,950
- That is a tough one, um...

1127
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,820
[audience exclaims] 
 No, it really is.

1128
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,590
It's inexcusable 
 that an academic priority

1129
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,030
should ever, ever 
 come before

1130
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,050
the health of the people 
 that you're working with.

1131
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,360
There's no question 
 about that.

1132
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,430
But the reality 
 of the situation is,

1133
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,800
there was a great reluctance

1134
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,470
among the community 
 of everything

1135
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,810
from the scientists 
 to the Congress

1136
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,440
saying that 
 what we should be doing

1137
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,650
is not telling investigators 
 what to do,

1138
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,980
but we should allow them 
 to do

1139
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,820
what they feel 
 is the most important.

1140
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,480
Now, that sounds awful

1141
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,320
when you're putting it 
 in the context

1142
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,390
of what we're talking about 
 here,

1143
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,830
but the whole world 
 isn't in this room.

1144
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,730
crowd: Every 12 minutes, 
 someone dies!

1145
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,500
Protests won me a Nobel Prize!

1146
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,730
Every 12 minutes, 
 someone dies!

1147
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,170
[chanting continues 
 indistinctly]

1148
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,330
- AIDS activists 
 stormed the government's

1149
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,340
premiere disease research 
 center.

1150
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,010
The National 
 lnstitutes of Health

1151
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,340
is where an AIDS cure 
 might be found.

1152
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,010
It is where therapies 
 are being tested

1153
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,350
in clinical trials.

1154
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,910
crowd: No more 
 secret meetings!

1155
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,180
No more secret...

1156
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,520
- Demonstrators 
 blocked access to buildings.

1157
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,860
Scientists and administrators 
 reporting to work

1158
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,450
stood around 
 looking confused.

1159
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,220
Activists charged 
 the Bush administration

1160
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,730
with foot-dragging 
 on AIDS research.

1161
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,030
It's not the amount of 
 federal money allocated to it

1162
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:39,060
so much as how research 
 priorities are defined.

1163
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,870
- We need new drugs 
 to keep people alive,

1164
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,030
but the NlH 
 is only testing old drugs,

1165
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,300
drugs that we already have.

1166
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,710
- Can you tell us 
 what you're doing?

1167
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,210
- Hi, I'm Jim Jenson,

1168
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,040
and I'm in 
 a clinical trial here.

1169
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,170
And right now,

1170
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,210
I'm observing 
 and participating in

1171
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,720
the ACT UP demonstration.

1172
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,340
- Why? 
 Why do you support this action?

1173
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,220
- Because we need 
 far more AIDS research.

1174
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,380
And we're just beginning.

1175
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,790
- What trial are you in?

1176
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,390
- I'm in interleukin-2 AZT 
 combination study.

1177
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,060
- Are there any women 
 in your trial?

1178
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,570
- No, there aren't any women 
 at all.

1179
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,730
- People of color?

1180
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,390
- Uh, no, there are not.

1181
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,630
- Why do you think that is?

1182
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,660
- [laughs]

1183
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,570
Just the beginning 
 of the problem.

1184
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,940
crowd: Murder, murder!

1185
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,100
- There are three major things

1186
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,580
that control NlH research:

1187
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,580
stupidity, incompetence, 
 and greed.

1188
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,410
Those are the three major 
 driving forces

1189
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,580
behind what's going on here

1190
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,210
and why there are 
 no treatments out there

1191
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,680
for people 
 living with this disease.

1192
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,910
[crowd shouting]

1193
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,250
In that building 
 down that way,

1194
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,920
Dr. Anthony Fauci is deciding 
 the research priorities

1195
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,020
for the National lnstitutes

1196
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,150
of Allergy 
 and lnfectious Diseases.

1197
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,490
We're down here 
 'cause we think

1198
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,120
we should be deciding 
 the research priorities,

1199
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,890
because these are the people 
 who know what's going on

1200
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,590
'cause they're dealing with it 
 every day.

1201
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,590
[crowd shouting and cheering]

1202
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,440
[whistle blowing]

1203
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,940
[people shouting indistinctly]

1204
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,810
crowd: The whole world 
 is watching!

1205
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,610
The whole world is watching!

1206
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,450
The whole world 
 is watching!

1207
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,110
The whole world is watching!

1208
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,920
The whole world 
 is watching!

1209
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,950
The whole world is watching!

1210
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,180
The whole world 
 is watching!

1211
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,780
The whole world is watching!

1212
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,620
The whole world 
 is watching!

1213
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,960
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

1214
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,630
[drums beating, 
 indistinct shouting]

1215
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,490
[smashing]

1216
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,650
- If anything, 
 the mood after the NlH

1217
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,490
was even bleaker 
 than the mood before,

1218
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,860
because we had no indication

1219
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,490
that they were gonna change 
 or respond to our demands,

1220
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,830
and we had in fact had a meeting 
 with them in Bethesda

1221
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,000
after the NlH action

1222
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,010
that indicated 
 that there was total resistance

1223
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,840
to putting people 
 from the community

1224
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,170
on the research committees,

1225
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,840
to letting the ACT UP observers 
 attend the meetings,

1226
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,010
and to open up the meetings

1227
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,510
so that 
 they weren't secret anymore.

1228
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,350
Why should science 
 be shrouded in secrecy?

1229
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,350
It's supposed to be based on 
 a free exchange of ideas.

1230
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:12,220
And so it was very important 
 to stage in San Francisco... 

1231
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,690
before, again, the global 
 community of scientists

1232
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,190
and people working on AIDS... 

1233
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,030
why we had been at the NlH,

1234
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,530
why the U.S. system 
 wasn't working out,

1235
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,530
and to reach the people 
 directly

1236
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:26,200
that we had reached symbolically 
 through the NlH action.

1237
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,230
[indistinct chatter]

1238
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,170
[indistinct chatter]

1239
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,720
- About 100 protesters 
 have already been arrested

1240
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,280
at the lnternational 
 AIDS Conference

1241
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,620
that began today 
 in San Francisco.

1242
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,460
Hundreds more 
 are angrily protesting

1243
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,690
a government policy

1244
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,630
they say neglects research 
 and ostracizes victims.

1245
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,160
- Why don't you do 
 an informational slide first?

1246
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,400
"United States 
 has the most discriminatory

1247
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,560
immigration policies 
 regarding HlV."

1248
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:05,740
- I could say, you know, 
 as a way to bridge the, uh... 

1249
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,910
the rift between the scientific 
 community... all of you... 

1250
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,580
and the activists, we'd like you 
 to join in some activism.

1251
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,590
And I've always been 
 painfully aware

1252
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,920
that in order for me 
 to beat this virus and live,

1253
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,120
I will need a great deal of help 
 from all of you.

1254
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,590
Can we all,

1255
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,760
before it's too late,

1256
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,430
begin to understand 
 each other?

1257
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,770
Will we realize that 
 we share similar motivations?

1258
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,360
During the upcoming days,

1259
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,600
ACT UP New York 
 will be handing out

1260
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,440
our AIDS Treatment Agenda,

1261
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,950
which includes a list 
 of 99 drugs

1262
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,610
that we believe 
 could be ready

1263
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,140
for small Phase I studies 
 this year or next.

1264
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,450
However, from your side,

1265
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,290
we're being constantly told 
 to butt out.

1266
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,130
On my side, the level 
 of anger and frustration

1267
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,790
is reaching such a point

1268
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:04,130
that attitudes claiming that 
 all of you are uncaring

1269
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,300
and in it for greed 
 are now widespread.

1270
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,970
While at times 
 we may offend you,

1271
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,640
remember as well that 
 like you,

1272
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,980
ACT UP has succeeded 
 in prolonging the lives

1273
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,980
of thousands of people 
 living with HlV disease.

1274
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,650
[cheers and applause]

1275
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,660
I would like to be joined 
 in front of the stage

1276
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,820
by my fellow AIDS activists.

1277
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,090
Would you all come up?

1278
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,260
[applause]

1279
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:37,000
At this moment, 
 there are others just like us

1280
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,000
who are trying 
 to get into this conference

1281

but are being barred 
 by the billy clubs

1282
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,330
of San Francisco police.

1283
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,340
And there are 
 still others like us

1284
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,000
who are trying 
 to get through customs

1285
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,840
at the San Francisco airport

1286
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,540
but are being detained instead 
 because they are gay.

1287
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,850
There's a man that could have 
 prevented these absurdities.

1288
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,190
This man has said that

1289
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,350
he would like to see 
 a kinder, gentler nation.

1290
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,690
If you believe 
 that the immigration policy

1291
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,860
barring people 
 living with HlV disease

1292
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,700
from entering this country 
 is useless as a health policy

1293
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,530
and discriminatory as well,

1294
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:14,370
please stand now 
 and remain standing.

1295
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,200
[cheering and applause]

1296
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,700
Join us in vocalizing 
 our collective anger.

1297
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,040
Join us 
 in a chant against the man

1298
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,880
who could bring down 
 the lNS barriers.

1299
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,540
Join us 
 in a chant against the man

1300
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,680
who has decided to show

1301
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,380
his commitment 
 to fighting AIDS

1302
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,390
by refusing to be here today.

1303
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,390
Instead, 
 he is, at this very moment,

1304
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,290
in North Carolina, 
 attending a fund-raiser

1305
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,560
for the homophobic author 
 of the lNS barriers,

1306
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,900
that pig in the senate 
 known as Jesse Helms.

1307
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,230
[crowd boos and jeers]

1308
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,200
Join us in this chant:

1309
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,070
300,000 dead from AIDS.

1310
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,070
Where is George?

1311
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,580
crowd: 
 300,000 dead from AIDS.

1312
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,240
Where is George?

1313
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,440
300,000 dead from AIDS.

1314
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,380
Where is George?

1315
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,750
300,000 dead from AIDS.

1316
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,880
Where is George?

1317
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,080
- You can all 
 now consider yourselves

1318
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,750
members of ACT UP.

1319
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,780
[cheers and applause]

1320
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,090
- One of the things 
 that happened in San Francisco

1321
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,940
was that we found out we had won 
 some of our NlH demands.

1322
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,100
Fauci came up to me and said, 
 "We had a meeting.

1323
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,540
"We decided that 
 we're gonna put you guys

1324
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,010
"on all the committees,

1325
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,740
"and we're gonna let your 
 observers go to the meetings,

1326
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,080
and the meetings 
 won't be secret anymore."

1327
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,570
- Never again

1328
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,780
could any of this be done

1329
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:39,120
without taking people with AIDS 
 and their advocates

1330
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,780
into consideration.

1331
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:46,660
This would be public business 
 from now on.

1332
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,960
- You know, we should all 
 be going through the bushes

1333
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,130
Iike this, 
 like, sticking our heads up.

1334
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,930
It was beginning to feel 
 a little different

1335
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,840
because we'd spent all the time 
 up until then

1336
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,140
being on the outside,

1337
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,300
sort of beating on the doors 
 and trying to get in,

1338
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,810
and now they actually wanted 
 to hear what we had to say.

1339
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,820
[peaceful music]

1340
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:12,850
? ?

1341
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,830
- We brought them in 
 at Merck.

1342
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,490
We made... we made 
 a very specific effort

1343
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,160
to bring 
 those individuals in

1344
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,760
so that they would see 
 what it is that we were doing... 

1345
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,430
or trying to do...  
 from the very beginning.

1346
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,000
- This was really fantastic 
 stuff

1347
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,170
because we were sitting down 
 with them, and... 

1348
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,510
sometimes from 
 the very earliest stages

1349
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,850
of the development 
 of a drug... 

1350
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,350
and helping them plot out 
 their strategy

1351
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,720
toward designing 
 clinical trials.

1352
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,190
- The chemists who had worked 
 on the project,

1353
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,120
a bunch...  
 a couple chemists said,

1354
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,960
"Let's look at all 
 the aspartic protease inhibitors

1355
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,360
that we have on the shelf."

1356
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,860
And they tested 'em,

1357
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,730
and they found a few molecules 
 that actually worked.

1358
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,200
The challenge was, 
 is now you had these molecules

1359
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,540
that were really good inhibitors 
 in your assay,

1360
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,370
which is just in a test tube.

1361
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,040
When you put it into animals,

1362
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,200
they just would never work,

1363
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,540
or they would never get absorbed 
 by your system.

1364
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,140
- And I remember 
 being very disappointed

1365
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,840
'cause I had to share 
 this information

1366
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,550
with sort of my own 
 personal view, which was,

1367
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,050
this is gonna be 
 a lot more difficult than,

1368
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,720
you know, we thought 
 it was gonna be originally

1369
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,380
and in fact 
 may not be possible.

1370
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,390
And Bill Bahlman said, 
 "Take a break,

1371
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,550
pick yourself up, 
 and go back at it."

1372
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,900
If he and his colleagues 
 and his friends around the table

1373
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,560
can take that attitude 
 and do that,

1374
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,930
I remember saying to myself,

1375
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,560
"Emilio, you've got no right 
 to say to yourself,

1376
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,970
'l don't know if I can do this,' 
 all right?"

1377
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,740
And so off we went.

1378
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,900
And we kept going at it.

1379
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,440
- We're spending $4 billion 
 a year on AIDS research.

1380
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,750
When you consider that 
 on a per capita basis for... 

1381
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,080
compared to heart disease 
 or cancer,

1382
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,420
it's an awful lot.

1383
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,750
- Almost nothing 
 stops George Bush

He's played nearly every day-

1386
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,930
and sometimes twice a day-

? No more ravioli 
 will you crave ?

1397
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,270
- If the message is research,

1398
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,110
I would say 
 please talk to Dr. Fauci

1399
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,450
and others at the National 
 lnstitute of Health,

1400
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,180
who will tell you that

1401
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,620
we're doing pretty well 
 in funding of research.

1402

1404
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,590
? All my meatballs 
 you tried to steal ?

1405
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,960
? Mm ?

00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,260
? You're a devil, yeah ?

1407

- Act up! 
 Fight back!

1408
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,460
Fight AIDS!

1409
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:46,500
? ?

1410
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,110
- We've got to factor in

1411
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:57,680
the sensitivity 
 of those of us

1412
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,160
who feel that there's 
 a spiritual and moral aspect

to this playing 
 to the homosexual,

1415
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:12,560
It makes it different 
 from anything else.

- Oh, sh... 

1417
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,670
- I wish they'd shut 
 their mouths and go to work

1418
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,010
and keep their private matters 
 to themselves

1419
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,640
and get their mentality 
 out of their crotches.

1420
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,580
- I'm here today because 
 Jesse Helms is the devil.

1421
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,520
Jesse Helms 
 has worked for years

1422
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,180
to do as much 
 as he possibly can

1423
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,120
to ensure the continuance 
 of the AIDS epidemic.

1424
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,020
- The disease is spreading 
 because of him,

1425
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,080
and people are dying 
 because of him.

1426
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,520
- This is an educational effort.

1427
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,820
It's not a violation 
 of people's property rights.

1428
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,420
We've been very careful that 
 absolutely no damage is done,

1429
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,860
and if any damage is done,

1430
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,200
whatever it is, 
 we'll be happy to pay for it.

1431
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,000
We have the money with us 
 to pay for it.

1432
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,470
- You guys don't want to tangle 
 with these people

1433
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,500
'cause you don't want 
 to get AIDS.

1434
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,570
I know, but what's next?

1435
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,240
Come on, get out.

1436
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,210
- If they would 
 keep their mouths shut

1437
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,710
and go about their business

1438
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,380
with whatever 
 their sexual orientation is,

1439
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,610
nobody would ever say a word,

1440
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,210
and we wouldn't know anything 
 about it.

1441
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,880
But, no, 
 they march in the streets,

1442
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,720
and they defy you to say 
 anything about it.

1443
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,660
Well, they don't like me, 
 and I don't like them.

1444
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,060
- Back off the property.

1445
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,960
- Bunch of 'em climbed up 
 on my house in Arlington

1446
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,870
and hoisted about 
 a 35-foot canvas, uh, condom,

1447
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,060
one day, 
 in protest of me.

1448
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,040
[upbeat jazzy music, 
 cheering]

1449
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,170
- Fight AIDS! 
 Fight AIDS!

1450
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,610
Fight AIDS! 
 Fight!

1451
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,840
- ? I'll be glad ?

1452
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,180
? When you're dead, 
 you rascal, you ?

1453
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,280
[music fades and ends]

1454
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,790
- Sir, when we started 
 this colloquy,

1455
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,310
I thought 
 I was on your side,

1456
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,820
particularly 
 on the First Amendment.

1457
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,120
And under 
 the First Amendment,

1458
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,720
people don't have to 
 shut their mouths.

1459
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,090
They have a right to speak.

1460
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:47,570
- Well, uh...they can speak,

1461
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,730
uh, just so long as, uh,

1462
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,400
they don't offend 
 anybody else,

1463
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,340
uh, I suppose.

1464
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:58,780
[monks vocalizing]

1465
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,110
- Make sure your second coming

1466
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,980
is a safe one.

1467
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,120
Use condoms.

1468
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,450
Are you shooting?

1469
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,780
- Yeah.

1470
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,880
I just turned it on.

1471
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,480
Okay, rolling.

1472
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,630
Tell him we're rolling.

1473
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,790
- The machine is rolling.

1474
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,330
You can start talking now, 
 honey.

1475
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,470
- Oh, I didn't know 
 she meant now.

1476
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,310
What I was gonna say was, 
 I just love... 

1477
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,840
I love so much 
 to go up to the tenth floor

1478
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,320
because no one 
 ever had explained to me

1479
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:46,150
that there was going to be light 
 again in the world

1480
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:50,960
and that the whole world 
 wasn't going to be dark.

1481
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,330
Some great challenges face us 
 as young people.

1482
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,340
We're in our 20s, and... 

1483
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,170
and this is the challenge

1484
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,830
that's been placed 
 in front of me.

1485
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,400
And, who knows, 
 little camera.

1486
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,680
Lots of other blind, deaf men

1487
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:12,050
have lived happy lives.

1488
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,220
There are...  
 there are many years to come.

1489
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,530
Let's hope.

1490
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,390
So...

1491
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,700
What the hell?

1492
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:28,860
Life is worth living.

1493
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,390
[chuckles] 
 lsn't it?

1494
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:46,880
- The death rate 
 just kept on climbing.

1495
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,220
We realized that science

1496
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,310
really was up against 
 a brick wall.

1497
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,220
We kept getting new drugs 
 approved

1498
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,890
to prevent 
 opportunistic infections,

1499
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,590
and then somebody would just 
 get another infection.

1500
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,130
- So, Peter, 
 where are we going?

1501
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,930
- We're gonna be going 
 to the headquarters

1502
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:40,100
of Daiichi pharmaceutical 
 companies of Japan.

1503
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,300
This is 
 their U.S. headquarters,

1504
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,930
and we're blockading 
 their offices

1505
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,100
because they have a drug

1506
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,440
that's important 
 both to AIDS activists

1507
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,610
and to cancer activists,

1508
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:55,450
specifically 
 breast cancer,

1509
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,120
that they've been 
 dragging their feet on

1510
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,950
for over two years now,

1511
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,290
and we don't understand why,

1512
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,130
but we certainly are gonna 
 try to let them understand

1513
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,190
why we're concerned.

1514
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,220
And, everybody...

1515
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:11,790
- Wait for you 
 at the end of the hall.

1516
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,300
- Just wait 
 outside the elevators.

1517
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,810
- Shh.

1518
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,970
- Hey.

1519
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,480
Hi, we're with ACT UP.

1520
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,480
We're doing 
 an act of civil disobedience.

1521
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:24,310
Please remain calm.

1522
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,320
Jim, it's Peter. 
 We're in.

1523
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,620
Send all the press.

1524
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,520
- Hello, 
 we're from ACT UP New York.

1525
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,160
- You already have the blood

1526
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,260
of several thousand people 
 on your hands,

1527
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,500
and those of us like me

1528
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,160
who have Kaposi's sarcoma 
 are gonna die,

1529
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,640
and we are here 
 until we get arrested.

1530
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,840
- You seem to know nothing 
 about the actual details

1531
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,500
of the development 
 of this drug.

1532
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,210
Maybe you're just 
 not telling us.

1533
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,110
- Mr. Borsic, have you scheduled 
 a meeting with the FDA?

1534
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,410
- Yeah, as soon as we can.

1535
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,850
- We have helped many companies 
 through this process.

1536
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,340
We can take a drug from 
 your test tube to the market

1537
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,690
in under two years 
 if you work with us,

1538
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,520
and we will pave the way 
 for you

1539
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,360
with the Food and Drug 
 Administration.

1540
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,860
But this total reluctance 
 on your part

1541
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,090
is gonna get you nowhere.

1542
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,030
- Have been used in people 
 for 30 years.

1543
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:19,130
- lt'll end up killing us, 
 all right?

1544
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,040
- See this dark mark 
 on my forehead?

1545
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,370
That's Kaposi's sarcoma.

1546
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,880
It's gonna spread!

1547
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,210
It's gonna kill me.

1548
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,870
You coming to my funeral?

1549
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,380
Because you're the man 
 fucking responsible.

1550
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,750
You are my murderer 
 in your shirt and tie.

1551
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:41,220
- Do you think 
 that you'll live to see a cure?

1552
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,390
- No.

1553
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,860
I don't.

1554
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,730
- Do you think 
 that you'll live?

1555
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,630
- No. No.

1556
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,800
- You expect to die from this?

1557
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,810
[somber music]

1558
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:04,840
? ?

1559
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,750
- The anger just mounted 
 and mounted and mounted

1560
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,760
the more people 
 who were dying.

1561
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,590
Once a week, we met.

1562
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:16,790
And at that meeting,

1563
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,920
a lot of people came 
 who were just terrified

1564
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,090
they weren't gonna be alive 
 even the next week.

1565
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,570
What can we do? 
 How can we get there?

1566
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,060
- I think ACT UP's anger 
 turned in

1567
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,940
after having been directed out 
 so long.

1568
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,310
In its first few years,

1569
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,780
Treatment and Data pretty much 
 got everything it wanted

1570
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,280
from the floor of ACT UP,

1571
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,450
but as Treatment and Data 
 was becoming

1572
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,460
more and more technical,

1573
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:49,790
there were a lot of people in 
 the general membership of ACT UP

1574
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,630
that saw that as an elite,

1575
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,460
and that maybe 
 it would be better

1576
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:59,600
if that elite 
 was pulled in a bit.

1577
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,300
- There was a fear, I think,

1578
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:05,740
that we were getting too close 
 to the people in power,

1579
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,210
that we would compromise 
 our own principles.

1580
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:13,150
And the people who were more 
 interested in the social issues

1581
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,780
became uncomfortable 
 with that.

1582
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,310
- I remember 
 this very divisive moment

1583
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:18,150
where, um, you know,

1584
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:20,320
there was a proposal 
 for moratorium

1585
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,820
on meeting with drug companies, 
 and someone... 

1586
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,160
for six months... 

1587
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,820
and there was a huge 
 and impassioned debate over it,

1588
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:28,990
and someone said... 

1589
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,830
a woman who was not 
 HlV-positive said,

1590
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,170
"Well, it's not like 
 it's for the rest of your life."

1591
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,170
And for a lot of people 
 in the room,

1592
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,970
it was the rest of their life.

1593
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:41,000
crowd: Act up! 
 Fight back!

1594
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,170
Fight AIDS!

1595
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:45,670
- There were inevitable 
 splits in priorities.

1596
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,550
- You know it quite well. 
 - I know.

1597
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,180
- And it was completely 
 left out

1598
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,350
of the NlH research agenda.

1599
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,690
- I agree. 
 I... I ... 

1600
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,350
- I remember a lot of 
 dirty tricks that happened

1601
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:00,520
and a lot of fear 
 within the organization

1602
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:03,530
that the various factions 
 had done this to each other.

1603
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,200
- Mark Harrington,

1604
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,530
Mark Harrington,

1605
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,870
there's a video camera 
 here now.

1606
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,530
Would you like 
 to take an oath

1607
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,740
that you will not write nasty 
 anonymous letters to people?

1608
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,540
- I've been getting 
 some hate letters too,

1609
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,710
but those are unsigned.

1610
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,220
I don't ever...  
 I don't ever... 

1611
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,880
- So you'll keep on 
 writing nasty letters to people?

1612
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,220
- There were a lot of charges

1613
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,350
in the midst of that, 
 of sabotage and threats.

1614
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:30,520
- Our last speaker is...  
 is Larry Kramer.

1615
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,720
- Why didn't you 
 answer the charges?

1616
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,890
- Bill, you're gonna 
 have a chance to talk.

1617
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,090
All right, everybody's... 

1618
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,230
- Don't lecture me,

1619
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:39,740
you stupid, lazy, 
 incompetent shithead!

1620
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,140
- Bill, 
 everybody got the flyer... 

1621
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,900
[both speaking at once]

1622
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,540
- You can't just lick his ass 
 before he talks!

1623
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,910
- Shut the fuck up 
 and let him answer!

1624
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,070
- Look, there are a lot of 
 people in the audience

1625
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,410
who want to ask 
 and talk about treatment,

1626
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,420
and I think it's important 
 that we allow that to happen.

1627
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:58,320
- Oh, we're gonna dictate 
 free speech now?

1628
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,790
- You're the one 
 who's interfering

1629
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,950
with speech right now.

1630
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,460
- Go back to GMHC

1631
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,760
or whatever AIDS pimp operation 
 is paying you.

1632
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,760
You're making the same point 
 George Bush made... 

1633
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,430
- Plague!

1634
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,260
We are in the middle 
 of a fucking plague!

1635
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,630
And you behave like this!

1636
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,240
Plague!

1637
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,150
40 million infected people 
 is a fucking plague!

1638
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,790
We are in the worst shape

1639
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:40,460
we have ever, ever, 
 ever been in!

1640
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,130
All those pills we're shoveling 
 down our throats,

1641
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,290
forget it!

1642
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,460
ACT UP has been taken over 
 by a lunatic fringe.

1643
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,670
They can't get together.

1644
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,940
Nobody agrees with anything.

1645
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,310
All we can do

1646
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,470
is field a couple hundred people 
 in a demonstration!

1647
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:00,140
That's not gonna make anybody 
 pay attention!

1648
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:03,810
Not until we get millions 
 out there!

1649
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,480
And we can't do that!

1650
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,490
All we do 
 is pick at each other

1651
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,620
and yell at each other!

1652
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,250
And I say to you 
 in year ten

1653
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,490
the same thing 
 I said to you in 1981

1654
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:20,830
when there were 41 cases.

1655
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:23,000
Until we get our acts 
 together,

1656
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,670
all of us,

1657
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:29,540
we are as good as dead.

1658
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,010
- In the end, 
 the Treatment and Data guys... 

1659
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:38,350
Peter, Garance, Mark, 
 and some others... 

1660
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:42,690
split off and formed 
 their own separate organization.

1661
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,700
- TAG was one of the little 
 mercury balls

1662
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:47,360
that flew off the main body 
 of ACT UP.

1663
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,730
A more sort of "think tank" 
 type project came about.

1664
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,210
- Mr. Harrington, 
 a TAG member,

1665
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,040
educated at Harvard College,

1666
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,200
and he has worked 
 for a long time

1667
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,210
on experimental treatments 
 for the disease

1668
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,210
and also the basic science.

1669
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:08,380
And Mr. Gonsalves 
 was born in Long lsland

1670
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,480
and attended Tufts University, 
 also a TAG member.

1671
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,050
I guess 
 I can do nothing better

1672
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:17,390
than to turn this conference 
 over to my speakers.

1673
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:18,550
[chuckles]

1674
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,890
- I noticed that you're both

1675
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:23,560
sitting up there 
 in suits and ties.

1676
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,070
Do you feel that 
 your approach

1677
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,730
is better than circling 
 NlH buildings

1678
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,240
and so forth?

1679
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,250
- I think that we 
 like to keep our options open,

1680
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,650
but it's silly to risk arrest

1681
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,310
and the hassles 
 that are attendant upon it

1682
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,410
if you can get serious attention 
 and negotiations going

1683
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,920
with other measures.

1684
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,580
- We've just released 
 a report,

1685
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,960
a critique of 
 all the NlH's AIDS programs.

1686
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,260
- The research is spread out 
 over 12 agencies.

1687
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,420
There's no coordination.

1688
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,260
There's a lot of duplication.

1689
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,770
There's no leadership.

1690
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,430
- The budget is shrinking 
 and shrinking as cases mount,

1691
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,100
and the president 
 needs to be blamed,

1692
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,500
as well as the Congress,

1693
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,270
who cut the entire NlH budget

1694
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,170
by $150 million 
 two weeks ago.

1695
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,610
- Our recommendations, 
 I think,

1696
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,610
are gonna require 
 some legislation.

1697
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:13,280
So we have to go 
 to our friends on the hill

1698
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,810
and see what wonders 
 they can work for us.

1699
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,860
[somber music]

1700
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:26,450
? ?

1701
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,470
- We had 
 this one particular compound

1702
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,300
that looked like 
 it may have had the potency

1703
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,960
and the physical properties 
 that we wanted,

1704
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,940
and it could be 
 a possible drug.

1705
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:37,440
- We said, you know, 
 "Let's put this

1706
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,880
in HlV-infected individuals, 
 and let's see what happens."

1707
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,310
So we went into 
 HlV-infected individuals

1708
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,970
with this drug 
 called Crixivan,

1709
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,180
and you could see 
 a very substantial drop

1710
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,840
just with 
 the one protease inhibitor;

1711
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,080
you could see a very substantial 
 drop in virus load.

1712
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,420
So that was the first week.

1713
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,150
The second week 
 was very disappointing,

1714
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,180
because what we saw 
 in the second week was, in fact,

1715
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,990
the virus load 
 coming right back up again.

1716
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,190
One exception.

1717
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,170
- There was one patient that... 

1718
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,830
patient 143, I believe, 
 was his name... his number... 

1719
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,570
that the virus went down 
 and stayed down.

1720
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,170
- That told us 
 that it was possible.

1721
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,680
If it can happen in one,

1722
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,510
then by definition 
 it can happen in everyone.

1723
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,410
You just need to figure out 
 how to do it.

1724
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,680
That puts you 
 in a completely different place

1725
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,850
and in a completely different 
 state of mind.

1726
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,180
So then the question became,

1727
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,690
"Okay, now what do 
 we need to do

1728
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,990
in order to make it 
 possible?"

1729
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,190
[cheers and applause, 
 whistles blowing]

1730
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,700
- This is the beginning 
 of the primary season

1731
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,600
to elect the next president.

1732
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,690
We want to send a message 
 to all of the candidates:

1733
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,830
we have not seen them actively 
 address the AIDS plague,

1734
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:45,360
and we thought it would be best 
 to send a message

1735
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,040
by voting with our feet 
 in the streets.

1736
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,780
I want to call for 
 a massive march on Washington.

1737
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,550
The weekend the AIDS quilt 
 is gonna be there,

1738
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:59,390
we have got to 
 surround the White House

1739
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,290
with people 
 concerned about AIDS

1740
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:05,560
to push Bush 
 out of the White House!

1741
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,590
[cheers and applause]

1742
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,730
- Last night, a man with AIDS 
 heckled Clinton,

1743
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,570
charging that 
 he had a bad record

1744
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,900
on fighting AIDS 
 in Arkansas.

1745
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,070
- When voter Bob Rafsky 
 met Bill Clinton,

1746
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,740
it was anything 
 but pleasant.

1747
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,580
- We're dying in this state!

1748
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,740
What are you going to do 
 about AIDS?

1749
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,410
- First of all, 
 it will become

1750
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,010
a part of my obsession 
 as president.

1751
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,250
- That's why 
 I'm running for president,

1752
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,760
to do something about it.

1753
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,090
- Now, will you just calm down?

1754
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,430
[laughter and applause]

1755
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,090
I feel your pain!

1756
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,430
I feel your pain.

1757
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:47,100
But if you want to attack me 
 personally,

1758
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,540
you're no better 
 than Jerry Brown

1759
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,800
and all the rest 
 of these people

1760
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,600
who say whatever sounds good 
 in the moment.

1761
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,900
If you want something 
 to be done,

1762
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,600
you ask me a question, 
 and you listen.

1763
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,770
If you don't agree with me,

1764
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,610
go support somebody else 
 for president,

1765
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,120
but quit talking to me 
 like that.

1766
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:00,950
This is not a matter 
 of personal attack;

1767
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,780
it's a matter of human loss.

1768

[applause and cheering]

1769
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,130
- I came here tonight 
 because I'm dying from AIDS.

1770
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,790
And it doesn't matter to me 
 who the next president is

1771
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,960
if they don't change 
 11 years of government neglect

1772
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,630
of this epidemic.

1773
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,460
- Is this on? 
 This isn't on.

1774
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,900
Um, okay, first off,

1775
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,810
what happened this week was,

1776
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,870
AIDS became an issue 
 in this campaign.

1777

[applause and cheering]

1778

 a Rhodes scholar.

1787
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,080
It gets you 
 into a world of trouble.

[laughter]

1789
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,950
It looks like 
 what we have to do

1790
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:19,360
is to keep forcing these clowns 
 to say the right thing

1791
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,520
so that if one of them happens 
 to become president,

1792
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,000
we can hold them accountable 
 for doing the right thing.

1793
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,260
- Yeah.

1794
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,530
- But I just...  
 it's always important to say

1795
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,200
that we all know that

1796
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,870
the names of the people 
 who might save our lives

1797
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,540
are not Bill Clinton 
 and Jerry Brown, et cetera.

1798
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,050
The names of the people 
 who might save our lives

1799
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,880
are lris Long, 
 Mark Harrington,

Peter Staley, et cetera.

1801
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,550
And they're the ones 
 who will be remembered

1802
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,380
as the heroes 
 of this epidemic,

1803
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,050
as well as those 
 who have gone before.

1806
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,520
- Well, I haven't showered,

1807
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,560
so I'm not surprised 
 that you would say that.

No, I've just been writing, 
 and...

I was up at 5:00 a.m. 
 yesterday.

- Yes!

01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,840

Still, it's like 
 making something beautiful

1841

out of the epidemic.

1842
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,270
And I felt like 
 doing something like this

1843
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,470
is a way of showing

1844
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:43,940
there's nothing beautiful 
 about it.

1845

You know, 
 this is what I'm left with.

I've got a box full of ashes 
 and bone chips.

You know, 
 there's no beauty in that.

1848
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,670
And I felt like a statement 
 like this is like saying,

1849
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,680
"This is what George Bush 
 has done," you know?

1850
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,840
This is what him

1851
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,410
and Ronald Reagan before him 
 have done.

01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,550
- I can't tell you 
 where it's coming from,

1907
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,390
but I am very much concerned 
 about AIDS,

1908
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,890
and I believe that we've got

1909
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:24,890
the best researchers 
 in the world

1910
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:27,230
out there at NlH 
 working the problem.

1911
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,730
It's one of the few diseases

1912
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,390
where behavior matters.

1913
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,060
And I once called on somebody,

1914
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,400
"Well, change your behavior."

1915
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,060
If the behavior you're using,

1916
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,070
uh, prone to cause AIDS,

1917
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,170
change the behavior.

1918
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:39,230
Next thing I know,

1919
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,570
one of these ACT UP groups 
 is out,

1920
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,580
saying, "Bush ought 
 to change his behavior."

1921
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,610
You can't talk about it 
 rationally.

1922
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:09,100
- Let everyone here know

1923
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,270
that this is not 
 a political funeral

1924
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,440
for Mark Fisher,

1925
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,110
who wouldn't let us burn

1926
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:22,610
or bury his courage

1927
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,920
or his love for us

1928
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,450
any more than he would let 
 the earth take his body

1929
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:32,450
until it was already 
 in flight.

1930
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,120
He asked for this ceremony

1931
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,290
not so we could bury him

1932
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:42,640
but so we could celebrate 
 his undying anger.

1933
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:45,970
This isn't a political funeral 
 for Mark;

1934
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:47,980
it's a political funeral

1935
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:52,470
for the man who killed him 
 and so many others

1936
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,820
and is slowly killing me,

1937
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:58,510
whose name curls my tongue

1938
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,920
and curdles my breath.

1939
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:06,160
George Bush, we believe 
 you'll be defeated tomorrow

1940
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,490
because we believe

1941
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:10,830
there's still some justice left 
 in the universe

1942
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:15,330
and some compassion left 
 in the American people.

1943
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:18,000
But whether or not you are,

1944
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,000
here and now, 
 standing by Mark's body,

1945
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,840
we put this curse on you.

1946
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,850
Mark's spirit will haunt you

1947
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,510
until the end of your days,

1948
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:34,180
so that in the moment 
 of your defeat,

1949
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:36,520
you'll remember our defeats.

1950
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,530
And in the moment 
 of your death,

1951
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,190
you'll remember our deaths.

1952
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:48,690
As for Mark, when the living 
 can no longer speak,

1953
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:52,110
the dead may speak for them.

1954
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,700
Mark's voice is here with us,

1955
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,210
as is the voice of Pericles,

1956
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:02,880
who, two millennia ago, 
 warned the Athenian soldiers

1957
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,890
who didn't have to die

1958
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,550
and in whose death 
 he was complicit

1959
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:10,390
but who had the nobility 
 to say

1960
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:14,560
that their memorial 
 was the whole Earth.

1961
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,060
Let the whole Earth 
 hear us now.

1962
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,900
We beg, we pray, we demand

1963
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:26,240
that this epidemic end!

1964
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:30,080
Not just so we may live

1965
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,580
but so that Mark's soul

1966
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,590
may rest in peace at last.

1967
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,250
In anger and in grief,

1968
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,960
this fight is not over 
 till all of us are safe.

1969
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:56,940
Act up.

1970
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:58,270
Fight back.

1971
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,610
Fight AIDS.

1977
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,740
- The debate over AIDS therapy

1978
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,210
has reignited 
 with a new European study

1979
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,540
that challenges 
 the effectiveness of AZT,

1980
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,710
the widely prescribed drug 
 used to treat the HlV virus.

1981
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,710
- This study disproves 
 what every other study proves,

1982
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,550
is that the drug is at best 
 modest, mostly useless,

1983
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:56,020
not good for you 
 in the beginning.

1984
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:59,090
- Two other drugs, 
 ddl and ddC,

1985
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,890
were approved because 
 they were as good as AZT,

1986
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:04,900
which means that they might not 
 be very useful either.

1987
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:07,400
All this 
 is profoundly dispiriting

1988
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,430
for advocates 
 of people with AIDS.

1989
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:12,070
- We thought we had made 
 some advance in AIDS treatment

1990
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,580
over the last five years,

1991
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:16,240
and these studies show 
 that we really haven't.

1992
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,250
- Many activists now admit

1993
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,180
their demands 
 were shortsighted.

1994
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,240
- It's been a huge expenditure,

1995
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,080
a waste of money 
 for the U.S. taxpayer,

1996
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,090
and it was a naiveté 
 on our part

1997
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,720
to think that the magic bullet 
 was out there.

1998
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,090
It just had to be tested 
 in humans and, uh...

1999
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,650
given to us as the cure.

2000
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,100
- Many doctors and scientists

2001
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:39,260
say the bleak results 
 presented here

2002
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,100
indicate the U.S. government

2003
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:43,110
needs to 
 substantially reorganize

2004
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,610
the way it conducts 
 AIDS research.

Robert Bazell, NBC News, 
 Berlin.

2006
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,280
- There's been this big crisis 
 at St. Vincent's

2007
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,780
about the way that we talk about 
 the, uh... 

2008
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:02,160
what happened in Berlin.

2009
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,630
Couple of doctors said 
 they were

2010
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:06,190
afraid of people 
 committing suicide now.

2011
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:10,460
- I don't feel like, 
 "Oh, now I just"... 

2012
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,630
I don't feel, 
 "Oh, now I want to give up.

2013
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:15,800
Now I want to stop living 
 because AZT doesn't work."

2014
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,140
- I've felt forever now

2015
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:18,970
that I'm not gonna outlive 
 this epidemic,

2016
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,140
that I will...  
 that I will die from this.

2017
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,970
- You know, 
 maybe that is our future,

2018
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:24,640
that we're gonna 
 watch each other die.

2019
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,650
It's... that's not a new thought.

2020
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,020
We've been thinking that 
 ever since we started the group.

2021
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,650
- The way that the recent 
 spate of deaths is... 

2022
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:34,820
I don't know.

2023
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:37,330
It all seems 
 so much more apocalyptic.

2024
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:41,320
Like, the story doesn't seem

2025
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,490
to have this relationship 
 to effective treatment

2026
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:45,830
or a cure anymore.

2027
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,000
It now seems to have 
 this relationship to death.

2028
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,010
It ends...  
 it ends with everybody dying.

- Joining me now 
 is Dr. David Kessler,

2033
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,420
the commissioner of the 
 Food and Drug Administration.

2034
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,950
Dr. Kessler, how excited

2035
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:11,360
should we get about 
 this new family of drugs,

2036
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:13,020
these protease inhibitors?

2037
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,860
- I don't want to overpromise,

2038
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,370
but these are 
 the most potent drugs

2039
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,300
we've seen against the virus.

2040
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,430
- I know that 
 you are pushing

2041
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:23,800
for faster FDA approval 
 of these drugs.

2042
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,540
I know that the application 
 has just gone

2043
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,200
for the first of these drugs 
 to the FDA.

2044
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,610
It's still 
 gonna take six months.

2045
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:32,550
- We will turn around that 
 application as quick as ever.

2046
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:35,550
We're approving drugs in 
 a matter of months these days.

2047
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,880
- But you were telling me 
 that's six months, right?

2048
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,150
That's as quick as possible.

2049
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:40,990
- We may be able to do it 
 even a little quicker.

2050
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,390
- A split has developed

2051
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,220
between those 
 who want rapid approval

2052
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,890
based on early indicators 
 of success

2053
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:49,400
and the Treatment Action Group, 
 or TAG.

2054
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:51,560
TAG has asked the FDA 
 to reconsider

2055
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,570
the accelerated 
 approval process.

2056
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,570
- We told the FDA, 
 "No."

2057
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,730
"The company has asked you 
 to approve that drug too soon.

2058
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:02,400
They need a little bit 
 more data first."

2059
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,710
- TAG is asking the FDA 
 to take a closer look

2060
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:07,580
at saquinavir, 
 the first protease inhibitor

2061
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,810
to seek approval.

2062
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,980
- We need to make sure

2063
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,750
we don't repeat 
 the mistake we made

2064
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,120
with AZT and ddl.

2065
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,920
This is a new class of drugs.

2066
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,550
We need to know if it works.

2067
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,650
The battle over 
 early approval of saquinavir

2068
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,600
was a really pivotal moment 
 for treatment activism.

2069
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:28,900
And we took such shit for it, 
 from within.

2070
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,410
- There are a lot of people 
 who do agree

2071
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,170
that there are problems, 
 serious problems,

2072
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:35,180
the way drug testing 
 and drug trials are run.

2073
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:39,770
But there are many of us 
 who feel that halting

2074
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,120
accelerated approval 
 is not necessarily the answer.

2075
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,480
- TAG made their proposal

2076
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,120
for this large simple trial 
 of 18,000 people

2077
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,990
that they want to put 
 in a placebo control trial

2078
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:53,290
where 1/3 would get placebo.

2079
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:56,960
They pushed this idea on the FDA 
 at a secret meeting,

2080
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,130
which was not announced 
 to the community.

2081
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:02,300
This is something we have fought 
 hard and long for.

2082
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,400
We've been arrested to get 
 accelerated approval through.

2083
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,810
- It's the behavior 
 that I have a problem with.

2084
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,570
It's the work they're doing

2085
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,440
that I have a problem with, 
 and it's... 

2086
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,970
this is what I am gonna fight.

2087
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,420
I'm not interested 
 in mud wrestling with the boys.

2088
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:17,820
I am absolutely enraged 
 that there are people

2089
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:21,150
who have appointed themselves 
 elitist representatives

2090
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,490
and represent themselves

2091
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,150
as the single voice 
 of this epidemic.

2092
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,490
I am gonna fight them,

2093
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,000
my patients 
 are gonna fight them,

2094
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,830
and you goddamn well 
 better fight them!

2095
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,860
[cheers and applause]

2096
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,330
- Apparently there was 
 a big discussion

2097
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,670
on accelerated approval 
 and protease drug development

2098
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:41,180
Iast week on the floor,

2099
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:44,670
so we just wanted to give you 
 sort of the TAG perspective

2100
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,680
and give you a sense 
 of our proposal

2101
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,120
around protease 
 drug development

2102
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,350
so we can start 
 from a baseline

2103
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,940
of common understanding 
 and knowledge.

2104
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:54,290
- This proposal is not about 
 taking expanded access away,

2105
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,190
taking accelerated approval 
 away.

2106
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,690
This is about 
 adding something.

2107
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:00,360
This is about figuring out 
 how do we get information

2108
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,020
about how to actually 
 use these drugs.

2109
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:05,430
- You need more people when 
 you have a less powerful drug.

2110
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,940
If we were dealing 
 with a penicillin,

2111
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:08,870
we could do it in 20 people.

2112
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,700
So we put together 
 a large simple trial

2113
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,040
that tried to synthesize 
 expanded access

2114
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,370
in large simple trials.

2115
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:17,710
And what we did is, 
 we presented it to Merck.

2116
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,370
We presented it to the FDA.

2117
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,710
We wanted to start 
 a community discussion.

2118
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,880
- I just wanted 
 to thank Gregg and Derek

2119
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,050
for coming 
 to tell us about this.

2120
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,720
[applause]

2121
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,880
Because we hadn't heard anything

2122
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:31,990
until we read about it 
 in Barron's.

2123
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:33,460
- If you wanted to hear 
 the proposal,

2124
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:34,900
you could have heard it 
 40 times.

2125
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,330
It's been talked about 
 all over.

2126
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,060
- Dr. Cotler wants to speak.

2127
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,570
- TAG is talking about 
 getting accurate information.

2128
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,400
ACT UP is talking about 
 making drugs available.

2129
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,240
There should be a way 
 to mesh those two.

2130
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,070
It's really not 
 one or the other.

2131
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,810
Your two groups are really 
 talking past one another.

2132
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,250
Try not to scream.

2133
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:54,080
Try not to go at each other's 
 throats, but just talk,

2134
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,980
because the differences 
 really can be bridged.

2135
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,950
[all talking at once]

2136
01:34:58,990 --> 01:34:59,980
- No, no, no.

2137
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,320
- Hey! 
 - Shh.

01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,090
- Quiet!

2140
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:08,590
- '93 to '95 
 were the worst years.

2141
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:12,260
It was 
 a really terrifying time.

2142
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:14,290
They were the worst years.

2143
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:20,940
And then we got lucky.

2144

You know, just losing...

2151
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,660
And, uh...

2152
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:23,160
just so many...

2153
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,000
so many good people.

2154
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,670
And... 
 uh...

2155
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:32,670
You know, like any war,

2156
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,550
you wonder 
 why you came home.

[keyboard clacking]

2161
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,530
- Mark collected 
 all of our writings,

2162
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:55,470
pieces that all of us had done 
 about what had gone wrong

2163
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:57,530
in the ways that we studied 
 previous drugs

2164
01:36:57,570 --> 01:37:00,040
and what we were 
 already doing wrong

2165
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,300
in terms of trying 
 to figure out

2166
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,970
whether the protease inhibitors 
 worked,

2167
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:04,480
and we published it 
 as this big report

2168
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,450
and started passing them out 
 everywhere we went.

2169
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,880
Let's do this study.

2170
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,320
- They elevated themselves

2171
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:12,880
by their own self-education 
 about these things,

2172
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,390
and then it became 
 very, very clear

2173
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,390
that you weren't gonna 
 mess with these people,

2174
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,550
because they knew exactly 
 what you were talking about,

2175
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,060
and they knew exactly 
 what they were talking about.

2176
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,400
- Activists created a system

2177
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,730
that was able to do 
 everything

2178
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:28,070
faster, better, cheaper,

2179
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:31,370
more ethically, 
 and more effectively.

2180
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:33,240
- They forced people 
 to put together

2181
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,010
the right clinical trials,

2182
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,240
where you had the patient 
 in mind,

2183
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,580
and you weren't 
 cutting corners.

2184
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,080
And, of course, 
 the big breakthrough

2185
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,520
was combination therapy,

2186
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:45,750
'cause monotherapy 
 was clearly not the way to go.

2187
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:47,260
- So let's go back 
 into patients,

2188
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:48,590
and let's go back 
 into patients

2189
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:51,120
with Crixivan 
 plus AZT plus 3TC.

2190
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,090
- The activists 
 proposed a study design;

2191
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:54,260
industry used it.

2192
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,420
It got the drug approved 
 in six months.

2193
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,260
- So I was at a meeting 
 in Washington,

2194
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:00,930
and I stood up there,

2195
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:04,930
and I showed for the first time 
 the data in the study.

2196
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,600
- The data 
 goes up on the screen,

2197
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,770
and everyone gasps, 
 and cameras start to click.

2198
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:12,210
And just ... it's a realization 
 that this is... 

2199
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:15,120
this is a really great drug, 
 and it... it could work.

2200
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:17,280
- I remember sitting there 
 in a hotel room

2201
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,450
in Washington, D.C.,

2202
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:20,960
our hotel banquet room,

2203
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:23,290
and just crying.

2204
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:26,120
It was like, "We did it. 
 We did something."

2205
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,790
- It was too much to take in 
 at that point.

2206
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:28,920
It wasn't until we started

2207
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,960
putting the drugs 
 in our bodies

2208
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,630
and we all went home and...

2209
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:36,300
started...  
 went straight on that regimen

2210
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:38,470
that had been on that slide,

2211
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:42,810
including Crixivan 
 and two nucleoside analogues.

2212
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:44,640
And sure enough,

2213
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:47,150
it happened in us 
 within 30 days,

2214
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,310
all of us.

2215
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,550
Undetectable, undetectable, 
 undetectable.

2216
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:54,580
- The dying was stopping 
 with triple-drug combination.

2217
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:57,150
And if you needed 
 your clinical trial,

2218
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,820
you could just 
 go to these hospitals

2219
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:00,330
that were not filling up

2220
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,160
the way they were filling up 
 with people with HlV.

2221
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,500
- You would see 
 their Kaposi's sarcoma lesions

2222
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:09,840
that had been bright 
 and red and big

2223
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:11,840
melting back into their skin.

2224
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,540
- They were calling it 
 the Lazarus effect.

2225
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:16,170
People who were deathly ill 
 would get put on this drug,

2226
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:18,340
and all of a sudden, 
 they're working again.

2227
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,650
That was a phenomenal feeling.

2228
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,010
- It worked.

2229
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:24,710
You know, 
 we did something remarkable.

2230
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,190
- So that breakthrough, 
 you know,

2231
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:31,020
that we thought was gonna happen 
 in '88 or '89

2232
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:33,190
if we just worked 
 fast enough,

2233
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:34,890
you know, it did happen.

2234
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,230
But not until '96, 
 and so...

2235
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,700
You know, 
 a lot of people died.

2236
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:48,540
Maybe if Reagan had started 
 putting money into AIDS

2237
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,410
a little earlier...

2238
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,720
[sniffles]

2239
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:58,880
[sighs]

2240
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,720
They wouldn't all be dead.

2241
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,730
[sniffles]

2242
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,850
- I feel very fortunate.

2243
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:10,560
And there's probably a lot 
 of complicated reasons why,

2244
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,570
but I still 
 find it very difficult

2245
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,070
to plan for the future

2246
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,400
and/or accept that

2247
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:20,840
I will have a long life,

2248
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,510
which is unfortunate, 
 because I've had a long life,

2249
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:29,080
and I've been living with AIDS 
 for 20 years.

2250
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:34,250
But it's hard for me 
 to relax into life.

2251
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:37,260
- I know lots of us 
 went through

2252
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:40,920
really difficult times 
 after,

2253
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,090
um, trying to figure out,

2254
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:45,260
"Well, what do I do now?"

2255
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,730
You know?

2256
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:49,400
Not just because I didn't think 
 I had a future and now I do,

2257
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:53,100
so I have to make some plans, 
 but...

2258
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,770
How do I do something else 
 that is as...

2259
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:58,440
[sighs]

2260
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,280
I mean, it's a weird word,

2261
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:04,620
but as fulfilling 
 as that work has been.

2262
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:09,610
- To be that threatened

2263
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:14,790
with extinction, um...

2264
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:20,630
And to not lay down, um...

2265
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:23,470
But instead to stand up

2266
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:27,310
and to fight back.

2267
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,310
The way we did it,

2268
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:33,300
the way we took care 
 of ourselves and each other,

2269
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:36,650
the goodness that we showed,

2270
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:40,320
the humanity 
 that we showed the world

2271
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,650
is just mind-boggling,

2272
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:45,490
just incredible.

2273
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:46,550

2274
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,790
Act up! 
 Fight back!

2275
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:49,990
Fight AIDS!

2276
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:51,660
- Every single drug 
 that's out there

2277
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:54,500
is because of ACT UP, 
 I am convinced.

2278
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,840
We had the brainpower, 
 and we had the street power.

2279
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:58,840
We had the good cops 
 and the bad cops.

2280
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:00,670
The government 
 didn't get us the drugs.

2281
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,840
No one else got us the drugs.

2282
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,680
We, ACT UP, 
 got those drugs out there.

2283
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,510
It is the proudest achievement

2284
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:11,850
that the gay population 
 of this world

2285
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:13,450
can ever claim.

2286
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:15,680
- We could do it 
 because we could deliver

2287
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:18,820
hundreds and sometimes thousands 
 of bodies.

2288
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:22,350
We had people with AIDS putting 
 their bodies on the line,

2289
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,700
flopping out in the streets,

2290
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:26,000
saying, 
 "Fine, this is my body.

2291
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,370
Take me away."

2292
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:28,600
- I drew the line there.

2293
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,540
[chuckles]

2294
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,040
I didn't want 
 to get arrested.

[laughs]

2296
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,070
That far, I wouldn't go.

 with words written

 Vito Russo:

 it would not be unethical
