It would've been easier
if we'd just sold the house,

44
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,900
because the way
the market was,

45
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,565
we would've cleaned up.

46
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:11,009
But Charlie grew up
in our house;

47
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:12,581
he refused to leave.

Even though we were
barely getting by.

49

Before I was born, he had
already lived several lives

took him by surprise.

Once, when things went south
for Charlie in Saint Louis,

he had to pawn that bass.

He said that everything
really started to go wrong after that.

until he found it two years later

were considered heretical.

But that's not
what's important.

378
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,627
The thing that matters here
is that he was more accustomed

379
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:16,507
to communicating
with numbers than words.

380

- They love it.
- Oh.

Anyway, I noticed that some
of the passages repeated themselves.

I read the book again,
and sure enough they did.

somebody in the middle of nowhere

You never do.

644
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:49,597
Well, l'll get it back.

645
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,800
- How are you going to do that?
- I don't know.

646
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:52,900
But I will.

647
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,538
Well, I guess I'd better
get a move on

648
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:56,379
since I'm going
to have to take the bus.

649
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,251
Can't you get a friend
to give you a ride?

650
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:01,158
I don't have any friends.

651
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:05,064
What about that skinny one
who only eats carrots?

652
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,399
Carrots-and-Mountain Dew-Julia?

653
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:07,963
Right, Julia,
carrots, right.

654
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:09,100
She had an eating disorder.

655
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,808
She went to the hospital
and died.

656
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,441
Oh.

657
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,081
Well, in that case, maybe I can
go back down and get the car.

658
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,285
I'm sure he hasn't
sold it yet.

659
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,329
It wasn't that the car
was in such great shape.

660
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:21,663
- I'm sure the car...
- Stop! Stop!

661
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,169
I loved that car.

662
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:24,969
I know you did.

663
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,806
No, you didn't
because I never told you.

664
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,280
Why? Because you never listen.

665
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:31,184
All right, I'm an asshole.
That has been established.

666

Not to the extent that
I'm about to establish it.

667
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:37,665
You make fun of everything
I do, including my job.

No, it's wild.

You don't take anything seriously, do you?

673
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:51,224
You think the world
is just here for your amusement.

674
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:53,422
- Look at the world.
- I do.

I have to live in it.

he'd never pawn it again.

Come on, come on!

757
00:50:46,165 --> 00:50:48,192
[Miranda]
One of them is named Mike.

758
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:50,966
And the other one
is named Bruce.

759
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,807
Security guards
have master keys,

760
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,112
but the manager,
he's the only one

761
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:58,620
who has the great
grand master key.

762
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,320
It opens every single door.

763
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,795
He calls it the "God" key.

play a little volleyball.

00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:36,523
Did you get sort of
a weird vibe

778
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:39,194
from these people?

779
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,364
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

780
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,707
That's because they're swingers.

781
00:51:43,778 --> 00:51:46,078
What?

782
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:48,143
Do I gotta draw you
a picture?

783
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:50,487
What are you
talking about?

784
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:52,424
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

785
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:56,833
So nice that you don't
know everything.

786
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:59,340
Swingers, um...

787
00:51:59,442 --> 00:52:02,346
Well, they're, you know,
people who like

788
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:05,614
to spice up their life
with different partners.

789
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,348
Oh!

790

Oh, my God.

791
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:13,666
They were talking
swinger code.

792
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:16,766
Oh, God,
that is so gross!

793
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,038
What am I going to do?

794
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:19,547
Why? Wh-What's the matter?

795
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:22,485
- They invited me to a barbecue.
- They what?

796
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:24,889
You were the one that told me
to accept any and all invitations

797
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:27,020
so that I can get to know
the people and the layout.

798
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,032
But I didn't mean that
you were supposed to go and...

799
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,693
I didn't know that
they were swingers.

800
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:32,967
It's cool, all right?
It's cool, it's cool.

in the 16th century in Spain.

He made up this place where
there was unlimited gold and pearls,

and beautiful, fierce women who
wore gold armor and rode wild beasts,
