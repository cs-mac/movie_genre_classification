1
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:51,654
Three years earlier.

2
00:00:55,788 --> 00:01:01,032
Sergeyevich found him.  Hiding in the jungles of Burma.

3
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,343
In a Karen village.

4
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:09,828
Largo lived there for three months.

5
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,161
They met earlier, when he  illegally crossed the border

6
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,800
between Thailand and Burma.

7
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:36,187
She took him to her village to heal him and he never left.

8
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:41,231
While he's there I'm counting on you to watch him

9
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,757
And if he returns?

10
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,909
Freddy don't say anything.  One day,

11
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,060
he will have to come out of hiding.

12
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:58,334
Like it or not, Largo is my successor.

13
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,824
Three years later.

14
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,014
God, oh my God!

15
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,857
Autonomous Republic of Bashkortostan .

16
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,263
Use the GPS to find the airport.

17
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:56,498
This press conference was a total failure.

18
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,613
I shouldn't have offended Nazachov.  He won't forget it.

19
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,452
Bring me that sonofabitch, Winch!

20
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:11,025
And bring that damn journalist!

21
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:16,109
Is it really necessary to go so fast?

22
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,944
D'you prefer to let them kill us?

23
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,078
Find the airport!
- I want to..

24
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,211
help, but I don't understand Cyrillic writing.

25
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,428
Let me do it.

26
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,811
I don't want to die here!

27
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,286
I have a wife and four children, I have a career.

28
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,657
I graduated from Harvard, so I hired you, huh?

29
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,688
He's right.

30
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,410
The route is wrong.

31
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,224
Turn left..

32
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:08,357
You were right, Nazachov is a little upset.

33
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:12,588
It's all your fault.  You made
him angry with your stupid questions.

34
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,907
That's my business, I'm a reporter.

35
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,708
And I do my work lady, a Managing Director

36
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,001
of a company with 394,000 employees.

37
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:29,424
Don't you care if Nazachov is a crook?

38
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,060
The contract I was supposed to sign with
Nazachov was vital for all these people.

39
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,938
Look out, be careful!

40
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,278
What are you doing?

41
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,116
No!
- Wait!

42
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,908
After 100 meters, turn...  - What are you doing?

43
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:25,184
The satellite connection has been lost.

44
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,380
Your plane is surrounded by police.
- Forget the airport!

45
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,594
Nazachov will never let us go!

46
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:15,324
In this country, everything belongs to him.

47
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,905
Police, military, everything!
- And in your opinion, is that normal?

48
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,883
Maybe..just shut up!

49
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:25,435
I know a guy who will get us out of here.  Lazarevic.

50
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,663
A mercenary,..a specialist in crisis situations.

51
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,266
Expensive, but effective.

52
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:23,107
Bosnians are often overly sensitive!

53
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:26,052
Be careful with your team choices.
This could easily turn into a massacre.

54
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,376
Lake Leman, Switzerland.

55
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,894
Hello, sir.
- I met with Mr. Jung.

56
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,483
He's waiting.

57
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,111
Come in, come in.

58
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:30,749
Thank you for seeing me.

59
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:34,535
We meet, eventually.

60
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:37,204
Mr. Jung, it is time for your medicine.
- No, later.

61
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,124
I told you later!

62
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,315
She has an exaggerated concern for
me,..it's probably love.  Help me.

63
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:57,299
Look.  This picture was taken here.

64
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,697
You guessed it.

65
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:04,091
I think you were my father's only friend.

66
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:07,716
Ah..  oldest friend, yes certainly.

67
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:11,105
This photo was taken in October 1947.

68
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,913
He had just arrived from Yugoslavia with his mother.

69
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,481
They both lived here under this roof.

70
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,514
Your grandmother remained in the
service of my parents, until her death.

71
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,482
My grandmother?

72
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,577
Yes, Nerio's mother, your grandmother, Largo.

73
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,739
I think I was the only one who knew of her existence..

74
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:37,065
Moreover, Nerio cried when she died.

75
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,923
Although he did not want to know he has a mother.

76
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,099
Please!

77
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,504
Relationships between parents and children are not always simple.

78
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,719
Nerio did not want a son.  He wanted an heir...

79
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:55,350
and gave me no choice.  Now

80
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,763
this property that he left me, I will use it my way.

81
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:02,065
I read your letter, the plan is amazing.

82
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:07,825
As a former president of the
Red Cross, I can only be excited, but...

83
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,042
But?

84
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,169
In our world, humanitarian organizations are owned by powerful people,

85
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,669
and so it always has been.

86
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,472
The rich give money to the poor, but little.

87
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,822
Very little.

88
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:29,363
If you decide to give the entire fortune to charity,

89
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:32,170
Largo, it will cause disruption.

90
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,049
So?
- You will make many enemies.

91
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,575
Very many.

92
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:42,100
And..  very influential.

93
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:48,131
A man with no enemies has no value.

94
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,763
A Boznian Proverb.

95
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:57,917
You cannot even keep track of it all.

96
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,718
Mr.  Jung.

97
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,484
Mr.  Jung?

98
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:08,123
Syringe, syringe!

99
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,358
It's there.

100
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:31,001
I'm glad we met.
- You'll be fine.

101
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:36,309
My wife died of cancer 10 years ago.

102
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:40,104
My son died in an accident.

103
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,812
It's now been almost three years.

104
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:46,289
No one else has needed me.

105
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,886
I need you.

106
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,888
Hong Kong

107
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,903
You brought me back to life.

108
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:26,722
Monsieur, captain just said

109
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,541
we passed the limits of territorial waters.

110
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,359
Thanks Gauthier.

111
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,877
Gentlemen...I will open some champagne.
Do you have a preference?

112
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:36,426
For this occasion, I recommend the bottle from 1901,

113
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:39,433
that your Dad received personally from Mikhail Gorbachev.

114
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,776
at the paper factory opening in Minsk.

115
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,987
On the other hand, as bad weather
is expected make you want to try...

116
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:49,437
pink champagne, the Laurent Perrier 2003
- Gauthier.

117
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:51,543
Whatever you decide.

118
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,797
Yes, Monsieur.

119
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,314
Please...

120
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,047
Not without regrets, Largo?

121
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,368
The sale is irrevocable,

122
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,253
in addition, the signing of

123
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,138
your access to the group accounts

124
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,450
until the completion of the transaction will be blocked.

125
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,031
While waiting for access to money from the sale, you will be poor again.

126
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,692
This is a standard contract, Mr.  Winch.

127
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:17,353
Kronberg Partners that I represent,

128
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,720
and you will be bound for two months to

129
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:22,201
guarantee that the transaction price will be indexed to the value

130
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,682
of the shares since the contract was signed.

131
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,375
If the transaction would take place today...

132
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:31,587
it's value would be, for example, 53 billion Mr.  Winch.

133
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,476
That's all?

134
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:41,670
If the stock rises, you will receive much more.

135
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,960
Just kidding Mr Beaumont.

136
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,538
Your initials and signature.

137
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:54,465
I did not really understand why signing should be done in the middle of the sea.

138
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,645
This allows us to conclude the contract

139
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:00,798
in Switzerland, where Kronberg Partners offices are located,

140
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,590
so under the tax laws of this country.

141
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,869
Just your signature.

142
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:29,566
Stop the boat immediately!

143
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:58,881
Attorney Francken would like to talk with you, Mr. Winch.

144
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,378
You could call my office to schedule an appointment.

145
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,715
It's probably already waiting at your office.

146
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,985
Ah, can you open this door, Mr. Winch?

147
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,773
This cabin is for my father's assistant,

148
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:00,560
Fred Kaplan, and he alone has the keys to it.

149
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:03,210
I told you?  - Then, I'll break the door.

150
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,083
Do what you want, just make it quick.

151
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,089
Lord!

152
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,453
Freddy?

153
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:20,540
He was strangled, perhaps 12 hours ago.

154
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,064
Now I understand, why you didn't want to open this door.

155
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:29,130
You're accusing me of murder now?
- Mr. Winch?

156
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:32,006
Calm down Mr. Winch.

157
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,506
Notify the police.

158
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:44,631
For many years, I hated Freddy,

159
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:47,345
I ran away when he found me.

160
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,090
Always.
- They were watching you.

161
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,723
They were spying.

162
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:58,319
Freddy knew very well what I was
doing in Burma three years ago.

163
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,835
He knew I had no contact with Nerio.

164
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:03,487
He would have had to testify about it.

165
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,911
Do you think that's why they killed him?

166
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:14,655
Many influential enemies, you were right.

167
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,349
Too bad I cannot help.

168
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:23,960
Do you think that Nerio was able to order it.....

169
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:27,454
a massacre?
- No!

170
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:30,025
Of course not.

171
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,861
He was my friend, I don't believe he was capable of it.

172
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:47,943
Muong Nam - Burma
Three years earlier

173
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,224
Malunai!
- Kadjang!

174
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,702
Largo is my friend.

175
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,707
Come with me, I want to introduce him to my friends.

176
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,425
A permit to pass from the Burmese army,

177
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:17,499
signed by General Kyaw Min.

178
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,272
That's right

179
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,057
Lie!

180
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,946
Stop, stop!

181
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:53,886
Stop!

182
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:59,338
Do not meddle in it!

183
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,183
Want to help him, right?

184
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,847
Want more?

185
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:01,999
Maybe I ought to kill

186
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,902
immediately.  No, let him hang,

187
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,157
learn how to talk to us.

188
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:39,179
You are part of the resistance?
- Something like that.

189
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,206
You're efficient.

190
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:45,322
Time to get out of here.

191
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:48,744
My name is Simon.

192
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,949
Simon Voralla.
- My name is Largo.

193
00:29:56,178 --> 00:30:02,089
So one day, Leonor tells me he
found a job at the French School in

194
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,971
Bangkok. As for me, I worked in
a Chinese restaurant and that's it.

195
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,217
I didn't wait too long and followed after Leonor.

196
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:12,088
I found myself some work.

197
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:14,325
Not that I have succeeded without her help.

198
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,364
I'm lost without her.

199
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:21,259
Eleanor is not a beauty, but she's nice.

200
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,249
We've known each other since I was about 12.

201
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,321
Her mother is my mother's best friend.

202
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:30,342
Next year we should get married.

203
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,692
Thailand.

204
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:43,201
She took care of everything.

205
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:51,371
Hong Kong
Three years later

206
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,769
John Waterhouse, Pandora 1896.

207
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:10,503
John Waterhouse...

208
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,495
Good morning, the password please.

209
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,219
Pandora.

210
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,954
Thanks.  Which service would you like sir?

211
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,340
I want to know my account balance.

212
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:41,062
One moment sir.

213
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:50,328
Your account balance is US$ 65,824,127.

214
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:20,591
Bangkok Airport - Thailand.

215
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:23,524
I'm not sure I'm the right person for this job sir.

216
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:26,309
I'm very bad with vehicles.

217
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,656
You must take them regularly, the only thing

218
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:32,576
that kept me alive on board your yacht.

219
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:36,691
Caraway, mixed with dried cassava and bamboo shoots..

220
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:39,444
..it's excellent.  Acts directly on nerve endings.

221
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,059
I'll take this to avoid potential problems.

222
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,668
I heard about it from one of my old friends from Peru, whom

223
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,694
I met while working for Marco Lueda.

224
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,803
Long before I started working for your father.

225
00:35:56,073 --> 00:36:00,214
I met with Lazarevic your friend, here at the airport.

226
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:03,263
I know it's effective, but we need security, you can keep your dog.

227
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:07,994
What heat! Aren't you uncomfortable?

228
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:13,512
Welcome to Bangkok. The Thai authorities informed us of your arrival.

229
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,947
Gauthier, I'm counting on you.

230
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,734
Yes sir.

231
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:55,280
Rights for Karen.

232
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,500
I am sorry sir, that you called

233
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,221
and apparently really hoped to talk,

234
00:39:57,222 --> 00:40:00,013
so I will leave a message on your voicemail.

235
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:03,774
As you asked, I tried to find one Simon Ovronnaz.

236
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:05,976
I got in touch with Eleanor, his fiancée.

237
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:08,484
Now it seems his former fiancée, but she was very un-cooperative.

238
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,515
She said that Mr. Ovronnaz left her three years ago.

239
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:13,044
Judging by the little she said, it's no way to find him.

240
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:16,564
So I gave up and did a little private investigation.

241
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,618
We talked a bit with the school guard.

242
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:22,755
A tiny man with bad breath.

243
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,412
He gave me an address, a new friend of Mr. Ovronnaz.

244
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:29,028
In fact, more true to say ex-girlfriend.

245
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,890
Thanks, you're charming.

246
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:34,173
Mr. Ovronnaz has gone to live in the south,

247
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,622
in Kasunkom, with another friend,

248
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:40,345
if you understand what I mean?

249
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:42,646
Count on me, I'll go to...

250
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:45,247
Damn, the line's cut.

251
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:18,183
I thought your commando Lazarevic devised an operation to free me...

252
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,073
I'm disappointed.

253
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:23,306
I received your message.  I haven't had

254
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:26,539
any contact with Dragan Lazarevic, since the Nazachov affair.

255
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,383
He landed in Bangkok, with a Winch Air plane.

256
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:32,314
It seems that half of his fee, quite expensive

257
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,708
was paid in Winch Air flights.

258
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,835
They do what he wants and go where he wants.

259
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:38,606
Lazarevic is a simple mercenary,

260
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:40,377
he works for whoever pays more.

261
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,336
For your concern Largo, the Thai Minister of Justice's staff arranged

262
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,665
for you to be released.
- Sorry.

263
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,540
I assure you I had nothing to do with it.

264
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,888
Of course, someone found out what happened.

265
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,204
You are an influential person, you have connections worldwide.

266
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,800
....and judging by everything, Thailand has

267
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,704
no desire to upset the Winch Group.

268
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,443
They managed to convince Francken I'm innocent?

269
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:06,259
Francken has no proof.
- There is a witness.

270
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,932
There was..as I said.  Thai authorities took care of everything.

271
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:35,867
Let's go, Largo.

272
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:38,669
Largo!  Excuse him.

273
00:43:18,218 --> 00:43:21,017
Military Base Makiling, Burma

274
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,687
Enter.

275
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:39,286
Go.

276
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:53,661
Hong Kong

277
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,109
Hello, Mr. Cochrane.

278
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,086
Mr.  Winch, isn't here?  - That's right.

279
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:19,626
I heard that he...disappeared.

280
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:22,151
Mr.  Winch assigned me to act

281
00:44:22,152 --> 00:44:24,675
on his behalf to find a buyer.

282
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:27,653
As I said, we have a serious offer.

283
00:44:27,654 --> 00:44:30,682
OK, so where is it?
- Please come with me.

284
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:32,476
Mr. Cochrane.

285
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,663
UN Headquarters in Geneva - Switzerland

286
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:29,072
Vladimir Podolsky chief cabinet minister.

287
00:46:29,073 --> 00:46:31,311
How was your trip?
- Thanks, well.

288
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:33,221
This is my assistant.  - Nice to meet you.

289
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:35,561
We apologize for the delay.  He has already come?

290
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:37,224
Are like Swiss watches

291
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:38,887
Their punctuality, legendary.  Welcome.

292
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:45,129
Why are you interested to know what is with this secret bank deposit, Ms. Prosecutor?

293
00:47:19,776 --> 00:47:21,540
Let us know.

294
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:46,416
Wear it.  I dine with a real woman.

295
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:49,177
That will not be a violation of the rules in our fair.

296
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,814
Go and change you!

297
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:09,482
You did a good job.

298
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,874
Winch, has done everything possible to find out where you are.

299
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,721
I contacted.

300
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:50,715
Wonderful.

301
00:48:53,746 --> 00:48:55,576
Truly magnificent.

302
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:02,596
Sit.

303
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,130
After a Winch Peter to give me the money your release,

304
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:14,605
I will leave this jungle.
In this country sucks.

305
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:22,262
You become a different person.

306
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:27,771
And to begin a new life.

307
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:31,993
You could go with me.

308
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:34,100
I'll take care of you.

309
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:38,352
I'll treat you like a princess.

310
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:48,605
You forget that you cannot refuse me anything?

311
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,948
Have you forgotten so soon?

312
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:04,180
Maine sent a jeep to bring him on Winch.

313
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,364
Just give us money
we will kill.

314
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:10,418
Both.

315
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,195
I feel bad again, sir.  As you asked me sir,

316
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:19,110
my mission of looking for Mr.  Ovronnaz,

317
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:22,289
despite their efforts, it is far from complete.

318
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,639
I must mention that pregnancy

319
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,988
I said, it is not so simple.  Oh my God.

320
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,121
Despising all possible risks,

321
00:50:29,122 --> 00:50:31,648
continue my investigation without rest,

322
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,903
and do not hesitate to venture through a Thailand

323
00:50:33,904 --> 00:50:36,045
which I would call it picturesque.

324
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:40,515
My old scout skills,
help me handle the country that odd, but not hostile

325
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:43,053
and to get in touch with the local population.

326
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:46,104
I would say that sometimes some people are really warm.

327
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:48,961
Returning to Mr.  Simon Ovronnaz,

328
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,339
I have not found Kasunkom.  He had problems of a financial nature.

329
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,833
If I understand correctly from his fiancée, former fiancée,

330
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:57,884
luckily managed to find a new path.

331
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:00,086
in Bangkok.

332
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,175
I hope Monsieur, you do not

333
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:04,263
angry for what happened, I worry for you I

334
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:09,695
Where are you?  Call me...  Hell, was interrupted.

335
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,841
General awaits us, wants to see this guy.

336
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:07,930
I am aware.

337
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:15,144
Pass.

338
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,731
Want to split?

339
00:54:53,732 --> 00:54:55,480
What's with this depravity?

340
00:54:57,638 --> 00:54:59,921
Hey, are they!

341
00:55:01,326 --> 00:55:03,051
What are you doing there?

342
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:08,267
We bring a prisoner.
- What's this?

343
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,231
Answer.
You where you come from?

344
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,449
Get out, quickly!

345
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:02,312
Go to the jungle, come, hurry up.

346
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,465
Malunai!

347
00:56:12,513 --> 00:56:14,629
No!
- Malunai?

348
00:58:13,136 --> 00:58:15,367
Hello, you password please!

349
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:20,975
Pandora.

350
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,303
Move faster.

351
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,537
Let's not sit.

352
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,307
Move.

353
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,906
Want to stay alive.
- Faster.

354
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:41,141
Yes authorize the transaction.

355
00:58:52,758 --> 00:58:54,567
Do not move!

356
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:01,147
Do not be afraid.  Mama's here.

357
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:03,801
My mother came to pick you up, do not be afraid.

358
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:05,776
My baby.

359
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:10,497
Yes.

360
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,644
Perfect.
- Come to me.

361
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,270
Everything is OK.

362
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:47,726
My baby.

363
01:01:25,663 --> 01:01:27,820
How old are you?

364
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,422
Two years.

365
01:02:15,554 --> 01:02:17,890
What is your name?

366
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,896
Noom, come over here.

367
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,114
Come on.

368
01:02:42,378 --> 01:02:45,399
Let's see you play..

369
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:47,468
Simon! Please, come in.

370
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:15,932
Are you Simon Ovronnaz?

371
01:05:22,262 --> 01:05:24,801
I'll take a break to rest.

372
01:06:25,155 --> 01:06:27,397
I was on the brink of death.

373
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:32,297
Believe me, it changed me.

374
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:36,267
After all that, I could not return to Eleanor.

375
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:39,970
I should enjoy my life now.  Girls, fun...

376
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,744
Your boss saved my life.

377
01:06:44,745 --> 01:06:46,882
I hope you understand.

378
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:50,173
I have already repeated 11 times, to be sure.

379
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:52,011
11 times.

380
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:55,238
Your boss saved my life.

381
01:06:57,034 --> 01:07:00,340
Hello, sir, sir.
Is it you?

382
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:04,894
I have Simon Ovronnaz here, I found him sir!

383
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,403
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.

384
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:13,340
You've waited three years,
you can wait another three minutes?

385
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,420
Yes, Monsieur, all is in order.

386
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:19,568
And you, where are you?

387
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:23,963
Not so near Gauthier.
On the

388
01:09:37,918 --> 01:09:41,434
Confirm transfer from of $25 million from your

389
01:09:41,435 --> 01:09:44,950
Pandora account to account 6034TIH49?

390
01:09:44,951 --> 01:09:47,129
This account belongs to Kyaw Min.

391
01:09:47,995 --> 01:09:49,975
Yes, I confirm the transaction.

392
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:27,063
My Saviour.
- In the resistance.

393
01:10:27,064 --> 01:10:29,213
You know he saved my life?

394
01:10:29,214 --> 01:10:32,759
I need to know what was between
Gen. Kyaw Min and Nerio Winch.

395
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,667
The man with the driver...

396
01:10:35,668 --> 01:10:38,634
you must find him, he knows everything.

397
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,656
That will be complicated.

398
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,506
He's dead.

399
01:10:48,694 --> 01:10:51,202
Maybe I can help.

400
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:54,414
You know why your father refused to pay the General.

401
01:10:55,704 --> 01:10:58,345
THREE YEARS EARLIER
- That guy hired me for a week.

402
01:10:58,346 --> 01:11:00,612
He wanted to visit Burma.

403
01:11:00,613 --> 01:11:02,641
Business trip, he said.

404
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:06,781
There, he spent several days in a military camp.

405
01:11:07,509 --> 01:11:09,642
He spoke many times with the General.

406
01:11:09,643 --> 01:11:13,521
He didn't tell me anything.  But I realised something.

407
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:16,824
One day, the soldiers went on a mission...

408
01:11:16,825 --> 01:11:19,447
and they returned with prisoners.

409
01:11:19,448 --> 01:11:22,487
Women, children and many wounded.

410
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,974
They told me how the soldiers burned their village.

411
01:11:25,975 --> 01:11:29,294
Completely. This, of course, was part of their plan.

412
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:31,938
Then, everything changed.

413
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:54,310
But Mr. Winch, if you don't send the money,

414
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,160
Yes I know,

415
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:00,759
but he took the risk in bringing these mines.

416
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:04,525
But I couldn't...
- From what I understood

417
01:12:04,526 --> 01:12:07,385
of the conversation, your father paid for getting these mines.

418
01:12:07,386 --> 01:12:11,003
Mr.  Winch!
- It's not what you imagined

419
01:12:11,004 --> 01:12:13,036
about this  massacre of the local population.

420
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:15,845
Excuse me.

421
01:12:18,256 --> 01:12:21,397
I spoke with Nerio Winch, he won't pay.

422
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:24,283
You need to talk to him.

423
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:27,272
Go see him.

424
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:32,063
OK.

425
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:36,435
He said he needed to get away.

426
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:37,967
Very quickly.

427
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:49,657
Then I went outside, I waited for him outside the camp.

428
01:12:52,995 --> 01:12:54,820
Listen, damn it.

429
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:57,052
I'll explain.

430
01:12:57,053 --> 01:13:00,294
I will arrange everything, give me time.

431
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:11,772
Talk, where are they?

432
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:25,565
I was near the road.

433
01:13:26,678 --> 01:13:29,491
I pulled out and left immediately

434
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:34,730
Your father didn't finance a massacre sir.

435
01:13:36,963 --> 01:13:39,196
What did you call this guy?

436
01:13:41,023 --> 01:13:43,217
Thomas, just Thomas.

437
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:46,537
Did you know his surname?

438
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,157
Never sir.

439
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,385
Why should I have known?

440
01:15:40,212 --> 01:15:43,037
Relax son.
Tilt your head.

441
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,225
Gauthier, come, get ready to...

442
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:36,340
Mommy.

443
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:59,033
Mommy?

444
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:04,999
Mommy?

445
01:21:26,394 --> 01:21:28,079
Let's go change?

446
01:21:37,716 --> 01:21:39,851
My mother dressed me before.

447
01:21:39,852 --> 01:21:44,388
We gotta get out of here.

448
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:49,674
And Mom?

449
01:21:49,675 --> 01:21:52,211
Mommy's gone already.

450
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:51,657
You've never seen a child?  Go!

451
01:24:57,588 --> 01:25:00,472
Where is my mommy?

452
01:25:01,235 --> 01:25:05,462
Where is mommy?

453
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:10,317
Noo, mommy won't be back.

454
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:14,710
Mommy died.

455
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:19,305
She's gone forever.

456
01:25:30,151 --> 01:25:35,357
She'll be watching you and always love you.

457
01:26:08,824 --> 01:26:11,302
What'll you do now?

458
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:20,383
Don't let fucking Nazachov get it?

459
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:24,068
This sucks, this son of a...

460
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:27,335
I don't care about Nazachov.

461
01:26:30,574 --> 01:26:34,130
Wait, is it because the boy's mother is dead?

462
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,300
You cannot leave the group to disintegrate.

463
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:46,446
Imagine what a man like him can do with so much power.

464
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:48,323
It would be your responsibility, sir.

465
01:26:48,324 --> 01:26:51,225
Too late Gauthier, I signed away my rights,

466
01:26:51,226 --> 01:26:54,126
the understanding cannot be cancelled.

467
01:26:55,157 --> 01:26:58,152
You know the Pandora legend sir?

468
01:26:58,153 --> 01:27:02,602
Zeus gave her to Epimetheus to be his wife,
she was the first woman on earth.

469
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,514
She possessed a box that Zeus forbade her to open.

470
01:27:05,515 --> 01:27:08,706
One day, overcome with curiosity, she opened it

471
01:27:08,707 --> 01:27:11,522
and freed all the misfortunes of mankind

472
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,338
old age, disease

473
01:27:14,339 --> 01:27:16,321
and stupidity.

474
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:20,973
Pandora was scared and closed the box.

475
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:24,734
Fortunately, something was left in the box,

476
01:27:24,735 --> 01:27:27,777
a small but very valuable item.

477
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:31,417
Hope...

478
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:36,050
and from that moment, even when a man hears trouble knocking,

479
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:39,230
he always keeps a small shred of hope.

480
01:27:39,231 --> 01:27:42,849
We must not lose hope sir, while you're alive.

481
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:46,990
Hello, the password please.

482
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:50,781
Pandora, I would like to make a transfer of $ 7.

483
01:27:50,782 --> 01:27:53,188
Did you say $ 7, 4 add 3?

484
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:56,036
Exactly.  
- To which account do you want to transfer the funds?

485
01:28:20,704 --> 01:28:24,885
In a few minutes, I'm getting on 
an aircraft to Geneva....tell everyone.

486
01:29:10,348 --> 01:29:12,656
And what exactly is your plan?

487
01:29:21,053 --> 01:29:22,946
Card?

488
01:29:25,914 --> 01:29:27,436
Simon!

489
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,776
Ignition switch is on here.

490
01:30:07,599 --> 01:30:11,661
- So there's enough information, right?

491
01:30:12,126 --> 01:30:13,651
Don't you think?

492
01:30:14,815 --> 01:30:16,951
The guy who taught me to fly is dead.

493
01:30:16,952 --> 01:30:20,271
Oh,...an accident?

494
01:30:20,272 --> 01:30:22,292
Assassinated.

495
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:27,003
He strangled him.

496
01:30:46,503 --> 01:30:48,654
D'you need help?

497
01:30:48,655 --> 01:30:52,130
Yes, just stop shaking.

498
01:31:06,498 --> 01:31:09,154
Not eating?
Not hungry?

499
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:35,816
Sleeping they don't seem so dangerous.

500
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,521
Now I'm worried about you.

501
01:32:41,397 --> 01:32:44,181
Geneva Tower, Winch Air requesting to land.

502
01:32:44,182 --> 01:32:48,369
This is Geneva, landing allowed. 
- Beginning descent to 13000 feet.

503
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:53,471
You don't know how much pleasure I got from that.

504
01:33:11,924 --> 01:33:13,827
I want to kill you, you son of a bitch.

505
01:35:32,428 --> 01:35:33,953
Simon!

506
01:36:07,314 --> 01:36:09,033
Are you OK?
- Yes.

507
01:36:09,034 --> 01:36:11,263
Fine.

508
01:36:24,893 --> 01:36:26,925
Yes.

509
01:36:28,232 --> 01:36:31,683
Largo, where are you?

510
01:36:34,104 --> 01:36:36,938
Yes, of course.

511
01:36:36,939 --> 01:36:40,098
I'll send my driver.
Tell me exactly where you are.

512
01:36:46,019 --> 01:36:48,324
Hello.  Passports please?

513
01:36:50,963 --> 01:36:53,436
D'you often bring such weapons with you?

514
01:37:19,025 --> 01:37:20,938
A doctor will examine you.

515
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:23,095
Alexander Jung, and your name sir?

516
01:37:23,096 --> 01:37:24,714
Simon Ovronnaz.

517
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:26,948
Mr.Winch didn't want to come with you.

518
01:37:26,949 --> 01:37:29,182
He went to a meeting with the prosecutor.

519
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:30,790
And you want to leave it like that?

520
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:34,858
That's crazy, she's extremely dangerous.

521
01:38:52,489 --> 01:38:54,840
Climb!

522
01:38:58,086 --> 01:39:03,442
I'm worried Largo.  
- Everything is going well. I just spoke to Mrs Francken

523
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:09,075
Nazachov is a peasant.  How'd he 
manage to invent such a complex plan.

524
01:39:10,484 --> 01:39:12,700
Sometimes among the peasants is a genius.

525
01:39:12,701 --> 01:39:16,319
I agree, but how do you think he knew what happened in Burma?

526
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,660
Three years ago?

527
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,003
I was told...

528
01:39:21,004 --> 01:39:23,287
..people in the group.

529
01:39:24,518 --> 01:39:26,849
I'm coming with you.

530
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:30,416
You're an angel, I hardly hurt.

531
01:39:30,417 --> 01:39:33,966
May I have another?
- Yes.

532
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:35,991
Thanks.

533
01:39:39,817 --> 01:39:42,988
And if Nazachov is not the head of this operation?

534
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:47,037
If he's just a front for someone else?
- If it's not him..

535
01:39:51,097 --> 01:39:53,943
..to organize such a conspiracy

536
01:39:53,944 --> 01:39:56,790
needs a more powerful motivation than greed, Largo.

537
01:39:58,854 --> 01:40:01,516
It takes a fierce desire to humiliate,

538
01:40:02,453 --> 01:40:04,943
to destroy a man's reputation forever.

539
01:40:05,935 --> 01:40:09,513
Name, company.

540
01:40:13,085 --> 01:40:16,177
Money cannot be the motivation.

541
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,957
Just revenge....

542
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:25,600
...and hate.

543
01:40:27,998 --> 01:40:31,403
My son actively supported Nerio.

544
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,305
Thomas.

545
01:40:35,306 --> 01:40:37,431
Thomas Jung.

546
01:40:53,526 --> 01:40:55,802
My son used my relationships..

547
01:40:55,803 --> 01:40:59,053
..to help the Winch group to obtain new markets, concessions.

548
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,155
Taxi!

549
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:05,783
Nerio didn't hesitate to use bribery.

550
01:41:05,784 --> 01:41:07,928
So they created the Pandora account.

551
01:41:09,392 --> 01:41:15,135
After a new market was won, 
Nerio paid my son Thomas a commission.

552
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,353
All this money was gathered illegally.

553
01:41:19,354 --> 01:41:22,063
He wanted more.

554
01:41:23,096 --> 01:41:27,847
When I saw you for the first time, young, handsome, rich,

555
01:41:28,694 --> 01:41:30,748
so alive.

556
01:41:30,749 --> 01:41:33,947
I'm going to die,

557
01:41:33,948 --> 01:41:37,146
but you gave me a reason to live.

558
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:43,196
Revenge.

559
01:41:44,709 --> 01:41:46,811
Nazachov is a moron.

560
01:41:47,479 --> 01:41:49,994
He just complied and paid.

561
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:55,134
Tonight, you have killed Prosecutor Francken.

562
01:41:55,135 --> 01:41:58,299
The only one who can prove your innocence.

563
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,776
Give him the second injection.

564
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,712
Take the gun from the glove compartment.

565
01:42:05,872 --> 01:42:07,762
Do what I say!

566
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,926
Simon?

567
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:04,923
Call the cops, quick!

568
01:43:23,414 --> 01:43:25,011
No, no!

569
01:43:55,336 --> 01:43:58,547
Alexander, don't do it!
- Also..

570
01:43:58,548 --> 01:44:01,309
also I asked Nerio to save my son.

571
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:04,985
I asked him to send the money, I asked.

572
01:44:04,986 --> 01:44:06,577
I begged on my knees before him, Largo.

573
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:10,752
Always my friend, my brother.

574
01:44:10,753 --> 01:44:13,328
On my knees!

575
01:44:14,486 --> 01:44:17,176
Stay there, don't come nearer!

576
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:22,196
Your son Alexander became a criminal.

577
01:44:22,197 --> 01:44:26,370
You know, he ordered the massacre in Burma.

578
01:44:26,371 --> 01:44:30,559
He was my son, my blood.

579
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:54,514
I cannot say I'm upset.
- Mr.  Cochrane, what will happen

580
01:46:16,601 --> 01:46:18,532
And did you have a good time?

581
01:46:18,533 --> 01:46:20,262
Excuse me?

582
01:46:23,493 --> 01:46:26,024
The girls!

583
01:46:26,025 --> 01:46:28,227
In Hong Kong.

584
01:46:28,228 --> 01:46:31,450
Largo told me that you stayed there a while.

585
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,788
Lord, my God.

586
01:46:33,789 --> 01:46:35,598
O Lord my God?

587
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:37,855
Want to try?

588
01:46:40,376 --> 01:46:43,224
You know, you and I'll make a great team.

589
01:46:46,814 --> 01:46:49,246
Yes, my partner.
- I'm not your partner.

590
01:46:50,392 --> 01:46:52,988
You are about to become.

591
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,909
Shall we go yet?
- No!

592
01:47:07,362 --> 01:47:09,412
Son, you can come back as often as you want.

593
01:47:13,371 --> 01:47:15,488
You know, I live on a big boat.

594
01:47:15,489 --> 01:47:17,759
No, I didn't know.

595
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:22,408
All around it there are very tall houses that reach the sky.

596
01:47:22,409 --> 01:47:25,916
Dad's office is on top of them all.

597
01:47:27,282 --> 01:47:29,971
Do you live all alone?

598
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:34,190
Not anymore.
