<i>At the hospital, they told
us she'd had an aneurysm.</i>

<i>There was nothing
I could do for her.</i>

the lens cap off?</i>

00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,338

probably would help.</i>

can you just...</i>

PHOEBE: <i>Okay.</i>

00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,586

<i>I know nowadays you can

23

<i>Why is that?</i>

26
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,768
<i>Well, question seven on
the application asks you</i>

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,504
<i>to tell them what your best
and worst qualities are,</i>

28
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,471

three-and-a-half inches.</i>

<i>Three-and-a-half
inches on a page.</i>

31
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,243
<i>I'm sorry, but my worst
qualities took up a lot more</i>

32
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,710
<i>than three-and-a-half
inches.</i>

33
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,547
<i>So I decided to throw
in a few extra pages.</i>

34
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,780

35
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,582

- <i>Wow!</i>

00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,924
<i>to express the very
essence of your being</i>

39
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:41,726
<i>and your views on how
insanely crazy this world is</i>

40
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,626
<i>in such a tiny space on a page?</i>

41
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,195
- <i>I mean, it's absurd.</i>
- <i>Okay, Addy, shut up already.</i>

very excited about, Phoebe.</i>

<i>You're very excited
about this, aren't you?</i>

<i>I'm excited to get some coffee.</i>

<i>You know what?</i>

57
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,758
<i>No. I'm not too worried
about the extra pages</i>

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,762
<i>because wasn't it Virgil who said,</i>

<i>"Fortune sides with him who dares"?</i>

didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe,</i>

65
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,987
we have to put in a little extra effort.

00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,524
Add... Screw you, Brandon.

69
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,427
Are you seriously with this guy?

70
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,461
Do you seriously imagine I
give a shit what you think?

71
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,763
Yeah, but the whole school
thinks you lost your mind, so...

72
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,466
- Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos.
- Got it.

73
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,536
- Are you going to pay for that?
- Nope.

74
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,537
Two medium Americanos for
Addison coming right up.

75
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,873
- What's going on, brother?
- How you doing, man?

76
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,441
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

77
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,443
- Did you read it, yet?
- Oh!

78
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,345
What? Dude, how are you so fast?

79
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,280
I don't understand. What did you think?

80
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,982
We'll talk about it after
you've read the James Baldwin.

81
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,684
Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you.

82
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,418
Oh... Have you guys
had your first kiss yet?

83
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,353
ADDISON: No, I'm waiting.

84
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,589
- Of course you would.
- ADDISON: You should've seen this guy

85
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,490
in philosophy class the other day,

86
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,925
he nailed Miss Keneally to
the wall. It was incredible.

87
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,493
- Why?
- Because she was giving a stupid lecture

88
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,394
about why students cut class.

89
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,796
And he said, "You're the
reason why students cut class."

90
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:29,733
- PHOEBE: Kevin.
- No. I said,

91
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,635
"People like Miss Keneally
are the reason kids cut class."

92
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,303
I was joking obviously.

93
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,805
He wasn't joking. It was incredible.

94
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,707
No, she is what's wrong
with the education system.

95
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,709
- Dude, I got to work. Okay?
- ADDISON: Okay. Okay.

96
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,010
Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs.

97
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,779
You got it.

98
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,848
You stand up for the people,
Kevin. You're a good man.

99
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,449
- Here you go. Sure.
- Thanks.

100
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,685
KEVIN: Phoebe?

101
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,485
- Huh? What's up?
- How's he doing?

102
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,454
He's okay.

103
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,058
I'll see you later.

00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:06,972
It's chilly.

106
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,543
- Can I ask you something?
- Mmm?

107
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:16,779
I feel like you hanging
out with me has, like,

108
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,582
a detrimental effect on your
standing with the cool kids.

109
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,551
We've always hung out, Addison.

110
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,054
Not really. I mean, we haven't
really since eighth grade.

111
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,057
I sort of went invisible there for a while.

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,658
Okay. Well, maybe it's because
I find every guy in high school

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,798
to be completely dull and predictable.

114
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,066
And why is that?

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,769
Are they predictable
because they want to hook up?

116
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,803
Can we just get some music or something?

117
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,505
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

118
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,074
I feel like you see me as
somehow sexually neutral

119
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,512
from the Latin "neuter,"
as in, without testicles.

120
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,714
(SCOFFS) No, I don't see you that way.

121
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,481
I hate to break it to you, Phoebe.

122
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:53,949
I don't want to disappoint you.

123
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,685
But guess what?

124
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,924
I want what all the other guys want, too.

125
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,395
That's okay.

126
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,529
Really?

127
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,598
Actually,

128
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,067
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

129
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,140
And I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you.

130
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,146
I don't want to go off to college as a...

131
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,415
As a what?

132
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,750

133
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:28,987
done it.

00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,822
Done what? (CHUCKLES)

135
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,856
- Screw you, Addison.
- (CHUCKLES)

136
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,925
I wanna get it over with.

137
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:41,964
All right? I want to have sex
with a guy who I feel safe around.

You know? Who won't judge me.

And who is definitely a virgin, too.

140
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,108
You're talking about me?

Wait, what? What makes you
think that I'm a virgin?

00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,690

- Yeah.

While there's a meeting between your
mom and the Secretary of Commerce?

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,593
Addison, I swear to God, if
you ask me another question,

00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,995
- I'm gonna change my mind.

00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,609
and one of the news crew guys told me that

they're going to write this
whole thing off as a gang killing.

Which means they probably won't
even go after the guy who did it

631
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:04,956
About this.

What's up with this, hmm?

00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,462
What's going on?

634
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,667

635
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,138
Remember that day

636
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,506
that Kevin was killed?

637
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,307
Yeah.

638
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,378
I drove back to the coffee
shop after it happened.

639
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,516
That's why I didn't call you.

642
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,652
I saw his body.

643

Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like,
I saw them wheel him out.

and no one cares.

650
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,404
Will you just do me a favor?

651
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:59,306
Just stop this nonsense. This
is... This is crazy, Addison.

D.C.? I don't know anything, man.

It's about Kevin Broadus.

Uh, he was a friend of mine.

1267

I don't know what you're talking
about, man. Get out of here.

1268
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,248
I heard that he pissed off a drug
dealer or something, and you...

1269
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,249
Do you know the guy?

What did I just say to you?

I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay?

He said that you were there when...
