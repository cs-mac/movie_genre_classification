<i>You're a thief, right, Nate?</i>

3
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:04,332
- Mr. Thompson...
- Who was your wheelman?

4
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:05,500
Rowland Smith.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,871
It was settled, Dean...
the territories.

6
00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:11,907
- Jake says you're encroaching.
- Is that what Jake says?

7
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,110
- You deny it?
- Without equivocation.

8
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,713
You gotta respect
the boundaries.

9
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:18,683
- I'm asking you are you deaf?
- Hey, his kid's deaf.

10
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,456
<i>I play the mandolin.
And sing to him</i>

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,861
with his hand right here.

12
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,596
<i>Dr. Landau is trying
to convince</i>

13
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,333
my husband and I to sponsor

14
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,168
a women's health clinic
at the hospital.

15
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,204
There are some delicate topics

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:35,174
which would have to be avoided.

17
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,110
Let's set the table over again.

18
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,780
I'll send you home tomorrow
with a full month's supply.

19
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:41,115
Square enough deal.

20
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,684
Masseria we need to settle with.

21
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,086
<i>He's gonna come looking
for his piece.</i>

22

<i>We're sending Benny
up to Harlem.</i>

00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:46,722
<i>We're dealing in Midtown.</i>

24
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,758
I sell two bindles of powder

<i>Joe Masseria gets cut in?</i>

26
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:51,261
That's how he'll see it.

27
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:53,229
Hey, kid.

28
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:54,931
Joe Masseria says hello.

29
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,433
Hey!

30
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,671
I understand you boys
are heading back to New York.

31
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,373
- Where'd you hear that?
- Nucky's man.

32
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:04,640
I think we're gonna
stick around awhile.

33
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,842
What the hell are you doing?

Don't.

36
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,550
Should I answer it?

37
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,919
Should I? Well?

38
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:21,055
- Oh, just answer it already.
- Hello?

39
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,591
Katy. I'm looking for Owen.

40
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,626
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, Mr. Thompson.

41
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,336
- Hello?
- <i>Where the hell were you?</i>

42
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,071
I was just in the loo.

43
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:38,640
I didn't hear the phone.
Jesus.

44
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,576
- The two of you?
- <i>Sir?</i>

45
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,745
- Where in the bathroom?
- No. No, no, I...

46
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:46,214
- <i>Have you read the paper?</i>
- No, I have not.

47
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,249
<i>Well, read one
and meet me at Mickey's.</i>

48
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,033
I'd have kept speaking
had I known you'd stop.

49
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,370
I don't have to.

50
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,940
I'd better go.

51
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:15,243
He's in a bad humor again.

52
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:19,314
Well, then it won't
matter if you're late.

53
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,784
Will it, Mr. Poofles?

54
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:32,326
Mr. Poofles.

55
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,640
There's some fresh rolls
if you want.

56
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,178
I like the poppy.
These are sesame.

57
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:56,115
Why ain't he at school?

58
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,417
Bellyache.

59
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,895
Let me take
a look at you, champ.

60
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,697
Hey.

61
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,232
What the hell's this?

62
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,103
Sonny, go play.

63
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,206
- Hey, your ma's talking to you.
- Go play.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,341
Go play.
Come on.

65
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,312
Go on.

66
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,017
He came home with it yesterday.
I rang the headmaster.

67
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,220
Some new boy, he's a bully.

68
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:32,823
Picking on a kid
almost stone-cold deaf?

69
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:36,094
They all are, Al.
That's why he's there.

70
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,464
Boys will be boys, whether they
can hear each other or not.

71
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:49,343
Kid's got to toughen up.

72
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,315
Coming through. Coming through.

73
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,954
<i>All right, pipe down.</i>

74
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,956
<i>Mr. Thompson wants a word.</i>

75
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,127
As some of you may know, our
contact at Tabor Heights...

76
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:10,601
Sheriff Victor Sickles
died recently

77
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,703
as a result of what
the "Atlantic City Press"

78
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,039
has deemed a tragic accident.

79
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,644
Given as how the chief witness

80
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,180
to this unfortunate occurrence

81
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,517
<i>was a Mr. Gyp Rosetti
of New York,</i>

82
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,187
it's quite possible there's
a bit more to the story.

83
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,491
That being the case,
until further notice,

84
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:32,361
all shipments
to Mr. Rothstein

85
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:34,497
will use back roads only,

86
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:36,766
<i>avoiding Tabor Heights
altogether.</i>

87
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:41,404
In the middle of January?
The roads are sheets of ice.

88
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,006
<i>And where are we gonna get gas?</i>

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,807
That's your problem, isn't it?

90
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,977
You sure this is a good idea?

91
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,846
What the fuck
you asking him for?

92
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,482
I just thought
when it comes to...

93
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:56,686
You just what?
I already said how it is.

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,722
All right, Nuck.
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:01,992
Get up to Tabor Heights, find
out what the fuck is going on.

96
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:04,194
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,931
You know that coast road
that heads through Hammond?

98
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,133
Head up there,
check out the roads.

99
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:11,569
See how icy they actually are.

100
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,139
- You know the one I mean.
- Okay.

101
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:18,577
What's being done
about Rowland Smith?

102
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:22,047
- Who?
- Rowland Smith.

103
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,817
Nate Honig's wheelman.

104
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,150
The sack of shit who
robbed this place.

105
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:28,053
That job was left
to Manny Horvitz.

106
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:30,522
Oh, where's he been lately?

107
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:32,091
I don't have enough on my mind?

108
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,759
I have to start checking
your fucking work, too?

109
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,628
<i>Make sure things
are being handled?</i>

110
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:36,896
<i>It won't happen again, sir.</i>

111
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,099
Find this guy.
Use Agent Sawicki if you have to.

112
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,634
You want the feds involved?

113
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:43,670
He's on the goddamn payroll.
Make him earn it.

114
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,241
Any more second-guessing?

115
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,610
I'll get on it straightaway.

116
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:56,283
- Nucky, can I have a word?
- About what?

117
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,487
This Rosetti business,
the whole Tabor Heights thing.

118
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,922
If you've got a complaint,
talk to Mickey.

119
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,158
I don't.

120
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,527
It's just that I'm back now.

121
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,028
I'm well aware of that.

122
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,998
Then let me earn, Nucky.
I did my time like you asked.

123
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,467
Let's get something straight.

124
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,904
Allowing you to simply go to jail is
the last gift I'll ever give you.

125
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:29,081
This is rather infelicitous
language, isn't it?

126
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:36,387
- Vagina?
- It is a medical term.

127
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,590
I've never enjoyed
the sound of it.

128
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:41,393
I've never liked brussels sprouts,
but I don't deny they exist.

129
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,663
What a peculiar analogy.

130
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,331
What term would you prefer?

131
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,334
The entire area
is problematical.

132
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,270
You do acknowledge
certain subjects

133
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,273
would be difficult
to discuss without it?

134
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,209
Intercourse,
fertilization, birth.

135
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,046
You imagine yourself quite
wicked, don't you, Doctor?

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,281
The jackanapes at the back
of every classroom,

137
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,850
mistaking his sniggering
for the wit of the world.

138
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:05,586
That sounds more like
my cousin Francis.

139
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,827
"Pregnant."

140
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,664
Another problematical area?

141
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:18,567
"Gravid" has a noble ring.

142
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,904
Will they even know
what that means?

143
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,772
Is it not your intention
to instruct them?

144
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,307
"With child"?

145
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:27,409
Ah.

146
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,511
"Monthly time."

147
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:32,114
You are at odds
with "menstruation"?

148
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,550
- It's good Latin.
- A regrettable neologism.

149
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,686
The Federal Children's Bureau
has already published a series

150
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,188
on prenatal care and
"menstruation" is what they use.

151
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:43,158
The indiscretion of politicians
is of no concern to me.

152
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:46,094
I will be attending the class

153
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,497
to make sure my instructions
are followed.

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,967
And these are?

155
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,069
Gifts for the women.

156
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:57,272
"Kotex."

157
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,542
Sanitary napkins, Sister.

158
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:03,279
These are sold openly in stores?

159
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:06,149
They are a relatively
new product.

160
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:08,651
Perhaps you yourself...

161
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,029
Well...

162
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:23,599
let's hope our evening students
aren't quite so sensitive.

163
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:54,764
Looks like you've stepped
straight into my trap.

164
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,332
What?

165
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:59,268
You know, like I was
gonna arrest you.

166
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,537
Why would you do that?

167
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:03,206
Just making a little joke.

168
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,408
Mr. Thompson's a busy man.

169
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,910
I have nothing better to do?

170
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:11,647
Came out here in the middle
of the day, didn't you?

171
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:13,715
Is this Rowland Smith's
place or not?

172
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,052
That's what the Philly
office says.

173
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,722
You spoke to other
agents about this?

174
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:23,125
Just the one

175
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,594
that I can trust.

176
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,664
You mean the one that's crooked.

177
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,105
Looks like it's locked.

178
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,008
Thanks for clearing that up.

179
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,954
Rowland Smith's
been a busy fella.

180
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,193
At least half of this is ours.

181
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,462
It's all ours now.

182
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,631
You sure he's showing up?

183
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,533
This is his main drop.

184
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,901
Says your man in Philly.

185
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:08,404
Well, he would know,
wouldn't he?

186
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,107
And what's stopping him
from tipping Smith off?

187
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,042
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

188
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:16,446
Because he's never
bothered to catch him.

189
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,059
Call me when he gets here.

190
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,895
I'll take care of it.
You've my word.

191
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,564
You needn't involve yourself.

192
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,099
Is that what I asked you?

193
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:36,003
You've mentioned low profiles.

194
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:39,406
I'm trying to oblige.

195
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:41,709
Ahem.

196
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:49,382
Go buy a personality.

197
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,199
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

198
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,802
<i>Rosetti's gassing up,
Sickles is at the next pump.</i>

199
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,939
He completely douses
himself with gasoline.

200
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:15,108
Then for some fucking reason,

201
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,077
decides that it's a
good time for a smoke.

202
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,778
Look, what's the difference?

203
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:20,413
The man was your partner.

204
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:22,716
What I'm saying is,
it don't matter.

205
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,384
The situation's being handled.

206
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,819
Meaning what?

207
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,854
Me and the boys,
we're taking care of it.

208
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,623
You just said
you couldn't arrest them.

209
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,524
I'm not talking
about arresting them.

210
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,193
I'm talking about handling them.

211
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,662
<i>I got a load coming through here
tomorrow night, Deputy Ramsey.</i>

212
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,398
I'm the sheriff now.

213
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,933
And I still got a load
coming through.

214
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,435
It's fine.
Same as always.

215
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,805
You boys go about your business.

216
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,408
Leave these dagos to us.

217
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,452
I don't like this.

218
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:00,454
Let the man do his job, Eli.

219
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,956
You ain't the only
sheriff ever lived.

220
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,592
Get in the car.

221
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,444
Postcard from Johnny.

222
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:26,013
"Greetings from Naples.

223
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,750
I haven't seen this many Italians
since we were back in Brooklyn."

224
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,223
What the fuck is this?

225
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,892
Cash.
What do you mean?

226
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,427
It's sticky.

227
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,398
Little schmutz.
I don't know, I just ate.

228
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,567
Even your money reeks.

229
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,968
Fuck you talking about?

230
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:50,038
Would it kill you to pony up for
a decent shave once in a while?

231
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,873
A little Bay Rum.

232
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,542
Gives me a rash.

233
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,110
Jake, I'm serious.

234
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,580
You know I love you, but you
smell like a sardine's twat.

235
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,648
I mean, what does your wife say?

236
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:04,618
"Why didn't I marry
Milton Korntragger?"

237
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,887
Your whores, then.

238
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,956
I pay 'em not to notice.

239
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,092
18th up to Harrison.

240
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:14,628
I got the rest of
my collections tonight.

241
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:18,131
- Where you going?
- Take a leak.

242
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,734
That's why beer
is so profitable.

243
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,537
We don't sell it,
we only rent it.

244
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,743
Personal hygiene, Jake.

245
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,512
It makes a big impression.

246
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,350
"How was
your day, honey?"

247
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,986
I love her and all, but my day?

248
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,888
This happened
and then that happened

249
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,090
and then the next thing.
That's the day.

250
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,713
Now you gotta go
through this whole...

251
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,189
Hi there.

252
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,757
Don't move.

253
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,060
<i>Check him.</i>

254
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,733
Just for coneys.

255
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,668
Who are you?

256
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,838
Ask you the same question.

257
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,006
You friends of my folks?

258
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,674
Do we look friendly?

259
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,179
You seem okay.
Don't know about him, though.

260
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,649
They don't like it
if I'm late for dinner, so...

261
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,753
- What's your name?
- Lon Chaney.

262
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,525
Norma Talmadge.

263
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,332
Baby Peggy.

264
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:03,939
Rowland Smith.

265
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:06,441
You're mean to children.

266
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,677
Aren't you the dog's bollocks?

267
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,512
Is that a good thing?

268
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,483
Yeah, I need
the Ritz-Carlton.

269
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:18,987
What used to come up
from Atlantic City

270
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:21,723
comes right through here,
straight in off the ocean.

271
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,125
Cut out the middleman.

272
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,495
We sail out, load up, off-load
here right on the beach.

273
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,163
Gonna have to do it at night.

274
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,934
We'll probably need
some boats, too.

275
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,869
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:35,370
You've been with us a year.

277
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,973
What do I know about the ocean?
I'm from Yonkers.

278
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,641
- Excuse me, miss.
- Sir?

279
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,211
One of these days I'm gonna
take you in the back,

280
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,746
show you how to
really make sauce.

281
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,882
But I don't know how to cook.

282
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,087
You stir, I'll provide the heat.

283
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,309
Could I have one?

284
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,512
How old are you?

285
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,381
16 next month.

286
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,049
Sir.

287
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,952
- You shouldn't smoke.
- I don't.

288
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,122
Then why do you want
a cigarette?

289
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,592
See what all the fuss is about.

290
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,932
You trying to charm me, kid?

291
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,067
Is it working?

292
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,969
What do you think?

293
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,040
You gonna hit me again?

294
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,610
I'm not opposed to it.

295
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,578
You know who I am, Rowland?

296
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,013
Answer straight.

297
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,949
You're Nucky Thompson.

298
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,318
You gave us
a Christmas turkey once.

299
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:58,186
When did I do that?

300
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,788
1914.

301
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,257
I was six.

302
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:06,128
Boy, was Ma grateful.

303
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,968
Is this how you thank me?

304
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,704
How do you mean?

305
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,840
Stealing my merchandise.

306
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:22,177
I guess I didn't think
you'd mind.

307
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:24,346
Why the hell
would you think that?

308
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,448
I don't know.
Whenever I see you in the paper,

309
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,850
it looks like
you're having a good time.

310
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,556
Anyway, I didn't steal
it all from you.

311
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,191
Who else?

312
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,961
A lot of it belongs to
Waxey Gordon in Philadelphia.

313
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:41,764
Did he give your mother
a turkey, too?

314
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,900
Heck, no.

315
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,936
He's a crook.

316
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:56,080
Tell me what you want
to happen here.

317
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,149
What's that mean?

318
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:01,652
It's not as expected. The fault's
mine for letting it get this far.

319
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:05,590
I'll take responsibility
and your hands stay clean.

320
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,212
Have one on me.

321
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:37,017
Need a light.

322
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,424
Expecting someone?

323
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,859
<i>Federal agents.
Get your hands up.</i>

324
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,327
<i>Get 'em up.
Hands up.</i>

325
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,196
All right, boys. Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.

326
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,431
Go around front.
Go around front.

327
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:57,670
What's the story, Rowland?

328
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:59,705
Beats me.

329
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,575
They're Prohees out of Philly.

330
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,844
They've kind of
been following me.

331
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,312
Arsed-out little shite.

332
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:08,614
- Just trying to get a leg up.
- You know any of them?

333
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,883
<i>That tall fed
with the 12-gauge,</i>

334
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:13,319
<i>he's in Waxey Gordon's pocket.</i>

335
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:16,556
- Anything else?
- Pretty sure they're here to kill me.

336
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,058
Enough with the bull...

337
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:21,528
Jeez, it's not our...

338
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:23,463
All right, let's go.
Do what you have to do.

339
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:24,798
Watch the windows, boys.

340
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,626
<i>I'm gonna check the cellar.</i>

341
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,794
<i>Anything?</i>

342
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:31,364
Just cobwebs and squirrel turd.

343
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,305
Squirrel turds?

344
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:41,507
That's rat shit.

345
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:57,855
Hit me again.

346
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,729
Picking up for Mr. Torrio.

347
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,136
Give me a short one.

348
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,972
Guzik, right?
Torrio's man.

349
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:14,507
Yeah. I know you?

350
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,709
Joe Miller.
I'm with Deanie O'Banion.

351
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,244
Uh-huh. Okay.

352
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,580
- Beer's better here, huh?
- How's that?

353
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:24,251
I say the beer's better here
down on the South Side?

354
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:26,286
Tastes the same to me.

355
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,424
Well, can't trust
the water anyway.

356
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,493
What water?

357
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,229
Any water.
I don't know, I'm just...

358
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:38,699
look, you drink, I'll drink.

359
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,767
We're fine, right?

360
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,304
Sure, we are.

361
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:51,043
You called Dean O'Banion a liar.

362
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:53,212
- Huh?
- That day at Torrio's.

363
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:56,414
- I don't really...
- You got a big mouth to match that big gut.

364
00:23:58,017 --> 00:23:59,951
Enjoy your beer, Joe.

365
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:03,255
How can I with the stink
coming off of you?

366
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,694
Walk away from me, Jumbo?

367
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:12,997
I'm talking to you,
you fat fuck.

368
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:15,199
Came to collect?

369
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:18,503
Here.

370
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:22,507
Have some more.

371
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:35,355
How you holding up, huh?

372
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,957
Come on, get it on.
Get it on.

373
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,331
Hurry it up, guys.
We don't have all night.

374
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,545
Taking their sweet time.

375
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,881
Wait it out.

376
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,785
And if they decide to
look down here again?

377
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:11,258
Well, we're all in this
together, ain't we?

378
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,731
The mouths of babes.

379
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,344
What did we leave in the car?

380
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,180
Nothing.
I always keep it clean.

381
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:36,017
- The plates?
- <i>In Tunney's name.</i>

382
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,956
Don't expect
he'll much mind now.

383
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,196
<i>I got maybe 50 if you need any.</i>

384
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,132
Got 50 what?

385
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,634
License plates.
Swap 'em around.

386
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,970
That way, they can't
ever track us.

387
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:56,973
That's your system, is it?

388
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,108
Worked it out myself.

389
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:03,846
Then what are they
doing out there?

390
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,149
Just coincidence, I reckon.

391
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:11,019
Pretty good run, though, huh?

392
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:16,925
Kept us guessing.

393
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,694
Not that hard, really,
if you don't mind me saying.

394
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,965
- Why's that?
- Drive fast, flash the pistol.

395
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:27,002
I mean, who wants to get all
killed over a few crates of booze?

396
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:31,507
No one.

397
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,809
That's how I see it, too.

398
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,212
Shame about Nate, though.

399
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,882
He was my partner.

400
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:42,519
Oh, aye?
What happened to him?

401
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,022
Feds got him.

402
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,893
Guess he didn't have your luck.

403
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,831
<i>Anyone check the cellar?</i>

404
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,433
Mr. Thompson.

405
00:26:57,636 --> 00:26:59,970
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

406
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,108
<i>Well, check it again.</i>

407
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:22,326
What the fuck are you doing?

408
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,095
Like you said.

409
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,231
One part laxative, Benny.

410
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,733
You want them shitting themselves
all over Hester Street?

411
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,435
Anything?

412
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:34,705
Charlie and I need to talk.

413
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,443
I think it's time
I got included.

414
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:40,444
- Based on what?
- I stepped up.

415
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:43,548
I did what I had to.
That means I stay in the room.

416
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,550
You shot your wad off
in the middle of the street.

417
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,786
- They went back minus one.
- Meyer did that.

418
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,722
- I fucking gave him cover!
- Benny.

419
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:53,726
We are certainly
gonna discuss this,

420
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,995
but not right now, so...

421
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:13,111
I'm summoned.
At noon.

422
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,679
I'll come with you.

423
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:18,149
Meyer, Masseria hates that
<i>shayna punim</i> of yours.

424
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:20,819
Now more than ever.

425
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,189
You turn up,
who knows where this goes?

426
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,759
He needs to understand
the way the world's heading.

427
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,160
You're the one who said
come to terms.

428
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:30,729
- That was before.
- Well, you see?

429
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,369
This is the problem with you.

430
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:38,504
Always very headstrong.

431
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,306
Good thing I'm here
to talk some sense.

432
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,482
Offer two.
Settle at five.

433
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:52,687
Nothing west of Broadway,
nothing south of Grand.

434
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:01,696
Anything else?

435
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,500
Try not to sit by the window.

436
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:19,145
<i>Tonight, 10:00 P.M.</i>

437
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,680
<i>All set on our end.</i>

438
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:22,448
<i>Some tough customers,
these boys.</i>

439
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:24,016
<i>You sure you want to do this?</i>

440
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,084
Think I'm gonna let
you fellas have all the fun?

441
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:29,454
We'll meet by
the filling station.

442
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:33,124
Pull the truck around back
and bring plenty of rope.

443
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,927
All right, let me roll.
Let me roll.

444
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:40,197
Look at that, baby.
All mine.

445
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:43,133
Hit me, tough guy.
Come on.

446
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,403
Come on, hit me.

447
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,471
Come on.

448
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:48,806
Hit me.

449
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,341
Come on, tough guy.
Hit me.

450
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:53,244
Come on. What was that, huh?
Come on, hit me harder.

451
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,213
What was that?
Harder than that.

452
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,181
Come on, put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

453
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:00,518
Put your hands up.
Like this in front of your face.

454
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,654
In front of your face like this.

455
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:04,389
Okay? And you're gonna
throw your punch.

456
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,024
You're gonna throw
your punch like bang!

457
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,594
Come on, let me see what you got.
Come on.

458
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:10,329
Come on!
Hit me!

459
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:12,965
You got to hit me.
You gonna let people bully you, huh?

460
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,634
Come on and hit me, huh?

461
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:25,545
Come here.
Come here.

462
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,215
Come here.
Come here. Shh.

463
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,285
It's okay, Sonny.

464
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,088
Shh. Come on.
Shh.

465
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:39,258
It's okay.
Shh.

466
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:41,795
It's okay.
Come here. Come here.

467
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:44,097
Come on. Shh.

468
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,232
Papa's got you.

469
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:49,069
Yes. Yeah, yeah.
Yes, missus.

470
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:51,705
Thank you.

471
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,907
Mrs. Thompson
has no information.

472
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,210
- Try over at Chalky's.
- I did.

473
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:58,345
Lolly Steinman as well.

474
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,914
Chippy in New York, then.

475
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:04,585
Miss Kent has not
seen him either.

476
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,956
How many for Rothstein?

477
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,492
800.
Same as last time.

478
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,294
I wouldn't do this, Mickey.

479
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:18,030
Of course you wouldn't.
'Cause you're not in charge.

480
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:20,065
Use your head, will you?

481
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,861
There's no way through the back
roads and Tabor Heights is off-limits.

482
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:25,203
Sheriff's on it.
You heard him yourself.

483
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:27,306
The sheriff's been on
the job less than a week.

484
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,774
And the last one got burned...

485
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:31,077
Don't you have
some trucks to load?

486
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:34,247
Sure thing, boss.

487
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:44,589
- What, you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

488
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,767
Couldn't sleep either?

489
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:01,072
Not exactly a featherbed.

490
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:03,942
Although that hasn't
been helping either.

491
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:07,946
Doesn't seem to bother him.

492
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,685
I'm not sure what does.

493
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:17,489
More than a few nights
spent like this

494
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,558
back in Ulster.

495
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:21,627
How's that?

496
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:24,529
You'd get your orders,
this or that address,

497
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:27,366
and then count off the hours
till you finish the business.

498
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:31,537
Wasn't the work, though.

499
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,240
It was the waiting.

500
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:36,275
Must have had your way
of getting through it.

501
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,943
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

502
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,447
Walk through the streets
of Coleraine

503
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,949
in my head.

504
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:47,352
Steps to the school.

505
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:50,788
Steps to the church.
Steps to the greengrocer.

506
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,059
That what you've
been doing all night?

507
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:02,533
I have not thought
on the place in months.

508
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:08,306
Sounds like
you're feeling at home.

509
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:15,046
I know who's in charge,
Mr. Thompson.

510
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,548
Maybe you're not happy about it.

511
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,185
<i>It's not my satisfaction
that matters.</i>

512
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:25,358
And what have I done
to earn your loyalty?

513
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:28,228
You made a place for me.

514
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,335
Now minus the soft soap.

515
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,575
You pay me.

516
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:06,867
Jesus.

517
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,969
What the fuck happened?

518
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:12,172
- Joe Miller.
- Who?

519
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,708
O'Banion's man.

520
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:18,511
Last night
I was making my collection,

521
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:20,847
he dry-gulched me.

522
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:23,183
What, he hit you when
you wasn't looking?

523
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:24,918
I was leaving the bar
at Keller's.

524
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:27,854
- He's on the South Side?
- <i>Cracked me with a beer mug.</i>

525
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,790
Split my head open.

526
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,059
Irish fucking prick.

527
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:34,061
Al, he made fun of me.

528
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:37,063
- What?
- <i>I mean, he...</i>

529
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,165
in front of everybody.

530
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:44,203
You think it doesn't bother me?

531
00:34:45,939 --> 00:34:48,740
I can't help how I smell.

532
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:53,244
Hour after I wash,

533
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:56,514
I already got to change my...

534
00:34:56,549 --> 00:34:58,350
Al?

535
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:04,790
<i>Women's health clinic.
St. Theresa's Hospital.</i>

536
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:07,293
Free to all.
Women's health clinic.

537
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:09,896
St. Theresa's Hospital.
Free to all.

538
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,200
Ma'am, may I give
you one of these?

539
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,534
- Miss.
- Pardon?

540
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,270
Miss.
It's not my baby.

541
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,973
You're welcome in any case.

542
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:30,517
Excuse me, I'm from
St. Theresa's Hospi...

543
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:33,620
Mrs. Shearer.
Hello.

544
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:35,455
Yes?

545
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:37,224
Margaret Thompson.
We met...

546
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:39,693
I remember you.
What do you want?

547
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:42,229
Something that might
interest you.

548
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:45,265
It's a series
of classes intended...

549
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,566
- I know about it already.
- The class?

550
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:52,002
All of it.

551
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:54,471
I thought the same thing myself.

552
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:57,775
And truthfully I'm ashamed
by my ignorance.

553
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:59,944
Then who are you
to lecture people about it?

554
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:03,381
I'm not. We have a doctor
from the hospital staff.

555
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,316
Please come if you can.

556
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,153
Your own experience
will be valuable for...

557
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:10,089
A two-cent piece
for each of them?

558
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:13,392
It's only once a month.
Who's this?

559
00:36:13,427 --> 00:36:14,827
A lady from the hospital.

560
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,263
- Is it Mr. Shearer?
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

561
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:18,798
This isn't about
our bill, is it?

562
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:20,600
We got ourselves a little
behind, but I promise...

563
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,068
No, not that at all.

564
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:24,804
I just wanted to
tell your wife that...

565
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,641
that I'm glad to see
she's doing so much better.

566
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:30,410
<i>Well, we've said our prayers,</i>

567
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:31,644
<i>but that's how the Lord
must have wanted it.</i>

568
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,746
Yes, of course.

569
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,348
But He spared Edwina
and we're blessed for that.

570
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,285
The doctors had some hand in it.

571
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,354
I took the week off
to see her through.

572
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:44,825
You just wanted to put your feet
up and smoke those awful cigars.

573
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:47,227
And when she's up to it,
we'll try again.

574
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,364
<i>We do appreciate
your good wishes, though.</i>

575
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,501
Are we gonna spend
the whole day out here?

576
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:55,804
Lead on, Mother.

577
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,973
Ready, boys?

578
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:09,083
Women's health class.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

579
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:10,718
Free to all.

580
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:13,720
Women's health class.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

581
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:19,287
You get a cut of the card game,

582
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:22,290
a cut of the fence,
a cut of the booze.

583
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,228
What's to give?
It's a sideline.

584
00:38:58,763 --> 00:39:01,432
"We."
"We."

585
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:04,369
Have a look around.

586
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,905
There's just you and me.

587
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,907
I have partners.

588
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,149
No.

589
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,640
With your partners.

590
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:13,668
Gonna look very cheap.

591
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:21,076
Mr. Doyle.
Why am I talking to you?

592
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,178
<i>'Cause you called me.</i>

593
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,781
- But why am I calling you?
- <i>Uh...</i>

594
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:27,549
Why is that even occurring?

595
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:31,754
If I had my liquor on the timely
basis your employer promised,

596
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:34,523
if, in fact, I could
reach your employer,

597
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,360
who now seems to think
acceptable business practice

598
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,928
to disappear for days on end,

599
00:41:39,962 --> 00:41:42,597
this conversation
would not be taking place.

600
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,167
And that would make me...

601
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,102
very happy.

602
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:49,704
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

603
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:52,507
- <i>Listen, Mr. Rothstein.</i>
- I want what I paid for.

604
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:55,810
- I want it now.
- <i>Okay, sir.</i>

605
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:59,380
And I don't ever want to find
myself chatting with you again.

606
00:41:59,415 --> 00:42:01,750
- <i>Of course.</i>
- Is that clear?

607
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,619
You'll have it
by tomorrow morning.

608
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,494
That Rothstein,
warm as a lizard.

609
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,463
What did he say?

610
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,532
That he's expecting
his delivery.

611
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,302
<i>And what did you tell him?</i>

612
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,938
That it's coming.
What do you think?

613
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:24,408
What do I think?
That you're a fucking idiot.

614
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,947
Watch your step, Eli.
I'm your boss.

615
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:34,784
Nucky explicitly said
to avoid Tabor Heights.

616
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,653
I heard. There's no way
to use the back roads.

617
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,622
Not till May at the earliest.

618
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,323
So hold off making the delivery.

619
00:42:41,357 --> 00:42:44,659
And get your brother's foot
up my ass? No, thanks.

620
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,962
I'm telling you
not to do this, Mickey.

621
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:53,233
I'm not doing nothing.
They are.

622
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:06,012
You're straight through
to New York.

623
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:07,681
Gas up in Tabor Heights
and that's it.

624
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:11,083
You stop for nobody.
Not even the law.

625
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:26,532
Tonight is my night.

626
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,971
Hey.

627
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:40,244
- <i>He's got a gun.</i>

628
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,007
<i>Easy!</i>

629
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:12,145
<i>Stop!</i>

630
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,282
Oh!

631
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:32,266
You want to pick on people
who can't defend themselves?

632
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:33,401
Huh?

633
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:35,803
<i>Pay for his funeral.</i>

634
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:52,285
What are they saying?

635
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,221
I think they're wrapping it up.

636
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:20,079
They're gone.

637
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:27,619
Nearly shit your breeches
there, didn't you, son?

638
00:45:27,653 --> 00:45:29,988
Heck, I wasn't scared.

639
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,390
I was.

640
00:45:33,725 --> 00:45:36,427
Okay, I was, too.

641
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:41,599
There'll not be a peep from me.

642
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:43,702
He always this much fun?

643
00:45:43,736 --> 00:45:46,204
You should hear him
on the phone sometime.

644
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,608
- <i>Canoodling with his girlfriend.</i>

645
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:54,647
Well, I got bacon
and eggs in the icebox.

646
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:58,284
<i>I can fry 'em up
if anyone's hungry.</i>

647
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:04,890
Maybe they left
a bottle upstairs.

648
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,151
Here we are.

649
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:03,652
Come on.

650
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,122
Hey, fellas.
Ready to make some dough?

651
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,496
<i>Don't make a move
until Gyp says so.</i>

652
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,999
<i>You're gonna help us
block the road.</i>

653
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,201
<i>First shot, then you move.</i>

654
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:21,305
<i>Just keep the road blocked.</i>

655
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:26,277
<i>- Don't be yellow now.
- Down in the shadows.</i>

656
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:31,183
Rothstein's shipment
is on its way.

657
00:47:33,286 --> 00:47:35,321
By which route?

658
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,523
Tabor Heights.

659
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:40,159
Word came back it's clear.

660
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:43,296
Did anyone wonder where we
were for the last 24 hours?

661
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,865
If they did,
they were quiet about it.

662
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:56,075
Well?

663
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:03,782
You see this?

664
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:07,586
See what?
There's nothing here.

665
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,689
That's my point.
We've both got empty hands.

666
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:12,757
What's that say to you?

667
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:17,428
Find a better hideout?

668
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:20,364
Mr. Thompson,

669
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:23,367
you got to admit
I'm pretty good at this.

670
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:25,703
I wouldn't go boasting about it.

671
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:28,773
Yeah, and I could say
I'd never do it again,

672
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:31,809
but you wouldn't
believe me, would you?

673
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:33,611
Probably not.

674
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:35,546
So...

675
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,550
so how's about
I come work for you?

676
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:42,454
How would that go, Rowland?

677
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,125
Well...

678
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,995
put me behind the wheel,
box of shotgun shells,

679
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,730
just let them try stealing then.

680
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,236
He doesn't like me.

681
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,105
Can you blame him?

682
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,708
Ain't I cool in a tight spot?

683
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,314
You'll do.

684
00:49:07,348 --> 00:49:08,882
I know all the roads
around here.

685
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,517
Best places to lie low.

686
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:12,719
Best places to keep your stash.

687
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:15,255
They won't ever catch me.

688
00:49:16,424 --> 00:49:18,458
We caught you, Rowland.

689
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:21,027
Okay, but it wasn't easy.

690
00:49:21,062 --> 00:49:24,698
And Waxey Gordon, he ain't
nearly as smart as you.

691
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:27,567
You could take as much
of his booze as you'd like.

692
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:29,136
It's apples off a tree.

693
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,707
Just tell me
what you want to do.

694
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:36,443
You've sure got a lot of moxie.

695
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:39,613
How else are you
supposed to get ahead?

696
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:45,018
I thought you didn't smoke.

697
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:47,254
Did I say that?

698
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:52,626
- How old are you really?
- 19.

699
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,263
So legally I'm allowed to drive.
Isn't that better?

700
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:03,504
Have one of mine.

701
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,563
- Mr. Kessler.
- Who's Mr. Kessler?

702
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:30,366
He's Mr. Thompson's driver.

703
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:48,382
I thought you were
letting him go.

704
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,520
Why would you think that?

705
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:59,259
I misunderstood.

706
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:04,364
As long as you understand now.

707
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:35,226
Stop!

708
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:37,028
- Is that Eli?
- Looks like it.

709
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:39,397
Fuck that.
Mickey said don't stop for nobody.

710
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,933
Stop!

711
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:44,102
Stop!

712
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:47,705
It's an ambush!
Wait!

713
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,976
Wait!
Stop!

714
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:55,013
Stop!
It's an ambush!

715
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,983
It's a fucking ambush!

716
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:03,088
<i>It's a fucking ambush!</i>

717
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,940
Come on.

718
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,541
<i>Oh, right there.
Right under his coat.</i>

719
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:57,676
<i>Look at this.
You want that?</i>

720
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,211
<i>Where we dumping these?</i>

721
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:01,480
<i>Boss says dig a pit
in the woods.</i>

722
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:03,316
<i>That'll take all night.</i>

723
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,451
<i>Get the podunks to do it.</i>

724
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:08,121
<i>Jeez, this one
crapped his pants.</i>

725
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:10,757
I need a wallet.

726
00:53:22,137 --> 00:53:25,640
Which one of them waitresses
do you think is cuter?

727
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:28,843
The little one
with the bobbed hair.

728
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,617
I'm gonna fuck the redhead.

729
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:50,399
Hey. Hey.

730
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:51,967
Shh.

731
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:54,002
Look.

732
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:05,213
Come on.
Come on.

733
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:09,316
Come on.
Here we go.

734
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,185
