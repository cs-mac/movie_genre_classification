00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,300
<i>[ Final Episode ]</i>

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:14,211
Just like Soo and Bin's biological mother

3
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:16,612
I can be possibly become like her?
Is that why?

4
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:31,212
When I die, are you going
to take care of my kids?

5
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,112
What?

6
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:40,211
When I die you have to raise all five
kids, what are you going to do now?

7
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:42,652
It will be back breaking, Honey.

8
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,411
I won't be able to die because I
would be so worried about that.

9
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:50,312
Don't say things like that. I don't
like it even if it was a joke.

10
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,011
Why are you being like this when
the test results not even out yet?

11
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:58,412
I'm sure that there will
be nothing wrong with me.

12
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:06,811
I'm just scared because I'm reminded of
what happened a long time ago that's all.

13
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,411
I know, I can understand
you're worried Honey

14
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:15,912
but I will be fine, really. You know why?

15
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:19,011
I have a long life line ever
since I was born you know.

16
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,011
Take a look honey, ta-da! Look at this.

17
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:25,211
This is my life line here,
it's super long, look at it.

18
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,011
I'm going to be living for a long time.

19
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:32,012
A long time ago there was this famous old grandpa that was a
palm reader in my neighborhood and that's what he told me.

20
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:40,212
I will be living way longer than
you, Honey so don't worry. Okay?

21
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:00,611
Oh Grandmother, you're awake.

22
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:04,011
But Son-in-law,

23
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:07,211
What are you doing so early in the morning?

24
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,811
I'm making some porridge
for the children's mother.

25
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:12,211
She went through an endoscope examination yesterday so I
want to feed her some porridge first thing in the morning.

26
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:16,252
The doctor said that she should avoid eating food
that's a little too stimulating for the time being.

27
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:28,011
Hey, Son-in-law is making you
porridge right now, dear.

28
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:32,611
He said that you should eat porridge since
you went through an examination yesterday.

29
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,212
Really?

30
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:40,611
My goodness, he cares for you horrendously.

31
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:44,011
My husband is that kind of man, Grandma.

32
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,212
I really married well, didn't I?

33
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:52,912
You did, sweetheart. You're such a lucky
girl to meet such a husband like that.

34
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:58,011
When is the test result
going to come out anyway?

35
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,611
In about a few days or so. I also did have a
corrosive esophagitis in the past too, Grandma.

36
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:06,211
I was told that this kind of sickness is common for modern people
because they drink coffee constantly and go to sleep and stuff.

37
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,211
It's nothing really so don't
worry about it, Grandma.

38
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:13,211
How can there be a sickness that's not a big deal? Even
something small can turn into a big illness you know.

39
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:16,411
So that's why Son-in-law is so
concerned like that, you know.

40
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,611
But it's nothing really though.

41
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:22,011
He is so sensitive about
me getting sick grandma.

42
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,811
I think it's because of
his former wife too.

43
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:29,411
He cried yesterday grandma.

44
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,411
Huh? The son in law cried?

45
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,611
Is it because of you getting
checked out at the hospital?

46
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:39,011
Isn't that funny grandma? I
thought I was gonna die laughing.

47
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:43,212
I think he is super scared because he
thinks that I'm gonna die or something.

48
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:49,811
Don't laugh sweetheart. He
went through that once before

49
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:54,411
so whenever something like this happens I'm
sure he gets scared and feels uneasy too.

50
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:57,912
I really feel sorry for that guy.

51
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:26,611
Last night at 2:00am in the morning

52
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:30,411
I woke from my asleep

53
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:35,312
but then you weren't there
when I looked next to me.

54
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:43,512
Maybe you opened up your eyes
briefly when I in the restroom sir.

55
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:46,811
That's strange.

56
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:52,011
I also opened up my eyes briefly around 4 o'clock in the
morning but your sister wasn't there next to me either.

57
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,611
Where were you at that time miss?

58
00:04:54,612 --> 00:05:00,212
I went to the restroom first and I couldn't go
to sleep so I walked around the neighborhood.

59
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,211
Can you anything that
early in the morning huh?

60
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,611
- Does that make sense?
- Of course it doesn't.

61
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,811
The air is really fresh here you know.

62
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,811
You went for a walk at
that hour didn't you?

63
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:13,411
Yeah, he's right, it's really
nice over here you know.

64
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,312
It's kinda dangerous though.

65
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:21,611
So from what we know so far, starting from
2-4 am in the morning, the two of you

66
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:26,611
weren't in the rooms that
you're supposed to be in right?

67
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,411
More than anything, they
disappeared early on

68
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,812
and showed up a lot later too.

69
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:37,211
Should I get some more bread?
There are fruits available too.

70
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,211
Wait for me, let's go together.

71
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,411
Do whatever you want.

72
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:43,611
What are we gonna do? I don't
think either of them were asleep.

73
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:45,811
They're just saying that.

74
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:50,611
Yeon Doo, I'm sure you haven't got much sleep
but why are you still so pretty today?

75
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:53,812
What are you saying?

76
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,111
- Let's just go back to Seoul.
- Why?

77
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:07,411
You should let them spend some time together
with the rest of the time they have left oppa.

78
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:10,211
You said that you have some
filming left to do anyways.

79
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,811
Stop messing with your sister already.

80
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,212
Okay. Let me eat the rest of this.

81
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,611
He can't go workout? Why?

82
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:24,011
My new mother went to the hospital yesterday and went through
an examination pr something like that because she is sick.

83
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,611
So when's the result coming out?

84
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:30,211
Didn't that take about two
to three days back then?

85
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,411
Did it?

86
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,811
Is your new mother awake?
How is she feeling?

87
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:36,312
- She's feeling good and she said she is fine.
- Is that right?

88
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,011
- I'm gonna go back upstairs now.
- Oh, okay.

89
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:42,342
- Alright.
- Bye.

90
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:50,611
I bet our son in law is going through
a lot emotional pain right now dear.

91
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:53,211
Yesterday I asked him if the
children's mother is sick

92
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:58,012
and the moment he heard that
his face become so pale.

93
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,211
Why wouldn't he be?

94
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,411
When you see experienced something traumatic you would
be shocked when similar things happen you know.

95
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:09,811
When son in law heard about that it reminded
him of Jin Young just like it did for us.

96
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:14,211
I told you not to say stuff like that honey.
What are you constantly being like that for?

97
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:19,811
Do all the people that go to the hospital and go through
an endoscope exam all die of cancer huh? Geesh.

98
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,012
Did I say that it was the case?

99
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,411
But the situation is exactly the same as our Jin
Young no matter how much I think about it..

100
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:31,312
I told you to stop that. One time is enough
with talking about unlucky things okay?

101
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:35,211
Hey, Jin Joo

102
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,811
hurry up and change into your
exercise clothes immediately.

103
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:41,411
- Why?
- Teacher Kim will be coming here for his morning exercise you know.

104
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:44,611
Nobody from the third floor is gonna be
going out to exercise today anyways.

105
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:49,011
Are you gonna make Teacher Kim wait by himself
outside huh? He's probably waiting for us by now.

106
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,211
You can go out there by yourself dad.

107
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:54,411
Would Teacher Kim come here for me?
He is coming here for you silly.

108
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,612
You silly little thing.

109
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:59,962
Don't say anymore and just change into
your workout clothes already. Alright?

110
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,612
Hurry up girl!

111
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:20,012
This silly boy.

112
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:49,611
Are you aware that teacher Kim your son
comes over to our house every morning?

113
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,011
Pardon?

114
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:53,812
He works out with me every morning folks.

115
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:08,211
Honey, I think Taemin went over
to that house to exercise again.

116
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,611
What should we do dear?

117
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:14,211
What else can we do honey? All you have to
do is approve of their relationship honey.

118
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:16,011
Honey.

119
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:18,811
You know very well how Taemin is honey.

120
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:22,011
When he acts like that there is nobody
that will be able to stop him you know.

121
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:27,611
Just let him have his way dear.
That's the only thing that we can do.

122
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:34,112
First of all, we should take care of Sang Min's wedding
then you should think about it carefully honey.

123
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,312
I wonder if something's going on.

124
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,612
Have you been well?

125
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:58,022
You lost a lot of weight. You
should try to eat better.

126
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,422
Same goes for you too.

127
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:05,711
Why do you keep on coming over here
to exercise in this hot weather?

128
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,491
Don't do that.

129
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,822
Are you worried about me now?

130
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,461
It's a lot of fun.

131
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:19,241
Running every morning with your
father, Soo's father and the boys.

132
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:21,541
It would be difficult to do
when the new semester starts

133
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:26,152
but I still want to take the time out during
the weekend and go exercise with your dad.

134
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:31,432
You said that you wanted to end it with
me but I do not want to do that Jin Joo.

135
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,861
I'm a man that breaks the
heart of a woman he loves

136
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,031
so I'm aware of the fact that I'm
a foolish man. I do know that.

137
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,952
Taemin.

138
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,751
Jin Joo.

139
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:51,202
Just this once. Do you think you can
put your trust in me this once?

140
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,631
I will try to do better.

141
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:58,721
You won't have to be hurting
again nor be disappointed.

142
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:02,211
And I will work a lot more harder
to be able to do that. Okay?

143
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:05,921
How much better can you do than this? How much
more do you have to work harder than this?

144
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:09,801
You are already more than
enough to me Taemin.

145
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:13,092
You never even disappointed me.

146
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:24,372
Sorry, Taemin for giving
you such a hard time.

147
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:28,332
Jin Joo.

148
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:34,081
How about if we take it slow this time?

149
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:36,881
- Slowly?
- Yep.

150
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,891
You can do all you can with your nail
art work which you like so much.

151
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,612
I can do all I can with my work too and
we can just take it slow like that.

152
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:48,381
I've been thinking about a lot of things because
of what I've been going through with you.

153
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,001
I thought that marriage

154
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:55,161
wouldn't be so difficult as long as our
feelings towards each other was strong.

155
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,262
But I realized that it wasn't.

156
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:05,671
I don't have anything that I can call my own since
I'm not financially stable like my brother.

157
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:09,121
I won't be able to get married
without the help of my parents too.

158
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,611
And maybe I thought of getting married
to be something to easy to achieve.

159
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:18,771
I should have thought about it more carefully, and I think
that we have come this far because I didn't do that.

160
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:21,911
Why do you keep on thinking
that it's just your fault?

161
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,342
I am more at fault here.

162
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,962
So this time

163
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:33,281
lets hold each others hands like this
without rushing and just go at it slowly.

164
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,581
My parents and your parents feelings

165
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,862
could be changed bit by bit if we work on
understanding where they're coming from.

166
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,332
Actually

167
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:51,502
I learned a lot by seeing you working
really hard to be accepted by my parents.

168
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:58,041
I was hurt for being disapproved but
she's still your mother after all.

169
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,552
I should've tried harder.

170
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:06,091
Instead of trying to overcome it by
myself, I should've discussed it with you

171
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:09,212
so we could come up with
a solution together.

172
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:12,451
I thought about all that.

173
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,291
It's still not too late.

174
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,952
We can both try really hard like that

175
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:24,632
and when we are able to get married with our own strength, then
we should get married with both of our parents blessing us.

176
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:30,171
When would that be?

177
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:33,152
About three years at the most.

178
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,681
But what if your mom still
isn't happy with me then?

179
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:40,451
Then we should just get married on our own.

180
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:42,821
We would be able to save up
some money within three years.

181
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:46,272
And we would be able to get
married on our own by then.

182
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:51,212
Would you be able to buy a
house within three years?

183
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,902
Of course not.

184
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:58,631
You want to live in a big house Jin Joo?

185
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:04,371
No, no. I'm okay living in a room for
rent as long as I can marry you.

186
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:05,701
Me too.

187
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:09,552
As long as I can be with you I'm
fine living in a rooftop house.

188
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,451
Let's not forget about how we feel

189
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:17,182
we should just trust each other
and go at it slowly Jin Joo.

190
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,272
Okay.

191
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:26,062
Let's try this out and go at it slowly.

192
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,832
I will try really hard.

193
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:52,971
I found out that he didn't
really break up with Jin Joo.

194
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:54,201
Yes, well..

195
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:59,842
We can't really talk about anything in detail
here but here is a gift for you. Please take it.

196
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:13,152
Why did they have to give me this?
It makes me feel so burdensome.

197
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:37,622
They bought a quality product.

198
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:42,161
Alright, our marketing team did it again.
You all worked really hard.

199
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:45,702
- Cheers.
- Thank you for the good work!

200
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:54,331
Sorry guys, Assistant An hasn't
been feeling well lately.

201
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:57,281
Look at you, you are totally
devoted to your wife.

202
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,531
You saw that right? You should also learn everything
you need to know before you get married Hye Sung.

203
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,761
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:05,871
You are taking your vacation late because there
have been so many events, isn't that right?

205
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:09,891
But I think this is way better since you are able to go on
your vacation with a lot of free time and a leisurely manner.

206
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,721
You've all worked really hard so you should get
plenty of rest while you are on your vacations.

207
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:13,901
Okay!

208
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,911
How are you gonna spend your time while you're
on your vacation? Where you guys gonna be going?

209
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:19,671
I'm gonna use up the vacation time I haven't used
and I'm planning on going to Spain and Portugal.

210
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:23,321
Really? You're so lucky. I heard that there
are a lot of good looking men in Spain.

211
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:27,321
That's why I'm going there you know.
Are you going anywhere Yeon Jae?

212
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:30,531
I'm going to Jeju Islands with my friends.
What about you Hye Sung sunbae?

213
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:34,931
I bought a ticket three months in advanced
so I can go to Okinawa with my family.

214
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:38,221
By the way, you should go on a
family vacation too Team Leader.

215
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:43,892
While I'm on vacation I will be spending
my time being with Assistant An perhaps?

216
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,992
Oh geez.

217
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:55,341
Here look.

218
00:17:55,342 --> 00:18:01,252
My goodness, you are really too much!

219
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:09,721
I wanted to at least go to the mountains
with the kids while we are on vacation.

220
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,161
Should we go after we hear
the test result tomorrow?

221
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,911
I'm sure the test results will come out
to be positive. Don't you think so?

222
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:16,771
We can't do that.

223
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:20,131
No matter what your test result come
out to be, you still have to rest.

224
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,501
The kids will be disappointed though.

225
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,471
This won't be the only
summer we'll have you know.

226
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,361
But still.

227
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:30,592
I have a plan for that.

228
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:36,971
One. Two.Three.

229
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:42,521
♪ One and two. Two and three.
Three and four and five. ♪

230
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:47,761
♪ One and two. Two and three.
Three and four and five. ♪

231
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:53,411
♪ Hey yo.♪ ♪ Hey yo.♪♪
Watch out for fire. ♪

232
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:59,701
♪ Hey yo. Hey yo. Watch out for fire. ♪

233
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:05,902
Oh yeah!

234
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,071
[Phone ringing]

235
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:13,261
What happened? Why haven't you called?
I've been so curious.

236
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,721
I haven't heard the test results yet
because they are backed up with patients.

237
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,042
Are the children having fun playing?

238
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:24,851
Alright, I'll give you a call when
the test result comes out. Okay.

239
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:27,471
- Was that your grandma?
- It was.

240
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:32,571
She said that the kids are playing
really hard. Your idea is good.

241
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,602
- Ms. An Mi Jung.
- Yes!/Yes!

242
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:44,772
Your test results has come out.

243
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,812
You are diagnosed with mild stomach cancer.

244
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,591
Mild stomach cancer?

245
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:56,411
To explain this simply, mild stomach cancer
is cells growing into a tumor in the stomach.

246
00:19:56,412 --> 00:20:00,091
And usually this can lead
to a full blown cancer

247
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:03,131
but Ms. An, you were able
to discover it early on

248
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:07,992
and the cancer cells are weak so it's possible
to get rid of it with just a simple operation.

249
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:13,602
Oh, thank you doctor.

250
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:19,551
So, how would the operation proceed?

251
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,151
And the operation will proceed using
a double path spectrometer device.

252
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:25,671
Also the duration time for the operation
will be about four hours at the most.

253
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:28,971
You will be staying at the hospital
for about five days at the least.

254
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:31,631
Should I set up a date for
the operation right away?

255
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:35,021
Yes, doctor. It would be great if I can get the operation done
as quickly as possible since we are on vacation as of today.

256
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:38,191
It would be great if I can get the
operation done while I'm on break.

257
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,641
Sure thing, we will try to set up an operation
date revolving around your schedule.

258
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:43,051
How long is your vacation by the way?

259
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:47,031
Come out already!

260
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:54,832
Get out kids. Hold on to Bin.
Like that kiddo.

261
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:59,181
I told you honey, they
said it's nothing big.

262
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:02,951
You were getting scared for nothing
and it got me all scared too.

263
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:05,841
You have to get an operation, how
can that be something small?

264
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:08,651
I do feel a little scared
to be honest with you.

265
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:12,042
But still, we should be thankful
that it's nothing a deadly disease.

266
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,451
I think the kids are done playing.

267
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:19,661
Come on in father in law. What's all this?

268
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,461
What are you two doing here?

269
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,711
What did the doctor say at the hospital?

270
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:27,602
You said that you'll call us as
soon as the test results come out.

271
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:34,321
Here we are.

272
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:38,831
I brought some pickled vegetables.
Let's see here.

273
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,861
And this is grilled yellow corvina from Beop
Seong that is given to us by our friend Mr Kang.

274
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:45,452
So take this out of the freezer
everytime you want to have some, okay?

275
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:49,541
And this is salted seafood from Mokpo

276
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:53,041
and this is perfect for you to have when
you don't have any appetite you know.

277
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:56,841
And the rest is just regular side dishes.

278
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:59,411
Oh okay. Thank you very much,
we will enjoy it for sure.

279
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:04,901
We didn't bring any kimchi on purpuse since your
mother in law is making it for you, isn't that right?

280
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:09,741
Oh my, this is so much. If you bring all
this then what are you going to eat?

281
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,901
We have a small family you know.

282
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:14,641
And our maid lady is such a good cook

283
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:18,881
so we eat three delicious meal a day so
you won't have to worry about a thing.

284
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:22,151
I guess I won't have to worry
about side dishes for awhile.

285
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:26,161
Why are you standing there like that?
Have a seat. Just have a seat.

286
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:32,042
Alright, alright. Woo Young's mom.

287
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:41,292
Oh, okay. Son in law, I know that the
grandma here is helping around the house

288
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:46,571
and Woo Young's mom is tired too

289
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:54,572
so our maid lady should come here twice a week and you can
also get the side dishes from our house too. Can we do that?

290
00:22:54,942 --> 00:23:00,131
Just do that. I heard from Soo that
the grandma here looks very tired.

291
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:03,952
And I also heard that you do all
the housework even after work.

292
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:08,391
I appreciate your thought but...

293
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:13,641
Of course I know how you feel my dear son in
law. That's why you refused last time you know.

294
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,041
But son in law things are a bit
different now than before.

295
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:23,081
We live like one family even though we live in a different apartment so why
would it be such a big deal for our maid lady come by every now and then?

296
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,892
Don't you think so?

297
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:33,621
Then I will receive your help while
I'm recovering from my surgery.

298
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:34,991
That's a good idea.

299
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:38,671
Just continue to use our help after that so you
won't have to jump up and down because of the kids.

300
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:43,751
Let's just do that honey. Your grandma
is having a hard time too you know.

301
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:50,172
Then I will do that. Thank you very much.

302
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:59,561
I was flustered when both of you moved
over here at first to be honest with you.

303
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,272
Of course you were.

304
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:09,201
We felt the same way. I did misunderstand you and felt
suspicious about you at first to be honest with you.

305
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:13,781
It's natural for us to be in that
position at the time you know.

306
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:19,301
And after living so close to you I realized
it's hard to fine someone like you.

307
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:25,472
Now I can understand why my son in law
was so stubborn about marrying you.

308
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,342
I think the kids are really here now.

309
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:34,831
Oh my.

310
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:37,011
You guys had a pool party
up on the rooftop?

311
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:40,211
Yes, sir. We really had a lot of fun.

312
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,842
Woori, did you have fun too?

313
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:50,311
Woojoo, you're not cold? Your
lips are all blue now kiddo.

314
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:53,461
Mommy, I want some warm water.

315
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:56,932
- Oh, okay sweetie.
- Come here sweetie. Go on in my dear.

316
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:01,612
What happened to mother at the hospital?

317
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,472
Woori!

318
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:21,512
This is so difficult.

319
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,371
Woori, let's talk with grandpa for a bit.

320
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:28,912
Woori, let's talk this out sweetie, okay?

321
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:35,282
Grandpa really has something to tell you.

322
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:40,601
Grandpa thought about something.

323
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:44,681
In order for My Woori to be
chosen from the next audition

324
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:47,872
I was wondering what this manager
of yours should be doing.

325
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:54,621
Woori, do you want a
private piano lesson? Huh?

326
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:58,261
There could be a piano
playing scene in a drama

327
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:03,102
and if you are really good at playing the
piano then that would be a good thing, right?

328
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,382
You don't want to?

329
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:14,451
Then what should I do for you?

330
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:18,771
Woori, you should talk so I would
know what you want my dear.

331
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:24,821
There is no way of knowing what this grandpa
should do because you are saying anything Woori.

332
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:28,461
It seems like you don't
know anything grandpa.

333
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,761
What do you mean?

334
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:33,611
If you want to make me feel better you shouldn't keep
on saying that you're gonna do something for me.

335
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:36,211
But you should first appologize
to me first instead.

336
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:41,611
Grandpa, you said that you're only gonna bring me
to this place but you brought Bin over here too.

337
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:44,531
So that's what it was all along?

338
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:49,632
Woori, grandpa will truly and
sincerely apologize to you.

339
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:55,161
That day Bin was in a really bad
mood that day to be honest with you

340
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:57,992
and I brought her here to cheer her up.

341
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:06,902
But before that you were really the first child that I
brought over to this shaved ice place. And I mean that.

342
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:16,271
So, if you don't want a private piano lesson
then how about a private English lesson then?

343
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:19,381
But my new dad is doing that for me though.

344
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:22,691
I like that way more because
its so much more fun.

345
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:29,072
Then let's get you enrolled into an
academy. The very best acting school.

346
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:35,261
But the acting school is far away from home so I
won't be able to go there by myself you know.

347
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:40,231
I will take you. You have a manager right here
and you shouldn't let that go to waste kid.

348
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:45,461
Really?! So you'll be taking me to the acting
school and also bring me back grandpa?!

349
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,871
Of course my dear!

350
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:52,411
I'm your manager after all Woori. Then it's a deal,
you're gonna be attending the acting school, okay?

351
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:55,871
I love it! Then pinky swear.

352
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,531
Promise.

353
00:27:57,532 --> 00:28:00,551
You can't break your promise this time.

354
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:03,191
Of course I won't.

355
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:06,221
So don't you worry.

356
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:09,702
It's gonna melt so let's eat up.
There you go.

357
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,601
The shaved ice here is
really delicious grandpa.

358
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:20,801
Of course it is. Your manager here will
buy you plenty of it in the future, okay?

359
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:23,312
So, eat up my dear. Yes, mix
it up nicely like that too.

360
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:31,882
- Father. - Yes, son.
- What are you gonna do about Woojoo now?

361
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:39,072
Do you know how Woojoo was after
coming back from the playground?

362
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,191
Woojoo, what's wrong?

363
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,011
My Woojin.

364
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:54,632
Woojin, I miss you! My dear Woojin!

365
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:59,071
- My dear Woojin!
- It's okay, baby.

366
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,692
It's okay baby.

367
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,121
Is it that bad?

368
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:09,551
What are you gonna do now father?
My goodness.

369
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:13,002
This is worse than I thought.

370
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:36,901
Mr.Pro Kim, you are so gorgeous,
please give me an autograph.

371
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:41,301
This popularity of mine for goodness sake.
All that you're doing will be useless now.

372
00:29:41,302 --> 00:29:43,042
If you keep on doing this..

373
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:48,921
What's going on here? How did
you find out that I was here?

374
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,501
I contacted Manager Do of course.

375
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:55,581
What's going on here? Did you guys plan
something together to surprise me huh?

376
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:57,641
Is that what this is?

377
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,161
I'm off now.

378
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,291
- Don't be too hard on her.
- Bye hyung.

379
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,672
Goodbye.

380
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:08,301
We were supposed to meet up in the evening.
I made reservation at a nice restaurant.

381
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:13,092
I have someone that I don't want to wait till
dinner time because I miss him so much you know.

382
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:17,571
Who would that be?

383
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,711
There his guy name Kim Sang Min
who is my personal golf teacher.

384
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:24,761
Then shall we go on with
the special lesson?

385
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:29,521
You should teach me properly this time. You
were just fooling around last time you know.

386
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:31,712
Okay, come here silly.

387
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:36,172
- Put your left glove on. - Yes.
- Hold on a minute. Instead of this

388
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,232
This one here.

389
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:45,621
Bend your waist like that and put your
left hand on the golf club like that.

390
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:49,012
And smoothly like that.

391
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:17,431
You're here.

392
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:23,271
What happened my boy? You should've
at least told me about this?

393
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:26,241
How could you tell me about this so
suddenly early in the morning son?

394
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:28,071
I didn't want to worry you guys.

395
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:31,481
We should all worry together.

396
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:34,361
It's fortunate enough to be not
so big of an operation right?

397
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:38,171
Did the doctor say that she will be
perfectly healed after the operation?

398
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,861
Yes, mother. He said she'll be fine.

399
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:44,731
Oh my, thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

400
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:48,631
Even when I heard about the surgery I
feel like I lost ten years of my life.

401
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:52,711
Just by hearing about the surgery
it made my heart drop my boy.

402
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,861
I'm sorry for making you worry.

403
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:59,131
What are you talking about? I feel this way

404
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:02,002
so I'm sure you're feeling
a lot worse right now.

405
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,401
I bet you had all kinds
of strange thoughts son.

406
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:12,071
Being sick from time to
time is normal in life.

407
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:15,271
But bad things don't happen all the
time because of sickness either.

408
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:21,261
Don't be so anxious about it. All you have to do
now is to love her and care for her even more.

409
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:25,491
Just think of this as a challenge that comes your
way from time to time so you can be more loving.

410
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:27,662
Yes, father.

411
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:42,892
Eureka! Okay!

412
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:49,111
How many times have we been going
around in circles? I'm so tired honey.

413
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:52,981
No, you can't. They say that you have
to exercise in order for you to fart.

414
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:55,051
This is so tiring.

415
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,781
You're being such a crybaby.

416
00:32:56,782 --> 00:33:00,581
Howcome you can't even lay a fart properly? You
were so good at doing that on a normal day.

417
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,361
I also want to fart too honey, I really do!

418
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:06,681
I am so hungry. I want to eat too honey.

419
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:12,002
Why don't you go around the hospital by yourself one more
time then. I'm gonna go to the bathroom for a bit, okay?

420
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:22,491
My goodness! You did good.

421
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:24,332
Be careful.

422
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:33,211
Woojoo, look at this.

423
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,511
There a lot of potential brothers
that you can choose from here Woojoo.

424
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,281
Choose the one that you
like here the most okay?

425
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:43,031
Look, this guy over here is pretty too.
That one there looks nice too.

426
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:45,821
This guy over here too. There we are.

427
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:48,002
What do you think about this one here?

428
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:50,912
You don't like this one either?

429
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:55,321
This one is is nice looking
and so is this one too.

430
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,771
But it doesn't look like Woojin though.

431
00:33:57,772 --> 00:34:02,352
But take a good look at it, you never know if you can
find one that's even nicer looking than Woo Jin.

432
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:09,371
There isn't any. It has to
be Woo Jin no matter what.

433
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:14,952
Is that right? But try to take
a look at it more carefully.

434
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:23,772
Alright then. I guess Woo Jin was very
nice looking and precious to you.

435
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:30,541
Woojoo, let's go since your grandma
is probably waiting for you by now.

436
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:33,171
Let's look for it next time, okay?

437
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,432
Thank you.

438
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,212
- Come again.
- I will.

439
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:47,101
How do you feel eating real food after just eating
nothing but porridge for the last few days?

440
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:49,191
I think I'm able to live now.

441
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:55,361
I had a more difficult time holding in my hunger
than having the surgery to be honest with you.

442
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:58,111
Eat everything that's here equally.

443
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:01,711
And your mother in law sent
this over for you to eat.

444
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:03,621
Make sure to eat all of this too, okay?

445
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:05,311
Yes, I will.

446
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:09,732
Oh yea, you said that you'll be discharged
today right? When are you guys leaving?

447
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:13,991
Your grandma must be waiting
for you right now big time

448
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:17,871
because we're so late right? Woojoo my dear

449
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:18,722
Woojin!

450
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:21,611
Hey, Woojoo! What's going on?!

451
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:25,301
Grandpa, please hurry up and come
over here. Woojin is over here.

452
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:28,731
Huh?! Are you sure this is Woojin?

453
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:33,711
I'm sure of it! This is my little brother Yoon
Woojin. Woojin, what have you been doing here?

454
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:35,201
I know right?

455
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:40,431
Our dear little Woojoo here has been looking all over for you
WooJin, why were you here so far away? You've been a bad boy.

456
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:45,031
Grandpa, if you get mad a little much my
dear little Woojin will be scared of you.

457
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,261
Yeah, that must be so right?

458
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:53,001
Woojoo, should we hurry up and take Woojin
before someone comes and snatches it away?

459
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:55,671
Woojin, I'm so glad to see you again.

460
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:58,952
Let's not separate ever again.
You got that?

461
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:04,631
Woojoo, let's go.

462
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:07,091
Hello everyone!

463
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:08,861
Congratulations.

464
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,871
Congratulations.

465
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:12,711
Yes, thank you.

466
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,901
Thank you very much.

467
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:16,131
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

468
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,751
Congratulations.

469
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:21,772
Congratulations.

470
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:29,371
You're here.

471
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,302
It's so hectic huh?

472
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:33,292
I'm fine. Let's go this way.

473
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:45,411
Thanks for coming

474
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,801
Congratulations.

475
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:49,621
We can't miss out on such
a good day like this.

476
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:51,331
Congratulations.

477
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:53,301
Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here.

478
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:55,471
You're here.

479
00:36:55,472 --> 00:37:00,061
Oh my goodness, you look so
beautiful in that hanbok.

480
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:01,042
Do I really?

481
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:04,131
Of course you do. Have you ever heard me saying anything
I don't mean? You look beautiful because I said so.

482
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:07,111
Why does the ribbon look
so cricket like that?

483
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:09,471
Director Lee. Oh my goodness.

484
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:13,262
You've been working so hard,
keep up the good work.

485
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,532
Thank you for coming.

486
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:22,601
Mother, father. Jin Joo is here.

487
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:24,431
Hello, father and mother.

488
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,961
Welcome.

489
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:31,831
Yes, thank you. Have you been well mother?

490
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,292
- I've been well. Have you also been doing well?
- Oh my goodness!

491
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,931
This couple looks so
good together you know.

492
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:42,752
- You're here.
- Yes, you are such a sweetheart.

493
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:47,161
I sincerely congratulate your oldest
son's marriage with all my heart madam.

494
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,922
It's nice to see you again sir.

495
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:54,761
You looks so gorgeous madam. You probably
look even prettier than the bride herself.

496
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:59,691
No wonder you were able to give birth to such good
looking sons, it's because you are such a beauty madam.

497
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:00,801
- Let's go honey.
- It was nice seeing you again.

498
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:02,802
Alrighty then.

499
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:09,191
See you later.

500
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,562
Thank you ladies.

501
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,381
Don't smile at me.

502
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,831
Don't smile yet Yeon Doo.

503
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:28,761
My heart hasn't calmed down yet.

504
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:30,331
You're overreacting again.

505
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:34,072
I'm not overreacting, okay? Oh my goodness.

506
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:38,642
You are really pretty today,
you are super beautiful!

507
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:41,632
Oh man, I thought you were
a goddess or something.

508
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,742
Hey there Jin Joo!

509
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:48,751
Hey, girl!

510
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:54,091
You look really pretty, this is so awesome!
Don't you agree Taemin?

511
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:56,171
Oh yeah, Jin Joo, this is your
first time meeting Sang Min right?

512
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:59,321
Huh? Hyung is what? You
were here all along bro?

513
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:00,671
Yeah dude.

514
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,871
Really? This is your first
time seeing each other huh?

515
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:06,451
Ah yes, hello there.

516
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:09,432
Yes, hello.

517
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:15,811
The woman you liked so much that you even used a childish
strategy to trigger a jealous behavior out of her was

518
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,961
Yeon Tae huh?

519
00:39:17,962 --> 00:39:22,601
Don't look at me like someone that you already know.
This is our first time seeing each other okay?

520
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:24,291
You must feel good right now

521
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:28,091
since you're able to finally get married
to the girl that you really like.

522
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:32,051
Hey, I will be your older
brother in law pretty soon.

523
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:37,152
I know, let's get along in the future okay?
My future brother in law..

524
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:41,601
What is it? What's going on you two?

525
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:44,691
Huh? Oh, it's nothing.

526
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:47,031
Should the four of us
take a picture together?

527
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,291
Okay, shall we?

528
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:49,561
Sure!

529
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:50,571
Let's go.

530
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:52,172
Come over this way.

531
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:55,432
Over this way.

532
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:03,702
Thank you.

533
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,472

of all, at least for today.

537
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:24,852

Be careful what you eat okay?

554
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:00,111
You do not have to worry
about father and mother.

555
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:04,111
I will treat my Yeon Tae like a
princess and bring back safely.

556
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:08,571
Brother in law, there is something that
you need to keep in mind for the future.

557
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,031
What would that be?

558
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:15,322
That fact that our Yeon Tae
has two older brothers.

559
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:22,051
Not one but two and that means
whatever you do to our Yeon Tae

560
00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:25,061
will make you go through double the
punishment for what you did buddy.

561
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:27,831
You must understand very well
what I'm saying here right?

562
00:42:27,832 --> 00:42:30,811
Yes, of course sir! I
will treat her well sirs!

563
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:34,162
Stop giving him a hard time and let him
go already boys. They will be late.

564
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,501
He's right dear. You should get going miss.

565
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:38,561
We'll be back safe and sound everyone.

566
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:39,761
You do that son.

567
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:41,081
We'll be back safely everyone.

568
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:44,182
Have a good trip!

569
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:55,051
Mother, it must be heavy carrying all that
to the car so I can help you carry them.

570
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,741
You don't have to do that.

571
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,931
I will carry those mom.

572
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:01,862
Taemin, let's go.

573
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:09,961
What are you doing these days?

574
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,291
- Me?
- Yeah.

575
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,531
Mother, I've been continuously
working at the nail shop.

576
00:43:15,532 --> 00:43:17,201
I'm very good at it now.

577
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:20,901
I will be taking an exam for an official
licence and I'm very confident about that too.

578
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,422
- Really?
- Yes.

579
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:35,861
They won't be able to
oppose for too long right?

580
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:39,301
The kids are working so hard
to make it happen like that

581
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:42,771
so how would they be able to continuously
go against it honey? My goodness.

582
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:48,092
If they dare to continously oppose then I will just have to take
teacher Kim away from them and bring him to our home to live wit us.

583
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,272
You made up the decision
to go down to Kyungjoo?

584
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:02,742
It's because my aunt works down there.

585
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:07,462
What are we gonna tell Woori then?

586
00:44:10,202 --> 00:44:16,362
It can't be helped if that's what you
have to do. I will tell Woori about it.

587
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:23,272
Please take good care of the kids.

588
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:33,532
We will raise the kids well,
so don't worry about that.

589
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:39,591
Write to the kids when you get there.

590
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:45,502
Even if Woo Young said that he didn't want to see you, he didn't mean
that. He just did that because he was angry with you that's all.

591
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:49,642
So please write okay? Make sure to do that.

592
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:53,842
I will do that, I promise.

593
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,751
Ho Tae, thanks for the good work.

594
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:04,741
Yeah, I really should be appreciated
for all the good work I did.

595
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:10,831
I did nothing but make movies which are just one part so I really
was exhausted doing a daily TV series that's 120 episodes you know.

596
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:15,021
But something good came out of you working so
hard. You even got high ratings for the show too.

597
00:45:15,022 --> 00:45:19,721
Now its time for us to make
a new contract, right?

598
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:24,781
Hey, I should get back to making movies now since I made
some money. What's up with signing another contract?

599
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:27,711
Do you know how miserable I was there guy?

600
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:31,511
What do you mean you were miserable? It
looked like you were having fun to me.

601
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:35,191
I was exhausted mentally.
Mentally, you know.

602
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:38,991
My dream is way over there but my physical
body is right over here in this reality.

603
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:44,952
Do you know what that feels like guy? You would never understand
that feeling dude. Hey, you should take this back and..

604
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:55,371
- Wait a minute, this is..The money for this contract, is it for real?
- Yep.

605
00:45:55,372 --> 00:46:00,592
It's real. No more B team for you man, now
you should come into become a real director.

606
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:08,332
Does this even make any sense? Are you seriously
gonna pay me this much? Are you serious about this?

607
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:22,282
Saehwa give your hand. Open up your hand.

608
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:30,792
What are you doing?

609
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:33,391
This is a flower from the garden.

610
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,681
Liquid from the flower?

611
00:46:34,682 --> 00:46:38,132
Yeah, it's to dye your fingers red.

612
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:11,092
Hey, it's me Ho Tae.

613
00:47:13,302 --> 00:47:15,371
I will sign the contract.

614
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:20,271
But you remember the movie that I didn't finish making? Let's
sign the contract once I'm done finish making that film.

615
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:26,262
That's the term for signing that contract. I must
finish making that film no matter what. Okay?

616
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:32,371
It has been a year since I have
become a father of five children.

617
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:35,261
Mother and father, congratulations
for your 1 year anniversary!

618
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:38,091
Congratulations!

619
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:42,842
We will blow out the candle after
we count two two okay? One and Two!

620
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:50,051
Mommy and daddy, did you make a wish?

621
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:53,391
Why would they have to make a wish? People
only make a wish on birthdays silly.

622
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:56,701
Why? Don't you make a wish
whenever you blow out the candle?

623
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:59,951
Whatever, you can do that if you want.
Mom and dad, did you make a wish?

624
00:47:59,952 --> 00:48:05,051
I thought that it would be great if we
can eat out like this next year too.

625
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:07,072
I did too.

626
00:48:10,872 --> 00:48:13,081
I wanted it to do my best
to make everyone happy.

627
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:19,032
And I wanted to be a good parent but
the kids didn't open up as easily.

628
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:26,652
It's here!

629
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:43,041
Daddy, this place is really good.

630
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:45,711
- Eat to your hearts content and let me know if you need more okay?
- Okay.

631
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:48,301
- You too Bin.
- Okay.

632
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:52,201
A year has already passed but
we are still clumsy parents.

633
00:48:52,202 --> 00:48:55,121
The kids fight from time to time
and fall out every now and then

634
00:48:55,122 --> 00:49:01,092
but we there are more happier times that make them
laugh and we are slowly building up time together.

635
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:14,152
[Team Leader An Mi Jung]

636
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:24,691
Hye Sung, there is a meeting for working
on the pattern for Pro Yoon right?

637
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:27,171
Yes, ma'am. There is a meeting with the
design team at 3:00 pm this afternoon.

638
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:31,131
The hand drawn portrait of Pro Yoon that he draw
himself which I got to see last time was outstanding.

639
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,781
The individuality of the athlete is
important because of the high profile name

640
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:36,911
so please make sure to take care of the athlete in
detail whenever you are working on the pattern.

641
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:40,202
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh and Assistant Chun

642
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,632
Assistant Chun.

643
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:51,881
Oh about this year's FW season, is
the photobook for that out yet?

644
00:49:51,882 --> 00:49:56,291
Not yet. The agency has sent us a planned visual of the project but
it came out to be a mess so I'm reorganizing everything right now.

645
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:59,302
I think I can submitted it by
tomorrow morning sometime.

646
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:01,622
Oh yeah?

647
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:06,022
Oh and Assistant Chun.

648
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:13,972
Could it be that, You are not dissatisfied by losing
the team leader spot to me or anything right?

649
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:18,411
No, I'm not okay? How could you
think up something like that?

650
00:50:18,412 --> 00:50:21,421
I was just joking.

651
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:26,151
Young Jae, you have handed over the summer sale
POP and the poster to the sales team right?

652
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:28,461
Yes, ma'am. I have handed all
over earlier this morning.

653
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:32,141
You should help out Assistant Chun since
she's having a hard time right now.

654
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:33,502
Yes, ma'am.

655
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:38,542
I will be back, I'm gonna go to the directors
office a for a little bit everyone.

656
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:50,781
What should I help with?

657
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,052
I will do it myself.

658
00:51:00,492 --> 00:51:03,581
Mr. director sir. Are you
really busy right now?

659
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:07,722
Yes, I am super busy. Why, what's up?

660
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:15,761
This is regarding Pro Kim's signing his contract
again. I have a headache because of this.

661
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:21,151
The term for the contract that Miracle company is
offering right now is totally shocking you know.

662
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:27,311
They told him that they will pay him twice as much as what we are offering here at Crystal
fashion, which includes the contract fee, incentive, and the training expenses too.

663
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:31,251
Would that even be possible? What we are
paying him isn't a small amount either.

664
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:34,991
They are desperate since the athletes that
they are sponsoring have poor results.

665
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:39,081
They are trying to get a hold of Pro Kim no matter what since
he has good results with a good fashion sense to boot.

666
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:43,911
Considering our budget we won't be ale to give him anything
more than what we originally offered him you know.

667
00:51:43,912 --> 00:51:47,422
What are we gonna do, Mr. director?

668
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:53,331
What else can we do? We should try to get a hold of him somehow.
If Pro Kim leaves then we would be at a great loss too.

669
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:56,021
How are you gonna grab him?

670
00:51:56,022 --> 00:51:59,591
I won't be able to get any answers if I
just sit here and worry all day long.

671
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:03,832
We should be calm and talk it out whenever we are going
through something like this you know. My goodness.

672
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,641
Hey, Brother in law.

673
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:20,621
Yes, hyungnim. What do you need sir?

674
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:26,631
I'm sure You are getting a lot of offers right now so I
was wondering if you are carefully taking a look at them.

675
00:52:26,632 --> 00:52:29,521
Yes, I am here at the office of
the agency taking a look at...

676
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:33,691
You are not gonna make a decision
all on your own are you?

677
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,161
Of course not, I would have to
discuss with the agency as well.

678
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:40,671
You should also discuss with Yeon Tae too.

679
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:45,821
- Pardon?
- You don't discuss that kind of stuff with Yeon Tae or something?

680
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:51,121
The contract for a sponsorship is a very important matter you
know. A married couple should discuss it with each other, right?

681
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:56,861
A married couple with a good relationship shouldn't have any secrets
and it's all about sharing everything together, okay brother in law?

682
00:52:56,862 --> 00:53:00,621
Do you even know what
I'm talking about here?

683
00:53:00,622 --> 00:53:05,591
Yes, I do sir. But hyungnim

684
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:12,261
you couldn't be pressuring me to resign the contract with
Crystal fashion subtly by bringing up Yeon Tae right?

685
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:15,261
What are you talking about guy? You
are the one that should decided that.

686
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:19,502
How could I be able to make it happen
by pressuring for goodness sake?

687
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,231
Look at this, you look so much better
with the clothes from here you know.

688
00:53:26,232 --> 00:53:28,921
The clothes from this brand is match
made in heaven for you Sang Min!

689
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:33,552
Do not try to persuade me girl. Private and
business matters are two different things okay?

690
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:38,521
Yes, this is Pro Kim Sang Min.
He is the model for this brand.

691
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:41,082
- Doesn't this look super good on him?
- Yes, he does.

692
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:44,172
You can go now.

693
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:53,911
Honey, be honest with me.

694
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:57,181
Would you like it if things go
better for us or your brother?

695
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:59,781
If things go well for my brother it
would be good for us too you know.

696
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:06,181
And also the brand that you were telling me about does give you a lot of money but you're the
one that told me that the quality of sponsorship for training is still pretty low there.

697
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:11,181
You're the one who acknowledged the fact that my
brother's company is the best when it comes to quality.

698
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:15,901
Yeon Doo my dear. That's not the kind
of answer that I wanted by the way.

699
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:20,101
I wasn't talking about anything that sounds so work
related. What is it that you really want Yeon Doo?

700
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:24,181
Me? I would be happy for you
to succeed the most of course.

701
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:28,131
Right? I'm always your first priority
to you. And I'm your number one right?

702
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,431
Of course, I would you ask something
so obvious like that for?

703
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:34,611
You should make sure to confirm all
that everytime you are reminded of it.

704
00:54:34,612 --> 00:54:38,992
Then you'll be working again for
my brother's company right?

705
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,642
Alright girlie.

706
00:54:55,152 --> 00:54:58,151
Let's go sign that contract.

707
00:54:58,152 --> 00:55:01,381
So, you'll be opening up
your own shop Jin Joo?

708
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:08,142
My director wants me to stay and work as
a manager but I have a dream too okay?

709
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:11,132
Look at this.

710
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:16,541
After seeing this I decided to look into it and I
realized that I can run a business of my own too.

711
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:20,631
You have a lot of regulars and you have the chops
so you'll be able to go for something like this.

712
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:24,221
I know right? You have to
cheer me on okay Taemin?

713
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:28,472
My mom and dad are against it. They don't think
that I'm capable of running my own business.

714
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:31,391
Should I invest in your business?

715
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:33,742
How much are you gonna
invest in it anyways?

716
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:39,062
How much do you need? 30,000 won?
50,000 won?

717
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,831
What the hell?

718
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:45,412
[Laughing]

719
00:55:47,372 --> 00:55:51,692
I told you to come out and eat
and you're still sleeping?!

720
00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:58,711
Mom, let me sleep for ten minutes more!
Just five more minutes!

721
00:55:58,712 --> 00:56:01,701
Hurry up and come out to eat or else
I'm gonna clear the table then.

722
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:05,891
Lee Bin! If you eat you're the one that gets
full and not me! Hurry up and come out to eat.

723
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:08,811
- Hurry up.
- I hate you mom!

724
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:10,362
What?

725
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:15,772
You hate me now? You come over here right
now girlie. Come over here right now.

726
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:20,232
Get up, you're not gonna get up?
You're not gonna get up?

727
00:56:22,622 --> 00:56:25,832
Come over here. I'm gonna
have to carry you out now.

728
00:56:28,282 --> 00:56:30,971
Mother and father. We are here.

729
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:34,111
- Welcome.
- Hello.

730
00:56:34,112 --> 00:56:36,592
Our sweet little Joon is here.

731
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:39,232
Come to grandma.

732
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:41,681
Look at this pretty little thing.

733
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:44,691
I took him to get a shot but it was so hot
outside so I decided to stop by briefly.

734
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,211
It was hot right my babyboy?

735
00:56:47,212 --> 00:56:49,771
You went through all that hardship
to go get a shot my little baby.

736
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:52,071
He didn't cry when he got
injected by the vaccine shot?

737
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:55,201
He cried for about 30 seconds.
He stopped crying really fast.

738
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:59,111
I think our little Joon here takes
after you for being so gentle.

739
00:56:59,112 --> 00:57:02,001
I think so too. Ho Tae was so sensitive

740
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,571
that he started to cry the
moment we got to the hospital.

741
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:09,131
And I went through a lot of hardship taking him around
to places because he embarrassed me wherever we went.

742
00:57:09,132 --> 00:57:10,751
Is that right mother?

743
00:57:10,752 --> 00:57:14,561
Joon, your daddy was a cry baby.

744
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:18,842
He was a cry baby but you are not.

745
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:23,791
When you come home you should wash your hands
and change clothes, didn't I tell you that?

746
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:27,801
You play video games the moment you come home. Am I making you wash
up because it's good for your daddy here? Woo Young, you tell me.

747
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:30,411
Am I making you wash up because
it's good for your daddy here?

748
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:32,711
No, sir.

749
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:36,402
Both of you raise your arms up straight.
You're not gonna raise your arms up straight?

750
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:42,612
Honey, come here and some fruits.

751
00:57:43,382 --> 00:57:44,292
Raise your hands up high.

752
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:47,041
I'm asking you to read for me sis.

753
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:51,561
Later on. Let me do this first. And
you could just read it by yourself.

754
00:57:51,562 --> 00:57:55,571
But there are some words I cannot read yet
though. You always want to do it later sis.

755
00:57:55,572 --> 00:58:01,251
That's what I'm saying. You'll be starting school next year so how can
you still not know the Korean alphabet completely? You are so silly.

756
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:05,461
Yoon Woori, howcome you are using such ugly
words to talk to your little sister like that?

757
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:07,711
I'm tired too mom.

758
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:10,911
I barely finished my homework and
I finally am able to rest too.

759
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:13,111
Are you bragging about the fact
that you did your homework huh?

760
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,231
Mom, you don't know anything.

761
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:18,372
That's your homework, not mine.

762
00:58:20,502 --> 00:58:24,081
Woojoo, you should study hard too kiddo.

763
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:27,072
I really hate studying.

764
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:39,551
It's my oppa!

765
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:42,991
[Asia Film Festival, Directors award.
Lee Ho Tae]

766
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:45,131
First and foremost I would love to
thank you for giving me this award.

767
00:58:45,132 --> 00:58:49,721
I had many hardships and
crucial moments in my life.

768
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:54,622
I gave up making movies temporarily and I
also even peeked into other areas as well.

769
00:58:56,092 --> 00:59:00,131
During the most difficult part of my life I
started out with just one line of inspiration.

770
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:04,641
Even my son Ho Tae gets a chance to receive
an award like this for goodness sake.

771
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:10,751
But what should I do? I can think
of only one name right now.

772
00:59:10,752 --> 00:59:15,391
My forever love, and the
only woman of my life.

773
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:20,671
The woman that became my first and
last audience, my wife Mo Soon Young

774
00:59:20,672 --> 00:59:26,641
My life is complete and I was also able to finish
making this movie because she was by my side.

775
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:31,761
Soon Young, I love you dear! I
love you my son who is my rock!

776
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,031
Thank you!

777
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:38,211
Father, mother did you hear my name?
Oh my goodness, what am I gonna do?

778
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:43,081
Joon, your father received an award.
You feel very happy too, right Joon?

779
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:46,822
Congratulations dear. You went through
a lot of hardship too my dear.

780
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:53,491
He's right. You endured a lot of
hardship by being by his side.

781
00:59:53,492 --> 00:59:57,482
No mother, I really was
no help to him anyways.

782
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:03,761
I thought Ho Tae was also gonna
mention our name at least once.

783
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:09,741
That punk. I even gave him money so he
can make that movie for goodness sake.

784
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:12,581
There's nothing that comes
out of raising a kid I say.

785
01:00:12,582 --> 01:00:15,601
You finally realized such an
immortal saying like that?

786
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:20,562
You know that so well but why you
do you look so disappointed dear?

787
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:32,331
Dad, this is our first time going on a trip as a
whole family ever since you got a new car right?

788
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:34,441
I'm super happy that we're
able to fit in this car.

789
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:38,561
Oh yea? I am happy too. There's nothing we
left out right? We'll put it below there.

790
01:00:38,562 --> 01:00:39,891

794
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:48,931

- Okay.

795
01:00:48,932 --> 01:00:51,151
- Alright everybody, get in the car.
- Be careful.

796
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:53,601
What? What did you forget to bring?

797
01:00:53,602 --> 01:00:57,001
We didn't get to do this properly last time so
I brought it so we can do it better this time.

and get in the car now.

Hows this grandpa's noodles dad?

837
01:03:09,312 --> 01:03:12,771
He's right, you're the
one that made this dad.

838
01:03:12,772 --> 01:03:16,141
Whenever your daddy here was going through a hard
time I would go over to your grandpa's house

839
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:18,481
and your grandfather made a bowl
of noodles like this for me.

840
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:21,441
And everytime I had a bowl of
noodles that your grandfather made

841
01:03:21,442 --> 01:03:25,391
me forget about all of the
difficult and hard times I had.

talking about here right?

thank your dad for the food kids.

846
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:39,552
