1
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,370
<i>What is a physical body?</i>

2
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,770
<i>The body is merely an object.</i>

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,540
<i>It is an existence all too impure to</i>
<i>store the gods within us called souls.</i>

4
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,410
<i>Now, you will remember.</i>

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,820
<i>The bloodstained history</i>

6
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,610
<i>Material desire.</i>

7
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,480
<i>Hunger.</i>

8
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,450
<i>Sexual drive.</i>

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,580
<i>Desire to dominate.</i>

10
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,780
<i>Desire for fame.</i>

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,420
<i>As long as there is a body,</i>
<i>desires will be born.</i>

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,990
<i>As long as there is desire,</i>
<i>human ego will not disappear.</i>

13
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,860
<i>Humans will continue to</i>
<i>fight to fulfill their…</i>

14
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,900
<i>…bodies’ desires,</i>
<i>and it will never end.</i>

15
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,740
<i>At this rate, there is no future!</i>

16
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,930
<i>Now, awaken your soul!</i>

17
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,210
<i>Now, be rid of that filthy body.</i>

18
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,850
<i>We are Scratch,</i>
<i>an electronic transcendence group.</i>

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>We are disciples of God,</i>
<i>sent here to free your soul from…</i>

20
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,490
<i>…your body and lead you to</i>
<i>the infinite sea of electrons.</i>

21
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,430
BRAIN SCRATCH

22
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,600
<i>Good evening. This is CBC News.</i>

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,380
<i>First, we have news about the</i>
<i>electronic transcendence group Scratch.</i>

24
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,210
<i>Last week, the ISSP and all</i>
<i>Sol solar system police departments…</i>

25
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,150
<i>…received the wanted poster</i>
<i>for the leader, Londes…</i>

26
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,890
<i>…and began searching the homes</i>
<i>of high-ranking members…</i>

27
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,770
<i>Here at the scene…</i>

28
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
<i>Enticing people with “easy entry”</i>
<i>and “salvation of the soul”…</i>

29
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,580
<i>…Scratch has been able to</i>
<i>constantly grow in numbers…</i>

30
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,940
<i>However, another suicide…</i>

31
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,550
<i>The members of Scratch use</i>
<i>the brain wave control device…</i>

32
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,590
<i>…on this new game console to</i>
<i>scan their own brain waves…</i>

33
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,150
<i>…and use a program created</i>
<i>by their leader, Londes…</i>

34
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,030
<i>…which is said to copy the spirit</i>
<i>from brain waves as digital data…</i>

35
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,340
<i>…and upload that spirit data</i>
<i>into the universal network.</i>

36
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,300
<i>They believe that doing this will make</i>
<i>them exist as a soul without a body,</i>

37
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,570
<i>Now Professor, they say that Londes,</i>
<i>the leader, was once a doctor.</i>

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,370
<i>Is such a thing possible?</i>

39
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,010
<i>This is ridiculous. Completely in</i>
<i>the realm of science fiction.</i>

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,410
<i>It may be theoretically,</i>
<i>possible to do so…</i>

41
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,990
<i>…but a theory is only,</i>
<i>a theory, in the end.</i>

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,820
<i>Yes, and…</i>

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,390
<i>…he hasn’t returned for two weeks.</i>

44
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,730
<i>Lady, you have to talk</i>
<i>it out with your husband.</i>

45
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,990
<i>It’s about your son…</i>

46
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,430
<i>But… He isn’t the type that</i>
<i>would just run away from home…</i>

47
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,660
<i>Could he have been kidnapped?!</i>

48
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,230
<i>Lady, are you listening</i>
<i>to what I’m saying?</i>

49
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>That’s got to be it!</i>

50
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,740
<i>That religion that’s been popular</i>
<i>lately… That whatchamacallit…</i>

51
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,110
<i>All right, we’re gonna take a break.</i>

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,710
<i>Hi! Today, I’m introducing Power CDJ, an</i>
<i>item for DJ’s who don’t exercise much!</i>

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,720
<i>You adjust the BPM using this lever…</i>

54
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,490
<i>…and it allows you to</i>
<i>be a DJ while you exercise!</i>

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,660
<i>Then, the reason you</i>
<i>decided to join is…?</i>

56
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,640
<i>Yes, er, I… I got tired</i>
<i>of a debt-filled life…</i>

57
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,110
<i>…and that was when</i>
<i>I found this… Yes…</i>

58
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,540
<i>If I rid myself of a body,</i>
<i>I’ll no longer need money</i>

59
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,110
Hey, Jet!

60
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,270
Hold on, it’s almost done.

61
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,010
I don’t care! Just get over here!

62
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,990
<i>By releasing the spirit from the body,</i>
<i>we are able to discard all desire.</i>

63
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,980
—<i>So you’re going to forget your debt?</i>
—I thought we hadn’t seen her in a while.

64
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,730
What kind of joke is this?

65
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
<i>Brain Dream!</i>

66
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,230
<i>The new game console, Brain Dream,</i>
<i>can read your mind!</i>

67
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,110
<i>Control your games</i>
<i>the way that you want to!</i>

68
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,580
<i>Are you always fighting</i>
<i>with your controls?</i>

69
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,010
<i>Do the cords get tangled?</i>

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,820
<i>If that’s the case then</i>
<i>let’s dream together!</i>

71
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,230
<i>And so, at our station,</i>
<i>we have the strictest policies…</i>

72
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,890
<i>…in the world, and against</i>
<i>programs such as this…</i>

73
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,190
Oh, there it is.

74
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,800
I’m gonna eat now!

75
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,300
Doctor Londes. Wanted for murder.

76
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,930
The bounty is an amazing 38 million.

77
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,200
I see. That’s enough for
her to flake out on us.

78
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,510
This guy was apparently a neurobiology
researcher fifty years ago.

79
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,950
However, one day he suddenly
had a vision from God…

80
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,150
…and immersed himself in research
to store the human spirit…

81
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,520
…the functions of the brain
itself, as digital data.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,220
Since then, he’s been missing…

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,660
Then, two years ago, he suddenly
reappeared to form…

84
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,700
…the electronic transcendence
group Scratch.

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,260
What the hell is that?

86
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,770
In other words, a new religious cult.

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
Anyway, according to him…

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,680
The human brain function itself is
a weak stream of electronic pulses…

89
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,380
…so if you are able to copy that
as data, and replay it over…

90
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,180
…the universal network as a program,
you can exist only as a soul…

91
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,060
Are you listening to me?

92
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,690
Well, it’s up to you
to believe it or not.

93
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,290
There are already 20,000 believers.

94
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,030
Of which approximately 100 have
committed suicide or ended up missing.

95
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,140
And so the cops have started
moving their lazy asses.

96
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,970
His face ain’t appetizing.

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,300
Seconds!

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,040
That’s all.

99
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,270
We’re gonna go after him, too.

100
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,580
<i>We are Scratch,</i>
<i>an electronic transcendence group.</i>

101
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,610
<i>We are disciples of God,</i>
<i>sent here to free your soul from…</i>

102
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,090
<i>…your body and lead you to</i>
<i>the infinite sea of electrons.</i>

103
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,020
Searching, searching, where are you?

104
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, so you want to be a member as well?

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,230
Y-Yeah, I guess…

106
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,070
For that, we need to
cleanse your soul first.

107
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,440
As the first step…

108
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,410
Uh… before that,
I want to meet this Mr. Londes…

109
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Do you know where he is?

110
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,050
Oh, of course.

111
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,380
Really?

112
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,950
He’s in heaven.

113
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,420
Londes?

114
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,490
Hum, did such a guy exist?

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Ya gotta help me, old man.

116
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,200
You’re the only colleague of
his that is still alive.

117
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,700
Can’t you remember something? Anything?

118
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,110
Maybe he existed… Maybe he didn’t…

119
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,510
Which is it?

120
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,720
Oh, then you want to
be a member as well?

121
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,120
Yeah, I guess…

122
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,850
For that, we need to
cleanse your soul first.

123
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,420
As the first step…

124
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,330
Oh, can I ask something before that?

125
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,200
I want to see Mr. Londes…

126
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,260
Well, anything, his soul or whatever,
will do, but how can I meet him?

127
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,810
Do you really want to become a member?

128
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,490
<i>And so Dr. Londes is the</i>
<i>center of everyone’s attention…</i>

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,980
<i>The first big-name guy in a while!</i>

130
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,150
<i>Unfortunately, we have</i>
<i>absolutely no new information!</i>

131
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,250
<i>Oh, my…</i>

132
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,560
<i>Everyone is doing their best to find him,</i>
<i>but there just isn’t any information.</i>

133
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,760
<i>We’re seeing his face virtually,</i>
<i>every day from Scratch’s…</i>

134
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,770
<i>…TV programs, but we know</i>
<i>nothing important about him.</i>

135
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,270
<i>Is he really a soul without a body?</i>

136
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,510
<i>Now, I have one other</i>
<i>bit of important news for you.</i>

137
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,320
<i>Oh? What is it?</i>

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,370
<i>Actually…</i>

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,750
<i>Hurry up and tell me!</i>

140
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,120
<i>We’ve been on the air</i>
<i>for a long time now…</i>

141
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,520
<i>…and I know it’s sudden,</i>
<i>but this is our final episode!</i>

142
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,750
<i>You’re kidding!</i>

143
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,100
<i>They’re canning us because of</i>
<i>low ratings, unfortunately…</i>

144
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,890
<i>Unfortunately?!</i>
<i>How come I didn’t hear about this?!</i>

145
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,970
No good?

146
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,200
No good.

147
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
I got nothing, either.

148
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,200
Nope, nope…

149
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,310
I went after his colleagues
from his research days…

150
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,680
…but it was all for nothing.

151
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,350
And I got nothing out of the members.

152
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,390
Oh, it’s Faye-Faye.

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,160
<i>I’m in… a little… trouble.</i>

154
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,670
<i>Are you listening…?</i>

155
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,200
<i>I think I really can…</i>
<i>get rid of my debt…</i>

156
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,670
Anyway, I’m trusting you with Faye.

157
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,020
<i>And I’m gonna be having a hard time if</i>
<i>you’re gonna be baby-sitting forever…</i>

158
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,990
As I said!

159
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,290
Brain Dream is pretty rare!
I have to line up here if I want one!

160
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,790
<i>Are you really going</i>
<i>to hack into his home page?</i>

161
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,890
That’s the only lead we got left.

162
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,530
<i>Beyond that… Faye seems to have</i>
<i>dug something up, so we can use that…</i>

163
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,630
Oof, it’s about that time.

164
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,380
All right, go for it.

165
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,240
Okay…

166
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,420
<i>Welcome to Scratch,</i>
<i>an electronic transcendence group.</i>

167
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,460
<i>Head straight if you wish to join us.</i>

168
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,550
<i>Head over that way to request more</i>
<i>detailed information about Scratch.</i>

169
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,660
So I guess I can’t copy
my spirit immediately…

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,990
Guess I have no choice…

171
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,170
<i>Joining us?</i>
<i>Please input your personal data.</i>

172
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,970
Data, data.

173
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,480
Fake data!

174
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,980
<i>Blood, muscle, and bone…</i>

175
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,650
<i>When those are lost,</i>
<i>humans face death…</i>

176
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,970
<i>What lies beyond that?</i>
<i>Heaven? Hell? Reincarnation?</i>

177
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,700
<i>Such things cannot possibly exist.</i>
<i>Those are mere excuses…</i>

178
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,710
What’s wrong?

179
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,970
What is this?

180
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:54,520
<i>None of the previous paths to salvation</i>
<i>had such a clear vision as this…</i>

181
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,500
<i>Awaken your spirit!</i>

182
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,630
<i>Now, be rid of that filthy body.</i>

183
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,610
High frequency?

184
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,980
<i>Yeah. I’m not exactly sure…</i>

185
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>…but it has some contraption that</i>
<i>paralyzes the sympathetic nerves.</i>

186
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,420
In just seconds, everything before my
eyes went blank and I passed out.

187
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,700
If Ein didn’t realize it and bite me,
I would have been…

188
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,690
…a member of Scratch.

189
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,240
Anyway, we need to devise
a countermeasure to…

190
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,260
<i>Well, I’ll try becoming a member now.</i>

191
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,110
Hey, Spike!

192
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,070
<i>Hey!</i>

193
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,820
I’m sure dogs have brain waves, too…

194
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,010
Ed wanna wear it, too!

195
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,250
If you become a member,
who is going to look Londes up?

196
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,180
Do it.

197
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,860
<i>Welcome to Scratch,</i>
<i>an electronic transcendence gr…</i>

198
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,590
Oh! Good going, Ed!

199
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,650
This is…

200
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,190
Can this really be?

201
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,360
<i>A guy named Londes never existed.</i>

202
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,440
His past, all the records…

203
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,030
…they were all counterfeit.

204
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,170
And all the controls
lead back to here…

205
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,150
Alles Valley Hospice.

206
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,590
Ed, help me.

207
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,100
Papa!

208
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,710
Not yet!

209
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,230
Papa!

210
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,960
Nobody here would want visitors.

211
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,460
And you need an
appointment to see someone.

212
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,020
Or did you come here
for inheritance?

213
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,400
Nothing of the sort!

214
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,460
Actually, this girl’s
twin brother is here.

215
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,830
Papa!

216
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,830
Girl? Is she really a girl?

217
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,030
Papa!

218
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,070
A-Actually… it’s a long story…

219
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,780
<i>I’m just having her sleep.</i>

220
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:14,050
<i>Of course, the other bounty,</i>
<i>hunters all slept to death.</i>

221
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,290
We finally tracked the
long-lost brother to be here.

222
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,540
Papa!

223
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,130
It was a shock to my daughter…
She has been insane ever since…

224
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,410
…and I thought about having
her meet her brother just once.

225
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,570
You can go.

226
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,270
I can’t thank you enough.

227
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,040
Why do you kill off your members?

228
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,750
What’s your purpose?

229
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,420
<i>I am not forcing anything.</i>

230
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,990
<i>They are merely practicing a faith</i>
<i>that they decided to believe.</i>

231
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,760
<i>Why do you think people believe in God?</i>

232
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,260
<i>It’s because they want to.</i>

233
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,070
<i>It’s not easy living</i>
<i>in this rotten world.</i>

234
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,550
<i>There is nothing certain while</i>
<i>living on in this world.</i>

235
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,580
<i>Do you get it?</i>

236
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,780
<i>God didn’t create humans.</i>

237
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,520
<i>Humans created God.</i>

238
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,530
He’s it?

239
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,530
I’m sick of this little act.

240
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,540
What’s wrong? Come on out.
An illusion isn’t enough for me.

241
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,910
<i>That is correct…</i>

242
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,750
<i>A man named Londes does</i>
<i>not exist in this world.</i>

243
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,610
<i>He is merely an imaginary,</i>
<i>character I created…</i>

244
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,990
<i>…a mere illusion created</i>
<i>by scanning lines.</i>

245
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,920
Is this a brain wave
controller like Brain Dream?

246
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,770
Hey, Ed.

247
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,960
Can you cut off the connection between
the brain wave controller and the network?

248
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,200
Yeah.

249
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,570
All right. But don’t turn
off the life support system.

250
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,580
<i>Do you know what the greatest and worst</i>
<i>invention that humans ever made was?</i>

251
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,180
<i>Television.</i>

252
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,650
<i>Television controls people</i>
<i>using information…</i>

253
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
<i>…and steals their sense of reality,</i>

254
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,960
<i>Yes. Now, television</i>
<i>itself is a religion.</i>

255
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:41,470
<i>TV has created people that are easily,</i>
<i>fooled by such an idiotic fantasy,</i>

256
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,490
Just like a little kid.

257
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,190
<i>What…?</i>

258
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,000
You are the one who can’t tell…
fantasy from reality, Londes.

259
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,230
If you want to dream, dream alone.

260
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,270
<i>W- What do you know?!</i>

261
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,740
<i>What do you think you know about me?</i>

262
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,110
<i>What… What are you doing?!</i>

263
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,280
<i>Stop!</i>

264
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,840
<i>Help! You can’t do that!</i>

265
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,310
<i>Stop!</i>

266
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,320
<i>Shit!</i>

267
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,450
<i>Stop it!</i>

268
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,890
<i>Stop it!!</i>

269
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,330
<i>Don’t turn it off!</i>

270
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,830
<i>What… What did I do?!</i>

271
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,000
<i>N- No… This is unfair…</i>

272
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
<i>Why… am I the only one…?</i>

273
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,940
<i>Shit…</i>

274
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,270
<i>Everyone should have…</i>

275
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,180
<i>…had the same body as me…</i>

276
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,710
<i>No… I…</i>

277
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,750
<i>I don’t want to disappear!</i>

278
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,880
<i>I don’t want to disappear…</i>

279
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,360
Ronny Spangen. Previously a hacker.

280
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,020
A boy who became
a vegetable two years ago…

281
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,700
…when he was 13,
from a medical accident.

282
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,910
No… you are no longer a boy.
You’re a damn good con artist.

283
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,360
Oh, long time no see.

284
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,690
Where am I?

285
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,020
It was all a kid’s dream.

286
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,030
Yeah, all he could do was dream…

287
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,310
This time, have sweet dreams.

288
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,960
<i>Our souls that God has</i>
<i>given us… our spirit.</i>

289
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,220
<i>Is not our body an existence all too</i>
<i>small and weak for our spirits…</i>

290
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,100
<i>…which found a way,</i>
<i>to swim through…</i>

291
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:29,130
<i>…the vast network and live</i>
<i>in the infinity of space?</i>

292
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,030
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

293
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:56,370
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

294
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:02,070
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

295
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:08,810
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

296
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:18,060
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

297
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,070
The real folk blues.

298
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:31,480
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

299
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:39,110
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

300
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,610
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

301
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:52,530
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

302
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,330
