1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,520
Everyone stop!

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,770
Isn't today the important entrance exam day?

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,570
I always wanted to go to Tachibana Ichi High.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,600
But during my parent teacher meetings,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,180
my homeroom teacher said Ichi  High was a bit tough.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,730
Can we watch it together?

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,280
I couldn't fulfill my dreams.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,760
I wonder what problem

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,260
this anonymous person has with the exam.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,860
Maybe they're challenging the test itself.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,120
So you're saying we should just

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,270
place people in the

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,380
closest high school, without any regard to ability?

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,040
We'll all be

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,780
tied to our areas for so long

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,300
- it'll ruin the country.
- But people have other

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,920
things to offer besides their grades.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,850
In these kind of arguments it seems

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,740
like the smart people are

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,780
always so mean and the other people seem so kind.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,130
So why do the people who do study get rejected?

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,560
The people who go to lower

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,010
- ranked schools didn't study?
- Another extreme argument.

24
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,590
People have always recognized that

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,040
we have different ability levels.

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,790
We should all try our best.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,250
From those efforts then

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,200
we can figure out how far we can actually go.

29
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,860
But your ability

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,920
to study isn't something that can be judged.

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,270
- So where?
- Parents should

32
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,200
praise their kids at home.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,460
You should be able to do it on your own.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,600
That's what everyone used to be like.

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,610
We didn't all hold hands when we ran in a race.

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,520
Even though I was last I did my best.

37
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,910
And my mother,

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,660
she told me I did a good job to

39
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,090
keep running to the end.

40
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,430
My parents always had

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,930
my bad drawings decorating their room.

42
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,400
The high school exam should be the same way.

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,430
On results day, my number was not among the ones

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,590
being posted up.

45
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,610
No matter how many times

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,940
I blinked, it wouldn't appear.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,350
Everything fall apart for me.

48
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,390
Why? My self grading

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,450
had me over the borderline.

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,260
There was a classmate

51
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,650
who was four points below me and he got in.

52
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,690
Down with the exam?

53
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,400
Perhaps the person doing this is

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,190
not angry with the test but with the grading.

55
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,730
Ah, we had a grading

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,600
problem here 4 years ago that we had to deal with.

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,410
Maybe someone who is still holding a grudge?

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,230
The ringleader may not be someone now

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,160
but a person who was affected by a previous grading mistake?

60
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,570
They're no victim then, just someone who didn't pass.

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,520
Really? Is that so?

62
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,140
Ogino-kun, you know we can't really say that.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,570
- It would be in the papers.
- But...

64
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,510
Everyone thinks

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,360
the school is full of bad, evil people.

66
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,650
But we're actually trying to save them.

67
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,820
If we went against what the rules say

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,730
the media would've been all over it a long time ago.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,670
Yeah, that's true.

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,210
There have been plenty of protests

71
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,380
against grading mistakes.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,400
But we have the rules in place to

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,060
deal with any kind of disturbance fairly.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,880
I've decided what we'll do.

75
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,850
Ogino-kun, call everyone in.

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,060
What about the student?

77
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,230
Matsushima-kun can take her home.

78
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,990
They can go back now.

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,440
Matsushima-sensei can go home now?

80
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,360
We can't have the relative of a test taker in here.

81
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,360
That's always been the rule.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,870
I got into Narasawa Academy.

83
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,900
Then I joined the Broadcasting Club, famous for their computers.

84
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,290
In order to find good material for a documentary

85
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,930
I'd read the newspaper front to back every day.

86
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,280
And then this June,

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,660
I found an article that started it all.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
People around the prefecture

89
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,310
made formal claims to see their entrance exams.

90
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,420
So I also made a claim to see my own exam.

91
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,280
Just one day.

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,300
To decide three years...

93
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,210
No, to decide your life.

94
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,990
You know all this, right?

95
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,860
This isn't some time for a lovers' fight.

96
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,750
And to damage the exam just

97
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,440
so someone doesn't go to a resort hotel?

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,810
I can't forgive that.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,500
It would be terrible if the exam failed.

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,140
So I

101
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,700
would do what I can to clear things up.

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,250
I would do whatever I could

103
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,620
to make sure this exam was a success.

104
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,070
I thought that's what we all wanted.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,090
But, I don't think that's true at all.

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,980
What are you planning?

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,640
Tell everyone, right here, right now.

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,570
Haruyama-sensei.

109
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:46,390

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,070
Wait, what's going on?

113
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,180
Just calm down.

114
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,190
But...

115
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,110
really?

116
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,720
Is it a mistake?

117
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,210
What do you want me to say?

118
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,290
Sorry to interrupt.

119
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,270
Everyone, please come back to the office.

120
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,200
However, Matsushima-sensei

121
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
please take Ishikawa-san back home.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,450
Why me?

123
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,560
The Principal is ready

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,030
to decide what to do about the grading.

125
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,330
It may have something to do with you

126
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,630
- personally, so in order to avoid any misunderstandings.
- I see.

127
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
I can go home?

128
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,040
Are you done talking to her?

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,860
Is there anything else you're hiding?

130
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,720
- No.
- Then, it's fine.

131
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,520
We'll talk with you again on another day.

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,900
Ogino-sensei, I'll go with them.

133
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,900
Ishikawa-san may try to get out of

134
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,180
what she did by lying to

135
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Matsushima-sensei, I believe.

136
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,270
She wouldn't...

137
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,500
No, I agree with Takimoto-sensei.

138
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,930
There's a good percentage of that happening.

139
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,750
- I think we should do it.
- I'm okay with it.

140
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,190
But maybe you'll fight again?

141
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,350
Then we'll have another problem on our hands.

142
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,100
I can't deny that but

143
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,290
another female teacher is fine too.

144
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,450
Takimoto-sensei, please.

145
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,650
You can go home too if you'd like.

146
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,950
I'll come back. But

147
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,430
I'd need my phone.

148
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,120
I see. Well, let's get back then.

149
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,710
In regards to the grading issue...

150
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,350
Wait a second!

151
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,720
Murai-sensei said that Haruyama-sensei

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,340
is responsible for everything.

153
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,300
We can't talk about grading until we figure that out.

154
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,510
Is it true, Haruyama-sensei?

155
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,310
What do you want me to say?

156
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,010
The poster.

157
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,150
Down with the entrance exam!

158
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,610
Ishikawa never said she did that.

159
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,250
When we were getting ready for the test

160
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,890
yesterday, I opened the key box a little early.

161
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,570
All the second year keys were gone.

162
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,460
I thought everyone had left

163
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,180
so I hurried upstairs.

164
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,760
Then I went back to the staff room

165
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,280
and Haruyama-sensei was back plus all the keys.

166
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,640
What were you doing there?

167
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,620
I hate to do this but I can ask a question first?

168
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,680
Sure.

169
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,630
Murai-sensei, are you not involved with today?

170
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,870
Not at all. What do you think?

171
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
I didn't put up the posters.

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Down with the entrance exam!

173
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,010
But.

174
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,150
I supported the

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,410
accidents today.

176
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,680
Really?

177
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,590
Murai-sensei, sorry to have suspected you.

178
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,280
I'll tell you everything I know.

179
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,410
The real leader is someone in this school.

180
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,730
I heard about all the plans from that person.

181
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,650
There's only three people in the school supporting it.

182
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,610
But it's not like we all agreed on it together

183
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,580
the leader reached out to people individually.

184
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,880
3 people? Kyoko-chan, Ishikawa Erina and then...

185
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,020
- It's not me.
- Yesterday,

186
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,100
when I was cleaning the rooms

187
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,620
I knew that Erina was going to

188
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,360
put the phone on the B class blackboard.

189
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,410
Is there a secret site about the school?

190
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,740
Mm, I wonder.

191
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,030
I don't know.

192
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,740
That's when I noticed I wasn't the

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,780
only one involved in today's plan.

194
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,990
I wondered who was really behind it all.

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,910
I was worried that someone would ask me

196
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,980
but I hoped that no students were involved.

197
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,130
But no students could come on exam day

198
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,500
so I figured it was okay.

199
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,460
So then you went to look

200
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,780
- for the phone.
- That was my intention.

201
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,140
But then that poster was in the classroom.

202
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,860
Down with the entrance exam!
But then that poster was in the classroom.

203
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,400
Down with the entrance exam!

204
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,740
We were finished with preparations.
Down with the entrance exam!

205
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,140
We were finished with preparations.

206
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,970
It would be hard for a student to get all five keys.

207
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,920
I think another teacher is involved here.

208
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,720
I was worried that person

209
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,590
would know I was looking for the phone.

210
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,330
But everyone knew that

211
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,290
Kyoko LOVE
But everyone knew that

212
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,610
Kyoko LOVE

213
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,330
Aida-sensei was big on cleaning.
Kyoko LOVE

214
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,030
So to make sure, I placed something in every classroom.

215
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,670
You wrote "Kyoko Love" on your own?

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,700
When the leader

217
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,330
found out about the phone on the blackboard

218
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,550
I asked what we should do.

219
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,110
They suggested that I use my own phone instead.

220
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,860
That's why it was in the locker.

221
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,050
I put my phone in a desk in the hallway.

222
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,510
But they thought it wouldn't be effective.

223
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,920
So they moved it.

224
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,180
It may have been a bit much.

225
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
You really were surprised.

226
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,890
Ishikawa Erina was in the charge of the phone.

227
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,250
So what was your part in the plan?

228
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,680
During the English period

229
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,490
I was supposed to give the leader two sheets.

230
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,950
Oh? I'm missing a sheet.

231
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,840
I'll take an extra.

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,800
There would be a blank sheet to keep the numbers level.

233
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,940
The plan was for the actual answer sheet to appear somewhere else.

234
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,700
So you did that!

235
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,520
But you didn't know who the leader was.

236
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,710
We had a code.

237
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,240
Excuse me,

238
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,860
when do you think the cherry blossoms will bloom this year?

239
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,360
Two days before the entrance ceremony?

240
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,090
I was asked the same thing too.

241
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,280
The phone going off would make a small panic

242
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,640
and make it easy to get the paper ready.

243
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,910
Why did you do that?

244
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,960
Isn't it obvious?

245
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,360
To take down the exam.

246
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,400
And why would you want that?

247
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,100
Right, it's a bit vague.

248
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,200
I didn't intend for the exam to go away.

249
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,070
So then what?

250
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,630
- I just wanted to create an incident.
- What?

251
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,650
I wanted to see how the school would react.

252
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,180
How they would deal with high school entrance issues.

253
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,020
But the cell phone going off was an exam disturbance.

254
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,750
It doesn't make the exam takers out to be victims.

255
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,950
The plan was for it to go off after the test was complete.

256
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,480
Then what about Shibata Asami's phone?

257
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,540
An unexpected happening.

258
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,720
I was supposed to take the completed sheet

259
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,820
after the test was complete but

260
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,020
I had to take Shibata Asami to the nurse's room.

261
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,900
So looking for the answer sheet was just a ruse?

262
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,140
No, I really looked for it. I wasn't

263
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,950
sure if he gave the

264
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,970
answer sheet to someone else helping.

265
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,770
But then, Sawamura-san found it.

266
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,340
And he wrote a tester's number on it too.

267
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,960
So then he was involved too?

268
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,520
I don't think so. He couldn't have made the posters.

269
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,180
Down with the entrance exam!

270
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,260
Another person? Didn't you do all this?

271
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,980
- No.
- Then how

272
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,430
- much did you do?
- I was just supposed to get the sheet.

273
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,950
What about the message board?

274
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,970
They're just all worked up about the exam.

275
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,300
Down with the entrance exam!
They're just all worked up about the exam.

276
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Can you really take it down?
They're just all worked up about the exam.

277
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,700
Can you really take it down?

278
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,070
The plan is perfect. Ignore the idiots.

279
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,140
What did Ishikawa do?

280
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,870
I didn't know anything about the plan to put up questions.

281
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,910
First is kanji problems. Overflow, a little while...no problem.
I didn't know anything about the plan to put up questions.

282
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,910
When was the Onin War?
I didn't know anything about the plan to put up questions.

283
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,080
But there is the issue of timing.

284
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,450
It seems like someone from the school helped with that.

285
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,250
- And after the test?
- All the talk about

286
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,680
Cell phone mom
- And after the test?
- All the talk about

287
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,080
Chairman
- And after the test?
- All the talk about

288
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,580
fighting!
- And after the test?
- All the talk about

289
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:18,590
- And after the test?
- All the talk about

290
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,320
who was involved, the details, the grades, it really surprised me.

291
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,090
One is 82.
who was involved, the details, the grades, it really surprised me.

292
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,790
The other is 100.
who was involved, the details, the grades, it really surprised me.

293
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,090
who was involved, the details, the grades, it really surprised me.

294
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,760
Perhaps it was all from Erina being here?

295
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,120
However, I think my former company was a reason for it too.

296
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,470
I think Erina was here this long

297
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,590
to get in the way of the trip of her special someone.

298
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,770
So that's why you suspected me?

299
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,030
You think she got me to help her out?

300
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,340
- Right.
- But that's not it.

301
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,400
I knew about Aida-sensei, Takimoto-sensei, and Ishikawa.

302
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,010
But anyone would have done the same in that situation.

303
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,120
- What do you mean?
- I'm serious

304
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,190
about Midori-sensei.

305
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,410
There was nothing going on with Ishikawa.

306
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,920
At her entrance exam, her phone went off

307
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,150
so the other female students were being mean towards her.

308
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,150
- I didn't know about that.
- Me neither.

309
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,930
I knew that Aida-sensei

310
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,440
was always looking after the cute girls but

311
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,310
I didn't know this about Ishikawa.

312
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,190
Wait a minute

313
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,950
are you trying to defend yourself?

314
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,030
No, that's not my intention. But

315
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,520
I just want to clear up doubts.

316
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,940
I'd rather find out

317
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,210
why Kyoko-sensei is doing all this

318
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,270
rather than look into who

319
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,440
else is involved. We've got this

320
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,480
far, trying to figure out who knew

321
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,090
what was going on in the school.

322
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,050
But that's not the whole story.

323
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,820
What's your real motive here?

324
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,330
My motive?

325
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,300
I want to learn about this school.

326
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,140
But you probably don't understand

327
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,540
why it got to this point.

328
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,200
You won't know unless you tell us.

329
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,460
That's right.

330
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
Everyone knows that

331
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,780
I lived in a foreign country until graduating high school.

332
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,370
I'm a returnee to Japan.

333
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,260
After graduating university I found work as a travel agent.

334
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,490
Then I was in charge of school trips in this prefecture.

335
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,470
It was my first chance to interact with Japanese high schoolers.

336
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,500
To me, it just seemed like they were having fun.

337
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,590
We all lived in Japan

338
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,640
but there was an innocence to them.

339
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,280
Hey, you guys. If you

340
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,910
smoke here it'll

341
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,930
- be all over the news.
- It's fine!

342
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,420
We're on a trip. A little

343
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,140
smoking won't make the news.

344
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,310
That's when I met him.

345
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,580
Okay okay okay.

346
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,630
This beautiful tour guide already explained it to you.

347
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,440
There's hundreds of years of history in this place.

348
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,040
If it burns down, what do you think would happen?

349
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,930
The moment there's fire the

350
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,420
police will come. Then

351
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,050
- that's the end of the trip.
- Really?

352
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,290
Yikes.

353
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,360
We'll finish this talk up at school.

354
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,620
Don't smoke anywhere else, okay?

355
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,100
Anyway, you should do things you can only do here!

356
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,520
The dumplings at the entrance are the best in Japan!

357
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,600
- Hurry up!
- Whatever.

358
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,420
Get to it!

359
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,930
Sorry for the trouble.

360
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,020
Ah, no...

361
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,320
Could you keep this

362
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,430
a secret from the other staff?

363
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,150
Sure, but why?

364
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,830
They'd cancel the trip and suspend the kids.

365
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,450
They may be big but they're still kids.

366
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,920
I don't want to just get them in trouble.

367
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,900
I want them to know what they did wrong.

368
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,930
I thought that he knew what it was like

369
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,950
to be a high schooler.

370
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,420
Ah, say hello to Tokuhara for me.

371
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,820
Tell him we'll go drinking next time.

372
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,170
- Oh, you know Yu-chan?
- He's my junior in university.

373
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,150
If you'd like...

374
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,170
Haruyama.

375
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,720
Kyoko-chan, you can come too.

376
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,900
I think high school is a good place

377
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,630
for kids to get ready to enter society.

378
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,770
You have to get angry at what they do wrong.

379
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,840
But you also want to leave them

380
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,210
with a lot of good memories.

381
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,500
My job is to help out with that.

382
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,800
I really respected him.

383
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,530
Terajima-san, do you have a girlfriend?

384
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
No, I don't.

385
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,130
- Still?
- Girls don't like

386
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,010
the hotblooded type nowadays.

387
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,740
I love that type, actually.

388
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,560
Well, let's drink first.

389
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,430
Yeah.

390
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Why are you looking at that?

391
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm researching what teenagers are into nowadays.

392
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,400
I see.

393
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,890
How about you try this out?

394
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,260
Come on...

395
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,930
I think it'd look good.

396
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,570
Sensei!?

397
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,420
Ah, oh man!

398
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,550
Rebound the ball!

399
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,510
Nine is open! Check it!

400
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,540
- Here's a gift from Kyoto.
- Thanks.

401
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,210
It's fun to guide students on the trips but

402
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,940
I'd like to be more involved like you.

403
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,750
- How about you become a teacher?
- Me?

404
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,240
I think it'd suit you.

405
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,280
- You'd be an energetic one.
- Like you?

406
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,210
No, more than me!

407
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,900
That trip we met, you got angry at the students, right?

408
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,660
Really? Could I do it?

409
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,990
You could.

410
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:40,430
- If you did...
- If I did?

411
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll tell you when you do!

412
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,920
Haha! What!?

413
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
If I became a teacher

414
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,060
he was going to tell me something.

415
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,330
But I never heard what.

416
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
He died?

417
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,990
- It had something to do with...
- Sakamoto-sensei.

418
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,410
Well, we need to find out.

419
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,740
Maybe Haruyama-sensei

420
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,510
is out to get revenge, right?

421
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,880
Sakamoto-sensei. Let's hear Haruyama-sensei tell us.

422
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,190
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,630
I don't really know.

424
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,230
- What?
- They say he died

425
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,310
after drinking and stumbling into a roadway.

426
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,540
I don't know if it was an accident or suicide.

427
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,190
But he was thinking long and hard about it.

428
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,540
About the entrance exam.

429
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,660
- So then...
- Sakamoto-sensei!

430
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,050
Before that,

431
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,640
please tell me something.

432
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,820
What is the high school entrance exam?

433
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,370
I've only been a teacher for a year.

434
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,130
I thought I was lucky to get into Tachibana Ichi High,

435
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,880
one of the highest ranked schools in the area.

436
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,480
The exam to get in is very hard so

437
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,500
I thought I'd figure out what the exam was very easily.

438
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,420
But, it wasn't that simple.

439
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,760
What surprised me is that the

440
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,660
students don't really have pride about going to Ichi High.

441
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,910
They probably studied very hard for it but

442
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,230
when they get in, they act like it was natural.

443
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,050
The best kids end up going to university

444
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,370
but what do they think of the high school exam?

445
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,010
Why does it have influence over your entire life?

446
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,430
And on the other side,

447
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,250
there are many people who still obsess over Ichi High.

448
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,170
The alumni who stay here and talk so much about Ichi High.

449
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,480
Isn't that natural?

450
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:05,640
The school we loved as kids

451
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,240
we still continue to love as adults.

452
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,380
Is there something wrong with that?

453
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,260
No, I think it's great.

454
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,320
But does that love of your school have anything to do with the exams?

455
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,770
But in reality...

456
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,190
It was the calculator's fault. Not mine.

457
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,500
There were so many grading mistakes.

458
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,690
Do you know about garbage day?

459
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,410
There it is, an Ichi High tradition.

460
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,000
It was just boasting.

461
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,770
I'm praying for my daughter's happiness!

462
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,540
What's the problem?

463
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,890
He's from San High!

464
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,980
Looking down on others.

465
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,610
It was just fooling around.

466
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,820
I thought it was all pointless.

467
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,700
Maybe we could do without the exam.

468
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,560
What's wrong with supporting our past?

469
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm doing what I can for Ichi High.

470
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,500
Maybe you wouldn't understand but

471
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,900
we need the entrance exam.

472
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,120
You don't think the kids need to put in effort?

473
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,130
You think those who have that one flash

474
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,130
of brilliance are better than those

475
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,840
- who work their whole lives?
- No.

476
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,930
Those people should probably stay where they are.

477
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,880
As long as they don't force their values on others

478
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,180
it won't bother anyone else. They're probably happy.

479
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,890
But those who obsess over Ichi High

480
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,740
are not all like you Sakamoto-sensei.

481
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,030
Why me?

482
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,070
You told us how you really felt

483
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,470
back there, Murai-sensei.

484
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,710
One teacher can have a tremendous impact on a student's life.

485
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,890
That's so much responsibility. That's

486
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,550
probably what I want to learn about.

487
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,830
A person who never had

488
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,920
a setback in life wouldn't understand

489
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,980
how important the entrance exam is.

490
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,580
I don't think so.

491
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,520
You don't?

492
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,910
I don't think you could understand how I felt.

493
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,410
- Why?
- You're a returnee here.

494
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,380
Without any connection to Japan you got into university.

495
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,710
Then you got your travel agency job.

496
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Then you decided to become a teacher. You passed

497
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,260
in one try. And your experience

498
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,850
abroad probably got you this far.

499
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,860
Sure, but because of that I can't relate?

500
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
I know what you think of Sakamoto-sensei

501
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
but didn't you have to use your own past to get here?

502
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,280
My past?

503
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,040
- Is that what it is?
- What?

504
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
Come on.

505
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,910
Haven't you noticed? You're chained to your past.

506
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm not chained to anything.

507
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,660
But your past will always follow you!

508
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,360
Just forget about it, Murai-sensei.

509
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,160
You passed the written exam but you failed the interview, right?

510
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,010
They were all Ichi High alumni

511
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,330
it couldn't be helped!

512
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,120
If I were them, I'd want people from my school to get in too.

513
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,660
I don't think that's true.

514
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,310
You went to Seikou Academy!

515
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,930
Perhaps. But you can't

516
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,010
keep blaming other things.

517
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,910
In a group interview, do you

518
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,930
think about how your answers stack up against other people's?

519
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,170
When you see the

520
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,340
numbers of successful people in your group

521
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,720
do you think about how they answered?

522
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,780
Did you try doing that?

523
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,520
I did. My answers

524
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
included a lot of thought about school

525
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,480
and environment issues.

526
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,650
We don't need any teachers that just worry about problems.

527
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,750
Rather, we want those who may have some fantastic goals.

528
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,880
But they have a purpose for being here,

529
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,960
something they want to do. Those are the people who are picked.

530
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,480
It doesn't mean that they pick just Ichi High alumni

531
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,960
or someone from their high school.

532
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,580
Did you ask Matsushima-sensei?

533
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,130
- Matsushima-sensei?
- He was your

534
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,740
high school teacher.

535
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,840
He's come to me

536
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,260
whenever he's needed some advice.

537
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,520
He said it.

538
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,070
He said the same thing you just told me.

539
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,560
But he was also from Ichi High. So I thought

540
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,990
he didn't know what it was like to be disadvantaged.

541
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,480
It's not a disadvantage, it makes you a good friend.

542
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,550
Haruyama-sensei, I'm sorry.

543
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,100
- I'm sorry for being out of line.
- No.

544
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm the one out of line. I've been doing

545
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,380
all the talking.

546
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,570
But,

547
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,380
I wish I could've told him one thing.

548
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:33,020
The test that he supervised had a grading mistake.

549
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,040
Even if the student committed suicide over it

550
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,380
you needed to go on.

551
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,700
You needed to stay a teacher to make sure it would never happen again.

552
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,640
Four years ago, in April,

553
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,650
a boy hung himself at home.

554
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,690
They said it was because he didn't get into his first choice for high school.

555
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,560
If there was no mistake

556
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,860
my son would have got in!

557
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,000
It's your fault that he died!

558
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,090
The boy's parents

559
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,230
requested to see his test that November.

560
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,010
There was a three point grading mistake.

561
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,920
He was involved in the mistake.

562
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,250
He blamed himself.

563
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,050
I did whatever I could to support him.

564
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,570
It isn't all your fault.

565
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,340
How long are you going to blame yourself?

566
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,010
I said whatever I could to

567
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,850
try and get him back.

568
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,280
But he always had the same reply.

569
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,330
A girl returning home to her country

570
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,290
wouldn't know anything about Japanese schools.

571
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,650
And then he died

572
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,100
three months later.
