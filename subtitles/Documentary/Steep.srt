1
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,708
John Muir said it really beautifully.

2
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:07,515
He said, ""Go to the mountains
and get their good tidings. ""

3
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,887
What he meant is
that there is so much out there

4
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,052
that you can receive from that environment.

5
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,724
We receive these amazing feelings
when we're up there

6
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:23,395
and we feel so strong and
sometimes you do bring those things back.

7
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,429
And it's special.
It's like you've been blessed.

8
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,742
I'm not sure what that is right there.

9
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,645
Ice or rock or something. Yeah.

10
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,549
Nice though. I like the deep of it.
I'm sure the snow will be good in there.

11
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,950
Magical.

12
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,283
It's got a nice start.
The snow looks perfect at the top.

13
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,850
You know, not too steep.
Get a little few warm-up turns

14
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,089
before we drop into this thing.

15
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:55,496
I didn't choose my life in the mountains.
It just happened.

16
00:03:55,803 --> 00:04:00,172
I tried to become a normal person
and have a normal job, but that didn't work.

17
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,034
As soon as I got out of jail, I went skiing.

18
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,172
As soon as I got out of broken legs,
I went skiing.

19
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:11,582
That's where I had to go
to make it all right again.

20
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,047
The rest of the world is total chaos.

21
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,459
We're mountain people. This is what we do.
This is how we live.

22
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,994
The risks are very high.

23
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,434
But I think most of us have decided
that the risk is worth it.

24
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,575
For me, as soon as the winter stops,
I get a week off.

25
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,077
I'll start dreaming about skiing.

26
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,275
This concept of just strapping
these boards on your feet.

27
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:49,615
You know, if you actually sit down and think
about it, it"s like, ""What a concept. ""

28
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,521
You know, that's great.

29
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,618
A couple of 2" x 4"s on your feet,
sliding down the mountain.

30
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,094
You know, how much fun is that?

31
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,337
The idea is simple.

32
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,840
Ski where no one thought to ski before.

33
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,876
Ski the backcountry, away from the resorts

34
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,146
and the rules and restraints
that go with them.

35
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,246
Ski where the sport of skiing
can still be an adventure.

36
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,789
A simple idea, but 35 years ago,

37
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,730
only a handful of people saw
big, wild mountains as a place to ski.

38
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,594
One of the first who did was Bill Briggs.

39
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,705
Skis are appropriate on mountain sides

40
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,009
and all kinds of mountainsides.

41
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,120
In June 1971, Briggs,

42
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:34,093
a skier and mountain guide
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming,

43
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,288
became the first person to ski

44
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:41,232
from the summit of one of
America's greatest peaks, the Grand Teton.

45
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,797
The idea wasn't, for me,

46
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,468
that I would be the only one
that would ever do this.

47
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,975
My idea was everybody
should be doing this.

48
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:59,078
At the time nobody was,
but this is something...

49
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,785
It's too much fun to pass up.

50
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,686
The Grand Teton,
it really is an iconic mountain.

51
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,460
You drive into Jackson Hole
and the first thing you see is

52
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,834
that gigantic, jagged thing
looming up there,

53
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,807
and it looks like it would be
tough to climb, let alone ski.

54
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:26,107
And in 1971, the concept of skiing
those kind of mountains

55
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,014
was very far from even
most skiers' point of view.

56
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,578
There's nobody out there with signs.

57
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,053
There's no ropes. There's no signs.
There's no patrolmen.

58
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,455
There's nobody, like,
taking care of you on the slopes.

59
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,153
It's not a ski area. You"re on your own.

60
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,026
You know,
you have to make decisions on your own.

61
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,901
Bill Briggs skiing the Grand Teton
was so far ahead of its time.

62
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,340
No one had even come across the idea that,
"Oh, hey, let's go ski that big rock

63
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,479
"with a little bit of snow on it
and call it a ski run."

64
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,681
What Bill Briggs did
was open people"s minds.

65
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:10,179
People in Jackson told Bill
skiing the Grand was impossible.

66
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,917
There were avalanches and falling rock.

67
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,189
Sections were too steep.

68
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,222
He would have to ski along cliffs
that dropped off for thousands of feet.

69
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,064
The smallest misstep could be fatal.

70
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:29,598
And Briggs was climbing and skiing
on a surgically fused right hip

71
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,406
that caused him to limp when he walked.

72
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,044
If there's no risk, there's no adventure.

73
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:40,544
I think adventure is a great part of life.

74
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,690
For me it's, "Why am I living?" You know?

75
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,585
Gee, it's to have some adventure.

76
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,193
Before dawn on June 16th,

77
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:56,225
Briggs, and three friends he had convinced
to help him climb up the Grand,

78
00:08:56,303 --> 00:09:00,364
Ieft their camp at 11, 000 feet
and began the push to the top.

79
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:07,538
The route Briggs planned would
take them up the Stettner Couloir,

80
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,315
up the avalanche-prone snowfield
on the east face

81
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,778
along the Petzoldt Ridge

82
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:20,559
and then the last few hundred feet
to the summit of the Grand.

83
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,594
I expected those guys to break trail for me.

84
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:33,066
Breaking trail is physically exhausting.

85
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:38,543
So I get up to the top of the Couloir

86
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:42,776
and I find they are all right there
and they say, "We can't do it."

87
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,818
Oh, that means I have to do it.

88
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:57,662
They took one look at the top of the Couloir
and it's a thousand-foot drop, and sheer.

89
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,556
And that was just too much.

90
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,103
Well, at that point I didn't want to quit.

91
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,298
At least I was going to see
how far I could go.

92
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,405
I think the biggest thing
is that he was alone.

93
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,213
You have this internal dialog
up there all the time.

94
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,878
You don't have your friend to talk to.

95
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,718
"You think we should go around
to the left a little?"

96
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,453
Or, "Boy, it's getting steep now."
You know, that's all in your brain.

97
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,052
You can't relay it to anyone else.

98
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:35,296
And it's fall-you-die terrain.
Where if you get avalanched, you'd be gone.

99
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,301
It's tough when you're alone.

100
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,107
His friends watched Bill pull himself up

101
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,941
onto the steep, snow-covered east face
of the Grand

102
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,615
and disappear from view.

103
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:04,260
No one saw Bill Briggs
when he reached the summit of the Grand.

104
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,095
No one saw him begin his ski descent.

105
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,196
No one saw him fall
and recover just below the summit

106
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,671
or ski the high snowfields.

107
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,973
Hours after he left them,
Bill's climbing partners waiting below

108
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,846
witnessed an avalanche tear past them.

109
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,849
They are sure that I was in it
and I had gone off this precipice

110
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,415
down a thousand feet.

111
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,462
""Well, that's Briggs
and he"s finished, right?""

112
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,928
Well, I drew a big turn

113
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,135
and I ski right up to my friends.

114
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,662
And they turn around and,
"Where did you come from?"

115
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,541
They didn't see me come through that at all.

116
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:57,743
They figured I was dead anyway.
And, all of a sudden, I reappear.

117
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,922
Bill descended more than 6,000 feet on skis.

118
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,489
It took him almost five hours
to reach the valley floor.

119
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:20,102
When I got to the bottom, I'm really tired.
I'm really physically beat

120
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,639
and...

121
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,077
Overjoyed.

122
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,546
I did it. Okay?

123
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,080
Man. This is...

124
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,515
This is the biggest thing I'll do in my life.

125
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:46,464
There were no witnesses
to Bill Briggs" achievement.

126
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,026
But the next day the proof was still etched
in the snow.

127
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,475
The editor of the local paper flew
with Bill around the summit.

128
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,105
She took four photographs.

129
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,740
And one of them was just a classic.

130
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,344
The beauty of the mountain,

131
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,080
enhanced a bit by human contact.

132
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,352
It was fabulous.

133
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,029
I don't know.

134
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,130
You dream up

135
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:26,101
what you want to accomplish

136
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,767
in your life and...

137
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,309
I don't know that many people get a chance

138
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,675
to fulfill that.

139
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:42,415
What that was...
I had at that point fulfilled a dream.

140
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,021
Totally.

141
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,468
I knew that someone had skied the Grand,

142
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,127
but I didn't know
what the Grand looked like.

143
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,365
So it just sort of, "Oh, yeah,
somebody skied the Grand."

144
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,202
And it was, you know, big news.

145
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,843
But I didn't really know what it was.

146
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,846
Doug Coombs was a teenager
growing up in Bedford, Massachusetts

147
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,782
when Bill Briggs skied the Grand.

148
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,911
The quote in his high school yearbook said,

149
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,252
"There is no such thing as too much snow. ""

150
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:25,560
Even when I was just a little tiny kid,
I would try to ski every day.

151
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,028
And where I live I could even
go skiing in my backyard.

152
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,629
My parents would flick the light on
and I'd ski at night.

153
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,833
You know, I could just go down
a little hill in the backyard.

154
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:38,435
It was flat as a pancake,
but it was icy because it was New England.

155
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,945
And I would just skate like a fiend
from the neighbor"s house

156
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,872
and then come down
through the other neighbor's house

157
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,510
and by the time I got to my house
I could do some turns.

158
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,883
No one ever said to me,
""Don't go off the trail. ""

159
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,297
We were off-piste skiing
when I was seven, 10.

160
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:03,325
I just didn't think of it as that. I just thought
it was going through the trees.

161
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,203
And then we'd go down riverbeds
and things like that and jump off waterfalls.

162
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,504
I just thought it was normal.

163
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:16,239
I grew up skiing maple trees in Vermont,
birch trees in Vermont.

164
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,681
Sometimes we weren't even on the ground.

165
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,746
We were skiing branches
and calling it good skiing.

166
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,314
We weren't even touching the snow.

167
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,318
You're not skiing the ground,
you just ski the trees.

168
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,403
If someone said you have to ski
at a ski area for the rest of your life...

169
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,531
Well, I could maybe do that when I'm 80,
but I can't do that now.

170
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,632
Every mountaineer and every skier

171
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,568
realizes the mountains are
a living, breathing thing.

172
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,102
Where's that chalk? Breathe.

173
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:55,513
When they're not happy, or just pissed off,
they're blowing, you have to read that.

174
00:16:55,582 --> 00:17:00,542
You can't just say, ""I'm gonna do this, ""
even though they're telling you, 
""Not today. ""

175
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,054
That's when you get in trouble.

176
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,787
Being able to feel what the mountains
are saying to you is huge.

177
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,795
They're alive. You know, they're totally alive
and they'll make you more alive.

178
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:18,695
You know, or they'll make you dead,
you know, if you don't read them.

179
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,900
You know, there's always bad luck,
and I don't know

180
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,138
where bad luck comes in,
but it's definitely there.

181
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,090
When you're always in that element,
the vertical world,

182
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,826
either skiing or climbing,
moving through the mountains,

183
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,165
not just being in them,
but actually moving through the mountains

184
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,330
and with the mountains, you're only a guest.

185
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,864
And you don't know
when your time is up as a guest.

186
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,413
I'm just a cheater. I've been out there
a lot longer than most people

187
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,780
and I just keep doing it
and doing it and doing it.

188
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,417
When I go out, I become more alive.

189
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,497
And that's probably the endorphins
that everyone talks about.

190
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:23,866
And I guess the more you produce,
the more you want.

191
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,801
And so I think I have been
producing a lot for a long time

192
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,274
'cause I want them all the time.

193
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,480
I just love skiing.
I like the gravitational pull.

194
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:12,749
It's not a natural motion for the human body
to stand on two planks and slide.

195
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,715
When you ski steep terrain,
all it takes on a 45-degree slope

196
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,457
to just launch into space is
a small tweak of your quadricep muscle.

197
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,558
And if you pop off that snow,
you can sail 20 feet

198
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,331
down the hill with very little effort.

199
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,936
You can almost get a feeling of flying.

200
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,611
You get up to the 50-degree range

201
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,352
and it starts to become
difficult to control yourself.

202
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,791
There's so much gravity pulling you down

203
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,665
that you get to a point
where you can't overcome it anymore.

204
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:11,569
But anything that produces
this much joy in people's lives

205
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:16,946
is worth a certain amount of risk,
physical risk, emotional risk, whatever.

206
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,952
But how much risk it's worth
is an open question.

207
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,917
Nowhere in the world are
the risks and rewards of a life

208
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:33,296
in the mountains revealed more clearly
than in the French valley of Chamonix.

209
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,259
Chamonix is the birthplace of alpinism.
It"s the motherland.

210
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,572
In the "70s and "80s,
it was always kind of held up as

211
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,510
this shining, larger-than-life destination.

212
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,208
It was like, "Oh, Cham, Chamonix."
And it was almost mythical.

213
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,183
You would aspire someday
to go ski in Chamonix.

214
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,559
The mountains are big. They're wild.
They're unbelievably aesthetic.

215
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,120
There are spires everywhere.

216
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:09,430
I mean, you cannot go there, whether you're
a skier or whether you've never seen snow,

217
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,062
and not be inspired by the landscape.

218
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,299
It will just blow your mind.

219
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,976
You know, in Chamonix,
there is a lot of people.

220
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,715
They come here
from everywhere in the world.

221
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,555
American, Swedish,
Norway, Australia, New Zealand.

222
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:38,755
There's a lot of very good extreme skiers
from everywhere in the world.

223
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,629
And they come here for the same things.

224
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:47,968
You can see if you go in the bar after 6:.00,
everybody was going crazy.

225
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,204
After a powder day or something, it's...

226
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,609
It's... You can feel the energy.

227
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:59,849
They have the same spirit.
So it's very special.

228
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,482
When you're skiing in America,

229
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,081
you're skiing in little,
controlled snow parks.

230
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,218
And everywhere is safe. You go
and you can't really get into trouble.

231
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:15,495
And in Europe, the ski areas are
basically access to the big mountains.

232
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,332
I mean, they put lifts,
you know, as high up as they can.

233
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,531
They wanted to put a lift
to the top of Mont Blanc.

234
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:24,167
So you get into a whole different level of

235
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,005
trouble over there.

236
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,781
Chamonix is one of those places
in the world of skiing

237
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,346
where every time you go there,

238
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,951
there is some chance
that you will leave in a body bag.

239
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,288
So this makes it

240
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:50,667
a little bit higher-intensity spot
than most places that you go to.

241
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,031
It's the place.
You're not a big mountain skier unless

242
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,473
you've skied Chamonix.

243
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,975
In the valley, you know,
the life is not easy when you are down.

244
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,143
When you are in the mountains,
it's very simple.

245
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,877
You have to do something right.

246
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:13,688
There is no way to do something wrong
because you die.

247
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,521
You know it's very risky, but you go,

248
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:24,798
because it's every day a new adventure,
a new story. It's magic.

249
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:34,109
In the 1970s and "80s,
extreme skiing became a sport

250
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,412
here in these mountains
around Europe's highest peak, Mont Blanc.

251
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:45,149
Europeans watched films of men
like Patrick Vallencant and Anselme Baud,

252
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,987
as they climbed and then skied

253
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,460
some of the steepest,
snow-covered faces in the Alps.

254
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:56,498
Patrick and I were more than friends.
We were like brothers.

255
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,167
We were always in control.
If we hadn't been...

256
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,469
Yeah, what can I say?
We'd be crazy.

257
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:14,050
And this is how the first viewers
of our films thought of us.

258
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,612
They thought we were insane.
But that wasn't it at all.

259
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,856
Of course, we were always
very afraid.

260
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,195
The one who's not afraid is crazy.
He's a dead man.

261
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,765
But we never panicked.

262
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,031
Like Jean-Marc Boivin
used to say,

263
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,841
you can either live your
life like a lamb,

264
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,846
or live your life like a lion.

265
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,045
We have a choice in life.

266
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,989
There was no shortage of
lions in Chamonix.

267
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,727
There were many skiers
attempting descents so extreme,

268
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,269
they appeared almost suicidal.

269
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,140
They were the early visionaries.

270
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,974
They were the people who were showing us
what could be done.

271
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,341
In the States,
Bill Briggs" descent of the Grand is

272
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:22,080
sort of the singular, crystallizing moment
for American big mountain skiing.

273
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:26,887
But there were dozens of people
doing stuff like that in Chamonix.

274
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,554
A whole series of people who were,
you know, pioneers and legends.

275
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:35,333
This whole string of people
that kept going steeper and steeper

276
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,494
and bigger and bigger.

277
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:40,666
You had people who were living and playing

278
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,207
in these mountains kind of
looking out there going,

279
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,038
"Well, what else can I do on skis?"

280
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:53,016
Even the deaths of men
like Vallencant and Boivin

281
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:57,215
did little to slow the pursuit
of bigger and steeper descents.

282
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,154
Extreme skiing is a way of life.

283
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,288
It was my way to become a man.

284
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,131
Stefano de Benedetti, like the others,

285
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:15,639
was drawn into the unskied world
around the Mont Blanc massif.

286
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,343
During the 1980s, de Benedetti made

287
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:23,075
some of the most extreme ski descents
ever attempted.

288
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,346
Some so dangerous,
they would never be repeated.

289
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,884
When you live in touch with the mountain,

290
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,892
when you spend most of
your time in the mountains

291
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,292
your vision changes completely.

292
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,958
And after three or four years,

293
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:45,197
I could see the possibility to ski

294
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,102
where nobody saw it.

295
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:57,406
In 1984, a film was made
about de Benedetti's attempt

296
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:02,648
to ski the east face of the Aiguille Blanche
on the Italian side of Mont Blanc.

297
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:06,818
A face so steep that it held snow
just a few days a year.

298
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:13,763
Imagine the line. The simple pen
stroke between base and summit.

299
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,196
It makes for an
unrepeatable experience.

300
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:21,097
Perhaps only in these
moments am I truly aware

301
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,772
that this is my mode of
expressing myself.

302
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:27,942
That this is my mode of speaking
to the others of freedom.

303
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,617
When I was sure it was the right moment,

304
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,220
it was the beginning of June.

305
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:50,394
I started from the bivouac
at 4,000 meters in the night.

306
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,165
And I climbed all over the mountain.

307
00:27:55,474 --> 00:28:01,709
When you wake up at midnight
and you cross a glacier with stars

308
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:05,182
in the black and you start climbing
these big walls

309
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,446
with avalanches, with seracs,

310
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,953
you feel you are a very little thing
in a big universe.

311
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:38,849
When I reached the top, I knew
that it was possible to ski.

312
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:44,288
I knew that that day
I would find my perfect moment.

313
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,282
And I did it.

314
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,872
In the perfect moment
I was so concentrated,

315
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,813
there was no space for other thoughts.

316
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,350
When you want to make a turn

317
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,258
and you are at the top
of a steep vertical wall...

318
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:27,556
I mean, when you are in the situation
that if you fall, you die,

319
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,231
everything changes.

320
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,336
You think very much about turning.

321
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,468
You think very much about where to turn.

322
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,807
And you do all this in a very special way.

323
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,719
You act like a different person.

324
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,853
You act with all yourself.

325
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:01,063
You are making
a completely different experience

326
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,800
and in some way
you are discovering yourself.

327
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,031
This is the magic of the mountain.

328
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:15,407
You can accept to die for this.
You don't want to die.

329
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:21,784
But to live so close
to the possibility of dying,

330
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,380
you understand
what is really important and what not.

331
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,151
And this makes you a better person.

332
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:36,560
It's probably the highest moment

333
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:41,870
of my life because in the perfect moment

334
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:46,810
I was, or I felt to be, a little Superman.

335
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,670
Let's go into this clearing here.

336
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:24,177
In the mid-1980s, extreme skiing,

337
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,913
the way of life that emerged
in the mountains around Chamonix

338
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:32,856
found a follower in a young skier
from western Canada named Eric Pehota.

339
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,621
You know, back then I didn't have kids.
I didn't have a wife.

340
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,530
It was me, me, I, I, me, me, right?

341
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,194
You know, you just keep stepping it up.

342
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,639
You just wanted to keep pushing it
and see how big and steep you could go,

343
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,566
without killing yourself.

344
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,637
You can see the log and slosh
right there, right?

345
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,806
Yeah.

346
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:57,871
It's the ultimate paradox,

347
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,511
the closer you come to dying,
the more alive you feel.

348
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,918
And that's so true.

349
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,424
You know, if you just sit around
on a couch and watch TV.

350
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,426
How can you appreciate that cold beer,

351
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:11,463
or that nice, big, hearty steak
and this and that?

352
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,591
But you eat soup, and live in a cold,
icy environment for two, three weeks,

353
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,728
and, man, you get back,
and that's the best burger

354
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,773
you've ever had in your life
and the coldest, warmest... Doesn't matter,

355
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,398
that beer could be piss warm,

356
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,773
and it'll be the nicest beer
you've had in your life.

357
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,368
I tell you that right now.

358
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,146
Can't breathe, eh?
We should get back to the truck.

359
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,515
Okay.

360
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,254
It's my life, right. You know,
it's something I've done all my life.

361
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,588
And I pass it on to my kids.

362
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,629
Pehota, like Vallencant,
like Baud, like de Benedetti,

363
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:49,725
risked skiing
where no one had skied before.

364
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,702
During the 1980s,
Eric was the first to ski dozens of peaks

365
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,504
in the coast range of British Columbia,

366
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:02,707
including the first ski descent
of the highest peak in the range,

367
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,442
Mount Waddington.

368
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,849
I've lost a few friends,
really close friends, you know,

369
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:12,083
almost like blood brother-type friends,

370
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:16,685
in this kind of life
I guess I've chosen for myself.

371
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,032
But, you know,
I guess I've learned to accept that.

372
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:26,365
When you ski big mountains
in an uncontrolled environment

373
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,599
and on a full-time basis,
you"re going to see death

374
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,734
and you may succumb to it yourself, right?

375
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,012
Pehota's closest friend
and frequent ski partner

376
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:40,483
was a skateboarder and skier
named Trevor Petersen.

377
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:46,017
Petersen died in an avalanche
in Chamonix in 1996.

378
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,660
But in the 1980s, he and Eric were inspired

379
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:53,391
by the partnership of Patrick Vallencant
and Anselme Baud.

380
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,101
Trevor Petersen was a big influence
on my ski mountaineering.

381
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,333
He had a really magical psyche
for the mountains.

382
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:06,305
And he had this gift of just getting me
psyched and pumped as well.

383
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:12,445
Trevor knew quite a bit of background
on the French extreme skiing.

384
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,116
He had a book.
I think it was written by Anselme Baud

385
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:20,920
on first descents in the French Alps.

386
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:24,190
And Trev started filling me in
and showing me pictures and, you know,

387
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:27,699
I was just awestruck
at what these guys were doing on skis

388
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,757
and I said, "l want to do that."

389
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,576
In the "80s, Trevor and Eric

390
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:50,520
basically pioneered ski mountaineering
in western Canada.

391
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,787
They were the guys who put down
most of the first descents,

392
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,523
who taught an entire generation
of western Canadians

393
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,792
what could be done in their backyard.

394
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,597
They just got after it in ways more so
than anybody did in the States

395
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,004
and created a body of ski work
that is really unprecedented.

396
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,306
Me and Trevor always kind of had
the same goal.

397
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:18,338
We seemed to focus on the same thing
that was the big objective in the area,

398
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,544
the big peak and the big run.

399
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:25,784
Maybe not the raddest run in the range,
but just the big peak and the line off it.

400
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,391
We were both driven to do that.

401
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:34,125
I think that's kind of how
we became really close.

402
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,168
To share that moment with somebody
and you know, work towards

403
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,397
a goal and then achieve that goal.

404
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,463
And to actually share that
with your best friend is, you know,

405
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,907
a feeling that, you know,
I can't really describe.

406
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,513
It's just such a great feeling, really.

407
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:55,676
In the early 1980s,
few American skiers were even aware

408
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:59,690
of the kind of skiing taking place
in the mountains around Chamonix.

409
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:03,819
Most American skiers
had never heard of extreme skiing.

410
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,797
In 1988, that began to change.

411
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,868
Steep skiing in big mountains
found an unlikely American pitchman.

412
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,740
His name was Glen Plake.

413
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,381
I grew up in South Lake Tahoe,
which was considered kind of a rat hole

414
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,816
of a place to be a snow skier.

415
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:32,381
You know, I was definitely an oddball.
I was an outcast.

416
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:37,885
Like anybody else, you grow up raising Cain
and sometimes you get caught.

417
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:45,227
Few people would have guessed
that a former juvenile delinquent

418
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:49,741
with a criminal record would become
skiing's most recognizable icon.

419
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,976
Everything I have in my life is
from skiing, everything.

420
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:59,211
Every dollar I've ever earned is
from skiing, every dollar.

421
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,479
That's it. It's what I do.

422
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:06,348
Glen Plake's star began to rise
in 1988 when he appeared

423
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:09,360
in an unconventional,
irreverent ski movie called

424
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,362
The Blizzard of AAHHH's.

425
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,989
Okay, if you thought skiing was skiing
and there was a certain sameness to it all,

426
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:19,469
I suggest you buckle your breakfast seatbelt
because what we're about to show you

427
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,563
is something called extreme skiing.

428
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,803
It lacks only a disclaimer
that you not try this on your own.

429
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,868
We assume your sense of
self-preservation will tell you that.

430
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,574
Extreme skiing is virtually outlawed
in this country,

431
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,550
where insurance companies
and promoters fear the worst.

432
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,611
So these days extreme skiing
is centered in France

433
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:40,351
where the concept of recovery
for ski injuries is laughed at.

434
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,326
Out-of-bound skiers have
no sanctioned competitions,

435
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:47,092
but most arguments advance
veteran Scot Schmidt as America's best.

436
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,099
Lately, though, he is being challenged

437
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,761
by newcomer Glen Plake,
the man with the Mohawk.

438
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,032
He now lives in France
where he earns a living

439
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:58,042
by wearing a point-of-view camera
to make ski movies like this one.

440
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,704
It's called The Blizzard of AAHHH's.

441
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,181
Glen Plake, Scot Schmidt,
good morning, guys.

442
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,409
-Morning, Bryant.
-How are you?

443
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm not going to let this pass
without comment, did you dress for us?

444
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,955
-Yeah.
-Did you?

445
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,581
-Did it for my country.
-Let's talk about the lake.

446
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,922
Oh, okay. So, talk to me
a little bit about injuries, guys.

447
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,223
I mean, how many
and what kind have you had?

448
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,695
I've had three broken legs.

449
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:21,324
Broken when I was five,
broken when I was like 17,

450
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,527
and then just broke one again
two years ago.

451
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,160
Before you started doing all the weird stuff.

452
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,536
No, I've been doing
the weird stuff the whole time.

453
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:31,770
-Do you do everything to extreme?
-Yeah.

454
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:37,138
The Blizzard of AAHHH's was
the creation of filmmaker Greg Stump.

455
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,582
Stump was unhappy
with the state of American skiing.

456
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,378
They wouldn't let us film in America.

457
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:46,515
We had been kicked out of every ski resort
because we were jumping off stuff

458
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,957
and skiing out of bounds.

459
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,460
And we were like, ""Screw it.

460
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:53,498
""Let's go to France
where we don't have to get any insurance,

461
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,862
""where they've got better mountains. ""

462
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,231
So we just all booted it to Europe.

463
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,300
Glen Plake joined skiers
Mike Hattrup and Scot Schmidt

464
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:10,437
in what would become the most influential
American ski film ever made.

465
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:17,748
They came to Chamonix,
the birthplace of European extreme skiing.

466
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,917
But The Blizzard of AAHHH's
bore little resemblance

467
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:24,120
to the extreme ski films
being made in Europe.

468
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,791
The skiers in Blizzard
were in Chamonix to play.

469
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:32,897
We were just having a good time, you know.
We were out cruising around.

470
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,202
We were making a ski film and skiing hot.

471
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,208
We were just good skiers
out ripping around.

472
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,574
And I think it showed. You know?

473
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,706
It looked like these guys were having
a fun time. That's cool.

474
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:58,254
The skiers in Blizzard were having fun.
But they were also courting danger.

475
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:06,728
I had never seen a glacier before.
I had never seen

476
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,800
Iifts that took us
to those types of places before.

477
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,642
You know, I mean, I knew what
a crevasse was, but I had never seen one.

478
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:19,173
You know. I'm from South Lake Tahoe.
You know, I grew up skiing Heavenly.

479
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,820
Yikes, this is kind of wild.

480
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,837
It was our introduction
into the big mountains.

481
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,134
It was awe-inspiring
and intimidating at the same time.

482
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,145
And that was all captured on film.

483
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,507
One run in Blizzard
that resembled the kind of skiing

484
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:57,214
that the European extremists were doing
was Scot Schmidt"s run

485
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,985
from the top of the Aiguille du Midi.

486
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,583
This one here is called the Couloir Poubelle.

487
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:07,030
It's about 47, 50 degrees.
It's a 200-meter shot.

488
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:11,000
-Scott, you want to try to ski it?
-Yeah, I'll ski it for sure.

489
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,370
Two, one...

490
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,849
Steep.

491
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:41,229
Blizzard really made skiing seem
like a dangerous sport,

492
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,790
more like surfing than golf, for instance.

493
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,736
I mean, you know,
there's this mountain that can cream you.

494
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,273
There's doubt there.
There's risk there. There's...

495
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:57,111
If you do something wrong,
the consequences could be fatal.

496
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:03,219
It was just light years away from the typical
American ski experience in the "80s.

497
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,727
People went berserk
and it just caught on like wildfire.

498
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,429
You know, you ask people where they were

499
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:18,730
when they first saw Blizzard of AAHHH"s

500
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,168
and most people can tell you
where they were.

501
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,172
It's like JFK getting shot
or something, right?

502
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,437
I mean, obviously not
something that monumental.

503
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,205
But, for a skier, the people that are fans,

504
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:30,737
they'll tell you where they were,
what house they were in, what town,

505
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,612
what they were doing, how old they were.

506
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,117
They know right where they were.

507
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,643
I was at my high school living room

508
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:44,590
and that movie had a real big impact on me,
just like it did for everybody else my age.

509
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:48,927
From that moment on, I focused
on being a professional skier.

510
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,197
And, you know,
I basically went back and told my dad

511
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,170
that I'm gonna go be in ski movies.

512
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,072
And he's like, "You're out of your mind."
I'm like, "No, I'm gonna do it."

513
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,168
You're just on the edge of your seat,
watching this thing, the whole time.

514
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,110
And then they get to go to Chamonix.
And they get to ski these lines

515
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,513
that nobody has ever seen before.

516
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:09,213
At least none of my friends,
nobody in the States, I mean...

517
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:14,623
It was just so eye-opening
and mind-boggling what they were doing.

518
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,162
I've probably watched it over
a hundred times. I mean...

519
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,259
I think we burned through
at least two VHS tapes

520
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:28,864
when that came out
with my friends and I watching that.

521
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:38,476
Blizzard was the first ski movie to come out
after VCRs were widely adopted.

522
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,214
And so it was the first ski movie
that you could watch over and over again.

523
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,855
It brought Chamonix into your living room.

524
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:53,330
It brought Chamonix to you
in a much more personal, intimate way.

525
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,604
American skiers were looking
for their own Chamonix,

526
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,974
a place to create
their own style of extreme skiing.

527
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:19,018
In 1991, the port town of Valdez, Alaska
was famous for one thing,

528
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,617
the massive oil spill
that fouled Prince William Sound.

529
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,460
But one feature of Valdez was overlooked.

530
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,594
Valdez is the gateway
to the Chugach Mountains.

531
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,572
A vast, uninhabited wilderness
that receives as much

532
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,972
as 80 feet of snow a year.

533
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,070
The mountains are
literally blanketed in snow.

534
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:49,117
In 1991, the town got the idea
to promote the Chugach

535
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,054
as a helicopter skiing destination

536
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:57,686
by staging an annual event called WESC,
the World Extreme Skiing Championships.

537
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:07,967
One of my sponsors had read
about this extreme skiing competition

538
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,836
and said, ""We'd like to send you there. ""

539
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:13,366
And I said, "Sure, I'm in. That'd be great."

540
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,608
And they said if you don't win, though,
you're going to have to come back

541
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,512
and paint the building.

542
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:22,246
And I didn't realize they were just joking
on that, but I was thinking,

543
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
"l don't want to paint that building."

544
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,014
Yeah. Coombsy.

545
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:34,194
So at WESC in 1991 you have the best skiers
and the toughest hills in North America.

546
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,132
-What's this guy's name?
-Doug Coombs.

547
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:42,230
Doug Coombs comes in, he's got this gleam
in his eye, this grin on his face.

548
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:46,573
And he skis everything
so much better than everybody else.

549
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:50,341
Stronger, cleaner, crisper,
makes it look easy.

550
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,578
There was just absolutely
no question who won.

551
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:58,016
-What do you have to say, Doug?
-Yeah, Doug!

552
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,920
Thanks, Valdez.

553
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:04,587
Doug won WESC in 1991 and again in 1993.

554
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:10,095
But it wasn't the competition
that drew Coombs and his wife Emily

555
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,728
back to Alaska year after year.

556
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,366
Well, when he came back,
he just said, "Em, you got to come.

557
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,433
"You got to go to Alaska.
It's just unbelievable."

558
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:23,208
He was just, you know, on fire about Alaska.
So we all went.

559
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:29,912
We'd all sort of found
this ultimate part of skiing

560
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,855
that we'd all dreamed about,
but never really imagined.

561
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:36,553
I mean, I had never imagined any places
like Valdez ever existing.

562
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:43,224
Just the vastness
and the enormous variety of terrain.

563
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,565
That's what attracted me the most.

564
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:50,074
It looked like a lifetime to ski.
And I said, "Oh, I love that."

565
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:58,578
It truly is, I think,
the best skiing zone on the planet.

566
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,016
And I can't believe it was only 15 years ago.

567
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:03,918
Like, why didn't someone find that
in the '80s and bring a helicopter up there?

568
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,513
It was like this gold field
in Alaska that just lay there

569
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,890
for hundreds of years,
but was never discovered.

570
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,392
The snow in Alaska is unique.

571
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:24,975
In the Chugach,
wet snow falls and sticks to everything.

572
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:31,280
Then cold, dry air comes in from the north,
pulling the moisture out of the snow.

573
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:39,154
What's left is light, soft powder
that sticks to even the steepest faces.

574
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:46,230
The velvety texture of snow in Alaska is...
There's no other.

575
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,333
Alaska's all about the velvet, that feeling,

576
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:56,635
the way it feels brushing up against
your legs and your thighs and stuff.

577
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,700
You don't get that
anywhere else in the world.

578
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:08,415
In the Chugach, the light surface snow
can slough off and follow the skier down.

579
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,624
It's like being on a giant wave at the ocean

580
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:18,253
and the thing's just tickling your back,
same thing up there.

581
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,058
You know,
the wave's about to crash on you,

582
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,157
but if you keep skiing hard
and you keep skiing the right way,

583
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,829
it's going to be there,
but it's never going to get you.

584
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:31,035
And that to me is the ultimate. I just loved it.

585
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,011
Doug was really one of the people

586
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,515
who pioneered literally
hundreds of runs up there.

587
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,810
And to think that you could actually ski
down these things,

588
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:45,982
you know, before anybody had done it,
is pretty phenomenal

589
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,321
because they are really steep.

590
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:52,795
Doug found the place
that he was meant to be.

591
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:56,459
It was the place that he had been...
Maybe he didn't know it,

592
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,298
but had been looking for his whole life.

593
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,999
It was the right place,
the right time and the right guy.

594
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:16,917
The helicopter pilot who took Doug
and his friends into the mountains

595
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:20,185
was a Vietnam veteran
named Chet Simmons.

596
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:25,494
I'd strap on my pistol,
put my helicopter on like a jacket

597
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:30,296
and go out into the wild unknown.
And it was great.

598
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:33,098
Things like this haven't happened
since the cowboy days.

599
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,401
I mean, you know,
you get on your horse, put your gun on

600
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,464
and go out and fight some lndians.

601
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,271
Well, I'd go out and fight some mountains.

602
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:42,074
You know, when you start skiing in
that kind of terrain up there,

603
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,013
you've got to have some sort of,
something going on in your brain.

604
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:49,543
Maybe it's a little bit of chemical imbalance
and Chet had that.

605
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,417
All of us had that.

606
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:02,365
He had a great eye for ski lines.
He knew what we wanted.

607
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,367
He would be flying up and he"d say,

608
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,335
""I don't know why you guys haven't tried
that peak yet. ""

609
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:09,635
And we'd look at it
and just get shivers up our spine.

610
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,505
And then we'd look at him
and he'd already be flying at it.

611
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,101
And you knew you were going to ski it.

612
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:22,346
Chet was a Vietnam vet pilot
that had been shot down 13 times

613
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,153
and he would come into these LZs,
landing zones,

614
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,989
and he would kind of look at you and say,

615
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:33,656
"You know, I'm not nervous at all."
He says, "Nobody's shooting at me."

616
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:42,799
We were the first, like, the pioneers,
and in Alaska pioneers are a big thing.

617
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:47,572
Nobody had been to these peaks.
Nobody had skied them.

618
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:48,976
Nobody even thought about it yet.

619
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:53,415
That first run I took in Alaska
was life-changing.

620
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:59,949
I've never been more scared than the time
when the helicopter took me to the top

621
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:05,291
of the summit and I'm looking at this
unbelievable peak below me going,

622
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,163
"Wow, we're going to ski this?
Is this safe? Am I going to die?"

623
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,529
I just thought, "Well,
either I'm going to die on this run

624
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:15,697
"because it's going to avalanche,
or it's going to be the best run of my life.

625
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,742
""So I'm just going to do it. It's worth it. ""

626
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:22,976
And I skied down and it was just effortless

627
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:27,814
and just got to the bottom and it was like,
""I can't imagine that I just did that.

628
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,877
""You know,
I would love to just do that again. ""

629
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,354
So we did.

630
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:41,126
No one could tell me where I could ski,
what I could ski, when I could ski.

631
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:44,191
Any of those rules, thrown out the window.

632
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,631
That was a really big freedom

633
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,935
and I think that freedom led
into all those first descents.

634
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:54,068
You know? There was nobody
telling me that lifts close at 5:00.

635
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:01,877
We made it happen because we couldn't
get enough of that kind of skiing.

636
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:06,117
The combination of endless lines
that hadn't been skied before

637
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,057
and just the adventure in this great snow.

638
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:13,894
It's where the craziest times
of the early '90s went down in skiing.

639
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:23,405
In 1995, Doug and Emily launched
Valdez Heli-Ski Guides

640
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:28,069
and together began taking
paying clients to ski in the Chugach.

641
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:33,715
The goal was just to keep skiing
with our friends out in the mountains.

642
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:37,515
And that's the only reason that we did it.

643
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,580
I mean, that was our plan,
was to take other people's money

644
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:44,219
so we could go skiing
in the greatest place in the world.

645
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:51,330
We just started out really bare bones
and it was just for the pure excitement

646
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:54,701
of being able to go skiing
in these big mountains

647
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,900
and to share the terrain with each other.

648
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:02,036
She knew how I thought
and we wouldn"t even have to talk out there.

649
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,613
Somehow we had some kind of
telepathic communication.

650
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:10,454
I don't know what it was, but it just worked.

651
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,512
I just felt very comfortable
with Doug in the mountains,

652
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,218
that was where we were together.

653
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,925
That was what I fell in love with,
was Doug in the mountains.

654
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:29,534
Skiers from all over the world came to be
with Doug and Emily in the Chugach.

655
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:34,135
They took them to the tops of mountains
where no one had ever been before.

656
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,610
You've gotten out of the helicopter,
and you are just afraid

657
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:45,452
to even stand there
because it"s just so completely intimidating.

658
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:49,425
And there's Doug, you know,
so casual and so calm about it.

659
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:55,295
It's just completely crazy. Completely crazy.
It's beautiful, but crazy.

660
00:53:57,802 --> 00:54:00,771
We took heli-skiing to the extreme level.

661
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:05,199
It was amazing because we had the funds

662
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,643
from our clients to go further
and further back.

663
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:13,306
It was big-game hunting,
basically, up in Alaska.

664
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,616
Everybody has to ski Valdez once.

665
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,985
When you have a guy
from Kansas skiing 50 degrees

666
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,621
in perfect snow,
I mean, there's nothing like it.

667
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,989
He'll never forget that for the rest of his life.

668
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:42,911
Valdez became the North Shore of skiing.
Just like Maui is the North Shore of surfing.

669
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:47,816
You go there when you're
at the highest level of your game.

670
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,716
It's the total Mecca.

671
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:58,261
I can still visualize almost every
single first descent, every run I've done.

672
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:02,425
If you just transported me there
by a magic transporter on top of a peak,

673
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,628
I would tell you exactly where we were.
It would be no problem.

674
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:08,297
That's how vivid the memories are.

675
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:14,172
Doug Coombs put
Chugach heli-skiing on the map.

676
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:21,085
Like Chamonix a generation earlier,
skiers now make the pilgrimage to Alaska.

677
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,991
Showing up in Alaska for the first time,

678
00:55:32,063 --> 00:55:34,293
everybody says
it's a mind-blowing experience,

679
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,629
it's an eye opener, all that stuff.

680
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,693
And it truly is,
because it's not like riding lifts

681
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:44,469
and skiing, you know, 1,000 vertical.
It's a different program.

682
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,547
And it's real.
That's real big mountain skiing.

683
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,008
Shane McConkey became
a big mountain skier

684
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:57,782
performing for the cameras in Alaska.

685
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:02,386
Standing on top of those peaks in Alaska is,

686
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,760
to me, one of the coolest feelings
that I've ever had in my life.

687
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,824
It's all up to you at that point to,
like, take care of yourself.

688
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,267
And it's a pretty cool feeling,

689
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:14,804
knowing you're about to do
something dangerous,

690
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,806
and about to drop in.

691
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,468
It's... It's really addictive.

692
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:28,150
Guys like Shane McConkey started
doing things in the mountains in Alaska

693
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,709
that they couldn't do anywhere else.

694
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:33,052
You couldn't ski the backcountry
in Jackson Hole that way.

695
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:36,651
You couldn't ski Aspen that way
or Squaw Valley, even, that way.

696
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,130
It's too short. You don't have enough room
to go big and to go that fast.

697
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:45,430
But in Alaska, all of a sudden your canvas
is five times bigger, and steeper,

698
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:48,666
and the snow is better
than it is anywhere else.

699
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:56,973
Alaska expanded the idea
of what is possible on skis.

700
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,881
And a new generation of skiers,
many inspired by The Blizzard of AAHHH's,

701
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:05,751
are coming here to make
their mark in ski films.

702
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:12,087
Ski films nowadays
are all about high speed,

703
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:15,792
huge air, showmanship,
style, explosiveness.

704
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:17,766
You know, just taking it to the mountain.

705
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:25,204
Chris Davenport won the World Extreme
Skiing Championships in 1996

706
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:28,734
and has been performing
in ski films ever since.

707
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:33,348
The ski filmmaker wants
to shred the mountain apart

708
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,386
and show off their skiing for the camera.

709
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,488
And when I'm in a ski film,

710
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,151
I'm trying to make as few turns as possible,

711
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:45,422
because I want to make it look
just death-defying.

712
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:46,986
I want to make it look exciting

713
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,726
and I want to make it look like somebody
just lit a firecracker in my pants

714
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,463
and I'm trying to get down
the mountain as fast as I can.

715
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,369
When you get up on top of a ridge,

716
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:02,037
and you've got a perfectly
smooth curtain of snow,

717
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:05,013
almost like a shower curtain
hanging down with maybe a spine

718
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:08,916
or a flute of snow,
it's like you're a kid in a playground.

719
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,482
Hopping from one side
of the curtain back to the other,

720
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:15,992
or on a pillow or catching a small air.

721
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,891
You know, your slough's going to the right.
I'm going left.

722
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:21,056
I'm going to cross underneath
my slough and let it go off a cliff.

723
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,122
And you're just kind of thinking to yourself,

724
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,398
""How can I choreograph this run
so it"s just playful and fun?""

725
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,602
When somebody makes it look fun on film,
you say, that's cool.

726
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,205
That's what I want to do.
And it inspires your skiing.

727
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,022
Ingrid Backstrom was discovered
in Squaw Valley, California,

728
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,227
by filmmaker Scott Gaffney.

729
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:04,606
Ingrid is special in that she's a guy
with a ponytail in the manner she skis.

730
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,441
I saw this woman ripping Squaw

731
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:13,710
and you'd be sitting on a chair
and a guy would be like,

732
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:15,547
""Wow, that guy rips. ""

733
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,923
And then I just kind of sit there like,
"l know that chick. Yep, she rips."

734
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:31,761
Ingrid's very first run
in a ski film was in 2004.

735
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:36,399
She traveled with Matchstick Productions
to Bella Coola, British Columbia,

736
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:39,806
with skiers Shane McConkey
and Hugo Harrison.

737
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:45,238
The first line of the day was... Hugo said,

738
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:46,783
""Oh, I skied this line last year,

739
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,650
"l wanna go back to the Harrison Motel
and ski it again."

740
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:59,855
The first thing that happens is
Hugo drops into this line that he's skied,

741
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,659
you know, probably five times.

742
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:05,566
And all I can see is Hugo
just cartwheeling out the bottom.

743
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:15,538
So I'm up there all by myself kind of like,
""Hugo, who never falls,

744
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,776
"just took the hardest crash
I've ever seen anybody take."

745
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,409
And, you know,
it kind of got me a little nervous.

746
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:27,216
I could see the helicopter
firing up down in the valley

747
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,749
and just really supercharged energy.

748
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:35,962
The helicopter gets closer and they give
their little wave or their foot kick

749
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:37,523
that says, ""We're ready. ""

750
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:41,594
And at that point I don't even know,
I think my brain probably shut off

751
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:44,402
and I just dropped in and went for it.

752
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,010
This is what you dream about skiing.

753
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:03,191
I just remember skiing out the bottom
and it was so fast that it was just a blur.

754
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,960
But it was
one of the most incredible feelings ever.

755
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:12,327
She comes charging off the ridge,
whack over the rocks,

756
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:16,806
and like four turns down to the bottom
at like 50 miles an hour.

757
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:21,141
I caught maybe the first turn from the heli.

758
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:25,511
And then we were sitting up there
just dumbfounded because she was gone.

759
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,716
We were just like, "All right,
that's gonna be

760
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:32,779
"the next big mountain skier chick
right there for sure."

761
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:35,756
She's good.

762
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,230
For me,
like the beginning part of my season,

763
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,891
I'm just like everybody else.

764
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,697
I'm at the mountain hiking for my turns.

765
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:25,005
But then, you know, the film season
starts coming in around January, February,

766
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,838
and it's off to heli-land.

767
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,557
Seth Morrison has made the big mountains

768
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:49,031
his place to explore
what a skier can do in the air.

769
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,834
Seth Morrison is a cat.

770
01:02:55,906 --> 01:03:01,310
He can control his body in the air
and on the snow as good as anybody ever.

771
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:13,479
He is a light wiry guy
who's incredibly coordinated,

772
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:17,755
incredibly athletic, could probably excel
at any number of sports,

773
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,921
but he's a skier.

774
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:31,032
He has redefined what's possible on skis,
redefined the style of how to do it on skis.

775
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,704
He is a legend.

776
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:42,242
No one can stick a landing exactly
where he wants to quite like Seth can.

777
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,564
You take these risks
because it's the ultimate, man.

778
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,295
It's all about the powder

779
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:02,736
and just the experience
of being out in the mountains.

780
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,668
Flying in the helicopter
is the other half of it.

781
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:08,973
Getting dropped off on some crazy peak

782
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:13,107
where the heli
just has to like come in sideways

783
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,152
and just stop and hover and let you out.

784
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,749
That's like the best landing ever

785
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,450
when it's just room enough
for you up there.

786
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,730
Deep powder.

787
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,394
That's all that matters.

788
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:38,104
When you get one of those runs
that everything goes right,

789
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:41,702
where you ski the steep fresh pow
and nail your air

790
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,643
and everything is perfect,

791
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:49,380
you know, like nothing's better, you know,
flying through the air off a cliff just...

792
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,136
We're always looking for that next thing.

793
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,369
We're always looking for something new.

794
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,435
And at this day and age,
it's hard to find those things.

795
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,674
But they're still out there.

796
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:27,681
Right on. You guys ready?

797
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:31,194
-I am, yeah.
-Very nice and early.

798
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,161
Dude, what trick are you gonna do?

799
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:36,165
I'm not sure. Still thinking about that one.

800
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,999
You'll figure it out
when we get out there, right?

801
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,436
It's a beautiful day.

802
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,101
Good wind.

803
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,804
I don't think I'm an adrenaline junkie,

804
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:52,371
but I sure do love those kind of things
that give you adrenaline.

805
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,882
What are you gonna do?

806
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,579
Possibly a flying squirrel of some type.

807
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,520
For me, it's all about trying new things,

808
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,217
something I haven't tried before
but I think that's possible.

809
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,591
""Hey, what if we do it?"" ""Hey, totally, dude,
we should try it this way. ""

810
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,960
-All right.
-Yeah, dude, have a good jump.

811
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,328
-Yeah.
-Enjoy.

812
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,264
Awesome.

813
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,169
Triple gainer, yeah?

814
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:20,267
It's all about getting creative and original
with different ideas and to do fun stuff.

815
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:26,308
Everyone else is going, "You're crazy.
You've got no fear," stuff like that.

816
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:29,284
But I don't see it that way.

817
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:31,651
-Yeah, Shane, nice one.
-Ready, set...

818
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:33,451
Watch out for that porcupine
in the landing area.

819
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:34,751
See you.

820
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,899
With the addition of a parachute
to my ski gear,

821
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:05,278
I'm looking at these mountains with totally
different goggles than all the other skiers.

822
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:11,152
There's a lot of lines that are really
aesthetic, really cool-looking lines,

823
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:14,622
that you can't do
because it ends in a big, giant cliff.

824
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:17,922
Well, if you throw a parachute on your back
and you have some BASE-jumping skills,

825
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,586
you can totally ski those lines.

826
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,510
For most of us it's a stunt.

827
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,641
It's completely crazy and kooky,
but for Shane it isn't.

828
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,242
I mean, if you have that ability
to BASE-jump,

829
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,553
and you have the ability to ski some
of the steepest, most radical things around,

830
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,025
putting the two of those together
makes complete sense.

831
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:54,829
It makes total sense. Why not?

832
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:57,332
I got to ski a line a couple years ago
in Bella Coola

833
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,767
that was a big, open powder field,
really nice snow

834
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,361
that came, that rolled over

835
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:07,069
and then came down into this choke
with ice on one side and rock on the other

836
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:10,807
and then it opened up again
to this big, slanting ramp

837
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,712
that ended in a massive cliff.

838
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:27,324
Above that ramp was
like a flat spot with a kicker.

839
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:30,332
You know, I got to ski that powder field
down through the crux

840
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,631
and then boom, off the kicker. 500-foot cliff.

841
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:38,304
And that was amazing.
You can't do that without a parachute.

842
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,987
Complacency is what gets everybody.

843
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:08,231
Accidents, deaths, problems,
you know, whatever, you know.

844
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:11,129
And I find myself getting
complacent in places.

845
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,268
Like when I was in Alaska
for year after year after year,

846
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:17,780
I was setting off class three avalanches,
six-foot fractures,

847
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:21,442
four-foot fractures,
going 1,000 meters, 3,000 feet.

848
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:24,544
Oh, darn it! Too bad I ruined the mountain.

849
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:26,953
You know, let's go on to the next slope,
but, you know,

850
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:30,322
you're looking down there at 50, 60 feet
of snow that you could be buried under.

851
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,452
And it's like I almost got numb to it.

852
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:37,926
Something in the back of my mind just said,

853
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:40,970
""Why don't you just step back
and take a look at all this?""

854
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,335
And so I left Alaska.

855
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,817
La Meije is the peak that looms over
the small French village of La Grave.

856
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,250
La Grave is like Chamonix 50 years ago,

857
01:11:01,157 --> 01:11:04,718
a wild, alpine world
with a lift to take you there.

858
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:11,161
It's where Doug Coombs and his family
now spend part of each year.

859
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:17,204
Well, we fell in love with France
and La Grave partly for the chocolate

860
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:20,300
and the red wine,
but mostly for the mountains.

861
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,505
The power of the mountain
and the mystique of La Meije.

862
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,107
And we were just drawn to it.

863
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:31,643
It's very raw and wild and it has moods,
ups and downs. But we thrived on that.

864
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:35,816
Everyone said it was
the last frontier of wild skiing.

865
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:38,622
You know, it's ski sauvage, as they say.

866
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,724
I instantly felt like I belong there.

867
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,694
That was fun.

868
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:59,473
Okay, let's go to town,
we'll go to the bakery.

869
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:02,575
We'll go buy some bread.
Wanna go to the store?

870
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,786
You can instantly get off the lift here

871
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,229
and get in the most amazing,
dangerous situations of your life.

872
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:20,895
You can go from sipping a nice cafe au lait
to almost killing yourself in five minutes.

873
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:25,374
I mean, to be able to have that freedom
of just wandering off the mountain

874
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:28,639
and getting into this wild spot right away.

875
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:33,740
You know, right from the restaurant,
it's like no other, no other, and I love it.

876
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:38,049
One, two, three, four, five.

877
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,022
Ten.

878
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:45,687
-Eleven.
-Twelve.

879
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,227
Fourteen.

880
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:49,458
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen.

881
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,022
Seventeen.

882
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:55,504
I haven't been slowing down very much.
A little here, and a little there, but...

883
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:58,807
I don't know how Emily puts up with me.

884
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:03,812
I think my wife is super tolerant.
She must think I'm just a complete kook.

885
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,815
She always calls me that. But I don't know,

886
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,512
I think she's the most tolerant person
in the whole world.

887
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:20,959
And to make me stop doing something
that I love, she knows it is not possible.

888
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:45,385
On April 3, 2006,

889
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:49,824
Doug Coombs died in a skiing accident
in the mountains above La Grave.

890
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:56,094
He fell to his death trying to reach a friend

891
01:13:56,166 --> 01:14:01,001
who had slipped and fallen off a cliff
while skiing the Polichinelle couloir.

892
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,270
We never questioned our life.

893
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:14,077
The other people might have, but we knew
that the risk that we encountered

894
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,277
was worth every bit of it.

895
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:21,720
He knew and I knew,
you're never above the mountains.

896
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,453
Mountains have always had the last say.

897
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:29,455
Mostly they give,

898
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,966
mostly the mountains just give you
incredible amounts of pleasure.

899
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:35,061
And sometimes they swallow you up.

900
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,901
I just can't imagine a better way
for Doug to have gone,

901
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:43,546
even if it was too soon.

902
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,089
You know what they say
in the mountains around here,

903
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:58,287
all the birds, all the blackbirds,
that's a dead person.

904
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,988
And there's a lot of birds
in the mountains here.

905
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:04,158
And they're all blackbirds.

906
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:08,269
That's their spirits flying around.
That's the rumor.

907
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,569
And there are a lot of deaths here,
because the mountains are so intense.

908
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,043
They're so gnarly, they"re so big,

909
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:20,048
and they can be so friendly one day
and so mean the next.

910
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:27,846
I remember being really shocked
when a friend died skiing.

911
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:31,690
And then the next friend died skiing.
And then the next friend died skiing.

912
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:36,130
And you're like, I don't know what it is,
it's weird, you just become numb to it.

913
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:43,036
It's still terrible, and you don't like it,
but it doesn't make you stop.

914
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:50,341
I hate seeing people that I know die,
but I know it's gonna happen.

915
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,579
I think that's just part of it.

916
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:58,380
It's like saying you know someone
who's died in a car accident.

917
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,948
You know, what's worse, a car accident,
or falling off the mountain?

918
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:06,484
I don't know,
I think the car accident's worse.

919
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:10,761
At least when they're falling off the
mountain, they loved what they were doing.

920
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:35,455
I was just getting ready to tell him,
if he runs into any of my family out there,

921
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,784
to steer clear of us.

922
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,384
Let's jump right in to that real quick

923
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:43,865
and take a phone call from Andrew McLean
calling from Iceland.

924
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:47,460
-Good morning, Andrew.
-Top of the morning to you, trail master.

925
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,599
Top of the morning to you, sir.
How's the weather in Iceland?

926
01:16:50,673 --> 01:16:54,131
Well, the weather in lceland is a lot
like our last trip to Patagonia.

927
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,576
I woke up and I wasn't really sure
where we were.

928
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:00,309
It's dumping snow, a total white-out,
and we're camped on a glacier.

929
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,317
It's kind of like deja vu.

930
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,345
I'm kind of wondering
what we're doing here.

931
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:08,515
Okay, Andrew,
for people that aren't familiar,

932
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:10,650
you were up here doing a little skiing

933
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:13,855
and decided Iceland had not been skied
a whole lot

934
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:16,091
so it was a great place to take off to.

935
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:20,602
Yup, so the skiing terrain up here
is phenomenal.

936
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,729
What we're doing is called
ski mountaineering.

937
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,467
And that's where you hike up
and then ski down.

938
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:28,908
And we're specifically looking
for steeper slopes

939
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:32,880
Iike couloirs and slopes
that are above 40 degrees.

940
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,076
And there's no shortage of them up here.

941
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,552
We can't see them at the moment,
but we know they're out there.

942
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:45,923
But just kind of reading some big,
thick, fat books and waiting it out.

943
01:17:57,974 --> 01:18:00,670
Andrew McLean is a throwback.

944
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:04,077
He calls himself a ""ski mountaineer. ""

945
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:09,274
Like Bill Briggs, like the first extreme skiers
around Chamonix,

946
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:14,085
his passion is simply to climb
steep mountains and ski down them.

947
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:20,193
No helicopters,
no starring roles in ski movies.

948
01:18:21,097 --> 01:18:26,694
Just Andrew and friends exploring
the remote corners of the world on skis.

949
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:33,065
I've never really taken skiing that seriously.

950
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,440
I've always just looked at it
as kind of like a hobby and, you know,

951
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:41,006
I'm going to get a real job and a real career,
and, you know, get with the program.

952
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:43,978
But what always happens is, you know,

953
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,715
I'll have the opportunity
to kind of get with the program

954
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:49,849
and then there will be like a ski trip.

955
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,992
And it will be like, well, you know,
I'll do the ski trip first

956
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,156
and then, you know,
I'll get with the program.

957
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:02,227
You know, 20 years later, you know,
it's like skiing always takes precedence

958
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:04,364
over getting with the program.

959
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:11,510
At some point you just have to realize like,
well, okay, you know, maybe this is,

960
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:16,280
you know, more of a full-time thing,
and I should just accept it as it is.

961
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:17,842
It's my destiny.

962
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:35,161
Ski mountaineering, I look at it
as kind of between-the-cracks exploration.

963
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:39,508
All these mountains,
people haven't been into them.

964
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:43,011
They've never been skied.
They've never been explored.

965
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,910
You can be a modern-day explorer.

966
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:49,145
And it may not be as significant as going
to the moon or the bottom of the ocean,

967
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:53,245
but from just a common standpoint
it's a great method

968
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:55,222
to get out and explore the world.

969
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:05,767
Andrew McLean has explored
remote mountains on seven continents.

970
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:12,065
This is the peninsula of the Giants
on the north coast of Iceland.

971
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:16,842
This is where Andrew and two friends,
Matt Turley and Dylan Freed,

972
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:19,711
have come to climb and ski.

973
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:33,354
I like doing steep skiing
and I like doing remote skiing,

974
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:36,694
and I like doing
complicated, technical skiing

975
01:20:36,766 --> 01:20:40,224
which could also be considered
dangerous skiing to some people.

976
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,901
It doesn't seem that dangerous when
you have been doing it for a long time.

977
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:46,237
It seems almost commonplace.

978
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,300
But taking a dangerous situation

979
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,871
and kind of figuring out how to do it safely,
that's the ideal.

980
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:59,880
Andrew McLean,
he's the real extreme skier in the bunch.

981
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,024
He's going on these trips
that are a million miles away from anything.

982
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:12,261
You're skiing 55-degree slopes.

983
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:15,702
You slip up, there's nothing there
to save you. You're done.

984
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:26,276
There's not very many people out there
pushing that envelope and for good reason,

985
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:30,752
because many of the people
that have pushed that envelope,

986
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,720
they're not with us anymore.

987
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:39,791
Andrew McLean continues that tradition
of skiing the ultimate extreme.

988
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:04,780
Having friends die and seeing friends die
and being involved in accidents

989
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:08,051
definitely does give me pause.

990
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:12,290
When I was involved in my first
avalanche fatality, I just was like,

991
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,829
""That's it, I'm not skiing anymore. ""

992
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,465
But I think I'm a slow learner.
You know, I just rationalize it.

993
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:21,526
I have what's called creative rationalization.

994
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:23,936
I always think,
well, you know, this was an accident.

995
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:26,975
It happened because
of these foreseeable circumstances

996
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:31,275
and those won't happen again.
But it's always something else that happens.

997
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:38,351
This was Andrew's 15th day
in the mountains of Iceland.

998
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:44,993
Holy crap.

999
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,140
-Dylan, you okay?
-Andrew!

1000
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,943
-Andrew, Dylan.
-You okay?

1001
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:14,288
-Dylan, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1002
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:15,585
Holy...

1003
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:19,124
Holy shit!

1004
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,096
Oh, my God.

1005
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:28,926
Oh, my gosh.

1006
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:36,809
Wow.

1007
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,516
I'm very glad to be alive.

1008
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,456
Glad you're all right, Dyl.

1009
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,086
There, Dylan.

1010
01:23:56,265 --> 01:24:00,702
-That was cool. Full value, huh?
-Oh, man.

1011
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:10,077
If I really want to avoid being caught
or dying in an avalanche,

1012
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:13,843
it's not the idea ofjust scaling back
on my skiing activities.

1013
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,282
It's more completely stopping.

1014
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:24,122
I know it's dangerous, but if I give it up,
what's the future going to be like?

1015
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:27,253
Is it just going to be sitting at a desk job?

1016
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:30,560
You know, you need to figure that
what's going to take the place of that.

1017
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:32,396
Where are you going
to get the same adventure

1018
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:34,595
or same excitement out of your life?

1019
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:41,934
It's just something about mountains

1020
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:46,243
that really appeals to me
on a very basic DNA level.

1021
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,846
I'm just a mountain person.

1022
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:04,089
Those of us that want the risk
and want the challenge

1023
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,930
are going to do it one way or another,

1024
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,167
whether it's in the mountains
or it's on a racetrack

1025
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,175
or floating down the river.

1026
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:20,075
This should be a common thing
for man to be doing.

1027
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:24,350
I think we get a little bit too safe
in our lives these days.

1028
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:34,022
I had a romantic vision of the mountains.

1029
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:40,531
The mountains represented something
different from a mass of rock.

1030
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:47,801
To me the mountains were the possibility
to discover life and discover myself.

1031
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,939
It's a different world.

1032
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:55,575
It's extreme. You risk your life.

1033
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:01,049
But if we decide to live this way,

1034
01:26:01,123 --> 01:26:04,615
it can give you
a lot of pleasure and emotion.

1035
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:07,389
And that's what you need in your life.

1036
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,768
I'd be lying if I said I was never scared but,

1037
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,532
you know, I think the risks are well worth it.

1038
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:24,946
Gliding down a slope with such peaceful
and graceful ease, no resistance.

1039
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:28,276
Something I've done all my life

1040
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,649
and I want to continue to do
to the day I die.
