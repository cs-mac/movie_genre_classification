1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Tonight's Imagine presents an intimate portrait

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,320
of the great British war photographer and photojournalist

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,200
Don McCullin.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,400
In his early 20s, and with no formal training,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,640
McCullin began his career here in Finsbury Park,

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,240
photographing the violent teenage gangs ruling the roost in the 1950s.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,040
He would go on to capture history as it was being made,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,880
bearing witness to the bloodiest conflicts of the last 50 years.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,720
Despite announcing his retirement from the warzone ten years ago,

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,840
after returning from Iraq,

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,000
McCullin decided to make a trip to Syria late last year.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,360
He wanted to show the human side of the ongoing conflict in Aleppo,

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,080
where, not for the first time in his career, he came under sniper fire.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,240
A self-confessed war junkie,

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,800
Don McCullin's quest to bring the ugly truths of the war

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,960
to international attention would come at great personal cost.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,160
Jacqui and David Morris's often graphic film

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,640
lays bare the addiction to danger, and the commitment to justice,

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,600
that lie at the heart of this extraordinary life.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,800
This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find disturbing.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,560
War is partly madness, mostly insanity,

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,000
and the rest of it is schizophrenia.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,160
You do ask yourself, "Why am I here? What's my purpose?

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,920
"What's this got to do with photography?"

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,320
And it goes on and on, the questioning.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,920
You're trying to stay alive, you're trying to take pictures,

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,520
you're trying to justify your presence there.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,760
And you think, "What good is this going to do anyway?

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,360
"These people have already been killed."

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,160
There were many battles within my own mind,

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,960
before I got to these major conflicts.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,080
And when I got there, I was even more confused.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,520
I try to stay calm.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,760
I try not to indulge myself in this picture-taking.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,120
It was something I was meant to do, but how far was I allowed to take it?

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
There was a lot of hypocrisy spinning around

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
inside my own mind at the time.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,040
I didn't really think, um, it was right to be there,

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,920
because I sometimes felt that

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,880
the people who were doing these terrible things

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,880
thought, you know, that I was OK-ing it,

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,560
which I certainly wasn't.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,560
The first execution I ever saw in my life

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,040
was a dawn execution of a bomber who had killed a load of people

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,160
in the Saigon market a few weeks before.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,000
And there were all these photographers and journalists,

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
they were all on this Jeep, you couldn't get another man on,

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,360
and there was nowhere I could see. But I saw the event.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
They brought the man, in a Volkswagen truck.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
He got out and screamed anti-Americans.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,960
The firing squad shot him.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,280
A man stepped forward, grabbed a turf of his hair,

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
and shot him through the brains.

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
And I stood there with my mouth wide open.

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
And I heard a man saying,

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,880
"God, that was great stuff, did you get it, did you get it?"

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,360
And I have never forgotten, to this day, and that was in 1965,

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,120
and I didn't get it.

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,400
And I never said anything about this situation

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,640
to the people in the Sunday Times, because they would have thought

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,240
I must have been a rank amateur not to have got such a picture.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
But, looking back,

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,400
did I have the right to take that man's picture of his murder?

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,760
Because, in a way, public executions are nothing less than murder.

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
And I didn't get the picture.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,520
MUSIC AND APPLAUSE

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,960
You came from a fairly rough background, didn't you, in London?

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,720
It seems an unlikely ambition to have, your first ambition,

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,800
to be a painter. Was that regarded as a bit sissy?

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
Well, yes, it was, because where I live,

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
you were expected to take on anybody.

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,160
You'd never back down from an argument.

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,600
I used to get some terrible hidings when I was a boy.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,320
But my father, when he was alive,

75
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,400
he used to let me draw on the kitchen wall.

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,160
And I'd actually stick pieces of paper on the wall,

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,200
but I went over the edge, so there was always

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
empty pictures with marvellous edges.

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,040
RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,320
I lived in a house that was a tenement house,

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,640
so we could knock huge nails in the walls and stick things on the walls.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,800
I wouldn't let my kids do it now but...

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,400
My art career didn't last very long,

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
because I got a junior art scholarship,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,160
and my father died and I had to go to work.

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,280
MUSIC: "Move It" by Cliff Richard

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
# Come on, pretty baby, let's move it and a-groove it

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,520
# Well, shake, oh, baby, shake, oh, honey, please don't lose it

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
# It's rhythm that gets into your heart and soul

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
# Well, let me tell you, baby, it's called rock'n'roll. #

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,080
I took a set of pictures of the boys I grew up with.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
They were involved in the killing of a policeman.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
They didn't actually kill the policeman,

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,800
the rival gang that came from Islington,

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,920
they were responsible for that killing.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,600
So, I took the photos to the Observer.

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
They asked me to do more. I did more.

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,120
They published the photos.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,640
They gave me the princely sum of Â£50.

100
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,040
In those days, Â£50 from where I came from was like five weeks' wages.

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,520
And then, I was, I suppose you could say, I was on the road to photography

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,800
which has been a lifelong love affair.

103
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,360
It has been really an amazing experience for me.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Because you've got to remember, I don't have any education,

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
I couldn't read properly.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,320
I came from a violent background where people were mostly interested

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,720
in how well you could fight or steal, or do harm to society.

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,400
So, quite honestly, having this amazing door opening, someone saying,

109
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,320
"There's your freedom from ignorance and bigotry and violence."

110
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,320
It was amazing I managed to escape from Finsbury Park.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,040
I've often wondered, how did he get that first memorable,

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,560
urban landscape of the lads, the gang,

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,080
The Guv'nors, as they were called in East London,

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
standing in a derelict house?

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,560
Perfectly framed by the building,

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,040
and seeing right through the building.

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,880
It was so emblematic of gang warfare and the roughness of London.

118
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,360
And here we have a picture which is almost beautiful in its composition.

119
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,000
You could say, there is no beauty in what this gang was up to.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
But he related, he had a sensitivity.

121
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,600
An empathy is something you can't fake.

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,400
This is the bloke I gave a good hiding to.

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,880
HE LAUGHS

124
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,480
He tried to hit me with a brick.

125
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
We had all been to a funeral.

126
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,040
One of the little girls had committed suicide,

127
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,480
put her head in a gas oven over some bloke I grew up with.

128
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,560
We came back from the funeral, and he ran past my car

129
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,920
and snapped the wing mirror off.

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,440
And he was peeing in this alleyway,

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,680
that's when I should really have laid into him, while he was peeing,

132
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,360
because it's difficult to fight back if you're in a situation like that.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Then he picked a brick up, came roaring at me.

134
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Then I managed to get hold of it and reverse the charges.

135
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,000
Wasn't I lucky to have grown up in a period of the '60s, '70s, the '80s,

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
when it was all happening?

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,240
It was as if, like it was carved out for me, really.

138
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
I did grasp the nettle,

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,400
I didn't just look at it and think, "God, I wish I was there."

140
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,880
I used to say, "I'm going to go there." And I did.

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,520
- NEWSREEL:
- Paris in the spring of 1961,

142
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,360
and the time of President Kennedy's visit, was as beautiful as ever.

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,880
I was in Paris with my wife, my new wife really,

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
we'd only been married a few weeks.

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
And I was like a fish out of water really,

146
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,440
because I couldn't speak the language.

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,280
And whilst we were in Paris, I saw somebody reading a newspaper.

148
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,320
It was a photograph of an East German soldier

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,400
jumping over some barbed wire, which was only, at that stage,

150
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,040
separating them from the West.

151
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,480
Of course, the story had been building up,

152
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,280
potentially been building up.

153
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,440
I looked at this photograph, it was a memorable picture.

154
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
And I said to her, "When we get back to England,"

155
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,160
knowing I only had Â£70 in my savings account,

156
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
"would you mind if I went to Berlin?"

157
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,680
And she said, "Of course I don't mind."

158
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,080
- NEWSREEL:
- The East Germans don't seem to have girders enough

159
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,560
to plug every hole.

160
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,760
When a soldier's attention is diverted by others,

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
a hole is cut in the barbed wire,

162
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,160
and Khrushchev's face is slapped again.

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,440
I rang the Observer newspaper, and they said,

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,840
"We're not interested in you going."

165
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,920
And I said, "Well, I bought the ticket." There was no commission.

166
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,840
So, I got near to a place called Friedrichstrasse,

167
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,800
which was the centre of all the problem.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,480
The Americans were facing the Russians.

169
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
There were tanks facing each other.

170
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,680
At that stage, in Friedrichstrasse,

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,440
they were actually building the beginnings of the Berlin Wall.

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,760
This was really the right place to be.

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
- NEWSREEL:
- Camera crews are harassed by reflecting mirrors

174
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,200
held by East German police.

175
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,680
Water hoses are played on equipment.

176
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,880
Nevertheless, our reporters are able to come up with remarkable pictures,

177
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,120
despite these hazards.

178
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,640
My camera equipment wasn't very good, actually.

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
I had a camera I had bought during my time in the air force.

180
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,600
It was totally the wrong shape

181
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,440
to give me the kind of pictures that I needed.

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,440
But, nevertheless, I stretched the use of this camera, kneeling down

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
and holding it up high and doing all kinds of funny things with it.

184
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,640
By the time that I'd been there a few days,

185
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,520
that wall went up pretty fast. And people could not escape.

186
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,800
And I looked at East German soldiers

187
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,160
leaning out of buildings on the other side of the wall, with binoculars.

188
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,880
And looking right at me. And I thought,

189
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,240
"They can't hurt me, because they're over there and I'm here."

190
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
It was very exciting, it was at the heightened part of the Cold War

191
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,280
where the Russians were quite prepared

192
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,720
to make a stand against the West, and vice versa.

193
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,960
What it really comes down to is that I was sitting on top of

194
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,560
the most important news story in the world.

195
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,040
And it was my decision,

196
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,040
this intuition that took me there in the first place.

197
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,440
So, I was beginning to show signs of having a brain

198
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,040
that was functioning in the right direction.

199
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
I came back to England with the film

200
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,520
and got it processed in the Observer's darkroom.

201
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,120
And they saw the pictures and they ran half a page of my story.

202
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,440
The story was then entered into the news category

203
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,080
for the News Pictures of the Year. And I won this award.

204
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
And the Observer gave me a contract after that.

205
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,560
So, I started getting better jobs at the Observer.

206
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,480
I started going to all kinds of political rallies and things.

207
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
I would go to the East End of London

208
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,040
and photograph disturbances with Oswald Mosley, situations like that.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
It was a developing and an expanding situation

210
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
for the early part of my career.

211
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,560
- NEWSREEL:
- The tinderbox that is Cyprus threatens to erupt

212
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,960
into a full-scale war.

213
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,160
Greek students demonstrate against British and US proposals

214
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,320
that a force of NATO troops help maintain a truce on the island

215
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,440
until differences between Greeks and Turks can be resolved.

216
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,680
I walked into the Observer office one day, and the editor said to me,

217
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,520
"How would you consider covering the civil war for us in Cyprus?"

218
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,840
And at that point in my life, I wasn't ready.

219
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,400
And I felt that, when I think about those words, I think,

220
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,680
I must have been levitating. I felt as if I was rising off the ground.

221
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,400
I knew that the second door was opening.

222
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,240
- NEWSREEL:
- The terror of civil war struck Cyprus in December.

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
On Boxing Day, the British came in to stop the bloodshed.

224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,640
So, I thought, I'm going to do my best here.

225
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,480
And I'm going to make an impression. This is my big chance.

226
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,680
So, I went to the Turkish community.

227
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,480
And they were surrounded by the Greeks.

228
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,600
I managed to slip past the roadblocks and get in.

229
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
I could hear gunfire.

230
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,720
That was the first time I had heard, in my life, hostile gunfire.

231
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,280
And then, suddenly, out of the cinema burst a man with a machine gun,

232
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,120
and he had a raincoat on and a flat hat.

233
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,600
And he looked like something like a Sicilian Mafioso bandit.

234
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,000
And then people ran out with mattresses on their heads,

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,560
women and children, as if a mattress would stop a bullet.

236
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,040
And this was my baptism of war.

237
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
I had to assess very quickly what was going on,

238
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,720
where the fire was coming from.

239
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,520
As the day wore on, we were trapped in these empty streets.

240
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,880
There were groups of fighters, Turkish defenders.

241
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,560
And funny, curious things caught my eye.

242
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
I could remember a group of men behind barricades.

243
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
It was almost like the Spanish Civil War, really.

244
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,040
And by the barricade, there were men with an ill-assorted bunch of weapons

245
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,240
and old, almost muskety-looking kind of museum pieces.

246
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,040
But standing near this group of men was a beautiful dog.

247
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,920
I thought, "Why is it that these things come to you,

248
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,960
"when you should be thinking about more serious things?"

249
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,680
But to be truthful, these little things sometimes tell you

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,520
much more about a story than the obvious things.

251
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,040
So, I think what I'm getting down to here is,

252
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,920
we're talking about sensitivity.

253
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,720
What I had to realise at the time, I was learning a new trade.

254
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,960
I was learning about the price of humanity and its sufferings.

255
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
- NEWSREEL:
- Now, four months later, the armed forces of both sides

256
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,000
are still defying the UN's attempts to keep the peace.

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,240
And the Cyprus situation is as dangerous and complex as ever.

258
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
The UN is powerless to do anything

259
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
that would really help restore law and order.

260
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,440
I saw a whole village trying to evacuate, they were being attacked,

261
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,560
to somewhere with more safety, like a school building.

262
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,800
And there was this one old lady, who was lame, and she had two sticks.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,480
And she really couldn't get those legs moving.

264
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,040
And there was a British soldier trying to coax her along,

265
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,960
persuade her to hurry up before she'd probably lose her life.

266
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,680
And I was with a friend of mine, I said, "This is ridiculous."

267
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,960
I took one picture of the soldier and the old lady,

268
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,080
and I put my cameras down.

269
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,000
And I scooped this old lady up in my arms.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,560
It was like scooping up some rag doll that had fallen from a child's pram.

271
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,080
I just ran and ran with her. I don't know why I did it.

272
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,960
But I didn't really want to see that old lady shot down and killed.

273
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,520
And I went back to my position as a photographer, and I carried on.

274
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,240
But it made me feel good.

275
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,880
I it made me feel as if I wasn't just there as a voyeur

276
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,840
that was enjoying other people's misery and possible deaths.

277
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,360
It's a very fine line.

278
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
I've been constantly accused of taking terrible pictures

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,680
and people saying, "Did you ever help anyone?"

280
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,640
Of course I did. But I don't want to brag about it.

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,880
I did it sometimes to clear my own conscience.

282
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,920
These little battles were erupting all over

283
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,160
the northern part of the island of Cyprus, where the Turks lived.

284
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,720
We saw this soldier looking at the bodies, and I said,

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,520
"What's happening?" He said, "There's been some killing," he said,

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,200
"There's a dead body up there and some more in that house."

287
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,160
I knocked on the door, I tapped on this door and there was no answer.

288
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,040
And I let myself in.

289
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,600
And the first thing I was greeted with was warm blood.

290
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,280
These men had been murdered the day before,

291
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,160
and the warm, early morning sunlight had penetrated through

292
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,600
the glass door of this house.

293
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
And I closed the door and I tiptoed around the room,

294
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
and I got myself in a corner, and I was taking the first shot.

295
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
And suddenly, the door opened and, to my horror, the whole family burst in.

296
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,280
I thought, my God, they're going to be really cross, finding me in here.

297
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,520
To my astonishment, they weren't, so I carried on photographing.

298
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,040
And there was a woman who started screaming like mad.

299
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,640
And the truth was that it was her husband who was just below my feet,

300
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,640
who was dead. A new husband at that, they had only been married a week.

301
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,920
And the Greeks came the day before and attacked this community

302
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,000
and murdered these people in cold blood in this house.

303
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,320
I'd go into a village one day, and I got there in the early morning.

304
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,920
And they were finding bodies of Turkish men

305
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,440
who were defending the villages.

306
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,480
And then they were coming back to the village

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,840
and telling women that their husbands had been killed.

308
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,360
And then you saw these Goya-esque kind of poses

309
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,120
of people looking up to Christ.

310
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,560
I've noticed that a lot in wars.

311
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,800
When people are in deep grief and emotion, they look up

312
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,880
as if they can see God himself there, offering them some help.

313
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,960
And you see that in Goya's drawings.

314
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
Before men are being shot or massacred,

315
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
they look up, or they are praying,

316
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,640
and it's part of that religious nature of the great painters.

317
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,280
That moment is so classic.

318
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,680
I call it one of the decisive moments in photography.

319
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,080
Because it combines the news moments with the compositional elements

320
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,360
which make a photograph in themselves.

321
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,360
So, there is something, a second or two would have made a difference.

322
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,040
I asked Don how he took the picture.

323
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,200
As I recall it, he actually had to fall to his knees quickly to get it

324
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,760
because he just sensed it was coming.

325
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,800
I mean, OK, I talk as if there's a lot of poetry in me.

326
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,640
There isn't. I'm a photographer. I am neither an artist or a poet.

327
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm a photographer.

328
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,720
And one of the things I've learned most of all, erm,

329
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
over and above photography,

330
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,840
the very best qualifications you can have when you are in this situation,

331
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,720
and you are exercising this duty as a photographer, or whatever, reporter,

332
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,320
is that it's much better to be on the side of humanity.

333
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,640
All this was coming at me so fast, this responsibility.

334
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,120
And I felt, almost from the word go, I got a grip of it,

335
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,160
and I thought, I understand what I'm doing for the first time.

336
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm meant to be doing this.

337
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,240
There was a decree put out that journalists were not allowed

338
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,800
to leave Leopoldville.

339
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,640
And then I thought, here I am, all this way out here in the Congo

340
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,720
and now I can't even leave out of the capital.

341
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
So, I had it in mind, and I knew that there were mercenaries

342
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
operating up in a place called Stanleyville.

343
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
I quickly managed to discover all this.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,920
I've been appointed by Mr Tchombe

345
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,400
to recruit a number, which I can't disclose,

346
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,680
of men to form a fighting unit in the Congo,

347
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
to dispel the present rebellion.

348
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,120
"Mercenary" is a dirty word.

349
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,920
This unit is going to change the meaning of that word,

350
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,080
and "mercenary" will now be a badge of honour,

351
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,800
rather than a dirty word in the English language.

352
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,280
I met one of these mercenaries, and his name was Alan Murphy.

353
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,240
And I said, "Could you get me some information about this?"

354
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,600
And I pumped him for how to get there.

355
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,240
And he said, what happens was, every morning,

356
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,800
a C130 American plane, under the CIA,

357
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,760
would take groups of mercenaries to Stanleyville.

358
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
And I said, "Could you get me one of your shirts and a pair of trousers,

359
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,680
"and if I sleep overnight in the hotel,

360
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,920
"would you kick my bed in the morning when you get the call to leave?"

361
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,360
And he did just that.

362
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,320
And I see myself now, many, 40 years ago, standing on that runway

363
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,640
with the early-morning rain shower that had passed.

364
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,720
And a man with a clipboard, who happened to be a CIA man,

365
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,880
asking people's names. And I thought, I've had it. I've had it, you know.

366
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,480
Then he came up to me and he said, "What's your name?"

367
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
And I said, "McCullin." He said, "You're not on the list."

368
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,600
I said, "I should be," and my legs were like jelly.

369
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,880
And he said, he wrote my name down, he said, "OK, climb aboard."

370
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,720
And I'd cracked this amazing no-go situation.

371
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,360
When I arrived in Stanleyville,

372
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,800
I could hear a lot of shouting and screaming,

373
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,160
people crying and gunfire.

374
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,760
And I saw gangs of boys who had been tied up, and they were being beaten

375
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,280
and shot in the back of the head and kicked into the river.

376
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,720
I was looking at all this.

377
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,160
I had my little camera in my bag, and 20 rolls of film.

378
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,040
And I thought, how am I going to bring my camera out now

379
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,000
and declare that I shouldn't be here and I'm not a mercenary?

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Because it was a huge gamble.

381
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,360
And it was the Congolese gendarmerie who were killing these people,

382
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,760
torturing them, dragging them behind trucks on wires,

383
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,360
it was really terrible.

384
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,480
They were skinned alive, some of them.

385
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,640
It was a kind of wood yard, and they were sitting in a corner, shivering.

386
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
Knowing that any moment, they would be shot.

387
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,160
And then they dragged some of these boys out in front of me

388
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,640
and started brutalising them.

389
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,640
And I had no power, by the way, to prevent this.

390
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
I took a few pictures and I walked away.

391
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,360
I thought, you know, you have a moral sense of purpose and duty.

392
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,320
You have to work out which of those purposes and duty you are there for.

393
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,520
It's very difficult too.

394
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,720
You want to take this picture, and you want to stop it.

395
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
And it's a very difficult thing.

396
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,040
It came up more and more my life,

397
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,240
seeing people executed in front of me.

398
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,080
GUNFIRE

399
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
RAPID GUNFIRE

400
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,080
There was a man called Mike Hoare

401
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,880
who was battling on the other side of this river, the Lualaba.

402
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,200
He was in charge of Fifth Commando,

403
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,640
these mercenaries I had teamed up with.

404
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,320
So, I arrived on the other side.

405
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,880
And then, Mike Hoare came to me and said,

406
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,000
"What are you doing, who are you? Where have you come from?"

407
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
And I said, "I have to be clean with you now,

408
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,520
"I'm working for the Observer newspaper."

409
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,680
He wouldn't have understood the German magazine, Quick.

410
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,960
I immediately fell back on my English heritage.

411
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
So, he said, "I'll deal with you in the morning,

412
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,880
"I'm going to hand you over to the Congolese military."

413
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,480
Which one knew right away, that would be curtains.

414
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,560
He said, "I admire what you have done, but I don't condone it."

415
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,760
And then he totally switched his whole kind of attitude

416
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,440
and offered to take me on this journey

417
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,360
chasing these Simbas who had abducted these nuns.

418
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,040
And they were cutting them to pieces with machetes on the way down,

419
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,680
as they were fleeing from us.

420
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
And we caught up with them.

421
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
There was goodness in Mike Hoare,

422
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
but there wasn't much goodness in what he stood for, really.

423
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,200
He was there for the adventure and the money.

424
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,120
There was one mercenary Rhodesian and I was sleeping in the same room

425
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,440
and he had a whole box of stuff and I said, "Where did you get that?"

426
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,240
He said, "I've just blown the bank in town but there was no money in it, unfortunately."

427
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,840
Halfway through the night, I heard gunfire

428
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,480
and I woke up in a great sweat.

429
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
This Rhodesian had got drunk and shot these two African boys,

430
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,720
who were doing all the laundry and the cooking

431
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,960
for these mercenaries for breakfast.

432
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,280
I remember looking at one of these poor black boys,

433
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,480
he was about 12 years old and his eyes were open.

434
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,960
And I looked at the mercenary and he said, "They asked for it.

435
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,640
"I found a weapon on them." Which wasn't true.

436
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,040
You know, some of these mercenaries,

437
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,360
they just had a lust for killing Africans.

438
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,920
HE MOANS

439
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,560
I hated them in the end.

440
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,560
GUNSHOT/HE SHOUTS

441
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,160
When I came away from these atrocities, I kept thinking,

442
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,400
"How am I going to get through this?"

443
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,520
I love what I'm doing, I love photography but, you know,

444
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,640
this other stuff is really too awful to live with, you know.

445
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
And sometimes people used to say to me, "Do you have nightmares?"

446
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,400
I would say, "No.

447
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,400
"Only in the daytime, when my eyes are open and I'm awake

448
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,800
"and my memory is, you know, on full alert."

449
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,440
So when I see... I love photography,

450
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,640
I love being in my darkroom, but even my darkroom is a haunted place.

451
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,360
I go in there with the red light and it's like being in a womb

452
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,960
and I play that music, which is only classical music,

453
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,000
it somehow pleases me, but at the same moment,

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
it takes me down and down and down to where I don't want to go.

455
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,040
It's like as if I'm drowning in a very deep ocean...

456
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,800
..and I'm trying to get back to the top again to see the daylight.

457
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,400
So, you know, I don't just take photographs. I think.

458
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,440
CLASSICAL MUSIC

459
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I would come back to Finsbury Park,

460
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
because unfortunately,

461
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,640
I was still living in quite poor circumstances with my new wife.

462
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
And then, when there were odd days when I had nothing to do,

463
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,640
I would go to the Wimpy bar and hang out with the same tribe, you know.

464
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,280
And then they would say, "Where have you been lately?"

465
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,320
I'd say, "I've been to the Congo with the mercenaries."

466
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,840
And they would try to humour me...

467
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,920
..but basically, they were almost putting me down,

468
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,960
as if I was living in a Walter Mitty world.

469
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,600
I did about four and a half years on the Observer

470
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,640
and things were beginning to slow down for me and I could also...

471
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,360
I started getting the taste and the need

472
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,600
to do much bigger, you know, international stories.

473
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,280
And a friend of mine called David King,

474
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,000
who worked at the Sunday Times, said to me,

475
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,720
"Why don't you come and join us?

476
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,720
"Why don't you come and do some work for us? I'll give you work."

477
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,720
So I did and he sent me off to the Mississippi.

478
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,760
BLUES MUSIC

479
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,000
It was an amazing part of the world, the Mississippi.

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,120
They had the sharecroppers,

481
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,520
the black people who brought in the cotton,

482
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,240
living in shacks and sheds, and then you had New Orleans,

483
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,840
where we basically, we arrived in New Orleans and it was amazing to see.

484
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,040
And there was a Ku Klux Klan rally one night.

485
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,360
It was like Hollywood.

486
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,400
There was the big fire cross burning,

487
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,640
these rather hateful people in these ridiculous kind of outfits,

488
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
smoking huge cigars and basically

489
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,000
saying, "Welcome," but, you know, at the same time intimidating us.

490
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,480
I managed to, you know, get a few pictures, which David King,

491
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,720
when I came back, put together.

492
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
You know, you can take amazing pictures,

493
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,640
but you still need to have them presented

494
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,800
in a way that the public can accept them and understand them.

495
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,920
That was my first assignment for the Sunday Times.

496
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,720
Roy Thompson was not a journalist himself,

497
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,200
but he was the best friend journalism ever had.

498
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,120
He was very proud of his newspapers

499
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,720
and he was so proud of their independence,

500
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,960
he had a card printed which he carried in his pocket.

501
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
So when Roy Thompson was attacked,

502
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,880
"Why are you papers publishing this?"

503
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,960
or, "Why are you putting these war photographs in the colour magazine?

504
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,400
"We advertisers don't like it."

505
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,880
He would pause and take out of his pocket a little card

506
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,720
and it said, it was a kind of oath he'd made, you know,

507
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,440
"The newspapers that I control will always be independent

508
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,240
"and will run professionally and I do not interfere in them."

509
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,240
So he would put the card back in his pocket and would say,

510
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,280
"You wouldn't expect me to go against my own word, would you?"

511
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,840
I was very privileged because I worked on the colour magazine,

512
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,760
which was directly associated with the Sunday Times newspaper.

513
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,800
And I had equally wonderful people there

514
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,360
who allowed me to just disappear and come back several weeks later

515
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,640
and on top of all that, allow me to edit my own material.

516
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,800
He knew he had the confidence that if he did his part

517
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,640
and took his photographs and reported with integrity

518
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,880
and accuracy and with a sense of composition,

519
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,840
that it wasn't going to be interfered with

520
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,880
or rejected because of some other concerns.

521
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,400
He trusted me and so it meant that I would try that much harder

522
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,960
for people who gave me this wonderful freedom.

523
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,600
So Roy Thomson, backing his editors,

524
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,240
was crucial to the career of Don McCullin.

525
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,520
MUSIC: "Tin Soldier" by The Small Faces

526
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,880
The '60s were packed with opportunities

527
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
if you wanted to go to war.

528
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,200
# I am a little tin soldier that wants to jump into your fire... #

529
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,320
Israeli soldiers, fresh from street fighting,

530
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,240
snapped one another at the Wailing Wall.

531
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,000
Pictures for girlfriends, or people from Tel Aviv.

532
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,240
# All I need is treat me like a man

533
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,880
# Cos I ain't no child... #

534
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,920
If they think that I've come back happy,

535
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,400
they know that I've got something ghastly to show.

536
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
And if I've got something ghastly to show,

537
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,640
it means that I'm trying to get the message over to people

538
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,040
that even though I like being in a war and I like being there

539
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,400
because it's a great adventure for me,

540
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,720
my duty is to be there for a reason, not just to have a bloody good time.

541
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,560
I covered the battle of the citadel of Hue,

542
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
which was the biggest battle I'd ever been in.

543
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,440
I mean, I wouldn't like to go through a year without being in a war.

544
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,560
And it went on for two weeks

545
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,080
and that was really the beginning of real madness.

546
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm getting a bit bad, really,

547
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,720
because I'm looking forward to doing two wars a year

548
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,840
and if I start looking forward to doing two or even more a year,

549
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm not going to survive.

550
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,600
CLASSICAL MUSIC

551
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,920
GUNFIRE

552
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,200
Sleeping next to dead bodies.

553
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,880
Looking at men who had been run over by tanks

554
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,440
and looked like Persian carpets in the road.

555
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,560
People with their brains hanging out.

556
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,120
Living under tables and sleeping in rat-infested rooms.

557
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,680
It was like, basically, going into total madness and insanity.

558
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,120
I stood for two weeks in that battle,

559
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,080
watching dozens and dozens of American soldiers being killed

560
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,240
and wounded and being dragged towards me.

561
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,160
They looked as if they'd been taken from a butcher's shop, with blood everywhere.

562
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,120
In the end, I became totally mad, free,

563
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,720
running around like a tormented animal.

564
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,680
CLASSICAL MUSIC

565
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I've got to make sure that when they look at my pictures,

566
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,000
if it's on a Sunday morning after breakfast,

567
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
that it's going to hit them hard.

568
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,760
The very first man I saw in that Battle of Hue

569
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,720
had been hit in the face with two bullets.

570
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,760
And he had a bandage around him.

571
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,320
It looked like a child who had his porridge dripping down his face,

572
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,760
through this bandage, but in fact it was blood and not porridge.

573
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,600
Big, gooey chunks of human gore, just coming out of his face.

574
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I put my camera up to my face

575
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,080
and he tried to move his head, this soldier,

576
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,440
but his eyes were screaming at me not to photograph him,

577
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,520
so I took my camera and went somewhere else.

578
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,800
There was no shortage of, you know, human flesh to photograph that day.

579
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,720
Our most vivid memory of the battle

580
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,840
was that it was one of the most intense battles of the Vietnam War.

581
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,080
Don came in and joined us and he just kind of showed up,

582
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,400
but what was unique about Don is that the other correspondents

583
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,080
and photographers would show up and, what I would say, snap and go.

584
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,320
They would take their pictures and then be out of there.

585
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,160
Don, for whatever the reason, decided to join with us,

586
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,080
stay with us and for several days, he became one of us.

587
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,880
On one occasion, on more than one occasion,

588
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,600
went out at great risk to himself

589
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,640
to assist with bringing some of our wounded casualties back

590
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,680
to where we could evacuate them.

591
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,680
His classic photo of the shell-shocked Marine

592
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,480
is a Delta Company Marine.

593
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,480
I dropped on my knees and photographed this man.

594
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,720
I shot five frames, each one singularly.

595
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,200
One, two, three, four, five.

596
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,320
There is not one blink of an eyelid. There's not one change.

597
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,320
All those negatives are exactly the same.

598
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,880
I have kept up with a sizeable number

599
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,920
of the Marines from Delta Company.

600
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,720
We get together periodically and that individual has not surfaced,

601
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,520
so I don't know his history from that day on.

602
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,560
PIANO MUSIC

603
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,760
DISTANT GUNFIRE

604
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,760
I photographed this giant American

605
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,360
who looked like an athlete, but he was throwing a hand grenade.

606
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,680
Within seconds, this sniper hit this soldier in the hand

607
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,440
and he had a hand like a cauliflower.

608
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,720
It was all busted and bursting open.

609
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,160
The picture itself almost defeats the anti-war feeling

610
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,080
that I was trying to put across,

611
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,640
because he looks the picture of manhood,

612
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,880
like a javelin thrower at an Olympic event.

613
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,720
Instead of that,

614
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,320
he was throwing a hand grenade which was meant to bring death to others.

615
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
DISTANT GUNFIRE

616
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,880
The one meaningful picture I took in that battle

617
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,280
was a man who had been hit in both legs, an American Marine.

618
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,440
He was being supported by two friends

619
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,560
and if ever I thought, at the very moment in my atheistic kind of mind,

620
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,560
that I was looking at something purely religious, was of this man,

621
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,120
who looked like Jesus Christ being taken down from the cross.

622
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,640
When it was over, about 50% of the Marines were casualties.

623
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,240
In my own case, I went in with a company of 120 Marines

624
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,800
and sailors and at the end of the battle,

625
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,440
there were 39 of us that were still standing.

626
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:54,520
So you can see from just those shots how chaotic it was.

627
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,040
After two weeks, I got back to the press centre in Da Nang

628
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,480
and I realised I hadn't taken my clothes off, my underwear,

629
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,120
anything off for two weeks.

630
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,320
And, you know, I had a beard and I was haunted-looking.

631
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,480
I took those clothes off and threw them straight into the waste bin,

632
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,640
my underwear and everything I stood in, and had a shower.

633
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,160
I think I could have easily broke down in that shower and cried,

634
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,080
you know, I was so...

635
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,360
..so drained and used and crushed by two weeks of seeing people dying.

636
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,840
And you know, I think what I'm trying to say here is trying to be honest.

637
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,880
You know, photography suddenly didn't come into the picture, even.

638
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,320
It had nothing to do with photography.

639
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,240
After a while, if you are that involved in that kind of situation,

640
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,400
it's not about photography, it's about humanity.

641
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,960
Still photographs do have this strong affinity

642
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,000
with the way we remember, so...

643
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,040
And the vibrations of a still photograph can be intense

644
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,160
and can last for ever.

645
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,440
I can remember that Don sometimes worries,

646
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,000
I know, about, "Have I taken these risks? Is it worthwhile?"

647
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,320
I can tell him it is

648
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:25,040
because nobody can trace...it's like throwing a stone in a pond.

649
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,480
The ripples go out and you can't say,

650
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,480
"This ripple was caused by this stone," but they are.

651
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,880
And I think the disenchantment with the Vietnam War in America

652
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,960
is powerfully reinforced by some of the photographers,

653
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,000
American photographers, including Don McCullin.

654
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,320
Photography is the truth if it is being handled by a truthful person

655
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,520
and I have to tell you that I have a lot of integrity.

656
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,480
I would never tell a lie.

657
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,120
I would never try to recreate something that wasn't real.

658
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,560
I did a picture once where I did recreate something.

659
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,120
It was the only time I ever did it,

660
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,440
but I saw some Americans looting the body of a dead soldier,

661
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,200
looking for souvenirs and mocking the body, mocking the person.

662
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,000
And when they went away,

663
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,640
having rifled all through his personal things,

664
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,480
I brought them together and made a kind of montage

665
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,240
of this pathetic possessions of this North Vietnamese soldier.

666
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,600
It's the only time I've ever done it,

667
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,920
but I thought I would make a statement for this soldier.

668
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,960
I have no shame about doing that.

669
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,240
I have this picture and I think it says what I was trying to make it say, that, you know,

670
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,520
"Hear me. I am just a victim of war."

671
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,760
I was trying to say this about this young man.

672
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,920
We had total freedom in Vietnam.

673
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,840
That, of course, made the Americans feel,

674
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,480
when the war finally came to an end,

675
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,000
that it was the media that let them down.

676
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They felt a bit upset about that, because they had given us

677
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,400
every facility and all they got in exchange was, you know,

678
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,080
that public opinion turned against the war in Vietnam.

679
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,840
So if you go to Afghanistan now, you are totally controlled.

680
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,720
They are never going to be allowed to take the kind of photographs

681
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,240
I did in Vietnam of the real thing, the battle, the price of war

682
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:36,120
and the suffering and loss, so the whole rulebook has been rewritten.

683
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,120
And it doesn't come out in our favour.

684
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
You just said it's a rotten job

685
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,400
and yet you have, in fact, sought it out.

686
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,520
You've sought out war and famine and misery

687
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,520
in all the time I've known you, which has been a long, long time.

688
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,160
Yes, I did it because I thought it was just going to be soldiers,

689
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,600
and then when I got to war,

690
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,240
I thought it was amazingly exciting to lay under

691
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,080
a barrage of shells dropping on me, or a sniper trying to get me.

692
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,680
I thought, you know, that was a challenge,

693
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,480
and I have swum around with many dead bodies in canals

694
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,920
to get by them when the sniper is working a ridge for me.

695
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,680
I felt I wanted to put my fingers up and say, "You missed it, mate."

696
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,600
And, you know, I had a very cocky attitude about warfare,

697
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,160
but then I started coming in contact with the real victims

698
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,840
and they are always the poor people who are not informed.

699
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,520
They don't have the Mercedes-Benz to get away.

700
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,720
They don't have the communication or the money to move off quick.

701
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,080
They are always the very poorest people who get clobbered.

702
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,760
And the amazing thing is that is where I started in my life,

703
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,800
living with poor people,

704
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,240
and when I am with them in those circumstances,

705
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,480
I have a very close affinity and understanding of what their lot is.

706
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,200
# I presume you never noticed

707
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,200
# How much I really cared... #

708
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,840
You are friends, aren't you?

709
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,360
- You are buddies, aren't you?
- Well, we're all buddies.

710
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,920
Can you look where my elbow is?

711
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,000
I want to see your face, if you don't mind. That's fine.

712
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,360
You're OK, aren't you? You don't mind? You don't mind me?

713
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm not bullying you around, am I? OK, thanks.

714
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,360
I don't want to take liberties, you know.

715
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,800
I could have spent the rest of my life working

716
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,960
in Aldgate and Whitechapel, it's all there.

717
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,040
Photographically, it's all there.

718
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,920
It is a totally, what do they call it...

719
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,320
..Hogarthian kind of experience, when you are doing these pictures.

720
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,240
PIANO MUSIC

721
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,600
This is one of my favourite pictures and I've never,

722
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,480
ever printed it before.

723
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,720
Look at these men's hands.

724
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,280
They are all standing up asleep, these men.

725
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,800
These people used to try and put the dead eye on you.

726
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,960
By that, they would try to stare you out.

727
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,400
You must never flinch away like that. You must stare them out.

728
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,760
This is a woman called Jean.

729
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,520
She used to hang out under the arches of Liverpool Street Station.

730
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,520
She used to curtsey when I went up.

731
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,520
She used to say, "Hello, Captain Mark."

732
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,400
I said, "Why do you keep calling me Captain Mark?"

733
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,400
And she said, "Because you look like Captain Mark Phillips."

734
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,440
She said, "Would you like some tea?"

735
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,560
And I said, "You haven't got any milk."

736
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,760
She said, "I can always get it outside of people's front doors."

737
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,120
I loved her.

738
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,920
In fact, what I did, I found her somewhere to live.

739
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,600
This is a picture I really like.

740
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,960
It's like a fallen woman from the turn of the century.

741
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,120
I did this in Chapel Market on Sunday morning when I was very young.

742
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,920
She's been a posh woman, this woman.

743
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,960
You can tell by the handbag, tell by the clothes.

744
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,320
They're all young, now. They are not old people like this.

745
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,520
I think one of the best portraits I ever did

746
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,920
was this man in Spitalfields Market.

747
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,840
He was actually lying by the embers of an all-night fire

748
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,800
that these homeless men used to congregate around.

749
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,080
He sat up and looked at me full-face.

750
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,600
I just held his stare and I just brought my Nikon camera up

751
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,840
to my eye and took this picture and he never moved an eyelid.

752
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,600
I was looking at the bluest eyes you've ever seen

753
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,640
and his hair was matted.

754
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,480
I felt as if I was looking at one of those Neptune images

755
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,320
of a man under the sea, you know, with a trident.

756
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,560
It was quite extraordinary.

757
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,120
So pleased with the picture.

758
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,280
MUSIC: "Blue Peter Theme"

759
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,080
This year it's a matter of life and death.

760
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,120
GUNSHOT

761
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,440
There has been a war going on in West Africa for two years now.

762
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,920
It's a civil war between the Biafrans and the Nigerians.

763
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,480
We're not going to say which side is right or which side is wrong,

764
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,040
except that all war is always wrong.

765
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,200
I went two or three times.

766
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,320
Aeroplanes that used to take in aid

767
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,000
used to land on an extended road, which was their airstrip.

768
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,360
It was called Uli Airstrip and you went at night

769
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,720
and the Federal Government had hired,

770
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,760
you know, Russian pilots and foreign pilots

771
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,760
to try and shoot these planes down.

772
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,320
This one is flying the other side of the mission church,

773
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,960
sweeping to the right.

774
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,080
Streaking the ground as they move,

775
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,760
dropping incendiary bombs and fragmentation bombs

776
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,880
in the places around here.

777
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,880
So, going in to Uli Airstrip at night was a very hairy experience.

778
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,120
There are crews out there willing to fly, despite the lack of permission

779
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,160
and we will just try and fly in.

780
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,920
- But you stand a good chance of being shot down?
- I don't think so, no.

781
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,240
They seem to have been fairly trigger-happy in the past, though.

782
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,600
Anyway, we are going to try and let us see.

783
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,240
Ms Ryder, why are you going as well?

784
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,520
Well, because one feels very concerned, clearly,

785
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,120
with anyone who is suffering any distress anywhere

786
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:25,760
and partly because one has seen a situation in Europe,

787
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,640
in the past, perhaps similar to this.

788
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,120
PIANO MUSIC

789
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,480
I walked into a camp which was actually an old school building

790
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,320
and there were 800 dying children, standing there, waiting for me.

791
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,960
You know, when you go into a camp with 800 dying children,

792
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,560
some of whom are actually dropping down and dying in front of me,

793
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,760
they think you're coming with some form of salvation.

794
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,200
They don't realise you're coming to take pictures and get information.

795
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,080
That's not what they want. You know, they want food.

796
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,000
I saw this particular boy that haunts me to this day.

797
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,560
He was an albino boy and he was standing, looking at me.

798
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,920
Barely managing to stand on his spindly legs.

799
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,200
When you're an albino in Africa,

800
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,440
you're singled out all the time for bullying and God knows what.

801
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,440
He was clutching a French corned beef tin,

802
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,760
some previous aid gift which he'd licked the interior completely dry.

803
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,880
And I thought, "I can't look at this boy." It was too much.

804
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,320
He was staring at me, so I went somewhere else

805
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,040
and spoke to a doctor, cos another child had collapsed

806
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,320
and was dying and suddenly, somebody touched my hand

807
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,360
and I looked down and it was the albino boy, he was holding my hand.

808
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,760
And I thought, "Why are you doing this to me?"

809
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,680
It was like he'd honed in on me and he was really paining me,

810
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,320
making me feel so ashamed.

811
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,720
So I gave him a barley sugar from my pocket and he went away

812
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,640
and he stood at a distance, licking this barley sugar.

813
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,720
There were children of two years old,

814
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,360
crawling around on their stomachs with their anus hanging out.

815
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,400
I've never seen anything so terrible in all my life,

816
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,640
the inside of their whole backside

817
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,440
had kind of invertedly kind of suddenly fell out

818
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,040
and they were dragging themselves around

819
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,960
with this inside-out situation of their bottoms,

820
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,720
with flies hanging on as they crawled.

821
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,720
I thought, this was worse than any inferno of insanity

822
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,560
that you could ever experience or see in your life.

823
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,080
It wasn't real, it was so horrible, so shocking.

824
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,920
And, you know, I almost become, well, I almost became paralysed.

825
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,600
I was so shocked.

826
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,320
I thought, "Take your mind off it. Take some pictures."

827
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,600
They said, "There's a girl you must see."

828
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,240
They said, "Her name is Patience."

829
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,120
They brought her in and she was completely naked.

830
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,080
She was 16 years of age,

831
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,400
days, if not one or two days, away from death.

832
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,960
And I thought, "How am I going to do this?"

833
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,440
And they sat her down and I asked the nurse

834
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,280
if she would place her hands over the lower part of her body,

835
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,120
cos I thought, you know,

836
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,880
"If I'm going to do this picture

837
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,960
"to show this terrible, shocking creature,

838
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,360
"I'm going to do it with as much dignity as I can rustle up

839
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,720
"and at least not take advantage of her nakedness."

840
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,480
You've never seen a more dignified person, you know,

841
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,480
you know, inches away from death.

842
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,000
PIANO MUSIC

843
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,280
And I remember one day seeing a woman trying to feed a child at the breast.

844
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,040
There was nothing for the child at the breast.

845
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,520
And I saw some writing at the back, in the far distance.

846
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,680
And after I'd photographed the woman, who, believe it or not,

847
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,920
was only 24 years of age and she looked like 65,

848
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,960
I went and read the writing in the far distance on the wall

849
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,560
and it had on the wall, "Today I am reborn."

850
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,000
And that little inscription took my legs away from me.

851
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,920
You know, you can go through so much as a photographer,

852
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,040
you put yourself there.

853
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,680
You don't ask, you know, you don't ask why you are there.

854
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,800
You go there and the same time you put yourself there.

855
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,720
You could refuse if you want.

856
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,680
I went there, but when I went there, I photographed these people

857
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,440
to show they had more dignity than most of us will ever dream of,

858
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,920
that being in the last throes of their life.

859
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,240
His awareness of the futility of it,

860
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,240
as well as the direct sight of these people dying on their feet...

861
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,600
..moved him enormously.

862
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,320
He always had empathy, of course,

863
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,400
with the soldier who was shot, but here he was looking at civilians.

864
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,040
Men and women without any clue about what was going on,

865
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,440
dying because of the ambitions

866
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,720
of some of the power-hungry people in the country.

867
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,800
MUSIC: "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd

868
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:24,000
# If I leave here tomorrow

869
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,200
# Would you still remember me?

870
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,640
# I must be travelling on now... #

871
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,720
I spent my whole life travelling the world. I was really on the move.

872
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,280
You know, I was constantly at London Airport

873
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,440
and waving goodbye to my little family.

874
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,480
# And this bird shall never change... #

875
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,360
I was very eager, as always,

876
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,600
and ambitious to get to the front of the fighting.

877
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,320
And the next thing I know,

878
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,920
we walked into an ambush and all hell broke loose.

879
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,960
GUNFIRE

880
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,520
There was tremendous, heavy AK-47 fire.

881
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,200
And I immediately ran down into the side of the road,

882
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,240
which is like a culvert.

883
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,240
And I thought, "I'm going to get my tail out of here."

884
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,280
Because, you know, what does one picture mean of a soldier under fire

885
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,120
if it's going to cost you your life?

886
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,120
For the first time, my nerve went.

887
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,800
I knelt behind a tube and there was an almighty explosion.

888
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,920
I was blown across the road.

889
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,320
I felt this terrible burning sensation in my legs

890
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,360
and everywhere from the waist downwards.

891
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,160
And all my past seemed to come before me and I thought, "This is it. I'm going to die."

892
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,160
So I crawled away for about 200 yards,

893
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,360
only to be put on the back of a truck,

894
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,920
having been stabbed with a morphine injection.

895
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,800
And then they filled the lorry up

896
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,720
with about half a dozen soldiers who were wounded.

897
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,520
I thought, "I'm going to take my mind off my own pain

898
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,840
"and I'm going to photograph what's going on in this truck."

899
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,280
They put the man on the truck right next to me

900
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,080
who took the full brunt of the mortar bomb that hit me,

901
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,880
but he got, unfortunately, all of it in his chest and stomach.

902
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,200
And he kept sitting up and trying to fight people holding him down.

903
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,240
He was fighting.

904
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,280
And he died on the way back in the truck to the hospital,

905
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,840
because I sat up and photographed him.

906
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,760
And I said, "I don't want you to take any more risks."

907
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,600
They took the risks as they judged fit

908
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,200
because they were independently-minded.

909
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,920
And I secretly rejoiced that they brought back what they did,

910
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,080
but nonetheless, the next time and the next time

911
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,120
and the next time, you thought,

912
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,120
"Pray to God that they are not playing Russian roulette with their own lives."

913
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,360
LOUD EXPLOSION

914
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,560
It was strange for me to get on an aeroplane and fly to Belfast,

915
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,000
drive to Londonderry, check into the hotel.

916
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,640
And you could guarantee that once the pubs turned out

917
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,680
at about 3-something in the afternoon,

918
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,320
that there you braced yourself

919
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,680
and you knew exactly where it would be.

920
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,320
It was almost like a football match. You knew where the action would be.

921
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,360
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING

922
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,600
It was bricks and bottles and stones

923
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,640
coming at the soldiers, who then fired rubber bullets

924
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,520
and CS gas back, and I used to be gassed on a regular basis.

925
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,520
But from a photographer's point of view, you couldn't miss.

926
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,560
It was like a theatre, really. It was like a play.

927
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,680
You knew the plot, you'd seen it many times before.

928
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,200
This particular day, I knew they were going to charge

929
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,480
and I was standing there with my short telephoto lens

930
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,800
and I took this picture of the "let's go and get them".

931
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,760
I wasn't totally aware that in the shop doorway by this taxi company

932
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,840
was a woman standing there, holding her mouth with total shock.

933
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,200
That made my picture much more poignant, really.

934
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,240
I came upon this highway

935
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,320
and saw these dying soldiers in the road, and I was with a very

936
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,720
nice friend of mine called Michael Nicholson, who was an ITV reporter.

937
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,560
Their wounds were kind of melting into the tar itself on the road.

938
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,800
So hot.

939
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,240
We prised them off the road and we draped them

940
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,200
across the bonnet of his Jeep.

941
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,960
And I stood on the front of it and kind of leaned on them

942
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,200
and we drove them back to a first aid medical centre for the army.

943
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,720
And we went back the next morning to see how they were, but they had died.

944
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,960
And I did lots of pictures of men coming in on that road

945
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,960
with pieces of cardboard around their feet,

946
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,320
because they threw their boots away

947
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,920
and, of course, they didn't last long on that road.

948
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,640
The whole thing was the most appalling shambles.

949
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,640
It was like the retreat from Moscow. Terrible disarray.

950
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,480
And so, when the Sunday Times published these pictures,

951
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:33,040
the South Vietnamese Government put me on a blacklist,

952
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,840
which I never thought for one minute existed.

953
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,480
I was building this reputation as a war photographer,

954
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,680
which today I really detest.

955
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,520
I worked for it and then,

956
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,920
when I suddenly felt that I was being acclaimed as a war photographer,

957
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,120
suddenly I felt uncomfortable and dirty.

958
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,320
I felt being called a war photographer

959
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,360
was like being called a mercenary.

960
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,480
Looking back on all that, I thought my family suffered very badly.

961
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,880
I was always waving goodbye to them and one wonders in their mind,

962
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,040
were they ever thinking, "Will we ever see this strange man again,

963
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,240
"who is supposed to be our father?"

964
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,840
But, you know, I didn't want to weaken my strength

965
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,320
by thinking in a sentimental way.

966
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,080
I wanted to do my job and then hopefully go home to them,

967
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,280
but it was very selfish, now I look back on it.

968
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,840
And it eventually ruined by marriage.

969
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,480
GUNFIRE

970
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,120
In Beirut's Christian stronghold,

971
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:21,080
Phalangist militiamen poured fire on neighbouring areas

972
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,160
held by Muslim leftists

973
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,920
and allies from the more extreme Palestinian guerrilla group.

974
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,240
Every day you had a twist in the Lebanon.

975
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,080
There is always something ghastly and new to kind of look at.

976
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,680
I did this photograph of all these Christians,

977
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,960
all proudly showing their manly side to them.

978
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,040
And the audacity was that they were wearing Christian crosses

979
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,680
and, you know, you think...

980
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,160
you expect more from Christianity

981
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,440
if you're displaying it in such a way than some of the terrible things

982
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,560
that they did in the name of Christianity.

983
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,240
On the political front, the situation still appears to be stalemate.

984
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,200
Efforts to implement a ceasefire clearly having failed

985
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,520
and parliament's attempts to hold a session...

986
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,760
The Palestinian areas, the kind of east side of Beirut,

987
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,080
right inside the Christian heartland.

988
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,080
And it was just, it was murder from the word go.

989
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,080
MUSIC

990
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,000
They started, you know, collecting prisoners.

991
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,960
It all happened so quickly.

992
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,400
I went to a house where I could hear a lot of women and children screaming.

993
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,760
A Christian was bringing the women and children down

994
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,400
the side of this stairwell and I could see two Palestinian young men

995
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,800
with their hands up, in the left-hand side of the stairwell.

996
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,440
The moment the women went out of the house,

997
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,960
the man next to me, and I was very close, you know,

998
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,880
very close, started opening up and killing these people in cold blood, immediately.

999
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,360
And they went down in a hail of bullets and blood, all up the wall.

1000
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,760
And I went round the back of the stairwell, another stairwell,

1001
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,840
and try to get a grip of myself, cos I was so shocked.

1002
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,840
I couldn't believe what I had just seen.

1003
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,640
I came out of the building

1004
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,880
and there was another Christian gunman who had the women and children

1005
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,480
and he said, "By the way, if I see you taking any pictures,

1006
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,320
"I am going to kill you myself. Get out of here."

1007
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,280
Everywhere I went that day,

1008
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,800
I could see another person being murdered in front of me.

1009
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,520
Of course, what I did eventually was get the picture of the man

1010
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,760
playing the lute over the dead Palestinian girl's body.

1011
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,480
They were so angry about it when it was published that they said

1012
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,400
if they ever caught the man who took the picture, they would kill him.

1013
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,160
In a way, it was almost an honour

1014
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,840
that they wanted to kill me for taking the picture.

1015
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,760
The 26-storey Holiday Inn is burning.

1016
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,680
The third of a trio of five-star hotels

1017
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,600
to be caught in the firing line.

1018
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,960
This is the courtyard of the Hilton Hotel

1019
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,680
and it was here that the fighting took place all last night.

1020
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:31,480
When the Islamics overwhelmed part of the Christian area where I was,

1021
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:36,120
they were actually ensconced in the Hilton Hotel and when they got in,

1022
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,280
the Christians that they'd captured in there,

1023
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,480
they took them to the top floor and they mutilated them

1024
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:46,320
in a manly sense, by cutting off part of them, and they threw them,

1025
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,720
alive, off the top of the building.

1026
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,360
When it gets down to that kind of hatred,

1027
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,040
it becomes a form of insanity.

1028
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:01,200
It goes beyond your understanding of anything. Anything.

1029
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,160
I don't know how he did it. He had a very sensitive conscience.

1030
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,480
I would often call him "the conscience with a camera".

1031
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,000
He had a very sensitive feel for other people's suffering,

1032
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,080
which also gave him the impetus to feel,

1033
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,040
"I can make people wake up to what is really going on here".

1034
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,240
So the sensitivity which might have made him

1035
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:37,400
recoil from the images was allied to this conscience of his which says,

1036
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,560
"I've got to get this story. It can only be told by photographs."

1037
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,400
His journalism, which is best when that cold eye of his,

1038
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:52,400
if you like, was informed by the warmth of his empathy,

1039
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,200
and by the text, which amplified the image which you could see.

1040
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,960
It's an awful question to ask you, but do you think the images you take

1041
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,920
of horror, of war, actually make anybody change their mind about it?

1042
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,240
Actually, to be honest, I don't think they have.

1043
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,440
I've been photographing war for about 16 years

1044
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,680
and I've got very disillusioned.

1045
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,240
And I've just had an exhibition

1046
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,680
and the exhibition was mostly attended by very young people

1047
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,920
and judging by the letters that I have received, which were many,

1048
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,720
the people who wrote to me were very young people

1049
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,920
and they are the people who care about war.

1050
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,880
I think the rest of us, the middle-aged,

1051
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,160
I hate to say this, people, they've had war and they've had enough of it.

1052
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,000
I think they are sick about hearing about it now.

1053
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,400
They think there is no solution, but the young people,

1054
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,360
who are tomorrow's people,

1055
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,360
they are more interested about trying to do something about it.

1056
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,080
They feel ashamed of it and can't understand it.

1057
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,160
I mean, why don't you settle for the easy life and earn 500 quid

1058
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,000
a day taking pictures of ladies wearing bras and things?

1059
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,120
- Or not wearing bras?
- I would probably get a heart attack.

1060
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,160
LAUGHTER

1061
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,880
Did you like this one? The sulky lover?

1062
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,480
You would be if you had a face like that against you.

1063
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,480
THEY LAUGH

1064
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:13,040
This is one of my favourite pictures. I don't have many favourites.

1065
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,160
It's a classic example of intrusion, of course,

1066
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,920
but it's just showing the English.

1067
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,200
The deckchairs says it all, doesn't it?

1068
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,200
One thing about England, you can guarantee to find

1069
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,320
all kinds of kind of crazy people in the summer.

1070
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,000
There's not, I don't think there is a country quite like this country

1071
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,080
for the diversities of people's manifestations.

1072
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,960
You know, eccentrics.

1073
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,800
You can get them by the bus-load here in England. I love it.

1074
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,800
MUSIC: "This Is England" by The Clash

1075
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,880
# I hear a gang fire on a human factory farm

1076
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,320
# Are they howling out or doing somebody harm?

1077
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,680
# On a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm

1078
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,800
# A voice spoke so cold, it matched the weapon in her palm

1079
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,960
# This is England

1080
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,640
# This knife of Sheffield steel

1081
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,480
# This is England

1082
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,520
# This is how we feel

1083
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,360
# This is England... #

1084
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,400
When the print unions sabotaged the Sunday Times,

1085
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,640
they basically killed the paper.

1086
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,800
The Thomson Organisation said, "We can't go on like this.

1087
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,560
"We can't have the paper wrecked not only physically but economically."

1088
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,000
So they put the paper up for sale.

1089
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,720
And they had a perception, a judgement,

1090
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,080
that Rupert Murdoch, with his history of being pretty tough,

1091
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,280
would be better able to control the print unions.

1092
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:32,000
And in some respects, that was a fair judgement.

1093
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,360
You've had enough photographs. I think we really...

1094
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,720
- And with Mr Evans.
- Mr Evans.

1095
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:41,920
And though he made promises about the papers would maintain

1096
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,800
their independence, he did not keep them.

1097
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,480
And this, of course, was very, very bad news for British journalism

1098
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,680
but it was also bad news, individually, for Don McCullin.

1099
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,760
When Murdoch took over the Sunday Times

1100
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,360
and Harold Evans went over to the Times newspaper,

1101
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,840
we all felt that, you know, we were looking at the beginning of the end.

1102
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,880
And I had had 18 fantastic years there.

1103
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,720
The precious independence that he'd had and the ability to go

1104
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,480
and tell an unvarnished truth through the medium of film

1105
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,200
was now at risk, and so it proved to be.

1106
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,280
MUSIC

1107
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,920
The Falklands War suddenly appeared on the horizon and I thought,

1108
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,880
"I want to be in on this, because for the first time in my life,

1109
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,520
"I'm going to be in a big, international war with British soldiers."

1110
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,160
You know, I thought I was the natural person

1111
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,640
and to my astonishment, I was barred.

1112
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,240
It didn't happen.

1113
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:08,400
I was left behind and I was utterly miserable and devastated.

1114
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,200
It was an appalling decision to keep Don McCullin off the boat,

1115
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,040
creating the excuse that boat was full.

1116
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,600
It seemed to be saying, "Your photography is so honest,

1117
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,880
"so searing, so implicit with meaning, we can't take the risk

1118
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,720
"of you accessing freedom of expression."

1119
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,240
I thought it was the most appalling decision

1120
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:37,040
and its effect on him was to seem to say,

1121
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,680
"You've spent your life documenting things

1122
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,480
"we don't think you should ever have documented,"

1123
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,200
which, of course, was saying, "Why have you bothered?

1124
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,120
"Why have you bothered to risk your life to try and tell the truth?"

1125
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,600
That's the reason I went back to Lebanon,

1126
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,680
because I didn't go to the Falklands.

1127
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,480
The Lebanon War was erupting at the same time.

1128
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,000
Cos, you know, I can always go somewhere else.

1129
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,760
If I couldn't go to this war, I could go to another war, you know.

1130
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,520
Cos I was suffering from what you become, a war junkie, really.

1131
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,920
I was suffering from that problem, you know.

1132
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:22,360
The massacres were carried out by an elite special security formation

1133
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,360
of the Lebanese Christian Phalange.

1134
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,000
The operation was, at all stages,

1135
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,920
under direct control of senior Phalange commanders.

1136
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,680
During that early stage of the massacre at Shatila Camp,

1137
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:40,200
the Israeli forces fired a constant barrage of flares

1138
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,160
to light up the camp for the Phalange forces.

1139
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,440
CLASSICAL MUSIC

1140
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,800
One morning in the hotel, very early,

1141
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,880
I had a call from someone saying, "Are you Mr McCullin?" I said yes.

1142
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,960
They said, "Will you come down to the lobby?

1143
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,600
"We want to take you to the hospital at Sabra and Shatila."

1144
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,320
They said, "About 21 people have been killed in this hospital,

1145
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,080
"but we are not interested in that.

1146
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,440
"We want to show you the worst aspect of what has happened here today."

1147
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,560
They took me upstairs to the children's department

1148
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,840
of the insane side of the hospital

1149
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,880
and to my astonishment, there was one nurse who had stayed

1150
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,360
for five days during this shelling and the others had fled the hospital.

1151
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,080
And she showed me around and I couldn't believe

1152
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,000
what I was looking at.

1153
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,120
She said, "We've had to tie the children to the beds,"

1154
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,880
she said, "because we couldn't cope.

1155
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,280
"They would have got away and been injured."

1156
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,720
And there were children tied to the beds,

1157
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,920
covered in flies, in a heat you wouldn't understand.

1158
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,520
So these children were lying in buckets of their own filth,

1159
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,920
starving hungry, dying of thirst.

1160
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,440
MUSIC

1161
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,360
And she said, "There is a room with more children.

1162
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,600
"I've had to lock them in the room and they are blind and insane,"

1163
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,000
and she said, "They're only two years old, some of them."

1164
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,160
And she opened the door of this room

1165
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,240
and the heat that came out of it, you could've roasted a chicken in it.

1166
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,920
And out swam, in their own filth and mess,

1167
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,920
they were like blind rats, these children.

1168
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,640
I don't think I was ever more ashamed of humanity.

1169
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,840
I thought, "If this is what people can do in the name of, you know,

1170
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,920
"Christianity or whatever, you know..."

1171
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,760
Because the war was being conducted against the Christians,

1172
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:51,360
or the Christians were fighting back and the Jews were shelling,

1173
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,320
I mean, the whole thing was about religious madness.

1174
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,560
Who was paying the price?

1175
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,760
I wandered away. I was in deep shock and I thought, "I'm confused, here.

1176
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:09,360
"Why am I here? What has this got to do with my original concept of being a photographer?"

1177
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,560
And I wandered into another room just to get away

1178
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,320
from all this horrible, horrible stuff.

1179
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,760
And I saw a child sitting,

1180
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,920
playing with bits of debris as if he had Lego.

1181
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,120
I think it was a day of reckoning for me,

1182
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,800
because I don't think I could have ever touched on more tragedy,

1183
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,880
all under one roof, than what I saw at that hospital that day.

1184
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,960
I've never forgotten it.

1185
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,760
The sad thing about these days that I never forget

1186
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,040
is that they come back, on a regular basis,

1187
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,840
as fresh as it was happening today, to haunt me.

1188
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,200
There is nothing so powerful as reporting.

1189
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:15,440
The government can't find out the things that reporters can.

1190
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,280
Certainly, many governments wish to suppress

1191
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:22,800
what can be found out, foreign governments and sometimes our own.

1192
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,920
So this is a very,

1193
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,840
very important quality of Don's impulses,

1194
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,200
which is the passion to report what is happening

1195
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,400
and insofar as that has diminished today,

1196
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,160
we've lost a huge amount

1197
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,000
and I think there is still a tremendous appetite

1198
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,680
for really good photojournalism, really good reporting.

1199
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,080
Mr Rupert Murdoch, on budget day,

1200
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,680
asked me to resign as Editor of the Times. I refused.

1201
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,800
At no time have the independent

1202
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,840
national directors sought my resignation.

1203
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,240
But in the circumstances, the differences between me

1204
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,640
and Mr Murdoch should not be prolonged.

1205
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,080
I am therefore resigning tonight as the Editor of the Times.

1206
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,080
The reason I got pushed out of the Sunday Times was simple, actually.

1207
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,840
They had brought a new editor in.

1208
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,280
A man called Andrew Neil, who was very ambitious,

1209
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,320
and quite, you know, he knew what he wanted.

1210
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,720
Most new editors like to kick off with a new bunch of people

1211
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,640
under them, but he did say that there would be no more

1212
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,800
wars in the magazine and in fact, it would be a magazine

1213
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:38,400
based on life and leisure, you know, to attract the ads.

1214
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,400
So I was one of the first casualties,

1215
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,720
because when I went and photographed wars and Africa

1216
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,760
and dying and starving children,

1217
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,160
I was going to make sure that I got the strongest images.

1218
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,800
They didn't always sit well in a magazine

1219
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,680
that was trying to sell you, you know, cars and luxury.

1220
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,920
So I was definitely on the way out by that stage.

1221
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,680
I asked him about the occasion he was invited to

1222
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,440
an execution in Saigon and as I recall,

1223
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,400
he went to the prison where the execution was going to take place

1224
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,040
and turned back and refused to take the photograph.

1225
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,080
It was because of his really powerful humanitarian impulses,

1226
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,240
he didn't want to legitimise murder in any way.

1227
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:55,440
Since, actually, his entire canon of photography

1228
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,800
is to delegitimise violence and say,

1229
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,480
"Look, these are the consequences of your political decision.

1230
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,120
"These are the consequences of your greed.

1231
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,040
"These are the consequences of your carelessness.

1232
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,080
"Look on these and think again."

1233
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,040
I think his entire impulse, a humanitarian photographer

1234
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:20,320
with tremendous technical skill, amounting to genius, in my view.

1235
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,160
MUSIC

1236
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,560
I'm nearly 75 years of age now.

1237
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,080
I still have some energy left, not a lot,

1238
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,960
but I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to eradicate,

1239
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,240
you know, the things we've been talking about.

1240
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,920
I'm just going to photograph the landscape,

1241
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,440
and the English landscape, to me, is my heaven.

1242
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,480
My form of heaven.

1243
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,240
The one thing that upsets me about it is, like all other things,

1244
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,520
there is always a threat surrounding the things you love.

1245
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,960
When I hear a chainsaw in the distance, you know,

1246
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,960
I think a tree is dying.

1247
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,920
When I hear shooting, when there is pheasant shooting,

1248
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,640
I think there's going to be some blood somewhere.

1249
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,200
The sound of gunfire immediately switches on

1250
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,720
another part of my nervous system.

1251
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:22,640
So I feel, as much as you try to run away from these things,

1252
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,760
someone always presses a button and says, you know,

1253
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,880
"Here is a reminder of, you know, what you used to do."

1254
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,120
