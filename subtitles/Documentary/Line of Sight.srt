1
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:17,794
Mexico was awesome,
thanks for asking.

2
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,329
You're late.

3
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:22,732
Yeah, speaking of late,
you're a couple payments behind.

4
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,335
I got to send my
brother more money.

5
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,337
Hurry up.

6
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:28,805
Seriously, he needs the dough.

7
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:31,407
Why? Huh?

8
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,443
Best thing about jail is
everything's taken care of--

9
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,578
Three squares, man.
Mexican jail.

10
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,146
They have to buy their
own toilet paper.

11
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:38,781
Come on, man, he's there
because of you and your--

12
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,250
- Jesus.
- Oh!

13
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,885
Come on, already.

14
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:42,986
Ah!

15
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,988
Ah! Ahh.

16
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,500
Send him my best the
next time you write.

17
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:11,848
Hey, I'm just the middleman.

18
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,549
You got a problem with the product,
you talk to Manny.

19
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,018
I already did.

20
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,053
Manny said it was good
when it left his hands.

21
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,721
I got to be honest,

22
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,957
I trust him a hell of a
lot more than I trust you.

23
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,759
hey, man.

24
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,460
I swear, I had no idea--

25
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,901
'Father figure' is a phrase
as potent as 'Mother Nature'.

26
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:57,115
Say it outloud and the images fly

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,235
From having a catch on the side of the yard

28
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:02,245
to the screen door slamming
exit of the dead-beat Dad.

29
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:06,220
For every 'Father Knows Best' in Atticus Finch

30
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:09,420
there's a Great Santini bouncing a ball off the head

31
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,500
of his teenaged son

32
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,100
One thing's for sure --

33
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,292
The 'Father Figure' -- in
your face or out the door --

34
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,368
will make his presence felt

35
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,159
like it or not.

36
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:24,487
Look, all I care
about is my brother.

37
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:27,256
I-I can send him money, right?

38
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,258
A percentage of the
stipend is yours to spend

39
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:30,660
However you want.

40
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,161
You'll have to send
it through our office,

41
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,263
So it isn't traceable to you.

42
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,899
And your brother Sam
gets out of prison

43
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,003
In only seven years.

44
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,673
That didn't serve as a
cautionary tale to you?

45
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,778
Kirk always looked after us.
What else was I gonna do?

46
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:51,614
That is one of the great
questions of our age, isn't it?

47
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,816
What to do when faced
with circumstances

48
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:57,520
Beyond our control,
which are most circumstances.

49
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,089
Look, Billy,

50
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,493
This is a chance for you.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,362
From this moment on,
your life can be anything you want.

52
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,897
why?

53
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,666
'cause I'm living in Albuquerque
with a different name?

54
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,001
Because you're alive.

55
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,736
You're safe.
You're going to school.

56
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:16,039
Yeah, some up-nose,
d-bag private school

57
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,306
Where nobody will talk to me.

58
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:18,441
One of the best boarding schools

59
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,776
In the southwest,

60
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,711
Where 99% of the students
go on to college.

61
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,179
What do you care?

62
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,847
Seriously?

63
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,116
I'm here. I'm gonna testify.

64
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,684
You did your job.

65
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,686
No, trust me,

66
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,990
My job with you
has barely begun.

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,571
So who's gonna pay for all this?

68
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,640
I convinced d.O.J.
That since you're taking down

69
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,475
A major drug cartel,
the least they could do

70
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,211
Is foot the bill for
a decent education.

71
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,746
And what if I don't like it?

72
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:58,548
Can I leave? - Sure.

73
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,183
Wait.

74
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,318
Seriously? - Absolutely.

75
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,454
In which case,
you'll end up back on street

76
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,456
Needing money with no
discernable skill set,

77
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,991
As you gravitate to the
easy money of crime--

78
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,259
Recidivism defined.

79
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:13,362
Or you could try something new.

80
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,264
Scary maybe,
but a different life

81
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,033
You can make for yourself.

82
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,302
I don't know.

83
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:20,870
Billy, I'm not just
dumping you here.

84
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,605
Anytime, day or night,
you can call me.

85
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:24,073
We can talk.

86
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,709
I can come down here,
and we can figure things out.

87
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,678
So this is really what
you do for a living?

88
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,046
It is.

89
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:31,314
It's weird.

90
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,883
It's many things,
weird among them.

91
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:38,187
You think where I go to
school actually matters?

92
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,456
Let me give you one
last piece of advice

93
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:43,059
That I heard growing up a lot.

94
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:44,760
Everything matters.

95
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,430
Everything you think,
feel, but most of all,

96
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:50,366
Everything you do...

97
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,201
It all counts.

98
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,206
Ahh.

99
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:10,753
Okay.

100
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,021
Well, welcome back.

101
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,823
I got a busy day
and a crazy week,

102
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,258
So I will see you
when I see you.

103
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,860
You know, uh, the stony silence

104
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,529
The entire way home
from the airport

105
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,764
Is a subtle sign that
you're pissed at me.

106
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:25,001
And look, it's okay. I get it.

107
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,970
I get that whatever I say
about whatever I've been doing

108
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,373
And where I've been is
just gonna sound like,

109
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,142
"blah, blah, blah, blah,
more lies," whatever.

110
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,945
But I feel like I've
turned a corner,

111
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,014
A real corner in my life,

112
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,882
And I'm gonna prove
that to you...

113
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,652
Soon, okay?

114
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,856
Okay, well, that's suitably
vague and unsettling,

115
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:49,892
And on that note,
which basically defines your life,

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,195
I'm off to work.

117
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,002
- Look these over.
- Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,103
Excuse me.

119
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,139
- Good.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,843
- So that's him?
- That's him.

121
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,078
Is it true he guarded hinkley?

122
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,580
Rumor has it.

123
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,081
Sat and read magazines with
Jodi foster on the cover

124
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,150
Just to bait him?

125
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,485
- That's the story.
- Wow.

126
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:20,056
So, Charlie, have you ever
been on an operation falcon?

127
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,124
No, sir--Stan.

128
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,993
No, I haven't.
I've heard about it.

129
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,695
Yeah, but you got the
basic drill, right?

130
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,396
Us, other feds, state, local

131
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:29,232
Chasing down every
open warrant, right?

132
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,499
Anything else?

133
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,901
Well, it always stirs
things up a little.

134
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,402
Some inspectors here love it.

135
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,938
Some, well...

136
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,708
I find your almost girlish
delight disturbing

137
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,142
On many levels.

138
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,078
Come on, it's five days
without your standard,

139
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,479
Whiny, mopey witnessrap.

140
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,748
It's back to basics-- hunt,
bust, cuff, haul.

141
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,950
Then there's the
icing on the cake...

142
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:49,518
him.

143
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,487
You've now crossed
over to sadistic glee.

144
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,588
- You nervous?
- No.

145
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,990
Well, you should be.

146
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,591
I'm about to find out
so many embarrassing,

147
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,892
Hilarious you-secrets,

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,928
I'm gonna have to
alphabetize them.

149
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:03,232
I honestly fear for the
state of your soul.

150
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,034
Marshall.

151
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:06,836
Dad.

152
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,005
Heaven.

153
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:18,247
Since 1970, the federal
Witness Protection program

154
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,383
Has relocated thousands
of witnesses,

155
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,652
Some criminal, some not,
to neighborhoods

156
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,287
All across the country.

157
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,089
Every one of those individuals
shares a unique attribute,

158
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,524
Distinguishing
them from the rest

159
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,259
Of the general population.

160
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:33,496
And that is somebody
wants them dead.

Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

162
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,166
- So.
- So.

163
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,935
So.

00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,203
Oh.

165
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,305
Here we are.

166
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:54,842
Yeah, we're here.

167
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:59,347
You must be Mary. How do you do?

168
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,415
Seth Mann. - Wow.

169
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:02,650
What a pleasure to meet you.

170
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,752
Really looking forward
to working with you,

171
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,387
Talking to you...

172
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,455
About everything.

173
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,790
- Good.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,993
Okay.

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,995
Stan, just want to say thanks

176
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,230
For giving me a desk out
there and letting me squat.

177
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:18,199
They're short of real estate
at the falcon command center.

178
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,867
My pleasure, Seth.

179
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,770
So you want to get us started?

180
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:23,905
Kid, did you put these together?

181
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,173
- Uh, yes, sir.
- All right.

182
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,308
Mug shots ought to be
clipped on the inside

183
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:28,876
And the outside.

184
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,747
Oh, okay. I mean, that matters?

185
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,582
- Here it comes.
- What?

186
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,150
What's your name?

187
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,485
Charlie.

188
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:39,020
Well, Charlie,
if you were one of my boys,

189
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,755
You'd know two words by heart--

190
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:43,024
"everything matters."

191
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:45,927
Okay, great, so guess Mary
and I should get out there.

192
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,962
Well, actually,
I'd like to work with you,

193
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,163
If you don't mind.

194
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,599
Oh, really?

195
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,534
Yeah.

196
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:57,004
I thought-- I don't know.

197
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,940
I thought maybe it'd
be good for both of us.

198
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,176
Yeah. Well, it's Stan's call

199
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:03,978
Whether he wants to
split up Mary and me.

200
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,080
I don't know.
How about the three of us?

201
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,715
Double our caseloads.

202
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:10,251
We could clear this
operation in no time, right?

203
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,553
That's a great idea.

204
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:15,323
Well, be safe.
Bring back some bad guys.

205
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,091
Thanks, Stan. Thanks, Mary.

206
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, you bet.

207
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,496
Okay, what do we got?

208
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:31,906
So you seeing anyone?

209
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:34,709
There are a few prospects.

210
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:36,510
Mary doesn't know about them,

211
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:39,680
Because I try not to
subject people I care about

212
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:41,148
To what I
euphemistically refer to

213
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,985
As her "winning abrasiveness."

214
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,287
Look, Seth,
Marshall's social life

215
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,822
Is a contradiction in terms,

216
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,757
Unless you count putting
a bookstore clerk

217
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,225
In a headlock and telling her

218
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:52,960
About nietzschean themes
in Wagnerian opera.

219
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,395
- She was interested.
- Shh.

220
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,730
There's so much I want to know.

221
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,898
Who was Marshall's
first celebrity crush?

222
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,501
<i>How old was he when he went to his
first star trek convention?</i>

223
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,603
And when did he start
using a curling iron?

224
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,273
Fortunately, you're dealing
with a man of few words.

225
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,575
Uh-huh. Well, give my best
to your wishful thinking.

226
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,243
Okay, here we go.

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,661
Hands in the air,
boys! - Don't move!

228
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,928
Don't move! Don't move!

229
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,463
Turn around slowly.

230
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:33,801
God, that felt good.

231
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,369
What is that?

232
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:38,539
Triumphing over others makes
you feel better about yourself.

233
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,341
And now you have
a brother-in-arms

234
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,576
Who likes the sound of
shackles clamping on flesh

235
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,345
Even more than you, if possible.

236
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,647
Okay, seriously,
what is it with you two?

237
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,516
I mean, other than feeling
completely exposed

238
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,585
In my presence,
which I'm really enjoying--

239
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,154
I mean, you guys
are close, right?

240
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,388
You see each other
every Christmas,

241
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,823
Talk every Sunday?

242
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:58,092
Christmas, we discuss the
best way to brine poultry.

243
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,329
Sunday, it's mom's
latest yarn-based hobby.

244
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:03,931
We assiduously avoid
any topic of substance,

245
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,800
And I get the feeling--

246
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,735
Nah. - What?

247
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,237
He's here to study me.

248
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,238
Study you?

249
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,807
He's retiring this year.

250
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:15,109
This is his last
operation falcon,

251
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:17,311
Maybe his last major manhunt.

252
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,479
So?

253
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,081
Making it his last opportunity

254
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:22,350
To assess my worth
for final judgment.

255
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,385
Final judgment?

256
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,686
You got to lighten up.

257
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,988
You make him sound
like Darth Vader.

258
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,224
Look, don't you think you're
being just a little paranoid?

259
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,492
When I was a kid,

260
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,194
He carried two things
in his briefcase--

261
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,096
My best report
card and my worst.

262
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:36,964
He would remove
them at key moments

263
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:39,100
To illustrate whatever
point was on his mind.

264
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,503
Trust me,
judgment day is coming.

265
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,277
Hey.

266
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,645
Who's here?

267
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:55,383
His name is Scott.

268
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,151
You drinking again?

269
00:12:57,219 --> 00:13:00,221
Wasn't aware a.A.
Gave time off for nerd behavior.

270
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,622
While it's true,

271
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,457
At times this house
severely strains my resolve,

272
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,892
This is for you.

273
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,228
Something tells me
you're gonna need it.

274
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,035
Mary, awesome-- you're home.

275
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:16,804
This is Scott Griffin.

276
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,038
Hi.

277
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:20,608
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

278
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,209
Our brother.

279
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,178
Wow.

280
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,547
You look so much like Lauren.

281
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,082
Even her shoulders-- it's weird.

282
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,283
I know, right? I told you.

283
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,851
Okay, I'm sorry.

284
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,553
What the hell's going on here?

285
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,556
Well, Scott and I got in touch
a few months back and...

286
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:36,690
And?

287
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,259
The $20,000?

288
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,927
I loaned it to Scott.

289
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:44,198
Okay, I've had a long day,
and I'm tired,

290
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,500
And I'm trying to catch
up here and actually care.

291
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,003
But honestly, Brandi,
for somebody who's such a good liar,

292
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,439
You are unbelievably gullible.

293
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,508
I mean, is there anything ever
you don't take at face value?

294
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:56,277
So what about lending
this guy $20,000

295
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:57,645
Puts you in Florida
for six weeks?

296
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,213
And what about
borrowing 20 grand

297
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,848
Puts you in my living room?

298
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,716
- Because Scott needed money-
- help with his business.

299
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,285
I hit a bad patch,

300
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,954
And I was gonna lose
basically everything.

301
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,355
- Oh.
- I work in Miami.

302
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,624
Anyway, Brandi flew out.
She loaned me the money.

303
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,092
She got interested
in the business.

304
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,494
Oh, my God. What business?

305
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,196
- Day trading.
- Perfect.

306
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:16,997
I just sort of helped
out in the office--

307
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,833
Drove some clients around,
but it was really fun.

308
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,034
That sounds really fun.

309
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:21,602
Come here.

310
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:25,272
Jesus.

311
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,774
Honestly...

312
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,943
Are you retarded? -

313
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,078
- You lend a total stranger--
- our brother!

314
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:33,180
- So he says!
- Oh, my God!

315
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,950
$20,000 and then go off the
grid for a month and a half,

316
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:38,385
Dodge my calls,
leave mom hanging, and Peter.

317
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,887
I mean, my God. Why?

318
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:42,156
Because I knew that this is
exactly how you would react.

319
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,791
You'd treat me like
some kind of idiot,

320
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:46,594
Like some failure-in-waiting,
stupid little squish.

321
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,128
That's not true.
Don't put words in--

322
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,396
I'm a good person, Mary!

323
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,832
I'm smart, and you know what?

324
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,300
I didn't just pay Peter back.

325
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,369
I made $10,000--

326
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,471
Me, working for Scott,
my own money, me.

327
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,306
Good. Congrats.
That sounds real legit.

328
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:01,942
and you wonder why I avoid you.

329
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,611
'cause you know what?
You don't trust anybody.

330
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,779
You don't even like anyone.
Okay, so I get it.

331
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,314
So your being a liar,
that's on me now?

332
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:09,149
- Because you're so honest?
- Yeah.

333
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,252
All those letters from dad
that you didn't tell us about?

334
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,820
That is completely different--

335
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:13,988
No! No, it's not!

336
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,890
You wanted dad all to yourself.

337
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,491
And you know what?

338
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,894
Our brother, I wanted him to
be my brother for a second,

339
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,996
Just once, to have
something in this family

340
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:23,397
That was mine before you and mom

341
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,632
Can tell me how
to feel about it.

342
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:25,966
You know what?
I'm happy for you.

343
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,434
Kudos on the fantastic
relationship

344
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:28,969
You've got blossoming here.

345
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,304
You want something just for you?

346
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,705
Take the Scott
side of the family.

347
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:32,973
They're all yours.

348
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,643
Send me a God damn
Christmas card.

349
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,693
So then?

350
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,927
I went to bed,
got up before Brandi,

351
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,062
And came to work.

352
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,463
And Scott?

353
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,932
- Don't know, don't care.
- Really?

354
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,301
Look, if we do
have the same dad,

355
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,136
He's at least half-crazy,
fully troubled,

356
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,838
And I've got plenty of both,
inside and out.

357
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,306
I don't want to think about it.

358
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,808
Liam Sykes...

359
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,243
Wanted for multiple
home invasions

360
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,811
Across three States.

361
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,080
Rolls into town,
pulls together a local crew,

362
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,282
Does enough jobs to
lay low for a while,

363
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,718
Then resurfaces in a new
town when the money runs out.

364
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,220
Last week he assaulted a
cop who pulled him over.

365
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:15,457
Abq p.D. Has a tip from a
confidential informant.

366
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,959
Let's get him.

367
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,561
That's Liam.

368
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,296
And he came here for?

369
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:24,032
Consignment sales.

370
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,200
Really?

371
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,535
Do we have to do
this old chestnut,

372
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:27,802
Where you pretend
you have no idea

373
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,371
What we're talking about,
and we pretend

374
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,172
We're not gonna haul your ass
in if you don't cooperate?

375
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,707
You know what? That sounds good.

376
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:33,975
You have the right
to remain silent.

377
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:35,610
Anything you say--

378
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,445
Guys, dial it down.

379
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,714
As you can see,
June, my partners

380
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,616
Are a bit adrenalized--

381
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,653
Too much red bull and sanka.

382
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,421
Thing is, I can yank
on their leashes

383
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,690
For only so long,
and then I've got to let go.

384
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,392
So...

385
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,560
Liam?

386
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,996
Couldn't tell you where he is.

387
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,531
It would be breaking
a confidence.

388
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,100
Okay.

389
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,203
Amy, tell these nice
people where Liam is.

390
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,005
Um...

391
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:08,376
7400 don Diego street.

392
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,115
We should call sog
and wait for backup.

393
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,517
I'm not gonna risk losing him.

394
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,085
Tactical protocol dictates--

395
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,753
That the team leader make
the call on approach.

396
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,889
- That's an interpretation.
- Which is the point of command.

397
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,290
To quote from the manual--

398
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,959
Okay, when you have to
quote from the manual,

399
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:27,362
It means debate done-
winner, dad.

400
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,531
So, what?

401
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,166
You don't want to
work for me anymore?

402
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,801
Billy says I should--

403
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,603
"Billy says"?

404
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,171
What do you say?

405
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,739
I want out, okay? I just--

406
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,040
No.

407
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,742
Sorry. Not happening.

408
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,043
Come on, Liam.

409
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,445
You can't just keep
me here forever.

410
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,846
Don't move!

411
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,181
Turn around!

412
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,782
Hands on your head!

413
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,317
I got Liam!

414
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,819
- Put your hands on your head!
- Don't move!

415
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:54,289
Don't move!

416
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,091
- Marshall!
- Stop!

417
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,326
Don't move, asshole.

418
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,333
Hey!

419
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,711
Billy?

420
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,580
Billy!

421
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,519
Dad, don't! - What
do you mean, "don't"?

422
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,987
He was--

423
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,722
He's gone!

424
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,658
What's wrong with you?

425
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:18,707
He's all yours.

426
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,241
So...

427
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,077
You guys lost Liam

428
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,978
And the girl? Wow.

429
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:27,215
You guys team up full-time,
this'll be fugitive Disneyland.

430
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,684
Billy Nevins was here.

431
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,853
Billy? "boarding school" Billy?

432
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,388
In a car.

433
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,924
My dad was gonna fire.
I stopped him.

434
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,792
I'm sure he was
aiming for the tires.

435
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,195
I'm sure if I'd let him,
we'd have Billy now,

436
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,163
Which I'm equally
sure I'll be hearing

437
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,199
A lot about in a second.

438
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,567
The kid in the car--

439
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,471
How Long's he been in
Witness Protection?

440
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,773
Son, you and I talk
around a lot of things.

441
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,174
That doesn't make me dumb.

442
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,643
You're a WITSEC inspector.
He was yours.

443
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,212
Now he's mine. - Ours.

444
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,580
And we don't know
what he's done--

445
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,348
And we don't care...

446
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,083
Long as we get him.

447
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,956
How old were you when
you first wondered

448
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:08,923
If you were adopted?

449
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,525
Four.

450
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,894
Did the saliva strip
test at eight.

451
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,730
Sadly...

452
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,936
Anything you want to
tell me about this kid?

453
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,571
There's a lot I can't
till we really know

454
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,939
What's going on.

455
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,575
What I can say is
he was adjusting--

456
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,444
Making friends, good grades.

457
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,579
He was a model witness.

458
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,214
Whatever that means.

459
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,283
Here we go.

460
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,519
Amber.

461
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,521
No last name.

462
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,289
Great.

463
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:42,724
I'll forward this to the office,

464
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,159
Have them try to find an I.
P. Address.

465
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,393
Oh!

466
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:46,728
Smart.

467
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,730
He left his cell phone,

468
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,432
'cause he knows you'd
use it to track him.

469
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,802
Looks like you
trained him well...

470
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,770
For whatever it is he's up to.

471
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,640
Three more fun-filled
days of operation falcon.

472
00:20:58,707 --> 00:20:59,707
Yep.

473
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,178
Tomorrow I'll bring popcorn.

474
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,615
Hello?

475
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,784
Slow down. Slow down.
It's Billy.

476
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,252
Jesus. Tell him to come in.

477
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,154
Give me a second.
Where the hell are you?

478
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:14,255
Did you arrest Amber?

479
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,024
Tell me where you are.

480
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,859
Is she okay?

481
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,327
I'll tell you when I see you.

482
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:20,595
Great.

483
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,631
Oh, yeah, this is gonna go well.

484
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,966
I started all this.

485
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,135
I got to do this myself.
Started what?

486
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,137
Do what? - I think
she's in trouble.

487
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,673
I think it's my fault.

488
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,041
I was just trying to help.

489
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,576
Help Amber?

490
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:35,777
- That your witness?
- I got this.

491
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:37,045
- Give me the phone.
- No.

492
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:38,847
Look, look,
Marshall can talk him in.

493
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:39,948
The phone, now.

494
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,282
- Man, who is that?
- Nobody.

495
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,884
You tell your boy he can come in

496
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,819
Or get dragged in,
dead or alive.

497
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,389
Hello?

498
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:53,328
Dad, that was the
antithesis of helpful.

499
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,163
We'd have him if you
hadn't stopped me.

500
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,965
We'd have all of them if
you followed protocol.

501
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,499
And we can all see
where this is going,

502
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,034
So why don't we hit pause,
pick it up on father's day,

503
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:01,769
And go find the kid?

504
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,271
Come on.

505
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:14,349
Liam...

506
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,483
So good to see you.

507
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,185
Yeah.

508
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,087
You hear anything about
Amber and that Billy kid?

509
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:21,723
They ran off this morning,

510
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,959
Along with my entire take
for the last four months.

511
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,562
Ah, young love--

512
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,931
Nothing makes you
quite as stupid.

513
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,900
If I hear anything,
I'll give you a call.

514
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:35,536
Who else you gonna call?

515
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,238
The cops all of a
sudden know where I live

516
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,742
Right after I start
doing business with you.

517
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:41,943
Coincidence?

518
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,128
Did am say anything

519
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,664
That might illuminate
his motive?

520
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,766
He knew she was
talking to the cops,

521
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,635
But that's not why he was here.

522
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:00,905
He was asking about
Amber and Billy.

523
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:03,041
So you've met Billy?
He's been here?

524
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:06,210
I just heard Amber
talk about him.

525
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:08,613
He's her boyfriend, I guess.

526
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,915
She's-- she was--

527
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,984
She works for Liam?

528
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:14,185
Doing what?

529
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:17,555
Uh, she helps him set up scores.

530
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:19,691
I don't know how exactly.

531
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,693
Something to do
with where s works.

532
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,194
Do you know Amber's last name?

533
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,229
No.

534
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,798
Just to be clear,

535
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,500
Liam said they stole a
bunch of money from him?

536
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:31,235
Both of them? - Both of them.

537
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,670
That's--that's what he said.

538
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:33,871
Uh-huh.

539
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,412
Okay, so the girl
is Amber Whitman.

540
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,348
She's a student at four hills.

541
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:45,216
Hasn't been home or to
her job at the u-move

542
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,551
In two days.

543
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,419
Let me guess-- Ms.
Whitman's got a record?

544
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,488
Possession, shoplifting.

545
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,123
Thanks, Stan. Uh, hey,listen.

546
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:57,028
Feel free not to
mention this to my dad.

547
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:58,429
Oh, yeah.

548
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:00,198
No problem.

549
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:02,300
Thanks.

550
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:05,303
So we talk to classmates,
coworkers,

551
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:06,971
Try to get a line
on where she is,

552
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,373
Hope she can lead us to Billy.

553
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,341
Listen, I like your dad.

554
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:13,211
Call it a soft spot for guys who
don't bail on their families,

555
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:14,912
Rob banks,
and start new families,

556
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,916
But I will admit, to find Amber,
he's got the wrong style.

557
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,252
If by "style,
" you mean all the subtlety

558
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,188
Of an armor-piercing Shell,
then, yes, agreed.

559
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,757
You got to look for
her without him.

560
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,860
If we peel off, then he'll
know we're ditching him,

561
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,461
Which means he'll be hunting us.

562
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,397
And trust me, even as a kid,

563
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:34,832
Hide-and-seek with that man
gave me stomach cramps.

564
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,336
Hey, p.D.'s tagged a
van belonging to Liam.

565
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,238
I could stake it
out with your dad,

566
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:41,472
Tell him you had a
WITSEC emergency.

567
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,408
Good enough?

568
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:44,942
I wish I'd had you
in High School.

569
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,180
High School me would have
eaten High School you alive.

570
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:56,220
So why'd you name
him "Marshall"?

571
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,090
It was his mom's idea.

572
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:02,160
She took one look at
him in the hospital...

573
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:06,130
Those eyes and that face.

574
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:08,633
She knew right away
he was gonna grow up

575
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,869
To be maybe a writer,
a philosopher...

576
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:14,072
Anything but a marshal.

577
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,473
So she named him "Marshall"

578
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,741
In order to try
to seal the deal.

579
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,676
Yeah, 'cause who'd
ever want a job

580
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,778
Where they're marshal Marshall?

581
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:23,614
Little did you know
he'd consider it a perk.

582
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:25,783
Well, that's him.

583
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:28,820
Came into this world
with a mind of his own.

584
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:31,589
Marshall has this crazy idea

585
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,058
You're here to assess him,
judge,

586
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,594
Or even grade him
on what he does.

587
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,729
He's right.

588
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,331
Oh.

589
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,233
Huh.

590
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:45,136
That's very... Parental?

591
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:47,305
Well, look, I don't
claim to get WITSEC.

592
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:49,774
I mean, I spent a few months
working it back in '89.

593
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,110
I never saw anybody
get transformed

594
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,178
Or get in touch with
their true selves

595
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,647
Or any of that crap.

596
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:59,283
And I always worry that this
just isn't right for Marshall,

597
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,854
That what we do...

598
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:05,790
He just isn't built for it.

599
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,859
He's a sensitive kid.
He always was.

600
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:10,294
Which is why he's really
good at what he does.

601
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,730
It's just not the same as-
here we go.

602
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,867
Support team, we're
approaching the vehicle.

603
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,635
Stop right there!

604
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,804
You, down on your knees!

605
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,573
Down on the ground!
On your knees!

606
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,510
Clear!

607
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:28,045
- Where'd you get the van?
- I bought it last week.

608
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:30,081
What's wrong?

609
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,284
This the guy you bought it from?

610
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:47,131
Aren't you a little old
for the kids' park?

611
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,799
Hey. I knew you'd come.

612
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:51,235
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

613
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,905
Yeah, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

614
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:56,507
- Are you stupid? The-
-the police are chasing us.

615
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,676
Liam is after us.
Nothing is fine.

616
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,611
Hey, look, whatever you did,
I know a guy.

617
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:01,779
He can help.

618
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:04,248
He's kind of a cop.

619
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:06,450
This is not just about the cops.

620
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:08,319
Well, I know Liam's mad that
you're gonna maybe quit,

621
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,787
But this guy can help.

622
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:12,023
During the raid, I just--

623
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,426
I kind of grabbed the money.

624
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:18,429
Wait. Liam's money?

625
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,869
He just-- he got so
mad right before,

626
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,471
And he just started
saying things about you,

627
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,340
And I thought if
we had the money,

628
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,743
We could just get out of here,
you know, go someplace.

629
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,312
Oh, amb.

630
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:35,580
- I know.
- Amb.

631
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:38,216
I know it was stupid. I just--

632
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,384
Look, it's done,
okay? Can we just--

633
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,720
Can we just go,
okay? I have the car.

634
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:47,191
Let's just get the money and
get out of here, please.

635
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,427
All right, where is it?

636
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:51,929
The money, Amber, where is it?

637
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:54,031
She was here yesterday.

638
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,734
Said she needed to
hide for a while.

639
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,136
I've never seen anyone
so scared in my life.

640
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:01,672
Did she give any indication
to where she was going?

641
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,708
No.

642
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:07,111
But I did let her borrow my car.

643
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,846
Charlie, hunter
green Toyota Camry--

644
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,781
I just emailed you
the license and Vin.

645
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,417
The car has safety connect,
so call abq p.D.

646
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,287
To get the real-time
tracking on its location.

647
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,891
What are we looking for,
a green Toyota Camry?

648
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,193
Yeah.

649
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,061
Where's my dad now?

650
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:26,097
He's getting the report
on the van Liam sold.

651
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,132
He thinks I clocked out,
and you're still with a witness.

652
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
I owe you forever.

653
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,968
Good.

654
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:33,271
He is here to judge you,
by the way.

655
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,640
And to his credit, he was
completely up front about it,

656
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:39,944
But he is a full-body, soul,
and brain scan with a gun.

657
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,012
Well put.

658
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,047
That's the one.

659
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,190
Amber?

660
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:54,558
Don't be afraid.

661
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:57,161
I'm a friend of Billy's.
I need to talk to you.

662
00:28:57,229 --> 00:29:01,132
Can you come out for a second?

663
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,502
I just want to talk.

664
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:06,137
Hey, you guys were at the house.

665
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,471
Do you know where Billy is?

666
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,506
Amber Whitman,
you're under arrest.

667
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,074
Seth, Seth, we got it.

668
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:12,243
Put your hands behind your back.

669
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:13,944
Seth!

670
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,646
Son, did you really think
you could put out a search

671
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,448
For a car, and I
wouldn't know about it?

672
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:18,916
I just need to ask
her a few questions.

673
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,685
Me too. Playtime's over.

674
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:21,819
I'm taking her downtown.

675
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,254
Come on.

676
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:37,443
I know Billy was
there at Liam's.

677
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:41,781
I know about the money you took.

678
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,050
Where is Billy...

679
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,119
And where is that money?

680
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,554
He could at least try
to relate to her.

681
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,824
Trust me, that's him trying.

682
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:55,228
Okay, let's talk about the fence,
June rorchek.

683
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,329
She's dead.

684
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:59,666
Your buddy Liam
looks good for it.

685
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,968
You know where he is?

686
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,106
Young lady, this is now
a murder investigation,

687
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,541
And you are an accomplice.

688
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,710
Just how much jail
time do you want to do?

689
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:12,845
Because every minute of silence

690
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,882
Piles on the time!

691
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:18,451
I want you to think about that.

692
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,900
she'll talk.

693
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,702
No, dad, she won't.

694
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,204
Yeah, a few hours more,
and she'll break.

695
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,839
"break"? She's not a terrorist.

696
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,974
She's a teenager.
She's not scared of you.

697
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,843
She hates you, because
you're not talking to her.

698
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,178
You're threatening her.

699
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,646
So unless you're willing
to pull out pliers

700
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,281
And a blowtorch,
she's not telling you anything.

701
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,782
Oh, so get her a frappuccino

702
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,150
<i>And a copy of one of those
twilight books.</i>

703
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,452
You two can brush
each other's hair.

704
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,354
Sir...

705
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,923
With all due respect,
you're just wrong.

706
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,424
Let Marshall do this.

707
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:07,900
Amber, Billy is out there

708
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:10,136
Because of you.

709
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:13,773
He told me that.

710
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,942
He wants to...

711
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,746
Fix something with you and Liam.

712
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,581
Trust me...

713
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:25,718
If he does that,
it will get him killed.

714
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,426
All I want to do

715
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:36,896
Is find Billy and get him safe.

716
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:38,231
But to do that,

717
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:41,567
I need to know more
about Liam and you.

718
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:57,383
Liam, uh, came into
u-move one day.

719
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:00,987
He said he could
tell I was smart,

720
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,855
Said I could make some money

721
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,792
And get out of my dad's house.

722
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,828
So what'd you do for Liam?

723
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:12,331
He just wanted me to,
uh, tell him

724
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,867
Which moving vans had the
highest insurance rates,

725
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,203
Which people had the best stuff,

726
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:18,971
You know, just who
was new to town--

727
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,606
That sort of thing.

728
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:22,608
Then what?

729
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:28,448
Then I met Billy.

730
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:32,452
Billy's...

731
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,353
Not like anyone else.

732
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,892
He told me I had to quit.

733
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,262
And he kept on me about it,

734
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,932
But he was gentle,

735
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:49,502
Not, like, all judgmental and--

736
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,906
Just telling me that it
was gonna be bad for me.

737
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,341
And I fought him on it.

738
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:58,544
I said, "who cares, you know,
if I work for Liam?

739
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:01,447
And none of it matters.
It's all pointless anyway."

740
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:07,553
Then Billy goes...

741
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,522
"everything matters."

742
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,726
You know, like,
everything adds up.

743
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:17,630
Little, big-- it all counts.

744
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:20,933
He really believes that.

745
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,735
Made me believe it.

746
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,403
So I...

747
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:27,073
I called Billy,
told him I was out.

748
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,409
And he came to pick me up.

749
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:34,413
And that's when you
guys showed up.

750
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:37,350
Do you know where Billy is now?

751
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,087
I gave him the keys
to the u-move office

752
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,890
To get the money
out of my locker.

753
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,427
Not bad. So now what?

754
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,096
We know Billy's
headed for the money.

755
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:52,999
Let's make sure Liam's not.

756
00:33:58,238 --> 00:34:00,439
Yeah?

757
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:03,075
Hi, Liam. It's Amber.

758
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,344
Look, uh, I'm sorry
I took the money.

759
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,746
It was stupid.

760
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:08,180
I guess I ju- I just got scared.

761
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:09,849
All right, take it easy.

762
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,684
Tell me where it is.

763
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,419
Well, I've still got it.

764
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,955
I can meet you at the
bowling alley on central

765
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:17,356
In 15 minutes.

766
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,425
Okay.

767
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,595
15 minutes.

768
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,933
I'll take the sog team
to the bowling alley.

769
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,268
You cover the moving place.
Wait for the boy.

770
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:32,572
Yeah?

771
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,874
Liam, it's Billy.

772
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,743
I get the money.

773
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:39,312
Really?

774
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,448
Okay, so where are you?

775
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,816
U-move.

776
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:46,085
Amber with you?

777
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:47,920
No.

778
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,689
And I'll only give you the money

779
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,157
If you swear you'll
leave us alone.

780
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,960
Take your money.
Stay out of our lives.

781
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,329
Cross my heart and everything.

782
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:57,997
See you soon.

783
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:18,551
You check the office.
I'll go out back.

784
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,252
Look, you got your money.

785
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,820
She's done, okay?

786
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,122
I'm not telling
you where she is.

787
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,090
Oh, I think you're
gonna tell me, Billy.

788
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,725
Drop your weapon now!

789
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,127
Aah!

790
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,502
I need an ambulance.

791
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,237
Liam went that way!

792
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,573
I'm on second and Woodward.
You're gonna be all right.

793
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,142
Who's got the trace
on Liam's cell?

794
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,912
Still near central,
still not moving.

795
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,781
Stay here.

796
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:37,896
Face down.

797
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,399
One way or the other.

798
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,226
How you feeling?

799
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:10,996
Uh, not too bad.

800
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,498
They say it'll leave
a pretty gnarly scar.

801
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:16,568
What the hell were you thinking?

802
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:18,470
She needed help.

803
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:21,240
Well, next time you decide
to help a criminal, don't.

804
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,776
This is far from okay

805
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:25,844
And far from over.

806
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,379
But in the meantime,

807
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:30,182
You have a visitor.

808
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,383
Hey.

809
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:32,751
Oh, my God. - Are you okay?

810
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:33,919
Yeah.

811
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,121
Oh.

812
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:37,790
- Yeah, you okay?
- Yes.

813
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:39,024
- Yeah?
- Yes.

814
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,025
No, it's okay.

815
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,333
hey.

816
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,434
Hey.

817
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,003
With all the hullabaloo,

818
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,604
I forgot to acknowledge the fact

819
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:55,574
That you probably
saved my dad's life.

820
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,543
Come on...

821
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,546
We both know he could have
caught that bullet in his teeth.

822
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,081
How does a guy like
that have a son

823
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,615
Who says "hullabaloo," anyway?

824
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:07,386
I feel like as much as
my father annoys, judges,

825
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,222
And generally fails to get me...

826
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,458
He's here.

827
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,227
So...

828
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:18,664
Go.

829
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:33,645
Hey, dad.

830
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,814
Hey.

831
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:37,716
What you doing?

832
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:42,121
Ah, just going over a few
things in my briefcase--

833
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:46,592
Lucky tokens I
carry on the road.

834
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,728
Is this the failure
report card or the...?

835
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,277
When did you start
carrying this around?

836
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,447
The day you gave it to me.

837
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,350
That and a few snapshots
of you and your mom,

838
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,986
Your brothers.

839
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:16,989
But that...

840
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:19,792
Is the only piece of art I own.

841
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,262
I, um...

842
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,033
Worried about you growing up.

843
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,602
It's a rough world.

844
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,739
You're not a rough guy.

845
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:39,311
But I think maybe
that's a good thing...

846
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,714
A real good thing.

847
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:57,896
- Thanks for coming over.
- No sweat.

848
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,969
Hi. - Hi.

849
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,608
So I looked you up.

850
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,210
You're a licensed broker...
That I am.

851
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:12,377
With a record.

852
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,680
Three arrests,
one suspended sentence--

853
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:16,949
Illegal gambling, bookmaking.
Did you know that?

854
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:19,551
We've pretty much told each
other everything, so...

855
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,189
If it makes any difference...

856
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,091
It's my two-year chip--

857
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,927
Gambler's anonymous.

858
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:29,995
Shannon blood.

859
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,064
Or griffin-- same thing.

860
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:35,834
Anyway, now I just
bet on the market.

861
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:38,470
Do you know where our father is?

862
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:40,038
No.

863
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,074
He just walked out one day.

864
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:46,512
I'll say this,
the man's consistent.

865
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,046
So you haven't been in touch?

866
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,615
Are you kidding me? Like,
I wouldn't--

867
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:51,884
I'm asking him.

868
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,386
Our father's a wanted fugitive.

869
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,088
If you're in touch with him,
either of you,

870
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:57,589
And I find out--

871
00:40:57,657 --> 00:40:59,157
Mary, that's not
what this is about.

872
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:00,893
Then what is it,
okay? 'cause money can be wired.

873
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,296
So again, I got to ask...

874
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:05,931
Why are you in my living room?

875
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:12,738
I feel like he's just...

876
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:15,908
He's my Er, you know,
and all of a sudden...

877
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:21,847
He's not the man
I thought he was.

878
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,855
Brandi told me he
wrote you letters.

879
00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:33,258
Those are private.

880
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,028
Well, then anything,
his life before--

881
00:41:36,095 --> 00:41:37,563
Can you tell me
anything about him?

882
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:42,401
'cause I'm happy to tell
you anything you want.

883
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:45,437
Please.

884
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,477
For most kids, the scariest
thing you can hear

885
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,446
is "wait till your
father gets home."

886
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:59,198
For some there's no fear
of that or hope for it.

887
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:01,683
I'm still waiting.
Not like a puppy

888
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,650
head tilting at footfalls on the porch

889
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,950
or a key in the lock

890
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,700
I go about my days

891
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,698
every so often aware of his absence.

892
00:42:08,788 --> 00:42:10,835
and telling myself that the heart,

893
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,288
old adage aside, does not grow fonder

894
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,590
except, it does.

895
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:16,531
It really, really does.

896
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:19,467
