1
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,204
TARS: Mars,

2
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:38,949
so you name it,
and think that you know it.

3
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:41,124
The Red Planet.

4
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,136
No air, no life.

5
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:48,576
But you do not know Mars,
for its true name is Barsoom.

6
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,170
And it is not airless, nor is it dead,

7
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,385
but it is dying.

8
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,683
The city of Zodanga saw to that.

9
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:05,318
Zodanga, the predator city,

10
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,905
moving, devouring,

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,081
draining Barsoom of energy and life.

12
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:17,924
Only the great city of Helium
dared resist, stood strong,

13
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:20,263
matched Zodanga airship for airship,

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,632
holding fast for a thousand years.

15
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,559
Until one day the ruler of Zodanga

16
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:29,863
became cornered in a sandstorm.

17
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:33,183
And everything changed.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,171
(Explosion)

19
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,384

00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,601
Get up.

34
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,728
Who... What are you?

35
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:32,682
We serve the Goddess.

36
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,027
And she has chosen you
to receive this weapon.

37
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,738
Do as we command
and you will rule all of Barsoom.

38
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,090
With none to defy you.

39
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,973
And nothing to stand in your way.

(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

- Ma'am.

42
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,153
Ten words a minimum.

43
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,041
That's 50 cents,
unless you want special delivery.

44
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,642
Special delivery it is.

45
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,568
Name of sender?

46
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,325
Carter.

47
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,118
John Carter.

48
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,361
CONDUCTOR: Croton-on-Hudson!

49
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:38,920
Mr. Burroughs? I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.

50
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:43,460
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.

51
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:01,856
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton,
your uncle's attorney.

52
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,234
My deepest sympathies.

53
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,663
His death came as a shock to all of us.

54
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,176
He was a model of health and vigor.

55
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,874
He just dropped dead in his study

56
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:15,557
not five minutes after sending
word for me and the doctor.

57
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,921
When I arrived he was already gone.

58
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,839
The man never stopped digging.

59
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,662
All over the world.

60
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:35,370
No soon he started digging one hole
than he was off to Java

61
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:37,801
or the Orkney Islands to dig another.

62
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,193
He said it was pure research,

63
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:44,521
but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

64
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,474
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

65
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,064
Every inch a cavalry man,
to the very end.

66
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:08,576
Mother always said that Jack
never really came back from the war.

67
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,587
That it was only his body
that went west.

68
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:18,250
He used to tell me
the most wondrous stories.

69
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,283
I'd like to pay my respects.

70
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,113
DALTON: You won't find a keyhole.

71
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,640
Thing only opens from the inside.

72
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,339
He insisted.

73
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:37,158
No embalming,
an open coffin, no funeral.

74
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,414
You don't acquire the kind of
wealth your uncle commanded

75
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,499
by being like the rest of us.

76
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:45,121
Come. Let's go inside.

77
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,962
"And lastly, I hereby direct

82
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,185
"In full."

83
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:29,634
Of course I always adored him,
but it's been so long.

84
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,939
Why me?

85
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:35,391
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

86
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,315
It was his private journal.

87
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:44,201
He was most explicit that you,

88
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,081
and only you, would read its contents.

89
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,789
Now, you might possibly find
some kind of explanation in here.

90
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,272
I'll leave you now.

91
00:08:55,391 --> 00:09:00,421
Again, my condolences.

92
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,364
JOHN: My dear Edgar,

93
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,406
I remember how
I used to take you on my knee

94
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,044
and tell you wild tales,

95
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,863
which you always
did me the great courtesy of believing.

96
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,936
Now you are grown.

97
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,601
Time and space have parted us,

98
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,681
but I reach out across that distance

99
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,248
to that same wide-eyed boy

100
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,330
and ask him to believe me once more.

101
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:51,073
This wild tale begins 13 years ago

102
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,804
in the Arizona Territory

103
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,459
between the PinaleÃ±o Mountains

104
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,253
and the backside of hell.

106
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,009
Ah.

107

(MAN LAUGHS)

109
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,627
No more, Carter.

110
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,701
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?

111
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,608
- Yes, you're a goddamn loon!
-(LAUGHTER)

112
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,270
I done took all your money, Carter.

113
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,038
Your tab's $100 in arrears.

114
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,316
I'll pay.

115
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:41,090
This old Yavapai I met
said he'd seen a cave...

116
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,089
No. Stop! Not one more word
about your cave of gold.

00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,096
It's the evil spider cave of gold.
(LAUGHS)

120
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,545
You're cutoff, Carter.

121
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,920
Now get on home.

122
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,655
MAN 1: Now, I do believe

123
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:06,153
he done told you to get on out of here.

124
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:09,412
I'll leave when these bags are full.

125
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,745
I found that two days ago up by Bonita.

126
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,318
That ought to cover my tab
and then some.

127
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,111
Beans.

128
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:34,503
The first item is beans.

129

00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,082
I suggest you come peaceably.

141
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,899
Excellent horseman.

142
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,944
Fine swordsman.

143
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:28,294
Decorated six times,
including the Southern Cross of Honor.

144
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:33,985
At Five Forks, the company under
your command nearly turned the tide.

145
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,253
(GRUNTS)

146
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,768
In short, a born fighter.

147
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,360
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam,

148
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,635
a necessary man for the defense
of the Arizona Territory.

149
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,967
No.

150
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,717
Son, we are up to
our chinstraps in Apaches.

151
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:52,833
Ain't my concern.

152
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,360
I believe it is your concern, Captain.

153
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:58,084
Folks are being attacked
in their own homes. Slain.

154
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,936
You started it. You finish it.

155
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,487
You've gone native, have you?

156
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,560
Apaches can go to hell, too.

157
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:10,176
We're nothing but a warring species,
and I want no part of it.

158
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,493
You're a cavalry man.

159
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,344
That makes you valuable
to our country and our cause.

160
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:17,704
Colonel Powell, sir,

161
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:20,584
whatever it is you suppose I owe you,

162
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:24,325
our country or any other beloved cause,

163
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,434
I have already paid.

164
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,781
I have paid in full, sir.

165
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,744
So let me tell you what I will do.

166
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:42,278

I am Dejah Thoris,

- Your share of the spoils.

Sola! Tend to Virginia's property.

513
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,039
Yes, my Jeddak!

514
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,084
You know once Sab Than
has conquered us,

515
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,005
he will turn his weapon upon you!

516

I know that Zodanga
has found a way to defeat you

517
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,926
and now you seek
a mighty weapon of your own.

518
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,190
But Virginia fights for us!

519

I don't fight for anyone.

525
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:08,320
Virginia, reject this honor

526
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:12,101

531

War is a shameful thing.

532

Not when a noble cause is taken up
by those who can make a difference.

533
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:18,335
You made a difference today, Virginia.

534
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,637
Okay.

535
00:48:21,757 --> 00:48:24,289
See, my name is John Carter.

536
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,236
Virginia is where I'm from.

537
00:48:27,677 --> 00:48:29,761
Where did you learn to jump that way?

538
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:31,620
I don't know.

539
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,476
How'd you learn to fly?

540
00:48:34,108 --> 00:48:38,014
Your ships cannot sail
on light in Virginia?

541
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:39,816
No, Professor.

542
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,241
See, our ships sail the seas.

543
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:47,142
Endless water everywhere.

What are you doing?

546
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,687
Must be the density of your bones.

547
00:48:59,484 --> 00:49:01,765
- Jump for me.
- SOLA: Enough!

548

There will be time for playfulness later.

549
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:06,051
I want no playfulness from him.

550
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,329
I want his help.

551
00:49:08,124 --> 00:49:09,794
Explain to me how you do it.

552
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,726

about the time of oceans.

- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.

Don't call me that.

561
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:38,628
There are no seas on the planet.

562
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,234

So, now home is Jasoom

No. Not like that.

- Yes.

No, she is Issus.

You must hurry. I mean to release you.

674
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:54,887
I make one condition.

675
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,214
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

676
00:55:58,364 --> 00:55:59,488
My Jeddak.

677
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,555
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess

678
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:05,350
than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

679
00:56:06,268 --> 00:56:08,134
Where you go, she goes.

680
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,787
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?

681
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:13,149
Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

682
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:19,783
Is it done, my Jeddak?

683
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:25,767
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

684
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:30,401
JOHN: Woola!

685
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:31,909
You belong to him.

686
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:34,407
Woola would follow you
anywhere on Barsoom.

687
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:37,374

688
00:56:51,548 --> 00:56:53,414

689
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:55,527
DEJAH: Zodanga happened.

690
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:43,527
Sailing on light.

691
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:47,751
Still playing the madman?

692
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,132
Or the liar.

693
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,781

694
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:16,411
SAB THAN: Why pursue this wedding
any longer? I've already won.

695
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:19,293
Not yet. You must aim past the horizon,
Sab Than.

696
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:23,253
To truly demoralize a nation requires a
public spectacle on the grandest scale.

697
00:58:23,254 --> 00:58:26,363
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

698

If you insist.

699

If you cannot see the wisdom in that,
then we will find another who can.

00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:51,295
Carter!

702
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,606
I do not think she leads us to the Iss.

703
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,735
All right, then, Sola.

704
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,815
Just play along.

What do you think I'd do
once I saw your city and not some river?

707
00:59:09,372 --> 00:59:11,223
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.

708
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,403
They should be at our backs by now.

709
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:15,620
You lead us toward Helium!

710
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,571
Once we reach there,

711
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:24,027
you would see for yourself
the virtue of our cause.

718
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:40,286
You can't!

719
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:41,950
I like this plan better.

720
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:43,516
Just wait.

721
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:44,997
She'll come around.

722
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:46,951
You mad fool!

723
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,497
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!

724
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:53,648
I only told you what you wanted to hear
so you'd get us out!

725
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,147
Stop!

726
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,482
I can't!

727
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,503
I cannot marry him!

728
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:03,586
Can't marry who?

729
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,023
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

730
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:10,015
Sab Than.

731
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,691
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

732
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,317
Your father?

733
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:17,692
Tardos Mors.

734
01:00:17,844 --> 01:00:20,823
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

735
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,993
A princess of Mars.

736
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:26,463
How about that?

737
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:31,127
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

738
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:32,989
No.

739
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:35,192
Is that all there is to the story?

740
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,394
No, I didn't run away!

741
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:41,495
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

742
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:43,832
So marry the guy and save your people.

743
01:00:43,957 --> 01:00:46,587
A life of oppression!
That's not living! (GASPS)

744
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:58,014
If you had the means to save others,

745
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:01,014
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

746
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:04,287
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

747
01:01:06,644 --> 01:01:09,022
I would lay down my life for Helium.

748
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:15,703
Yes, I ran away.

749
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,655
I was afraid,

750
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:20,796
weak.

751
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,439
Maybe I should have married.

752
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:32,984
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

753
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:39,996
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

754
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:43,453
there are no Gates of Iss.

755
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:45,626
They are not real.

756
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:54,687
I'm sorry, Princess.

757
01:01:57,908 --> 01:02:00,254
But this, this is real.

758
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:06,111

No.

761
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:23,071
I go alone, General.

762
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,846
But, Jeddak...

763
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,854
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

764
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,968
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

765
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:35,582
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

This glyph here,

840
01:09:31,522 --> 01:09:35,243
it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy,

841
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:38,660
sent along these lines here,
between the worlds.

842
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:39,889

843

844
01:09:42,626 --> 01:09:44,644
You're saying I was telegraphed here.

845

I'm a copy of myself.

here the command for travel.

I don't like guessing.

01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:01,602
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

849
01:10:02,817 --> 01:10:04,171
Right.

850
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:06,157
And where might we find those?

851
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,837
In the Hall of Science.

852
01:10:11,554 --> 01:10:13,453
And where's that?

853
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:15,564
Helium.

854
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:19,465
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

855
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:20,967
What do you take me for?

856
01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:23,241
I take you for a man who's lost.

how to work this thing!

I will!

859
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:30,063
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

860
01:10:30,082 --> 01:10:32,581
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

868
01:10:57,634 --> 01:11:01,126
I felt the heart of a man
willing to lay down his life for others,

869
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:05,927
a man willing to fight for a cause.

Don't you see, Carter?

873
01:11:38,306 --> 01:11:40,205
I fled to find another way.

- Who are you, sir?

1022
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,765
"Sir." Definitely the South.

1023

1028

Sorry, sir. The streets are blocked.

1029

Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?

1075

History will follow
the course we have set, Earthman.

1076

And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.

1077

must remain in the hands

1079

And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

1080
01:27:28,424 --> 01:27:33,856
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

1081
01:27:33,857 --> 01:27:36,967
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

1082

We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

1083

We simply manage it,

01:49:56,447 --> 01:49:59,241
that you left a light burning

1335
01:50:01,536 --> 01:50:03,554
or a door open.

1336
01:50:09,087 --> 01:50:11,041
Go back to bed.

1337
01:50:11,455 --> 01:50:13,474
I won't be long.

1338
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:23,135
Be back in one xat,

1339
01:50:23,647 --> 01:50:25,633
John Carter of Earth.

1340
01:50:40,895 --> 01:50:42,794
Come.

1341
01:51:12,032 --> 01:51:13,931
John Carter of Earth.

1342
01:51:27,103 --> 01:51:28,260
Yup.

1343
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:33,922
John Carter of Mars
sounds much better.

1344
01:51:39,167 --> 01:51:42,593
Sire, I must express the deepest
of gratitude for saving Helium.

1345
01:51:42,687 --> 01:51:44,554
Please. The honor is mine.

1346
01:51:44,672 --> 01:51:46,788
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.

(GROANING AND PANTING)

1350
01:52:08,383 --> 01:52:10,337
No, no.

1351
01:52:12,767 --> 01:52:14,502
No.

1352
01:52:14,847 --> 01:52:16,069
Powell?

1353
01:52:25,023 --> 01:52:26,030
No!

1354
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:30,785

Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

1357
01:52:53,536 --> 01:52:56,198
Bars... Barsoom.

1358
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:05,284
50 million miles apart
and no way to bridge the gap.

1359
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:08,648
No way to return my body
and my soul to their true home.

1360
01:53:09,567 --> 01:53:12,262
Like a fool,
I had thrown away my medallion.

1361
01:53:14,943 --> 01:53:16,863
Then I recalled Matai Shang.

1362
01:53:17,023 --> 01:53:19,402
His knowledge of Earth, of my history.

1363
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:21,779
It meant Therns
were a presence on this world.

1364
01:53:21,984 --> 01:53:23,718
The cave in Arizona was proof

1365
01:53:23,719 --> 01:53:27,454
There might be other such proofs,
other Thern way stations

1366
01:53:27,455 --> 01:53:29,190
hidden all around the world.

1367
01:53:29,312 --> 01:53:32,422
I knew now what the cave
of gold must be used for.

1368
01:53:32,703 --> 01:53:35,365
So for ten bitter years, I searched.

1369
01:53:35,551 --> 01:53:37,156
On the trail of rumor and legend

1370
01:53:37,247 --> 01:53:40,106
I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns,

1371
01:53:40,191 --> 01:53:41,991
but I found no medallion.

1372
01:53:44,095 --> 01:53:46,954
And then it came to me.

1373
01:53:51,615 --> 01:53:54,179
MAN: (SHOUTS AND
WHOOPS EXCITEDLY) I've got it!

1374
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:56,804
I've found it!

1375
01:53:56,895 --> 01:53:59,209
(EXCITED CHATTER)

1376
01:54:02,604 --> 01:54:06,974
JOHN: And once it came,
there were many plans

1377
01:54:06,975 --> 01:54:08,775
I had to make in secret.

1378
01:54:08,863 --> 01:54:10,849
I could trust no one else.

1379
01:54:11,263 --> 01:54:15,366
I had long suspected that the Therns
were following my movements.

1380
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:23,722
Sir.

1381
01:54:23,839 --> 01:54:25,923
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.

1382
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,955
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:54:30,111 --> 01:54:32,010
And, Thompson...

1384
01:54:33,023 --> 01:54:34,856
My attorney as well.

1385
01:54:36,575 --> 01:54:38,080
Of course, sir.

1386
01:54:43,903 --> 01:54:46,762
Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.

1387
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:55,078
The reason
for my bizarre funeral instructions.

1388
01:54:58,495 --> 01:55:01,986
Why the door can only be opened
from the inside.

1389
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:08,448
For if my body dies on Earth,
then my copy dies on Mars.

1390
01:55:10,623 --> 01:55:11,812
You are the key.

1391
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:15,013
This is the task I entrust to you
along with all my fortune.

1392
01:55:15,103 --> 01:55:18,213
Protect my body.
The Therns will attempt to destroy it.

1393
01:55:18,214 --> 01:55:20,414
In the time it has taken you
to read these pages,

1394
01:55:20,415 --> 01:55:22,369
they may have already done so.

(PANTING)

1396
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:32,159
I am the key. I am the key.

1397
01:55:32,255 --> 01:55:34,274
I, Edgar.

1398
01:55:36,031 --> 01:55:37,951

01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:39,999
E...D...

Ed!

1401
01:55:41,503 --> 01:55:43,335
It should work!

1402
01:55:53,343 --> 01:55:55,013
Dear Ned.

1403
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:58,911
You sneaky devil!

1404
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:02,367
You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!

01:56:39,391 --> 01:56:41,258
You never found the medallion.

1410
01:56:41,343 --> 01:56:42,532
No.

1411
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:46,817
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

1412
01:56:48,383 --> 01:56:51,689
I... I was just bait?

1413
01:56:51,903 --> 01:56:55,046
No. You're far more than that.

1414
01:56:55,423 --> 01:56:57,409
I really do need a protector.

1415
01:56:59,391 --> 01:57:01,443
That is, if you're willing.

1416
01:57:09,855 --> 01:57:11,176
Goodbye, Ned.

1417
01:57:15,583 --> 01:57:17,569
Oh,and, Ned...

1418
01:57:18,623 --> 01:57:20,129
Take up a cause.

1419
01:57:20,222 --> 01:57:22,089
Fall in love.

1420
01:57:22,175 --> 01:57:23,681
Write a book.

1421
01:57:25,663 --> 01:57:27,583
It's time I went home.
