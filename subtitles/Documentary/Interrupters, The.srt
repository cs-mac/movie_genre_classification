NEWS ANCHORS:
A man was murdered overnight
on Chicago's South Side.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,137
Police say it happened
execution style in the ...

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,722
It was a violent night
in Chicago.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,017
Nine people were shot in just
five hours, one person died.

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,894
The victims were all men...

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,313
124 people have been killed
so far this year, one per day--

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,316
about the number of Americans
killed during the same period

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,528
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:32,490
There are three bullet holes
in his home fired by...

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,951
Gregory Robinson is the 28th
Chicago public school student

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,954
killed this school year...

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,330
...died last Friday,
shot in the back

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,000
as he tried to shield
two young children...

14
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:46,337
Sadly, in another sign
of the times,

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,173
members of CeaseFire were also
at today's memorial service,

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,137
hoping to stop any thoughts of
retaliation for Greg's murder.

17
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,638
MAN:
Twelve- and 13-year-olds
are walking around

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,349
with bulletproof vests
on up under their clothes.

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,861
CONGREGATION:
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

20
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,281
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

21
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,032
and lead us not
into temptation...

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,905
All right, let's close up.

23
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,908
Everybody that's in the meeting,
this is serious now, okay?

24
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,786
We're in a crisis mode,
and we need people

25
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,413
to step up this table
and go over and beyond.

26
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,832
Guys are getting killed
for just anything.

27
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,418
Have there been any conflicts
mediated on the front end?

28
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,671
From last week to this week?

29
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,632
MAN:
Two guys was arguing.

30
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,884
One guy threatened to blow
the other guy's wig back.

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,429
I got him to calm down,
tell him he didn't shoot you,

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,931
he was just talking.

33
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,432
We stopped that one
on the front end.

34
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,435
TIO HARDIMAN:
I have the dirty dozen
at the table.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,062
We've always had
outreach workers,

36
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,647
but the violence was not
necessarily going down

37
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,898
at that point.

38
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,025
So in the year 2004,

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,444
we began a new concept called
the violence interrupters.

40
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,321
Most of the violence
interrupters

41
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,449
come from the hierarchy
in some of these gangs.

42
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,034
Because can't no anybody come in

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,078
and tell a guy
to put his gun down.

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,460
HARDIMAN:
The violence interrupters
have one goal in mind:

45
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,545
to stop killings.

46
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,381
They're not trying
to dismantle gangs.

47
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,132
What they're trying to do
is save a life.

48
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,175
MAN:
I might get shot.

49
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,240
Ice cold.

50
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,750
After what happened a week and a
half ago, nobody's been changed.

51
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,085
Nobody's come
through shooting.

52
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,878
MAN:
Ameena.

53
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,421
What happened?

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,972
By the time we got out there,
the fight had just ended.

55
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,974
MAN:
The cops pulled up
and pulled off.

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,517
Y'all missed that shit.

57
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,560
The cops pulled up
and they left.

58
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,561
They're scared.

59
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,187
They're scared of the community.

60
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:55,276
MATTHEWS:
One group of guys said
the young man threatened

61
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,529
that he had a gun,
and that he was gonna kill him.

62
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,323
So he started fighting

63
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,575
and ended up getting
his teeth knocked out.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,453
MAN:
He needs to go
to a doctor.

65
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,163
So you want to go
to the emergency room?

66
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,540
Let's take him,
come on.

67
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,375
MATTHEWS:
Cobe got him off location.

68
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,878
And I asked Cobe to take him
to the hospital.

69
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,464
(crying) :
These bitch-ass niggas...

70
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,549
I'm gonna pop when I see 'em.

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,012
MATTHEWS:
The block got quiet,
and I'm looking down the street,

72
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,806
and here comes the sisters
of the guy

73
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,141
that got his tooth knocked out.

74
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,645
They came to defend
their brother's honor.

75
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,189
With a butcher knife.

76
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,359
(shouting)

77
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,490
MATTHEWS:
The sister calls one of the guys
a bitch ass, punk ass.

78
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,658
The little four-
and five-year-old baby

79
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,368
was doing the same thing.

80
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,495
I'm a knock
your bitch ass out.

81
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,456
Run up, then.

82
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,416
You going to
never knock me out!

83
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,585
(yelling)

84
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,757
You respecting yourself.

85
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,133
She ain't respecting herself.

86
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,013
But still.

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,266
MATTHEWS:
The story about sticks
and stones may break your bones

88
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,977
but words can never hurt you?

89
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,603
Words'll get you killed.

90
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:19,610
All of the sudden, the sister
ran up with a piece of concrete.

91
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,614
(shouting)

92
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,912
One of the girls was about
to stab one of the guys.

93
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,255
Her cousin picked up
the butcher knife.

94
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,594
(yelling)

95
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,269
MATTHEWS:
Dee, who's in the heat
of the moment,

96
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,646
that adrenaline was still going,
that, "I'm gonna fuck them up.

97
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,481
I'm gonna get them back."

98
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,524
MAN:
She just hit
my man with a rock.

99
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,609
83rd and Wolcott.

100
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,861
MATTHEWS:
I picked up Dee.

101
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,446
I said you need to get off
the block for a minute.

102
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,281
He was out of line.

103
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,574
He was out of pocket.

104
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,825
He was very disrespectful.

105
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,453
And I know how many people
I got out here

106
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,954
that are willing
to take care of business.

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,666
We fittin' to do this
and all this and that.

108
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,210
MATTHEWS:
His family kept calling him.

109
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,628
You know, what's
taking you so long

110
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,256
so we can come back over there
and set that block off.

111
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,050
'Cause if his family
would have came to get him...

112
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,469
maybe it would have been
a death behind it.

113
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,972
I know you got some
damn fools for family.

114
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,098
About you.

115
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,725
DEE:
And... and they
ready over here.

116
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,685
Because I know
you just come home.

117
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,103
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

118
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,397
You ain't going no problem
in going back.

119
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,691
I saw that you, wasn't,
you know, you was walking away,

120
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,526
to defend you
and your family.

121
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,737
But, and I really, man...

122
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,697
Man, I thank you.

123
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,449
I mean, for real.

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,701
For real, that's what gangster
is about right there.

125
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,702
I... I definitely
don't want to go back.

126
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,537
Wasn't that gangster?

127
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,710
Didn't them girls square
up like Joe Frazier?

128
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,128
Shoot.

129
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,298
MATTHEWS:
I took him over
to his cousin's house.

130
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,426
We were talking about
how he got hit.

131
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,720
And he tumbled over.

132
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,180
Like a cartoon character.

133
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,973
Woo!

134
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,186
So if you get them
to laugh at themselves,

135
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,772
give them a moment to pause,

136
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,318
and think about really
how crazy and funny that it was,

137
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,737
find that soft spot
in that person.

138
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,282
Not weak, but soft spot.

139
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,743
And you just ride on that.

140
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,329
HARDIMAN:
Ameena Matthews as
a violence interrupter,

141
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,456
she's the golden girl.

142
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,042
She gets in where a lot of guys
can't get in.

143
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,752
She knows how to talk
to these high-risk young men.

144
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,838
And a lot of guys that
I know that have

145
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,382
a lot of murder in they
background, they respect her.

146
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,676
So, he all right?

147
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,553
MATTHEWS:
The life that I lived,
being in shootouts,

148
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,764
looking at the devil
face to face...

149
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:58,102
And I look at my sisters and my
brothers today, you know,

150
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,563
that was once me.

151
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,773
HARDIMAN:
Her father was Jeff Fort,

152
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,484
one of the biggest gang leaders
in the history of Chicago

153
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,444
outside of Al Capone.

154
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,530
Fort is serving a life sentence

155
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,990
for allegedly conspiring
with Bolivians

156
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,367
to commit acts of terrorism
here in the United States.

157
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,661
I understand the fact that
we got polices in here.

158
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,789
There is not going to be any
killing without killing.

159
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,291
HARDIMAN:
Jeff Fort stood up
against the police.

160
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,751
He was definitely a feared
and very revered man

161
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,794
in his community.

162
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,505
But she never lived
off that name.

163
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,674
Ameena made her own name
on the streets.

164
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,554
Growing up, it wasn't his
influence that influenced me

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,973
to do anything.

166
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,767
You know, my dad was not there.

167
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,271
When I was conceived,
he was 16 years old.

168
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,858
So when I got older, I was
in a mob with a bunch of guys,

169
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,904
and I was like the only female
that was the lieutenant.

170
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,822
That took care of the business.

171
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,825
MATTHEWS:
It was drug selling, hustling.

172
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,704
You know, one crew was
on the pimping tip.

173
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,831
One crew was on the stickup tip.

174
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,960
Drugs, guns, party, fun.

175
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,253
That was it.

176
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,342
My dad wasn't around, and...

177
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,639
when he got wind of that
I was a part of that team,

178
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,016
he was kind of hurt.

179
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,851
But he couldn't be too hurt.

180
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,939
Because look at what precedent
that he started.

181
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:25,940
MAN:
Ceasefire.

182
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:26,857
CROWD:
Ceasefire.

183
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,859
Ceasefire.

184
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,528
Stop the shooting.

185
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,906
Stop the killing.

186
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,032
I said stop it right now.

187
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,867
Stop it right now.

188
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,869
COBE WILLIAMS:
Young man got shot 22 times.

189
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,871
13 years old.

190
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,164
That's sad.

191
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,750
This is a state of emergency.

192
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,753
This is what
the war zone looks like.

193
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,882
We're sick and tired
of our babies being killed.

194
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,886
This man here
lost a son.

195
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,597
We can't be
quiet no more.

196
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,891
FATHER:
My son has been
killed right here

197
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,434
and we're standing here
with cameras right here

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
where my son been slain at?

199
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,895
Come on now.

200
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,355
I don't think that's right.

201
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,731
We could have did
this somewhere else.

202
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,609
I have to sit here and try
to say something to you guys.

203
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,320
Who does that?

204
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,572
REPORTER:
Would you say that there's
still a code of silence

205
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,949
going on in the neighborhood,

206
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,284
that people aren't
coming forward?

207
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,910
FATHER:
I can't walk around,

208
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,537
go up to people's houses
and say, "Who killed my son?"

209
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm not a police officer,
and I'm not a doctor.

210
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,711
You know, I don't know how many
times my son, they tell me 22,

211
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,547
I don't know how many times
my son's been shot.

212
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,924
See, somebody in the background
saying 22.

213
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,217
You a doctor, baby?

214
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,930
That's my son, baby,
you didn't make him.

215
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,558
You his auntie.

216
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,310
MAN:
We're going to move
this on past.

217
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,936
FATHER:
What you mean, you,
watch you don't get what?

218
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,606
You better shut up, don't know
what you're talking about.

219
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,957
MAN:
Let me just say this,
we just had another homicide.

220
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,960
Just now, while we're marching.

221
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,462
Another homicide.
It's a war zone.

222
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,047
It's a war zone
and an epidemic.

223
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,174
People, we must come together.

224
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,054
MATTHEWS:
He was sticking people up.

225
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,306
The guys caught him
in a walkway.

226
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,974
Shameful.

227
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,977
You know, we got some guys
over on the next block.

228
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,395
Some inroads over there.

229
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,607
It ain't gonna be
no retaliation from it.

230
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,736
WILLIAMS:
It's just so crazy, man,
because it's like,

231
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,654
every time you come outside,
somebody getting killed.

232
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,409
I don't know what this world
coming to.

233
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,412
We got to be out here, man.

234
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,623
Before things happen.

235
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,125
WILLIAMS:
All my life,
I knew right from wrong.

236
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,044
I knew if I do this,
I'll get in trouble.

237
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,048
But, you know, at the time,
I just didn't care, though.

238
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,008
I always wanted to be
like my dad.

239
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,094
You know, he was my role model,

240
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,180
because he used to always
dress slick.

241
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:08,018
Wear big hats and suits
and, you know, all that.

242
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,021
And, I just, you know,
wanted to be like him.

243
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,608
I was 11 years old
when my father got killed.

244
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,693
He got beat
with some baseball bats.

245
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,030
And that just messed me up.

246
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:24,785
I used to be out there in the
streets all through the night.

247
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,203
I used to be in jails,

248
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,748
fighting, kicking off riots, and
doing all crazy stuff.

249
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,042
Just gangbanging.

250
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,961
Oh, what up boy?

251
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,379
Man, come holler at me, man!

252
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,839
What's up?

253
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,090
HARDIMAN:
Ricardo Cobe Williams,

254
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,466
he's a younger interrupter,
which is a good thing.

255
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,051
Once he came on board
at CeaseFire,

256
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,971
he began to really
turn the heat on.

257
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,223
Cobe knows how to get in,
he talks the language.

258
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,768
And he knows what to say,
when to say it.

259
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,229
You two guys, man,
you all been around

260
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,565
here on a lot of bullshit,
both of you all.

261
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,110
Robbing people, breaking
in windows, all kinds of stuff.

262
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,987
Man, whenever I gotta do
what I gotta do,

263
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,071
I gotta do what I gotta do,
you know.

264
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,365
Don't get it
all twisted.

265
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,075
Once upon a time this man
was out here too,

266
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,077
doing the same thing
we done and did...

267
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,872
HARDIMAN:
Cobe has big-time credibility
with the gang members out there.

268
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,707
...we gonna wait for
the heat to come to us.

269
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,042
Breaking out...
look at them.

270
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:14,960
What's going on?

271
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,882
WILLIAMS:
A friend of mine called me, very
concerned about her two kids.

272
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,633
The streets is
taking a toll.

273
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,093
WILLIAMS:
They stay in the same house.

274
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,386
And they be at each other

275
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,180
because both of them are
in two different cliques.

276
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,099
Just threatening
to kill one another.

277
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,185
Shooting at each other,
it's just crazy.

278
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,479
I can't keep
coming off the road.

279
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,355
You know, because
I work for Amtrak,

280
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,608
and not knowing if somebody's
gonna kick the door in

281
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,109
because of this
gang's violence.

282
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,486
I just packed up
and left, yes.

283
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,112
So...

284
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,532
I left the apartment in my name
so they don't be homeless.

285
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,410
So this my little
honeycomb hideout.

286
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,829
They don't know
where I live, either.

287
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,039
Your kids don't?

288
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,166
Nope.

289
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,710
Your youngest son's
still locked up, right?

290
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,128
Yup.

291
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,380
He don't get out 'til 2016
for attempted murder.

292
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,759
And he was 17
when they got him.

293
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,594
WILLIAMS:
One thing, you still have
all three of your kids.

294
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,179
It's some people...
Yep, I thank God for that.

295
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,808
People say I'm crazy
because I always say,

296
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:17,022
"If I lose one of my sons,
I don't want no funeral."

297
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:21,777
I don't want nobody to come,
you know, give me condolences.

298
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,572
Because I want
to remember them...

299
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,367
the last decent time
I seen them.

300
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:36,959
And they say that's mean of me,
but that's how I feel.

301
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:41,171
So just stay strong
and keep your head up.

302
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,050
I'm a try to reach out
to them myself.

303
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,928
Well, I wish you luck
in finding them.

304
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,930
Yeah, just I'll see
what I can do.

305
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,473
Because I know if they
have a strong person

306
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,185
that's lived that life,

307
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,020
I think they could be saved.

308
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,815
Because I... I just
can't do it anymore.

309
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,196
GARY SLUTKIN:
Violence is like
the great infectious diseases

310
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,240
of all history.

311
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,118
We used to look at people
with plague, leprosy,

312
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,622
TB as bad and evil people,

313
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
and something needs
to be done about them.

314
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,792
And they were put in dungeons.

315
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,839
What perpetuates violence
can be as invisible today

316
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:28,427
as the microorganisms
of the past were.

317
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:33,640
I had been overseas for about
ten years at World Health

318
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,601
working on infectious diseases.

319
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:41,231
Coming back to the U.S.,
the violence is unavoidable.

320
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:46,028
But I saw it as behavior,
not as bad people.

321
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,240
You can judge it, but it's
not what we do in science.

322
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,413
I never had nothing against
Poot and them-- nothing.

323
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,082
When I came up, like I said,
they shot at my car.

324
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,460
SLUTKIN:
For the young people
in these neighborhoods,

325
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,297
they see violence
as their disease.

326
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,300
What they expect
to die of is this.

327
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,052
Don't tell me you gonna
squash something

328
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,345
then go back
and do something else,

329
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,639
and then you done made me
look like an ass.

330
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,807
And if that's
what you want to do,

331
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,685
then you put on big boy shoes,
then you play big boy games.

332
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,146
SLUTKIN:
Violence is a two-step process.

333
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,275
The first thought is,
"I have a grievance.

334
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,736
"He looked at my girl,
he called me a name,

335
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,363
"he disrespected me,
he owes me money.

336
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,114
"He's a Sunni.

337
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,658
"He's a Palestinian.

338
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,951
He's an Israeli."

339
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,289
The second thought is that
grievance justifies violence.

340
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,291
WILLIAMS:
At the end of the day,
man, nobody gonna win, man.

341
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,293
SLUTKIN:
Our work is about thought, too.

342
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,296
I mean, and your family hurt
behind this shit.

343
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,048
That's why I'm saying
ain't no point in...

344
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,299
you was wrong,
you was wrong.

345
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,384
Fuck all that,
you know what I'm saying?

346
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,177
Motherfuckers just
trying to move on, man.

347
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,970
SLUTKIN:
So the interrupter's role,

348
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,307
like the TB disease control
worker's role,

349
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,102
is to do this initial
interruption of transmission.

350
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,688
HARDIMAN:
Five steps to effective
gang mediation.

351
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,232
A lot of times you gonna
get into them situations

352
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,817
that you gonna have
to weigh it out

353
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,318
and you gonna have to know
when to step it off.

354
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,612
SLUTKIN:
Their experience around
difficult situations

355
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,699
did not begin
with their work with us.

356
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,576
So it's all a matter of

357
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,996
selecting the right people
and training them

358
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,332
and supervising them
and supporting them.

359
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,419
EARL SAWYER:
Told the officers

360
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,170
that you ain't
got nothing to say,

361
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,672
you gonna deal
with it yourself.

362
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,924
HARDIMAN:
You got to drown yourself
with the people

363
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,260
and immerse yourself
in the bullshit.

364
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,054
You have to talk as if,
"Man, I understand, man.

365
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,097
"I been there.

366
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,349
I know how it is
to hurt a motherfucker."

367
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,351
I'm not no punk
or nothing.

368
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,686
Yeah.

369
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,355
Only thing that came
to my mind was retaliate.

370
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,315
They got to know
they did the wrong person.

371
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,567
Yeah.

372
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,569
HARDIMAN:
"I hear you, Jack, you know,
you 100% right.

373
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,945
"And I'm with you man,

374
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,946
"if you gonna take care
of your business,

375
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,989
"take care of your business.

376
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,866
"But check this out.

377
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,743
"If I know you want
to shoot the motherfucker,

378
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,996
"the police know already,
your friends know,

379
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,873
and somebody gonna tell
on your ass."

380
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,460
Make sure you talk to the
individual that did this to me.

381
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,296
You let 'em know that you
gonna keep this here peace.

382
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,048
You doing this.

383
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,675
HARDIMAN:
Once you make sense
out of the madness,

384
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,887
then you start talking about
the scientific theory.

385
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,222
You start talking about
the change of the behavior.

386
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,183
Then you can give them
a history lesson.

387
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,726
You know,
"Your daddy was violent,

388
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,395
"your granddaddy was fucked up,
he was violent.

389
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,938
"Now all your brothers
are fucked up

390
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,565
"because you misled them.

391
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,400
"It's time to save yourself,
brother.

392
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,610
"Save yourself.

393
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,403
"I'm not preaching to you,
just save yourself.

394
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,489
Does this make sense, brother?"

395
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,991
"Oh man, you know what,
you got a point."

396
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,411
All right, just give
me time to work it.

397
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,038
HARDIMAN:
I really understand
why it's not easy

398
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,415
for people to back down
for one reason.

399
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,417
Because you've been taught
all your life...

400
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,836
in the community where I grew up
in, you know, like,

401
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,963
you know you got to stand up
no matter what happens.

402
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,340
Death before dishonor.

403
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,717
When I was 14 years old,

404
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,428
this guy beat me down
in the streets.

405
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,431
And my stepfather took his life
right in front of me.

406
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,016
And I felt good about it,
really.

407
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,941
And I was always
a shaky criminal.

408
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:16,238
I used to sell fake hash to the
sailors down on Michigan Avenue.

409
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,657
I used to steal smoke detectors.

410
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,325
They called us the smoke
detector bandits.

411
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,954
I was playing on women a lot--
you know, women would help me.

412
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,081
I had a lot of girlfriends
that would give me money

413
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,833
because I had a big old afro
back then.

414
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,418
First started working
with CeaseFire in 1999.

415
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,962
I told Gary I had a bachelor's
degree at that time.

416
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,463
(laughs)

417
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,381
And Gary asked me, he's like,

418
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,049
"Where is your
bachelor's degree at?"

419
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,385
I say, "Look, man, hey,
I was just trying to get in."

420
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,803
But I went back to school.

421
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,264
I got my bachelor's degree,
with my master's degree.

422
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,933
I began to understand that
we've been taught violence.

423
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,434
It's... violence is
learned behavior.

424
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,688
Hear me clearly, young brothers.

425
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,066
I don't mention gang names when
I do my mediations, all right?

426
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,278
HARDIMAN:
At this transitional home
for teenage parolees,

427
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,779
the residents were in conflict
with one another,

428
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,197
and they were
pulling in gang members

429
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,198
from throughout the area.

430
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,367
It was about to blow up
in a major way.

431
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,537
The problem that we have
right now is about some money

432
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,289
that lead to a fight, right?

433
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,290
How much money was it?

434
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,499
Like five dollars.

435
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,750
It was about five
dollars, everybody?

436
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,670
Dude said instead of giving him
five dollars, give him 15.

437
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,921
No, it don't work like that.

438
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,756
You ain't fin a get no more
than what you owed.

439
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,008
Me said, I'm not paying yous...

440
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,009
Right.

441
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,177
Then five minutes later on,
they came up here.

442
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,512
It took me as a woman

443
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,097
to stand in the middle
of the street with 15 guys,

444
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,891
that I knew...
knew nothing of...

445
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,225
And take...
come out of my pocket

446
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,518
and pay $15 to keep peace.

447
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,021
No respect for where
you live at.

448
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,023
You think this could
turn into gun play?

449
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,524
I think so,
because it's gonna escalate.

450
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,151
It's gonna keep
going and going.

451
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,777
If we got to live here, man,

452
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,446
I don't want to bring these
streets over here, man.

453
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,032
I ain't trying to go
back to that life.

454
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,534
I'm one man,
I can't fight all them.

455
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,493
What you think I'm a do?

456
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,872
HARDIMAN:
Like this brother just said,

457
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,582
any time 15 guys
mob up on you,

458
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,001
the first thing that
comes across your mind,

459
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,711
"I need to be strapped
to deal with that."

460
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,630
If you got to live here
and coexist with each other,

461
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,132
someone has to be big enough
to take the higher road.

462
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,134
It's gonna go through
one ear and out the other.

463
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
WOMAN:
Look you know what,
the most important thing is

464
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,845
to pay attention
to what they're saying.

465
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,513
Because at this site
where you live at,

466
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,640
if you cause any
kind of trouble,

467
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,726
five-oh will be called.

468
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,479
I'm hearing what they telling me
in there, right.

469
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,564
And to me,
it's like starting off

470
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,025
with a five dollar bag of weed.

471
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,485
It's beyond that.
But wait a minute.

472
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,406
No, no... no no no.

473
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,241
You got to play it
like a big man.

474
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,952
I got to play it
like a big girl.

475
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,578
When I get angry,

476
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,499
I can bring some noise
if I want to.

477
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,292
I go lay it down.

478
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,585
I have to.

479
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,170
Don't make me feel like a punk.

480
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,297
It make feel like,
you know what?

481
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,591
It's fighting my own ego.

482
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,511
I swear to God I wish I had
someone to holler at me

483
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,804
like I'm right here
hollering at you.

484
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,181
I would have not had
the felony on my record.

485
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,224
You understand what I'm saying?

486
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,892
What we gonna do?

487
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,436
We gonna fight about another
five dollar bag of weed?

488
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,646
It ain't worth it.

489
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,314
They feed off
her energy, too.

490
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,607
So what you
gonna do, son?

491
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,359
Tell me.

492
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,610
And I'm a hold you to it.

493
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,070
Make myself better.

494
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,531
You too.

495
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,657
Little Ameena.

496
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,409
(laughs)

497
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,285
Yo, if they want to let it go,
we can let it go.

498
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,287
All right, I want
to see some love.

499
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,647
MATTHEWS:
I just love Englewood.

500
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,649
But it's hard knocks, man.

501
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,652
You know, it's a old saying,
Englewood is all good.

502
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:47,449
It's where I learned
all my life's lessons.

503
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,452
Ah, I locked my keys in the car.

504
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,453
Ooh, I don't even know
how to do that.

505
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,455
I got a screwdriver

506
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,664
and a wire, a hang...
A screwdriver?

507
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,166
Y'all gonna tear my car up.

508
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,542
What kind of
locks you got?

509
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,294
MATTHEWS:
Whatever.

510
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,587
CeaseFire back
in the hood.

511
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,131
Who scratch your face?

512
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,843
You was out here thumping?

513
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,678
I fight every day.

514
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,846
You fight every day?

515
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,057
You too handsome to be
doing all of that.

516
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,185
MATTHEWS:
Most of our mediations come
through the community here.

517
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,521
They'll tell us that it's
some tension in the air

518
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,608
and need us to come in
and help out.

519
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,319
Quit playing before
I bust your nose.

520
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,072
I'm a pass these out
to everybody and they mama.

521
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,490
Just pass them out
to everybody and they mama,

522
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,908
but I just didn't want
to have to see your drawers

523
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,993
in the process
of passing them out.

524
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,328
Did I have to?
No.

525
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,704
Well, why am I
still seeing them?

526
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,332
But I thought you had got shot
in your shoulders,

527
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,542
but it was in your leg?

528
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,711
It was these guys shooting
at each other in these cars.

529
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,714
So I jumped, 'cause I was trying
to save my cousin.

530
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,926
I had a big old hole in my leg,
like this big.

531
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,427
What your grades like?

532
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,845
A's, B's, and C's.

533
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,013
A's, B's, and C's?

534
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,056
And one D.

535
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,724
What you wanna do...
what's the D in?

536
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,268
It better not be in P.E.
or I'm a hit you in your throat.

537
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,609
I like those, too.

538
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,737
No, I didn't,
I bought these.

539
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,197
You think you hot, don't you?

540
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,949
MATTHEWS:
When I was growing up
in Englewood,

541
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,660
we still looked out
for one another.

542
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,163
To me, it's like,
there's still some hope left.

543
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,040
You think you hot.

544
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,212
No, no killing.

545
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,089
CeaseFire!

546
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,049
WILLIAMS:
I've been trying to get up
with Toya's two kids, man,

547
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,760
because both of them
in rival cliques.

548
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,387
It was easy to get up with Bud.

549
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,265
Your mama asked me
to try to reach out,

550
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,058
try to sit down and work with
the... you and your brother,

551
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,685
try to talk with you
and all that, too, though.

552
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,353
So, bloodline, thicker
than water, and, like...

553
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,443
But I get into it with him
a lot, though.

554
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,863
Is there any way
we can meet him

555
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,823
and try to talk to both
of y'all at the same time?

556
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:52,782
Yeah.

557
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,576
Okay then, man.

558
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,785
Just hit me tomorrow.

559
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,870
Okay, I'm a get up
with you.

560
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,538
All right.
Thanks a lot.

561
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,539
I appreciate it.

562
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,838
He do look like
a rough rider, don't he?

563
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,799
WILLIAMS:
It took me a minute to get up
with the older brother, Kenneth.

564
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,217
What's up, boy?
What up?

565
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,343
How you doing, man?
Chilling out.

566
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,805
WILLIAMS:
I might as well just be
straight up on it.

567
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,183
Your mama, she concerned
about you and Bud.

568
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,642
We fight every day.

569
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,603
It's either I knock him out
or he knock me out.

570
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,812
I mean, like...

571
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,232
We upping pistols on
each other over little shit.

572
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,984
And y'all live under
the same roof.

573
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,403
That mean if y'all upping guns
up on each other,

574
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,822
that mean if he go to sleep
and you go to sleep,

575
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,824
y'all got to sleep
with one eye open.

576
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,117
Y'all can't even trust
each other.

577
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,830
Like last year,
my best friend got killed.

578
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,832
I could get
shot tomorrow.

579
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,544
I know it's gonna hurt my mom
more than anybody, you know?

580
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,838
She say she just moved away

581
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,881
because she couldn't take it
no more.

582
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,091
I can't get along
with my mom.

583
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,844
'Cause she, "You act just like
your daddy" and shit.

584
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,221
"Woo woo woo," and...

585
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,097
I... I ain't trying
to hear that, I'm gone.

586
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,682
I'm outside, you know?

587
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,060
My father, he been locked up
since I was three years old.

588
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,855
He get out a little bit
after I turned 18.

589
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,234
My life would be totally
different if my father was here.

590
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,861
You know, if he was in my life,
just being involved.

591
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,864
Checking up on me every day,
and, "How you doing, son?

592
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,740
"What's going on?

593
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,367
I love you, son."

594
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,868
I can count on one hand

595
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,287
how many times I told my mama
I love her.

596
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,873
So I'm gonna talk
to with Bud and Toya, man,

597
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,375
and see, man, we could try
to get together, man,

598
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,876
just sit down and talk, man.

599
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,878
I ain't trying to point no
finger, who wrong and all that.

600
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,338
Let's just correct this.

601
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,049
Let's just, be a family
and be happy.

602
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,884
So, you up with that?

603
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,887
Yeah, I'm with it.

604
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,099
First and foremost, I want
to thank the young brothers

605
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,684
coming from Calumet City.

606
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,560
Why don't you stand up
in the back, if you don't mind.

607
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,895
What happened last week,

608
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,855
there was a big conflict
with two different groups.

609
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,774
We got a chance to really work
with them young brothers

610
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
and a sister.

611
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,318
When I met that sister, she made
it clear to me, she said,

612
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,779
"I'm a sister, brother,
you know what I'm saying?"

613
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,781
MATTHEWS:
I been trying to call you.

614
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,910
When I call your phone,

615
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,247
I expect you to answer,
like, "Yeah, Ameena."

616
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,499
I'm like, hello?

617
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,918
MATTHEWS:
We've been keeping in contact.

618
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,337
Caprysha is a very loving
young lady

619
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,923
that had not had a chance
to have a childhood.

620
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,594
Substance abuse plays
a huge part of the toxicness

621
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,513
that she was raised around.

622
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,973
I was worried.

623
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,934
I know you wanted
to go see your mother.

624
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,693
Do you want to go?

625
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,906
I'll get mad.

626
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,992
All right, so we just gonna
have to keep it moving.

627
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,162
You gotta get ready to do
you, be a big girl.

628
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,456
You want to go skating
this weekend?

629
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,790
You do?

630
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,958
Okay.

631
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,461
I'm a send a car for you
this weekend,

632
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,880
because it's my
eight-year-old's birthday.

633
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,135
If I got time,
I'll come and get you myself.

634
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,553
All right, baby?

635
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,223
(disco music playing)

636
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,193
Where is my husband?

637
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,989
Come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on,

638
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,659
come on, come on,
come on, come on, yeah!

639
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,079
Yeah! Yeah!

640
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:39,008
MATTHEWS:
Today we're celebrating
my daughter's birthday.

641
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,510
We're really sad,

642
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:45,098
because Caprysha was supposed
to come skating with us.

643
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,308
(singing)

644
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,937
So then I got the full scoop.

645
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,023
She wanted to get back in touch
with her mom.

646
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,316
And that caused her to feel.

647
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,194
And she acted out
on some old behavior.

648
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,863
She got high.

649
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,532
She violated her parole.

650
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,326
So she's in the county jail.

651
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,497
I need you guys to say
please and thank you.

652
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,207
Right, Maddie?

653
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,417
Okay?

654
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,168
Right, right, right?

655
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,093
KENNETH:
So where you find
these strangers at?

656
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,887
These your people, man.

657
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,305
Ah, where y'all
find him at?

658
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,599
WILLIAMS:
Today I finally reached Toya
and her two kids

659
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,728
and we agreed to all sit down
together and work things out.

660
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,356
This morning,
Toya was steaming hot.

661
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,192
She went back to the apartment
she left her kids.

662
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,070
She saw Kenneth's friend
in there bagging up some drugs.

663
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,489
She went back
and changed the locks.

664
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,532
Shit, times hard.

665
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,742
You got to have
a job out here, man.

666
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,121
Yeah, man, or hustle.
One or the other.

667
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,082
Hustling going to end you up
one of two places.

668
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,333
It really don't matter
right now.

669
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,085
Well, if it don't matter,
why speak on it?

670
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,254
BUD:
I guess that's the same
as your life.

671
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,672
You not gonna
make no progress.

672
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,674
You just got to
humble yourself.

673
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,092
You thinking like,
you want a handout.

674
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,095
No one's going
to give you anything.

675
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,097
Who you talking to?
Him or me?

676
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,432
I'm talking in general,

677
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,100
and if you listening,
then I'm talking to you, too.

678
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,102
I'm really not listening
to shit you're saying.

679
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,395
That's why you in the
predicament you in now.

680
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,105
I don't have time
for this shit.

681
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,565
BUD:
What you been through
that's so hard?

682
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,108
What you been through
that's so hard?

683
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,526
So what the fuck
is you saying, B?

684
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,069
You ain't no boss
of me, boy.

685
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,951
Push comes to shove,
whatever I say gonna go.

686
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,453
If I want to... if I don't want
no motherfucker out there,

687
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,121
ain't nobody gonna be
out there, nigger.

688
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,247
Now what?
Now what you gonna say?

689
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,418
And I'm right there.
Then it's on.

690
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,755
Hey, hey.

691
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,133
Hey, Bud and Kenneth,
Kenneth and Bud.

692
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,220
WILLIAMS:
On our way down there I'm like,
"Damn, did I make a mistake?"

693
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,804
You know what I'm saying?

694
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,640
I don't want them to get
to fighting under my watch.

695
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,934
I'm saying, one thing
y'all missing, man.

696
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,519
Y'all is blood brothers, man.

697
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,145
Y'all ain't no bad kids.

698
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,647
Both of y'all
finished school.

699
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,149
Both of y'all ain't been
to motherfucking penitenti...

700
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,400
that's good, man.

701
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,903
I just hate how my own
people just think like,

702
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,821
"Yeah, Kenneth, the type
of crowd he be around..."

703
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,949
Boy, if I wasn't
the parent that I was,

704
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,408
you wouldn't have made it
through school.

705
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,952
I made sure you had
what you needed.

706
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,203
Hey, hey, but Kenneth,
I'm gonna tell you this, though.

707
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,914
She don't want to see shit
happen to y'all, man.

708
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,832
He can't say when he need,
or he need a bond I'm not there.

709
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,334
I always bond him out of jail

710
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,254
for stuff that I don't
even believe in.

711
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,089
I don't need no, no,
no other motherfucker.

712
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,174
I never served for another man,
or none of that shit.

713
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,510
Always been on my own two.
Yes, you have.

714
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,595
Always been on my own two.

715
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,180
If I, if I,
if I had got something

716
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,765
from another motherfucker,
Cobe, I took it.

717
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,933
Plain and simple.

718
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,184
'Cause I feel the
motherfucker owed it.

719
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,769
Go to work.

720
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,439
Yeah, I'm right here
on Roosevelt and Ashland.

721
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,525
Right here.

722
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,112
All right, come to the office,
it's heated right now.

723
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,405
Okay.

724
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,197
All right.

725
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,118
HARDIMAN:
If the clique you are in...

726
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,244
I ain't putting you
on the spot,

727
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,621
but if they came at your
brother, would you stop them?

728
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,831
Yeah.

729
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:57,582
You would?

730
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,208
Okay.

731
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,751
The clique you in,
if they came at your brother,

732
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,211
would you stop them?

733
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,504
Of course.

734
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,923
And my thing to you, when it
come down to the street game,

735
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,760
the only choices, man, is jails,
deaths, and institutions.

736
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,513
Do you feel you can be in a cell
for 23 hours a day?

737
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,015
A six-by-nine cell?

738
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,018
No, no man could be in that
place for... for that long.

739
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,352
Well, what'll happen
when you're on the streets,

740
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,729
though, little brother,

741
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,896
you'll run into
a situation out there

742
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,106
with your brother's associates,

743
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,233
you mad at your mama,
you mad at your brother,

744
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,235
you not thinking right,
you high on some reefer, bam!

745
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,570
You shoot some
motherfucking body, right?

746
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,196
I ain't that type of guy.

747
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,531
No, you ain't that guy,
but it happens.

748
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,657
Your brother not either,
look where he at.

749
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,992
Hear me clearly.

750
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,869
60% of the guys
in the penitentiary

751
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,912
were not them kind of guys.

752
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,748
They were probably sitting
in the same seats

753
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,750
like you're sitting in and never
thought it would happen to 'em.

754
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,751
I bet you.

755
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,252
I love my brother
to death.

756
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,879
He just don't
understand, like,

757
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,422
and it's not really
a problem with him,

758
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,257
it's really a problem with like
my mother and my grandmother.

759
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,344
I just feel like they
really do take sides, man.

760
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,262
I don't got no problems
with my brother.

761
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,056
I love my mama to death,
but she just don't listen

762
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,807
or try to just,

763
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,809
try to relate a little bit,
you know what I'm saying?

764
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,895
And all the shit that she done
while I'm growing up,

765
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,272
you ain't always been peaches
and cream in your life either.

766
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,899
I ain't never said I was.

767
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,734
But at the same time, you
don't have to go down that road

768
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,194
and be the spoiled peach.

769
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,654
I'm really not,
I'm really not.

770
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,280
You gonna have issues
with your mother.

771
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,032
Every damn kid in the United
States, black or white,

772
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,283
got issues with
they parents, man.

773
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,284
This ain't nothing new.

774
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,911
Which one of you
brothers can cook?

775
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,746
Neither one.

776
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,289
I know how to cook,
some of anything.

777
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,874
You cook your mother
a meal one day, man.

778
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,626
Y'all need to sit down
with your mother.

779
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,127
You hear me?

780
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,504
I know it's kind of tough
because you haven't done it,

781
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,005
but you need to sit down
with your mother, man.

782
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,424
Have a family day.

783
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,763
You know, that's kind of,
that's kind of odd to me.

784
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,098
It's not coming
to me, right.

785
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,725
It's just not coming
to me right now.

786
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,977
Man, you know what I'd love
to see though, for real, man?

787
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,313
I'd love to see y'all two
embrace each other, man.

788
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:45,731
You and your brother, man.

789
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,358
For real.

790
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,859
HARDIMAN:
I'm a let Cobe handle
that one, there.

791
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,319
I'd love to see y'all
embrace each other, man.

792
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,321
HARDIMAN:
And your mother.

793
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,948
WILLIAMS:
And your mama, yeah, man.

794
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,324
HARDIMAN:
Your mom, that's what's
happening right there, bro.

795
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,493
You know, can you handle that,
little brother?

796
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,953
Huh?

797
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,538
I ain't gonna force
you to do it, you know that.

798
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,872
I ain't gonna force
you, brother.

799
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,333
You should embrace your mom
or your brother.

800
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,334
Mmm, not right now.

801
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,214
WILLIAMS:
I was sick behind that shit.

802
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,341
This your mama, man,
I wouldn't care what...

803
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,635
You should still always
hug your mama

804
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,262
and let her know
you love her, man.

805
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,705
Is that Alfreda?

806
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,457
This is my baby.

807
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,876
This is my heart.

808
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,210
WILLIAMS:
I know my mama love me.

809
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,378
I love my mama.

810
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,671
I know she'll do anything
for me.

811
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,090
Hello.

812
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,383
WILLIAMS:
But when my dad got killed,

813
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,635
things really
just went downhill.

814
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,306
My mother done come up,
start using drugs.

815
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,558
After my father died,
she couldn't deal with it.

816
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,809
I'm like...

817
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,395
That shit took a toll on me.

818
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,565
I'm fin a drink me
a cocktail today.

819
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,649
I ain't drinking
no cocktail.

820
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,402
I don't want you
to keep drinking.

821
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,949
WILLIAMS:
That's why, God as my witness,
I'm 38 years old right now.

822
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,244
And I said I wasn't gonna
never use drugs.

823
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,579
I wasn't gonna never drink.

824
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:28,083
I really started following
in my daddy's footsteps, though.

825
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,294
Selling drugs, hustling, going
back and forth to jail.

826
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,963
What up, Granny?

827
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,925
I know they thought I was
coming in through the back...

828
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,344
WILLIAMS:
Coming up I was more close
to my grandparent.

829
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,555
And my grandmother from day one,
stayed on me.

830
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,349
Look at Granny.

831
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,060
Happy birthday to me!

832
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:50,731
MILDRED:
I called him Carty,
but his name Ricardo.

833
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,360
I love all my grandkids.

834
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,863
But Carty was one I guess
I did do more for

835
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,074
and took under my wing.

836
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,993
WILLIAMS:
When I went to jail,
my grandmother bonded me out.

837
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,411
I was like,

838
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,455
"Grandma, I knew you was going
to get me out, anyway.

839
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,498
I'm your baby."

840
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,750
She say, "Go back and see."

841
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,126
I went back.

842
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,461
Grandma didn't do none of that.

843
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,676
I probably have broke her heart
a lot of times,

844
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,846
doing things I shouldn't
have been doing.

845
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:25,182
But she always remind me
of the good in me.

846
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,984
(singing)

847
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,363
MILDRED:
He saved his life.

848
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,074
Because Carty had been shot at.

849
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,869
Probably was shooting at people.

850
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,079
So something turned him around.

851
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,499
I ain't gonna say it
through me and his granddaddy,

852
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,503
but he lucky.

853
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,255
Hey, my Granny.

854
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,506
Love you.

855
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,799
Love you too, Granny.

MATTHEWS:
Ms. Madea's always shot
from both hips.

861
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,541
I was with Madea
from birth to nine,

862
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,003
and from nine to about 15,

863
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:41,634
I went and I did stay
with my biological mother.

864
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,094
Now we're talking
about my family,

865
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,557
because I'm the mother
of her biological mother.

866
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,727
We need to honor and
respect our children.

867
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,855
We can't just throw 'em out
there and throw 'em away.

868
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:02,404
MATTHEWS:
Because of the lifestyle
that my mother lived,

869
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,574
I went through
a real rough journey.

870
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:11,580
Being abused-- physically,
emotionally, sexually--

871
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,459
from the age of nine
to the age of 15.

872
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:19,838
So I just went back to Madea.

873
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:24,385
My grandmother lived
in a apartment with four of us,

874
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,470
and it was roach-infested.

875
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,430
You know, once I started
learning the game,

876
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,683
my goal was to get Madea
up out of there.

877
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,979
Madea was the type of woman
that... that type of money?

878
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,189
"Don't bring that shit
in my house."

879
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,733
But I got caught up.

880
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,655
I got caught up in that one more
thousand, one more run.

881
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:49,451
One more big hit.

882
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,122
(singing religious song)

883
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,006
I was introduced to Islam
through my father.

884
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:08,262
(singing)

885
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:12,766
It was always
something inside of me

886
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,186
that was constantly saying
that I have to do better.

887
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,653
I wasn't afraid, I just knew
that I had to come on with it.

888
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:30,200
Allah sent me confirmation
through someone else.

889
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,036
SHEIKH RASHEED:
She knew what she wanted.

890
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,246
That's what lead her here.

891
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,832
And so, we believe that,
you know,

892
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,584
it was a heavenly marriage.

893
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:42,504
Allah, let your blessings and
your peace be upon your servant.

894
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,674
MATTHEWS:
My family keeps me
very, very grounded.

895
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,431
He took your phone?

896
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,184
Noah took your phone?

897
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,685
MATTHEWS:
At the end of the day,

898
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:01,065
I have to come in, cook dinner,
help with homework.

899
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,942
Tear some ass out the frame
if I have to.

900
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,695
Show him some
Salaam love.

901
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,363
Don't do it no more.

902
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,199
All right.
I'll bust your jaw.

903
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,703
MATTHEWS:
A family is really my real job.

904
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,456
Out there in the community
is a piece of cake for me.

905
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,712
My husband worries about me
more than anyone else.

906
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,715
There are times that I can't be
there physically with her,

907
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,594
but I know that she is fearless
and she will lay it on the line,

908
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,971
and she'll go up against a lion.

909
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,350
She will just stand up
for anyone,

910
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,977
because of experiences
she's had growing up

911
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,730
where someone didn't
stand up for her.

912
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:45,359
MATTHEWS:
Our mosque is holding
a prayer vigil

913
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,737
for a kid shot
sitting in front of his home

914
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,739
just listening to the radio.

915
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,658
Corey definitely wasn't
in a gang

916
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,618
and he was loved by his block.

917
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,956
When rage sets in, when ego sets
in, when that Hennessy sets in.

918
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,209
Okay, I'm going to walk down
here where Corey's friends are.

919
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,877
You stay right here.

920
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:08,465
MATTHEWS:
These young guys say, "Let's go
get who we think did it."

921
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm hearing 20 different things
why that brother got changed.

922
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,012
And all of it is stupid.

923
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,765
All of it is stupid.

924
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,476
2:00 in the afternoon when these
babies coming home from school,

925
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,769
y'all shooting.

926
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,437
For real?

927
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,356
This is unacceptable for me
to be holding this boy's...

928
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,150
this young man's obituary.

929
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:30,404
Schools, churches,
your mama's house, your cars,

930
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,324
those are safe zones.

931
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,617
When I was about your age,

932
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,370
I was making some
real stupid decisions

933
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,667
and some stupid calls
that was costing me my life.

934
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,545
Blood on my hands and my head.

935
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,591
Stop.

936
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,803
Who does this baby belong to?

937
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,763
Who does this little
shorty belong to?

938
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,099
He just hanging
around y'all?

939
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,560
He just hanging, this little mo,
this little mo,

940
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,353
he just hanging around y'all,
right?

941
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,064
So he see everything
that you all do, right?

942
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:10,569
So if this brother right here
catch a case and do 100 years,

943
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,446
whose fault is it?

944
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,364
It's his fault?

945
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,825
MAN:
Uh-uh.

946
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,994
It's our fault.

947
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,829
Teach him righteous.

948
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,706
Y'all got it?

949
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,957
ALL:
Yeah.

950
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,167
Y'all got it?

951
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,418
ALL:
Yeah.

952
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,379
You got it?

953
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,589
All right.

954
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,882
I'm looking to you.

955
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,553
Here's my number, give me
a call, all right?

956
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,846
All right.

957
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,168
YOUNG MAN:
This is my, my little brother,
on the left side

958
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,544
and my little cousin
on the right side.

959
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,340
Tyrone Williams
and Percy Day, Jr.

960
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:08,937
GIRL:
Luis was killed trying
to sign Michael's altar.

961
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,108
I held him to his last breath.

962
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,360
I didn't want to let him go.

963
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,100
MAN:
I've lost at least 20 guys.

964
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,644
It's no answer to it, you know.

965
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,396
You one of your guys
got killed, fuck it.

966
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,024
I'm gonna kill that nigger
and make his family suffer.

967
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,155
I don't want no shrines,
beer bottles, drinks.

968
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,532
Niggers crying, smoking weed.

969
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,910
Pictures and shit, t-shirts.

970
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,995
I don't want none of that shit.

971
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,997
I don't want to die looking
stupid as hell.

972
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:09,998
No, fuck that.

973
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,224
DISC JOCKEY:

Tony Sko and the morning riot
and that's right,

975
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,020
it is the first day of school

DISC JOCKEY:
That's right and we want you
to hit us up,

978
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,652

Youth violence in Chicago

980
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,864
has gotten world attention.

981
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,492
NEWS ANCHOR:
16-year-old honor student
Derrion Albert was attacked

982
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,952
as he walked home from school.

983
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,454
A senseless killing, this time
was caught on videotape,

984
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,998
has put Chicago's deadly
epidemic in the spotlight.

985
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,417
NEWS ANCHOR:
Now there's debate
on a national level

986
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:56,002
which all basically started with
that viral video that came out,

987
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,546
from the cell phone,

988
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,466
of the clash between the two
gangs outside Fenger High School

989
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,260
that killed Derrion Albert
right in the middle.

990
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,308
See this young man here?

991
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:14,354
You see him taking this board
from this young man.

992
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,773
And this is the young man that
you're actually going to see

993
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,067
hit the boy
in the back of the head.

994
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,819
Look for the guy
in the red coat.

995
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:21,778
Watch him.

996
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,740
JACKSON:
He took it, and watch him.

997
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,159
MAN:
Damn.

998
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,119
That was a two-by-four,
wasn't it?

999
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,832
MAN:
They still doin'... oh wow.

1000
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,503
Man.

1001
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,714
JACKSON:
Ameena is gonna assist us
with the family,

1002
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,049
because we got to get them
to the site

1003
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,509
where they're gonna do
the memorial.

1004
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,595
'Cause this is what
the family wants, okay?

1005
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,096
Which way does that go?

1006
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,681
It goes that way,
the arrow?

1007
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,682
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,309
Okay, go that way.

1009
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,103
MATTHEWS:
I seen the video.

1010
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:59,107
And I said, "Aw man, I hope
his mother does not see this."

1011
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,119
It's a lot of people here
for your brother.

1012
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,496
You know that, right?

1013
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,831
It's a lot of people, okay?

1014
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,249
Stay in that circle.

1015
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,793
We got security
on both sides of you.

1016
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,546
MATTHEWS:
Anjanette needed help
getting him a funeral.

1017
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,552
She needed help trying
to make sense

1018
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,472
of what just happened
to her son.

1019
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:34,142
I got resources for Anjanette
to put Derrion in a mausoleum

1020
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,061
next to her mother.

1021
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,979
Only the family.

1022
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,481
Nobody else.

1023
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,068
ANJANETTE:
Ameena's very, very
important to us.

1024
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,406
Everything I went through,
she was right there with me.

1025
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,160
MAN:
We're praying for this family.

1026
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,371
We're praying that God
will heal their hurts.

1027
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,957
And I'm praying for all of you,
my brothers and my sisters.

1028
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,708
This is a problem
in our community.

1029
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,168
It's a problem in our city.

1030
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,254
It's a problem in our nation.

1031
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,173
HARDIMAN:
Once the media has gone back
to wherever they came from,

1032
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,550
we have to step up to the plate

1033
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,593
and make something happen
over there.

1034
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,053
MAN:
...year after year,

1035
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,014
who are not doing anything
about this problem.

1036
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,933
I'm talking about
the police department.

1037
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,269
I'm talking about all those
who are doing nothing...

1038
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,187
HARDIMAN:
The person that was videotaping

1039
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,730
the goddamn beating
was saying,

1040
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,566
"Zoom in, zoom in,
put that nigger to sleep."

1041
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,819
That's what you heard the people
saying in the background.

1042
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,112
So that goes to show you
the mindset.

1043
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,989
'Cause I know Ameena,

1044
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,824
she's spending a lot of time
with the family still,

1045
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,451
they trying to fix his face
so they can have a open casket.

1046
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,829
I heard some interviews
from the young brothers.

1047
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,498
They say they don't know why
the hell they fighting.

1048
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,166
They just hate each other.

1049
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,334
So somebody tell me what
they fighting for, then.

1050
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,919
MAN:
We grew up gangbanging.

1051
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,879
It don't make a difference
what we fighting for.

1052
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,881
You ain't with me,
you against me,

1053
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,175
and that's just how
it's always been, Tio.

1054
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,302
HARDIMAN:
The guys from Altgeld Gardens,

1055
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,221
they were attending
Carver School.

1056
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,265
Which was turned into
a military school.

1057
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,851
A lot of guys didn't want
to go to a military school,

1058
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,686
so they transferred
the guys to Fenger.

1059
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,231
So now you got these guys coming
from a whole other neighborhood.

1060
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,234
When they laid there and closed
down Carver High School,

1061
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,445
and started letting these guys
get to school

1062
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,946
any kind of way they can,

1063
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,324
riding on the bus, walking,
or what have you,

1064
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,244
you left it to them that
they had to defend themselves.

1065
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,455
And the Ville is fighting
Altgeld Gardens.

1066
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,707
They've been doing that
since the '60s, man.

1067
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,293
HARDIMAN:
We up against history.

1068
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,753
Yeah, and we gotta
respect history,

1069
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:28,548
but it shouldn't play
a big factor in this table.

1070
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,968
Man, we got over 500 years
of prison time at this table.

1071
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,762
That's a lot
of fucking wisdom.

1072
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,264
How the hell are we gonna
let these kids school us,

1073
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,725
that we were schooling them?

1074
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,227
HARDIMAN: We're gonna try
and work this conflict out.

1075
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,146
Because right now
they just had another big fight

1076
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,314
up at Fenger while we talking.

1077
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,275
The beat goes on.

1078
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,077
That's that brother
right there, man?

1079
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,663
They put him in the,
that's the body?

1080
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,790
Damn, that's fucked up, man.

1081
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,542
EDDIE BOCANEGRA:
This young brother

1082
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,211
that we just finished
doing some mediating with,

1083
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,171
his close friend
just got killed.

1084
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,090
The possibility of retaliation
at that moment

1085
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,675
was very, very likely.

1086
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,302
That cop was just looking
at me all crazy, too,

1087
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,304
like she got a
fucking problem.

1088
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,933
WOMAN: They just right now shot
on 30th and Kedville, again.

1089
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,810
30th and Kedville?
Right now.

1090
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:22,936
Get the fuck out of here;
again, right now?

1091
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,312
Right now, a couple
of minutes ago.

1092
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,816
BOCANEGRA:
Police are going to be harassing
a lot of guys over here

1093
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,068
whether they're affiliated
or not.

1094
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,903
I think the police
should enforce the laws

1095
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,114
but I think it's the way
they go about it.

1096
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,782
There's a reason why people
in the community

1097
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,410
don't really like talking
to the police.

1098
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,328
They see other guys:
they see their nephews,

1099
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,247
they see their brothers
and their sisters, you know,

1100
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,332
being harassed.

1101
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,751
Just because there's a high
presence of police right now,

1102
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,337
that doesn't mean nothing
for these guys, man.

1103
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:53,466
Within 30 hours there was
about seven shootings.

1104
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,052
HARDIMAN:
Eddie always presents himself

1105
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,638
as a preppy, school-going,
collegiate type of guy.

1106
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,725
I said, look man, there
ain't nothing shaking, man,

1107
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,351
HARDIMAN:
When you talk to him
about his street past,

1108
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,228
"Oh no, we don't want
to go there man.

1109
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,354
We don't want to go there."

1110
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,731
But at the same time,

1111
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,734
he came from the lifestyle
with the Latino gangs.

1112
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,986
And he wasn't no
low-level member.

1113
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:13,987
He was right there
with the leader.

1114
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,780
They called him Bandit,

1115
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,574
because he would end up
taking something from you.

1116
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,868
BOCANEGRA:
My nickname... (laughs)

1117
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,620
Well, I was pretty good
at stealing cars.

1118
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,497
I was... give me a screwdriver
and less than a minute,

1119
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,582
and I'm gone with your car.

1120
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,793
Well, this is the block
in Little Village

1121
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,378
that I actually grew up in.

1122
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,046
I have a lot of memories here.

1123
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:35,800
Right hand to God, I had about
almost half of this parking lot

1124
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,844
full of stolen cars at one time.

1125
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,139
But one day, the city, I guess,
found all the stolen cars.

1126
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,558
So there was about seven,
eight tow trucks,

1127
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,145
just lined up,
taking these cars out.

1128
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,442
Most of our parents,
immigrants from Mexico.

1129
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,444
Worked two jobs.

1130
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,404
We were out here in the street,
running around.

1131
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,825
My dad was a hardworking person.

1132
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,243
He fixed cars.

1133
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,828
And I would see my dad's hands,

1134
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,455
and they'd be full
of calluses, you know,

1135
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,750
and you know, cuts all over
his arm, burn marks,

1136
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,294
you know, from the blow torches.

1137
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,630
From day one, I told myself,

1138
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,965
"I am never going
to be fixing cars."

1139
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,425
It wasn't me.

1140
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,927
I didn't feel it.

1141
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:23,431
It lit up in me, when I saw some
things in the neighborhood.

1142
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:28,436
And I'd see these guys hanging
out, a lot older than I was.

1143
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,438
They had the nice cars,
they had the girls,

1144
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,690
flashing their colors.

1145
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,819
What it was they had a pride
of who they really were.

1146
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,779
They had an identity and they
were proud of that identity.

1147
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,787
Half of my life I was in prison.

1148
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,455
That's why I do what I do now.

1149
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,082
To me it's a personal thing.

1150
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,919
How you've been feeling?

1151
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,462
You've been moving around
a little more or not, or what?

1152
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,630
Before I couldn't even walk.

1153
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,049
This dressing, this is what
I got to clean.

1154
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,926
You know I got to take a dump
right here in a bag...

1155
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,886
BOCANEGRA:
How much of an impact
are we making?

1156
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,306
If we stop one shooting tonight,
we did good.

1157
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,808
Where the bullet
went through?

1158
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,434
But how do we stop
maybe the same person

1159
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,645
shooting somebody the next day?

1160
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,438
MAN:
Has anybody been
here to visit?

1161
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,190
A couple of my friends.

1162
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,026
BOCANEGRA:
They've been cool, or they've
been like, "Oh man, fuck that"?

1163
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,488
BOCANEGRA:
Am I really helping?

1164
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,948
Some people I can't.

1165
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,493
Even as much as I want to,
they don't want the help.

1166
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,798
The needless and
brutal violence

1167
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,010
that continues to take our
children from us is an outrage.

1168
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,388
Youth violence is not
a Chicago problem.

1169
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:48,516
It is something that affects
communities big and small,

1170
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,769
and people of all races
and all colors.

1171
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,147
It is an American problem.

1172
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,524
I promise to work
as long as necessary

1173
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,526
to rid our country
of this plague.

1174
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,821
MAN:
Secretary Duncan, I've heard you
say those things many times.

1175
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,532
What's different now?

1176
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,451
DUNCAN:
What's different
that it takes

1177
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:09,537
capturing Derrion Albert's death
on video to wake the country.

1178
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,706
We were dealing with children
being shot every single day.

1179
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,459
I never saw a crowd
like this, ever.

1180
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,836
Now the professionals
working in this field,

1181
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,087
they knew about
the hostilities

1182
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,964
coming out of the
Altgeld Gardens projects

1183
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,550
and the young men
around Fenger.

1184
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,552
So there was no way
in the world

1185
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,971
that should have really
occurred, to be real with you.

1186
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,557
I talked to the mayor's
office today.

1187
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,559
We're gonna bring together the
guys that are in the conflict.

1188
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,186
And they've agreed
to meet with us,

1189
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,562
and we're gonna process
with them.

1190
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,813
We have a
five-hour agenda.

1191
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,565
I think we can get all
the brothers we need.

1192
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,108
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1193
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,777
If they willing to come sit
down here and talk with us,

1194
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,446
you know, people need
to talk to them,

1195
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,156
Come to see what's on they mind,
the kids' mind.

1196
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,033
Right.

1197
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:54,040
WILLIAMS:
What's up, Tay?

1198
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,542
You just got kicked
out of Fenger, man.

1199
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,794
You want to go
back to Fenger?

1200
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,462
Yeah, you know I do.

1201
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,297
So how you feel
about them people

1202
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,300
come from Altgeld Gardens
out there?

1203
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,677
I used to get into it with them
a lot though, but...

1204
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,261
That's what
it is though, man.

1205
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,763
Either fighting
or shooting.

1206
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,266
That's how got to solve y'all
prob... these problems nowadays,

1207
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,394
'cause if you don't do it,
they gonna try and do it to you.

1208
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,562
If you don't go hard,
it's your life.

1209
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:30,868
♪

1210
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,371
WILLIAMS:
Me and my wife was looking
for a house.

1211
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,998
I didn't want the kids
to grow up

1212
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,625
and really experience the things
I've experienced all my life.

1213
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,295
We way out here, man.

1214
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,131
Way out yonder, man.

1215
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,803
ANDREA WILLIAMS:
Instead of gun violence,

1216
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,640
we probably have to worry
about rabbits and deer,

1217
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:53,683
and I'm okay with that.

1218
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,601
Man, my wife came
from the streets.

1219
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,145
She used to be around
rough riders,

1220
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,313
people who lived the same
lifestyle I lived.

1221
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,778
I end up getting pregnant at
about 16, and did a 360, so...

1222
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,657
WILLIAMS:
I met my wife in 2002.

1223
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,743
And she already had three kids.

1224
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,661
ANDREA:
It wasn't love at first sight.

1225
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,872
Probably not even love
at second sight.

1226
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,749
He's very nerdy.

1227
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,960
Very, very nerdy person.

1228
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,962
Man, my wife a mess.

1229
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,673
But, like most wives.

1230
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,259
No, no, but I love my wife.

1231
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,677
WILLIAMS:
That's short.

1232
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:30,678
He at the 30.

1233
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,640
ANDREA:
Cobe as a dad, he's really good.

1234
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:40,354
He's there for every
football game.

1235
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,192
My kids really enjoy him,
especially my daughter.

1236
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:49,113
That's... that's her everything,
her Cobe.

1237
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,156
Cobe.

1238
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:50,740
Ooh-hoo!

1239
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,033
Jake.

1240
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,038
WILLIAMS:
What really made me start
thinking more

1241
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,917
about doing the right thing,
I started thinking about my son.

1242
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,710
I remember I was in jail,

1243
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,003
and they brought me out
with handcuffs

1244
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,714
till the judge called us.

1245
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:11,469
My son, he ran up to me
and hugged and kissed me

1246
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,554
and grabbed me
and started crying.

1247
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,850
So instantly I got so emotional
and, like,

1248
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,436
I think tears was coming,
you know what I'm saying.

1249
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,898
And, like "Dad, Dad, I love you,
I love you."

1250
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,943
As I'm going back to the back,
my son just like

1251
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:30,863
broke down in front of
everybody, just crying.

1252
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,824
"I want my daddy,
I want my daddy."

1253
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,785
I started thinking more
about him.

1254
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,746
Wanted to change my life because
I wanted to be there for him.

1255
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,753
It was so much
that they had to do.

1256
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,587
To get you released?

1257
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,548
Yeah, to get me released.

1258
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:52,510
MATTHEWS:
Caprysha had to stay
in the jail for almost a month.

1259
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,762
I was the first call
on her way home.

1260
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:58,766
And that experience was just
such an eye-opener for her.

1261
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,059
She said she didn't
want to do it again.

1262
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,436
My mom had just
went to court.

1263
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,772
They talking about taking
her last four kids.

1264
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,776
MATTHEWS:
She's been in over
15 different homes.

1265
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,821
She's raised herself
and her sisters and brothers

1266
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,782
while her mom was out doing
whatever her mom was doing.

1267
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,784
The money that I get,

1268
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,912
I'll go buy my drugs and start
selling drugs out on the block,

1269
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,206
just to make money
for my sisters and brothers,

1270
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,875
for them to have
what they wanted.

1271
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:27,378
ANDERSON:
I blame myself for my sisters
and them being in DCFS.

1272
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,213
I blame myself
for a lot of stuff

1273
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,300
that I know that
it wasn't my fault.

1274
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,467
What's your goal?

1275
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,595
To get my high
school diploma,

1276
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,054
go to college
to be a pediatrician,

1277
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,806
and, like,
take care of, like,

1278
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,433
and then with like,
my free time,

1279
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,809
take care of my...
go get my sisters and them.

1280
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:46,314
MATTHEWS:
And her saying what her goals
and dreams are,

1281
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,066
who am I to say,
"You can't do that.

1282
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,193
Look at your record."

1283
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,861
Look at Ameena's record!

1284
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,992
Being a violence interrupter,
nothing surprises me.

1285
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,828
But being a mother,
and seeing this 18-year-old

1286
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,290
never riding on a carousel,
kind of blew my mind.

1287
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:13,007
It's true that it's only
so much that I can do.

1288
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:16,552
And that's just one Caprysha.

1289
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,931
But it's hundreds of thousands
of Capryshas out there.

1290
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,894
MATTHEWS:
Pick out another color.

1291
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,062
I like green.

1292
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,605
MAN:
Let her be,
let her be.

1293
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,814
If she got green,
leave it green.

1294
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,194
She got like that
lizard green.

1295
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,696
Now, this is a very
expensive manicure.

1296
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,073
If I see you out there
biting your nails,

1297
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,741
we gonna be on the ground,
boxing.

1298
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,285
You better be worried.

1299
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,870
How does it feel?

1300
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,080
Nice, right?

1301
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,873
Yeah.

1302
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,083
MATTHEWS:
Don't slap him,
don't hit him.

1303
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,293
Enjoy it.

1304
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,711
So, where are you from?

1305
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,712
Rockford.

1306
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,880
What made you move
all the way out here?

1307
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,883
'Cause I was
getting in trouble.

1308
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:59,345
I used to fight every day
at school.

1309
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,347
Where does
that get you?

1310
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,598
Huh?

1311
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,183
Where does that get you,
fighting?

1312
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,185
Nowhere.

1313
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,853
Finally figured
that out, huh?

1314
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,230
Yeah.

1315
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:12,900
Only for one brief second
you become the winner.

1316
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,360
Mm-hmm.

1317
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,904
But then, the only thing
you win is your own pride.

1318
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:20,408
But, but, where's that gonna
take you anywhere in life?

1319
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,827
I don't go out and start trouble
with everybody.

1320
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,912
When she bring it,
she bring it hard.

1321
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,916
We were doing a
conflict mediation and...

1322
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,170
Just happened to be the
only girl standing outside.

1323
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,923
MATTHEWS:
And when you came to the house,
what you thought?

1324
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,967
It was different.

1325
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:42,638
Because like, you actually
was talking to me.

1326
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,933
You know, you deserve
to be happy.

1327
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,643
You know, you 19.

1328
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,603
You deserve, like you said,
to be having girly stuff done.

1329
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,150
That's a whole
different hand, man.

1330
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,200
Why do you feel like you want
to cry but you don't want to?

1331
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:04,618
I don't know.
It's okay.

1332
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,123
I cry.

1333
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,625
Big girls cry.

1334
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,504
Angels make prayer
in your tears,

1335
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,841
when you, when you crying
and you grateful.

1336
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,594
When you're crying and you're
asking God to help you.

1337
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,975
I'm really so glad
I met you, man.

1338
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,313
You know?

1339
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,573
BOCANEGRA:
You guys remember
where we left off last week?

1340
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,991
We're working on our what?

1341
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:44,992
STUDENT:
Backgrounds.

1342
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:45,993
BOCANEGRA:
Backgrounds, right.

1343
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,495
It's about using your brush.

1344
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,746
Crisscrosses.

1345
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:49,997
C's.

1346
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,833
BOCANEGRA:
Last year, I had a hard time
going to schools.

1347
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,001
I was like, "Hey, look,

1348
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,961
I work for the violence
prevention program."

1349
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,713
A lot of them didn't want
to acknowledge

1350
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,507
that there was issues
in their schools.

1351
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,800
I used the pencil
to sketch it out

1352
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:01,884
and I shaded the background.

1353
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,177
Oh, you shaded it, okay.

1354
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,012
BOCANEGRA:
Namaste contacted CeaseFire.

1355
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,890
They were actually focusing
after school about violence

1356
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,518
and how they could help
the community and so forth.

1357
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:11,852
And I was like,

1358
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,979
"What do you think about the
idea of maybe introducing art

1359
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,857
for them to express themselves
about violence?"

1360
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,610
Now this one right here,
I kind of really like this one.

1361
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,028
BOCANEGRA:
And when I was in prison,

1362
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,406
painting was my form of dealing
with my issues and my problems

1363
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:24,740
and really discovering myself.

1364
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,034
You got this angel,
he's in Hell,

1365
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,036
and behind him is like
some demons, taunting him.

1366
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,665
BOCANEGRA:
Art is kind of a way
to hook the kids

1367
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,624
and what they're
thinking about.

1368
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,043
What's the one thing
in the neighborhood

1369
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,046
that you wish people could
focus on more, to help out?

1370
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:42,299
Spray painting.

1371
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,217
What about you?

1372
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,052
The shootings
in the neighborhood.

1373
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,054
The shootings?

1374
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,141
Because my mom's
scared that

1375
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:54,854
there's gonna be a shooting
going on while I'm outside.

1376
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,107
GIRL:
I would want them
to help with the shooting,

1377
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,067
because that really bothers me.

1378
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,861
BOCANEGRA:
Why does it bother you?

1379
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:06,282
GIRL:
Because there was
this one time

1380
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:10,244
when our neighbors
got into a fight and...

1381
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:16,083
I don't know what else happened,
but somebody started shooting.

1382
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,711
And...

1383
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,380
(sniffling, starting to cry)

1384
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:26,051
I really don't...

1385
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,764
BOCANEGRA:
And what you're doing
right here,

1386
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,434
being part of this program,
that's a great thing,

1387
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,977
because it shows that you care

1388
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,437
and that you want to do
something about it.

1389
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,485
BOCANEGRA:
And I just wish
that these kids,

1390
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,111
if they ever go through that,

1391
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:45,613
it doesn't affect them
the same way it affected me.

1392
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:50,743
My coping mechanism is keep
going, keep going, keep going.

1393
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,120
Keep working.

1394
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,752
I think I stay busy just
to stay out of bullshit, and...

1395
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,843
try to forget about some
of the things that I've done.

1396
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:12,598
When I was 18, a very close
friend of mine was paralyzed.

1397
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,476
I'm feeling this anger,
I'm feeling this rage.

1398
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,145
I'm feeling like, they shot one
of our guys, we're going back.

1399
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:32,952
When I pass through that block,
it seems so different.

1400
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,538
And I try to kind of rewind.

1401
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,165
And no matter how much I try
to remember it,

1402
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,168
it just don't come out.

1403
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:45,172
It's hard for me to say
the victim's name,

1404
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,175
and... and even the crime.

1405
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:51,220
I guess I really try
to detach myself, like,

1406
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,471
not putting a face.

1407
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,182
But in reality,
the face is there.

1408
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:59,186
The face is still there.

1409
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,355
(music from
ice cream truck)

1410
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:07,194
And I... I had to be careful
as well out here,

1411
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:10,406
because I knew these guys
were packing.

1412
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:15,744
And... I'd say by
the fire hydrant over there.

1413
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,206
This dude just kind of
came out the cars.

1414
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,292
Shot him pretty much
point blank.

1415
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,839
It was a whole bunch
of his friends, too,

1416
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:28,257
that were behind the cars.

1417
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,884
And I was trying
to shoot them as well.

1418
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:35,180
But it was more like on the
defensive side by that time.

1419
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,265
It was more like,

1420
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:39,476
just to make sure that
they didn't shoot at me.

1421
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,187
It's funny because
this block itself

1422
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,981
has claimed a lot of lives.

1423
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,482
This one particular block
right here.

1424
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,819

HARDIMAN:
Do you all think
we can establish

1441
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:42,206
some type of coexistence or
peace up in Fenger High School

1442
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,458
if we all work together?

1443
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,293
STUDENT:
Fenger can be
a better place

1444
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,046
if the Gardens won't
come up to there, trying to...

1445
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,464
(abrupt laughter)

1446
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,840
HARDIMAN:
Listen, hear her out.

1447
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,133
Hear... give everybody
respect.

1448
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,343
Hear her out,
hear her out.

1449
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,512
I live in Altgeld Gardens.

1450
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,139
And, all this, it's the Gardens,
and they animals.

1451
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,391
It's both ways.

1452
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:04,937
MAN:
You young men and women
have to place

1453
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,480
a value and a vision
on your life.

1454
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,692
Look at yourself 15 years
down the road.

1455
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,235
You will be a full adult.

1456
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,071
I cannot believe that I'm
looking at what has happened

1457
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,364
to the young people here.

1458
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,825
You don't have to
fight anybody.

1459
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,329
Everybody don't think
the same way.

1460
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,331
Everybody don't
think the same way.

1461
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,875
This is not about me
being an old lady

1462
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,086
and telling somebody what they
should and should not do.

1463
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,337
It's about
you all's life.

1464
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,714
And you all need to be heard

1465
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,466
all the way through
ends of sentences.

1466
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,260
So I'm gonna throw
some scenarios at you,

1467
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:39,430
and I want you all
to just answer honestly.

1468
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,889
One of your friends
was just beat up

1469
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,725
at a party over the weekend.

1470
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,437
You see a couple of kids
that your friend identifies

1471
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,355
as the dude
that stole on him.

1472
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:51,233
What do you think
would happen next?

1473
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,944
I feel that we gonna fight.

1474
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,780
Because it wasn't...
it wasn't no problem

1475
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,074
when they jumped on my friend
over the weekend,

1476
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,368
so if we see them walking,
we gonna fight.

1477
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:02,745
It ain't like y'all put it.

1478
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:03,829
It's not that easy.

1479
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,415
You might walk away
and somebody might put...

1480
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,376
hit you in your head
with a bat or something.

1481
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:11,378
Who like to fight?

1482
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,381
I don't like to fight,
but I'll fight if I have to.

1483
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:17,843
That's how it is,
but... I'll fight.

1484
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:18,802
I'll fight anybody.

1485
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,471
Everybody fighting.

1486
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:21,638
Why you so angry?

1487
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,182
Why... why you love to fight?

1488
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,100
Because it's just the way
I was brought up.

1489
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,393
I just always had to fight.

1490
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,395
Always had to fight.

1491
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,398
Basically.

1492
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,692
MATTHEWS:
It's hard out there.

1493
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:37,196
When I grew up, I used to wake
up wanting to bite somebody.

1494
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,448
Just bite somebody.

1495
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:43,410
And I understand a hellraiser
liking to fight.

1496
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,953
But walking away
from a fight

1497
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,413
ain't always meaning
that you punk.

1498
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,126
... not to them.

1499
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,920
When they look at it,

1500
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,005
they gonna think you a punk
and little bitch and all that.

1501
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,508
But...

1502
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,427
MATTHEWS:
As I got older
and weighed out my consequences

1503
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,596
and saw everybody that I was
raised with that loved to fight

1504
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,431
was in the penitentiary
or dead.

1505
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,849
Does that mean
you a punk, still?

1506
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,729
HARDIMAN:
It's a myth that most of
the violence is gang-related

1507
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,065
because a lot of the violence
is interpersonal conflict.

1508
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,068
Guys get into it for the most
pettiest reasons out here.

1509
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,695
So it's all about respect
and disrespect.

1510
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:21,824
Not being accepted
in the overall society,

1511
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,284
a lot of people feel ostracized,
so what they do?

1512
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,454
They try to dominate
their surroundings.

1513
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,706
MATTHEWS:
I didn't eat this morning.

1514
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:33,377
I'm wearing my niece's clothes.

1515
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:41,260
I just was violated
by my mom's boyfriend.

1516
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:46,932
I go to school and here comes
someone that bumps into me

1517
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:50,936
and don't say excuse me.

1518
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:57,734
You hit zero to rage
within 30 seconds.

1519
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:01,405
And you act out.

1520
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,908
BOCANEGRA:
Some of these kids, man,
they don't care about tomorrow.

1521
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,285
"Fuck tomorrow."

1522
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,786
That's what they gonna tell you.

1523
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:11,415
"I'm trying to survive today,
right now.

1524
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,499
"I'm trying to live right now.

1525
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,585
"I'm trying to make sure
I don't get shot.

1526
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,504
"I'm trying to make sure that my
boy next to me doesn't get shot.

1527
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:20,507
"And if he does, guess what?

1528
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:23,510
I'm gonna go over there
and shoot them too."

1529
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,366
SLUTKIN:
So this is what violence
interrupters do.

1530
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:50,537
Focused like a laser on reducing
shootings and killings.

1531
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:54,541
And then the deeper part of the
whole program is changing norms.

1532
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,294
In Chicago,
the interrupters

1533
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,922
have interrupted
about 1,400 such events.

1534
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:04,551
We average about a 40% to 45%
drop in shootings and killings

1535
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,970
in the areas
where we are put in.

1536
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:11,558
Have you had incidents
where the police feel

1537
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:16,855
that you should have given them
information and you didn't,

1538
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,484
and that you were
on the side of the offenders?

1539
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,487
If we were to do that,
we would not be effective.

1540
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,447
KERR:
We are trying
to keep CeaseFire

1541
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:29,534
neutral, uh, politically,
as far as the relationship

1542
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,495
with law enforcement
and the community.

1543
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,622
I mean, I'm confused
when you say neutral.

1544
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,083
How are you seen as being
a neutral force in that area?

1545
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,378
Because there's right
and there's wrong.

1546
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:42,589
KERR:
It's not about right
and wrong on one side.

1547
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:45,300
We don't want law enforcement
thinking

1548
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,594
that we are coddling
these criminals

1549
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:48,971
and we're hiding information

1550
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,598
so they can continue
doing negative behavior.

1551
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,475
And we don't want
the community thinking

1552
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,311
that we're stool pigeons
reporting information

1553
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,605
that they give us
to law enforcement.

1554
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,607
You know, the right and wrong
of these conflicts

1555
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,609
is all point of view.

1556
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,612
Whether you're going to take it
back one day or five years

1557
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,990
or 200 years.

1558
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:10,283
I mean, everyone
has got a grievance,

1559
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,620
and so we just have to say that
no matter what,

1560
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:16,915
the additional violence
isn't going to be helpful.

1561
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:21,420
So we're not in the, um,
the good and bad game.

1562
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,465
We're not in that drama.

1563
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,552
It's just hard, because
these guys are still, uh,

1564
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,637
cut from the code
of the streets.

1565
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,681
I've seen the faces
of the Interrupters

1566
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:36,101
when we hear that
a seven-year-old girl got shot.

1567
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,520
Interrupters say, "Man,
something needs to be done."

1568
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,231
But it's hard for these brothers
to make that quantum leap

1569
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,651
into turning somebody in.

1570
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,653
The police support CeaseFire,

1571
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:49,489
but when they first started
down here, I got criticized.

1572
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,366
You know, from everybody,
police,

1573
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,452
people down here
on CeaseFire staff.

1574
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,828
You know, when you are hiring
all these, you know,

1575
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,288
go for tough guys.

1576
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,666
But how the hell you really
gonna stop the violence?

1577
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,668
CHINA JOE:
We was mediating
that situation,

1578
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,838
a guy recently was released
from prison,

1579
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,673
and he thought the man
was talking about him.

1580
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:09,217
And got out the car and punched
the man and his brother...

1581
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,511
HARDIMAN:
China Joe was known
as the Gladiator.

1582
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:15,015
All vice lords had to fight
China Joe to become a vice lord.

1583
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,683
How do you think that makes
a young guy feel?

1584
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:19,478
"Man, China Joe just told me
to stand down."

1585
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,063
CHINA JOE:
...all good,
he shook his hand, hugged him,

1586
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:22,981
and we left it at that.

1587
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,150
BOCANEGRA:
Hey, what's up?

1588
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,778
BOCANEGRA:
Interrupters, you know,
our intentions are noble,

1589
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,279
and they're good.

1590
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,573
But sometimes we don't always
go at it the right way.

1591
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,992
I'm not in the streets anymore.

1592
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,787
You can't take the law
into your own hand, you can't.

1593
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,707
As an Interrupter, that has been
one of our greatest challenges.

1594
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,293
When Violence Interrupters have
to use the threat of violence

1595
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,462
to actually mediate a conflict,

1596
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,631
this is where the rubber
meets the road at.

1597
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,382
Because in reality,

1598
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:53,053
you cannot mediate conflicts
without confrontation.

1599
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,389
PHONE VOICE:
First saved message.

1600
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,724
WILLIAMS:
He left me a voicemail.

1601
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:58,600
What up there.

1602
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,230
WILLIAMS:
I got a call
from a guy I met in jail.

1603
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,273
He said this guy sent some
police in his house,

1604
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,025
"Someone here's doing
illegal things."

1605
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:13,115
WILLIAMS:
Said the police kicked his door
in, locked up his brother,

1606
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,117
they threw handcuffs
on his mother.

1607
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:16,785
And he talking about he knew

1608
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,954
who had sent the police
in his house.

1609
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,248
He was looking for 'em.

1610
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,750
(talking on phone)

1611
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,043
Fuck that pussy-ass nigger.

1612
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,169
What's up, what's up?

1613
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,755
WILLIAMS:
My man Flamo,
he'll make you laugh.

1614
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,841
But if you fuck with him,
you better bring it on.

1615
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,384
These motherfuckers
came here, man.

1616
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,594
Had my motherfucking mama
handcuffed.

1617
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,346
My little brother handcuffed
and shit, man.

1618
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,764
Took my little brother,
the one that got shot.

1619
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,599
In a fucking wheelchair, man.

1620
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,934
Took him to jail.

1621
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,937
But still though man, you got
to try to leave that shit alone.

1622
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,398
Man, I ain't leaving shit alone
until I get these motherfuckers.

1623
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:48,733
You already know how I get down.

1624
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,360
I mean, but that shit
ain't gonna make no...

1625
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,070
Boy, it's gonna make it
better for me.

1626
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,780
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother,

1627
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:54,823
but still though,
that don't make shit no right.

1628
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:55,824
Oh damn, I need my phone.

1629
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:56,783
That ain't gonna make shit
no better, though.

1630
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:57,784
Fuck making it better.

1631
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,497
I can't, you know...

1632
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,793
Man, you crazy man,
be out here like this.

1633
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,170
I'm listening to you, man.

1634
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:09,379
It's love, and everything.

1635
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,797
But I ain't feeling that,
none of this shit.

1636
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,132
And I respect y'all,
you know what I'm saying,

1637
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,925
what you doing and everything,
that's cool.

1638
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,677
But fuck that.

1639
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,804
I'm not with CeaseFire.

1640
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:18,805
Where was y'all at

1641
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,515
when these motherfuckers
came kicking my door in?

1642
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,809
What I'm saying is, we can't
erase what already happened,

1643
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,604
but the whole thing is, you
gotta look at it like, man...

1644
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,855
You can't erase what happened.

1645
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:27,981
You right.

1646
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,400
And you can't predict
what the fuck I'm finna do.

1647
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,359
Shit...

1648
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,819
You know, we just try
to work shit out.

1649
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:34,821
PHILLIPS:
We try to offer you options
and solutions to the problem.

1650
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:35,822
Man, fuck this shit.

1651
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,532
Fuck a problem.

1652
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:38,825
Fuck a solution.

1653
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,911
These motherfuckers

1654
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,245
trying to take my shit.

1655
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,831
You ain't just crossed me,
you crossed my fucking mama.

1656
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,708
For my mama, nigga,
I come in your crib

1657
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,335
and kill every
motherfucking body.

1658
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,837
WILLIAMS:
Two of your brothers gone.

1659
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,215
If you be gone, that ain't gonna
do nothing but hurt your mama.

1660
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:55,508
She'll be all right.

1661
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,052
WILLIAMS:
How many kids you got?

1662
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,887
I'm claiming four, that's it.

1663
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:00,347
All right,
I'm just saying,

1664
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:01,890
so if you go to jail, who gonna
take care of your kids?

1665
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,183
That's the thing.

1666
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,643
God taking care of us now.

1667
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,436
He gonna take care of them.

1668
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,896
Just like when I do
what I'm gonna do.

1669
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,606
He gonna take care of me too.

1670
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,858
But you was locked up before
for the same shit though.

1671
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,610
Man, I been...
I'm 32 years old.

1672
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,111
I been locked up
15 years of my life.

1673
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:16,238
What that mean?

1674
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:18,281
What the fuck that mean?

1675
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,532
That's where I grew up at.

1676
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:20,825
God damnit.

1677
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,327
Ain't no shame,
ain't no secret.

1678
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,745
Shit.

1679
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,622
I'm tired of being out here
any motherfucking ways.

1680
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,873
It's boring as hell,

1681
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,292
soft-ass niggers out here
ain't doing shit but tricking.

1682
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,086
That ain't the police, is it?

1683
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,921
What's that on the corner?

1684
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,882
I know these punk ass police
still want me.

1685
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,801
Motherfuckers gonna have
to kill me.

1686
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,594
WILLIAMS:
Now that shit crazy, man.

1687
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,762
How can you help me?

1688
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:41,888
Right now.

1689
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,139
How can you help me?

1690
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:44,891
I mean, the only thing,
like I say,

1691
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,602
the only thing I can do is try
to get to know you more,

1692
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,355
spend a little time with you,
and try to work with you, man.

1693
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,232
So that mean you would
take me out to dinner, then?

1694
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,900
We can go to lunch right now.

1695
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:54,859
And we can sit down,

1696
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,278
we can talk about this
motherfucking problem.

1697
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:57,570
That's what you telling me?

1698
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,155
Yeah, yeah.

1699
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:00,782
I'm gonna hold you to that
goddamn shit.

1700
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,450
Yeah, we could go out
if that's what you wanna do.

1701
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,326
When? When?

1702
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,119
We could go out now.

1703
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,161
Right now? Yeah.

1704
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,913
Let me go put my pistol up.

1705
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,915
WILLIAMS:
Shit, I don't know.

1706
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:09,916
We'll just see.

1707
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:14,587
Hot Rod, make sure though, man,
he ain't got shit on him.

1708
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:15,922
I'm... I'm good.

1709
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,090
I ain't got nothing.

1710
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,967
WILLIAMS:
It's a rough one.

1711
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:22,345
I think that's one of
the worst ones I had.

1712
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:26,016
He kept coming
and going with us.

1713
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,101
One minute I think I'm reaching
him, he calmed down.

1714
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,770
And then he blow right back up.

1715
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,982
Anytime you got a person who
stay there and talk with you,

1716
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,943
you got a chance of working
it out with them.

1717
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,570
Melvin, these... this is
the time of the month

1718
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:39,946
we go over the conflicts
that we turn in once a month.

1719
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,906
WILLIAMS:
Before the meeting started,

1720
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,241
Tio talked to him
for a nice little minute.

1721
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,493
Tio was telling him,
"Just come listen.

1722
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,745
"Just check it out.

1723
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,663
If you don't like it,
you can walk out right away."

1724
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:49,998
HARDIMAN:
I'm gonna shift the agenda

1725
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,916
to just bring up
a hypothetical problem

1726
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,252
that's taking place
somewhere in our town.

1727
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:57,422
Let's say somebody tricked
on your brother.

1728
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,924
And somebody called the police

1729
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,052
and said that he has
some guns in the house.

1730
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,595
And the police came
and locked your brother up.

1731
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,972
They found two guns,

1732
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,974
and they put your mother
in handcuffs.

1733
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,227
And you know who the guy is
that told on your brothers.

1734
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,813
Now, how would we resolve
a conflict like that?

1735
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,899
INTERRUPTER # 1:
If we gonna keep it 100,
that's real real hard.

1736
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,276
When you put mama into
somebody else's business,

1737
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,944
that's... that's
super duper hard.

1738
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,071
INTERRUPTER #2:
We're not gonna be able
to be effective

1739
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,864
in all interventions.

1740
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:23,990
Okay.

1741
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,784
There's gonna be some that gonna
slip through the cracks.

1742
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,077
INTERRUPTER #3:
I let him know that,

1743
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,080
"Hey, you get messed up,
you add to the burden."

1744
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,581
So what you gotta do is

1745
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,958
you gotta put your little
personal pride aside

1746
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,502
and start dealing
with this thing

1747
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,921
on a realistic,
responsible way

1748
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,173
to start trying to figure out
a way to get your brother

1749
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:43,176
from up out of that drama
and ease your mother.

1750
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,011
You wanna be tough to be a hero,

1751
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:48,431
going to be like the rest
of our guys who's locked up.

1752
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,516
HARDIMAN:
I think that's good for now.

1753
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,725
Got some solid feedback.

1754
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:51,935
Leave it alone at that.

1755
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,061
All right, so this is what's
happening right now.

1756
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,021
We got a situation over at
Michelle Clark High School.

1757
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,065
HARDIMAN:
I think when you first started
meeting with him,

1758
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,024
he was on ten.

1759
01:18:58,109 --> 01:18:59,025
Right.

1760
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,860
And now I think he's at,
like, a level five.

1761
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,028
Okay.

1762
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:05,031
The only problem now, Cobe, if
he was to see this guy tonight,

1763
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,741
there's gonna be a problem.

1764
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,244
What's gonna happen now,
you gotta babysit him.

1765
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,537
You and Hot Rod
gonna have to take turns.

1766
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,329
Okay.

1767
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,747
I know you tired of waiting.

1768
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:13,998
Let's get out of here, man.

1769
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:14,999
CeaseFire for life.

1770
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,042
Man, about time.

1771
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:18,044
HARDIMAN:
Cobe is one of the best
Violence Interrupters,

1772
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,046
but he knows how to walk away.

1773
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,506
That's very important,

1774
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,841
because if you don't know
how to walk away,

1775
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,759
you can end up getting hurt.

1776
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,056
8424?

1777
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,058
HARDIMAN:
We've had some close calls.

1778
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:34,185
Several Violence Interrupters
have been shot at.

1779
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,520
Brother Joel.

1780
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:36,646
Still in a lot of pain?

1781
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,773
HARDIMAN:
This is the first time

1782
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,067
one of our Violence Interrupters
ever got shot.

1783
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,694
I came up here to tell you
we appreciate you.

1784
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,279
And, uh, everything you did

1785
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:45,780
to try to mediate
that particular conflict.

1786
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,658
I'm just glad
you, uh, survived.

1787
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:49,451
You know?

1788
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:50,785
Yeah.

1789
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,079
You stumbled across this coming
out of your father's house.

1790
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,206
There was a couple guys
down the block

1791
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:58,001


arguing over some money.

1792
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:02,964
As I was approaching them, I had
like, something telling me,

1793
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,467
like, it wasn't even the right
moment to even interrupt them.

1794
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,093
Right.

1795
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,845
I'm just trying to,
you know, do my job.

1796
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,597
One of them said,
"Who are you?

1797
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:11,890
You ain't from around here."

1798
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,641
So I go talk
to his other friend.

1799
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,436
And then, um, and that's when
he shot me up.

1800
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,979
When you turned
your back?

1801
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,355
Yeah, when I turned my back.

1802
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,733
So you got shot in the ankle
and in the back, right?

1803
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,110
They opened my whole stomach
open.

1804
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,279
Yeah, that's tough
little brother.

1805
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:28,490
Um, because the day
you got shot

1806
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,367
there were like 16 shootings
in six hours.

1807
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,453
Because I need you to know, all
the guys came up here Friday.

1808
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,121
All the brothers
were here.

1809
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,706
Yeah, Zale was telling me.

1810
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,124
Yeah, we were here,
you know.

1811
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,292
And, uh, hmm...

1812
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,014
It's... it's just kinda tough,
that's all.

1813
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:53,806
I understand.

1814
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:55,308
Right.

1815
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,687
When I thought about you,
uh, getting shot

1816
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,147
and your father
was there--

1817
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,149
because I have sons, you know,
got a son who's, like, 24,

1818
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,652
got another son that's, like,
28 years old,

1819
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:06,653
believe it or not--

1820
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:07,904
So when I thought about it...

1821
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,030
(clears throat)

1822
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:16,246
I gotta collect myself,
that's all.

1823
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,164
Yep.

1824
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,208
And I'm only human,
you know.

1825
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,168
Yep, we be good,
we be all right though.

1826
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,628
You know, we just gotta
keep on pushing.

1827
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,796
Okay?

1828
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,130
Appreciate you,
little brother.

1829
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,840
All right.

1830
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:29,884
Okay, I'm gonna
get on up out of here.

1831
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,302
And I'll be back Wednesday.

1832
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,221
All right.

1833
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:34,264
Yep.

1834
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,640
Oh man.

1835
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:36,641
Yeah.

1836
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:55,368
MATTHEWS:
I'm begging you, my brothers,
I'm begging you, my sisters,

1837
01:21:55,494 --> 01:22:02,500
let God do what God needs to do
for Duke.

1838
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:08,256
Once we lay this brother down in
the ground, we got work to do.

1839
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,800
MATTHEWS:
Jesse Smith got shot
in a retaliation

1840
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,219
for another student
that got shot.

1841
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,723
But it wasn't Jesse
that did the shooting.

1842
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:20,935
The family has to heal,
and we have work to do.

1843
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,771
SPENCER LEAK:
I'm just seeing
in the last ten, 15 years,

1844
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:28,151
random violence like I've never
seen it before.

1845
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:30,862
Last year, of the 125 homicides

1846
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,573
where we serviced
those families,

1847
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,658
about 90% were young people.

1848
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,078
These children don't expect
to live past 30.

1849
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:43,416
They come to these funerals, and
I watch them and they represent,

1850
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,627
and they put themselves

1851
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:49,047
in the place of the person
in the casket.

1852
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,966
These young people are,
in reality, saying,

1853
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:56,512
"This is what I want to happen
when I'm killed."

1854
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,390
Affectionately known as Duke...

1855
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,267
MATTHEWS:
I heard little buzzes in the air

1856
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,853
that they were coming
to shoot the funeral up

1857
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,272
to get the person that
they were intending to get.

1858
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:09,525
I called for all hands on deck.

1859
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:12,445
Left behind his loving mother,
Lanea Smith.

1860
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,281
MATTHEWS:
The mother got in touch
with CeaseFire.

1861
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,866
I've never met
this mother before.

1862
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:22,288
She said, "I need you
to be there, Ameena."

1863
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:26,501
I just would want somebody
to do that for my son.

1864
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,253
(crying)

1865
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:30,421
A lot of y'all
might not know me, but...

1866
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:52,527
They woke me out of my sleep
and said my baby was gone.

1867
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:56,406
That's my baby, that's my heart.

1868
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,366
Rest in peace, baby,
I love you.

1869
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:07,375
MATTHEWS:
I need everybody
from the ages

1870
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,544
of 13 to 24 to stand up.

1871
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:16,050
CROWD:
Go ahead, go ahead.

1872
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,845
I'm the second oldest daughter
to Jeff Fort.

1873
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,930
To ones that call Malik Chief.

1874
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,349
And I'm fed up.

1875
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:27,729
Because each and every one of
you all can be Duke right here.

1876
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,648
I'm gonna be real honest
with you all, because see,

1877
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,358
we real talking up in here,

1878
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:34,235
because Duke is real,
laying right in front of us.

1879
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:37,447
And it's a reason why
this brother is here.

1880
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:40,241
I see these red caps.

1881
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,577
My brothers.

1882
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:46,247
I know we hurt
because we love Duke.

1883
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,374
But we got a responsibility

1884
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:52,044
to bring up our community
to be vibrant.

1885
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:57,091
Whatever it is that's going on,
cease the fire, call a truce.

1886
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,350
LEAK:
I was the chauffeur
for Dr. Martin Luther King

1887
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:10,772
when SCLC made their first
venture into the north

1888
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,900
by way of Chicago.

1889
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,403
The black community,
we were the nobodies.

1890
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:23,409
And the Civil Rights era gave us
hope that we could be somebody.

1891
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:27,079
How can the president of the
United States be a black man?

1892
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:30,291
I never thought I'd see that
in my lifetime.

1893
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,835
But while I'm seeing
the president on television

1894
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,422
and the images of him
leading the free world,

1895
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,549
I'm still burying black kids.

1896
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,176
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

1897
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:52,480
WILLIAMS:
Oh, I'm gonna get stuck
in this snow.

1898
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:53,439
Where my man at?

1899
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:54,357
Where he at?

1900
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,234
Where Flamo?

1901
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,152
How you doing, sir?

1902
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,445
I'm all right.

1903
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:00,446
Hold on.

1904
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,948
Okay.

1905
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,449
What's up, what's up, Flamo?

1906
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,868
How you feeling today, man?

1907
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,453
Yeah. You all right?

1908
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:08,496
How things been
going for you?

1909
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:12,458
FLAMO:
Well, you know,
I can't sell drugs right now,

1910
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,335
so I got to gamble.

1911
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,711
Man, I just lost.

1912
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,505
WILLIAMS:
You talking about
the Super Bowl?

1913
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,673
FLAMO:
Yeah, man.

1914
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,132
I'm a sore loser.

1915
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:22,385
I'm ready to get my money back,

1916
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,470
but you know I ain't come
with the game, man.

1917
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,471
I'm just so happy, man,

1918
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,932
you calmed down though,
man, you know?

1919
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,268
You been thinking
in another way,

1920
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,644
and that's...
that's very good, man.

1921
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,770
Man...

1922
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,480
It's hard.

1923
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,899
I wanna stop doing what I'm
doing, but shit, don't push me.

1924
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,484
Right.

1925
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,528
FLAMO:
And you know the good thing?

1926
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:43,698
I stopped a little commotion
on the block a little while ago.

1927
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:44,907
WILLIAMS:
You stopped something today?

1928
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:45,992
Yeah.

1929
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,369
As I'm talking to him,

1930
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:51,247
I see they want somebody
to intervene and stop him

1931
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,875
and tell him to go his way
and he go his way.

1932
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,627
You intervened and stopped
all that from happening?

1933
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,296
Yeah.

1934
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:00,047
So how do you feel about
what you did?

1935
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:04,385
Personally, at the time,

1936
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,388
I just felt like these
motherfuckers were making noise

1937
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,515
and I'm upstairs watching TV
and trying to get high.

1938
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:12,727
And they made a big-ass scene
in front of the crib.

1939
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,146
So shit, I tell them
to move on

1940
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,939
or I'm gonna get in there,
fuck them both up.

1941
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,026
WILLIAMS:
Oh, Flamo, nonviolence,
nonviolence.

1942
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,529
I'm gonna be waiting right here
on the side, Rodney.

1943
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,990
Okay?

1944
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,533
Oh!

1945
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,035
What's that in your hand?

1946
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:30,077
It's a blunt, man.

1947
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,495
Hey man, but Flamo, man,

1948
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:32,830
let me tell you,
I don't ride like that,

1949
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,333
you know, I don't ride with no
blunts and shit in here, man.

1950
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,043
I know, man, that's why
I ain't tell you, see?

1951
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:38,711
Well, I'm saying you should have
enough respect for me,

1952
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:39,921
don't do that though.

1953
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:42,798
Police pull up, everybody
in here gonna go to jail.

1954
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,884
Let me get rid of
the evidence.

1955
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,344
Hell, man,

1956
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,553
that ain't cool at all.

1957
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:48,554
FLAMO:
I wasn't thinking.

1958
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,557
WILLIAMS:
You weren't thinking?

1959
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:52,725
That's why I'm trying
to get into the mode

1960
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,185
of doing what's right, man.

1961
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:58,564
I know I got a little screws
missing on the attitude side.

1962
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:00,232
I used to want
to get in tune

1963
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,193
with the gang bangers
and gun slingers.

1964
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,905
Like, wasn't none
of that worth it.

1965
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,575
Because out all the stuff
I had to do and done back then,

1966
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,411
I ain't got nothing
to show for.

1967
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,581
None that I done, negative.

1968
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,667
My friends in jail.

1969
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:21,587
My friends, drug addicts
or whatever.

1970
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:24,966
It seemed like you know how
life repeat itself as a cycle.

1971
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:29,637
You just be one the persons
that telling the story.

1972
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:32,598
I'm trying to be one of the ones
telling the story.

1973
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,183
I don't wanna be the one

1974
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,478
just living lifestyle
on these streets, struggling

1975
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:41,607
and, you know, gotta keep
harming, doing wrong

1976
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,567
and all this other nonsense.

1977
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:52,159
All right, man,
I'm gonna holler at you, boy.

1978
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,411
All right,
CeaseFire brother.

1979
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:54,495
CeaseFire.

1980
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:05,172
WILLIAMS:
Today I brought this young man
home from prison.

1981
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,843
He'd been gone for like two or
three years for armed robbery.

1982
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,637
I've been knowing him
and his family for a long time

1983
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,180
and the only thing
he kept saying,

1984
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,474
he wanna see his little brother
and his two sisters.

1985
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:27,653
What's up, C?

1986
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,783
It's gonna be all right.

1987
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,995
It's been a long time.

1988
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,329
SISTER:
Yes.

1989
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:38,664
A lot of changes.

1990
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:39,582
Mm-hmm.

1991
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:40,708
Long time.

1992
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,960
You know, two years
and ten months.

1993
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:47,256
Before you went to jail,
I really, like,

1994
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,718
noticed you as Lil' Mikey, but
now you not Lil' Mike no more.

1995
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:56,682
Hated it, but I ain't gotta
do that no more.

1996
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:59,310
I missed your graduation.

1997
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:00,686
I ain't gonna miss yours.

1998
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,689
And I definitely
ain't gonna miss yours.

1999
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,692
What about that role model paper
momma was telling me about?

2000
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:08,861
BROTHER:
It's about you and me.

2001
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,113
About how I miss you.

2002
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,325
I hope you get to see one
sometimes.

2003
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:15,618
Right.

2004
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,870
This the old Mikey that you say
was your role model, right?

2005
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:18,871
Mm-hmm.

2006
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,915
I don't want him
to be your role model,

2007
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:24,335
because he was a different
person than he was at home

2008
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,088
than he was on the block.

2009
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,756
Hopefully this Mikey
will be your role model.

2010
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:30,216
BROTHER:
Uh-huh.

2011
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:33,344
WILLIAMS:
Your daddy will be coming
home soon, won't he?

2012
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:36,722
2013.

2013
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,140
How long your daddy
been gone?

2014
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,391
17 years.

2015
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:43,729
MIKEY:
I'm here for ya.

2016
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,734
I'm here for y'all, now.

2017
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:56,742
Too long.

2018
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,746
WILLIAMS:
It's real tough for people
get out of prison, man.

2019
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,665
And lot of times
when you get out of prison

2020
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,209
when you can't find no job,
you get discouraged

2021
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:08,087
and like, "Man, it's hard
out here, man.

2022
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:11,757
Should I go back to doing
the shit I used to do?"

2023
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,259
WILLIAMS:
He sent me
a text message.

2024
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:14,593
He got a new phone number?

2025
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,054
ANDREA:
When he got out,
he tried really hard.

2026
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,848
Until he found his job.

2027
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,266
WILLIAMS:
A-ha!

2028
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:24,270
Where your boy at,
Stephon?

2029
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,356
ANDREA:
Even when they laid him off,
he was very active.

2030
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,150
I'd be like,
"Why are you going out there,

2031
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,776
you're not getting paid."

2032
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,069
It's like, "Because."

2033
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,112
(Andrea laughs)

2034
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,406
"Eventually they'll get
some funding.

2035
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,782
"I have to go, though.

2036
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,868
This is what I'm supposed
to be doing."

2037
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:42,788
And he stuck with it,
and he's back.

2038
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,575
Get your Mother's Day gift!

2039
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:25,122
I made that print up,
but it ain't dry yet.

2040
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:38,844
BOCANEGRA:
Today's a big day for, uh,
the students at Namaste.

2041
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:41,305
Putting up their artwork
that we worked on

2042
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:42,848
this past couple of months...

2043
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,600
Yay, he's here.

2044
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:47,269
You're like, damn, about
time he shows up, right?

2045
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,771
How you been?

2046
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:49,647
Good.

2047
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:51,857
How about by the neighborhood?

2048
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:53,692
A kid got shot.

2049
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,528
Paralyzed
from the waist down.

2050
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:57,655
Did you know him?

2051
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:58,280
Yeah.

2052
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,782
He lived downstairs from us.

2053
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:00,866
Really?

2054
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:01,867
Oh, my gosh.

2055
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,787
TEACHER:
If anything like that
happens, guys,

2056
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:06,997
now you know you could get
in touch with Eddie.

2057
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:09,708
Especially if you just
want to talk, you know.

2058
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,585
You guys can tell me
these things too, you know.

2059
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:14,380
Yeah?

2060
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,422
No? No?

2061
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,300
Eddie's a little bit more
equipped to deal with it.

2062
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:19,885
'Cause I've got a cousin
I'm afraid of.

2063
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,720
Because his mom's
in the hospital

2064
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,597
and he started drinking
and smoking.

2065
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:26,433
And he wears a lot
of bad colors.

2066
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,352
So, yeah, I just wanted
to talk to you about that.

2067
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:31,146
STUDENT:
I think he's gonna get shot
or get killed

2068
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:34,900
because of all
the bad stuff that happened.

2069
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:38,362
My cousin, I know he has
a gun like in his bedroom.

2070
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:42,241
Like, um, I don't know, it's
like I'm really afraid for him,

2071
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:49,915
because, like, I don't know,
he might like, um, I don't know.

2072
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,917
You know, I mean your cousin
probably right now

2073
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,794
feels kinda hopeless,
feels probably like he's alone.

2074
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,922
Why not do these things?
you know.

2075
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,424
"Nobody cares if
I get locked up.

2076
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,925
Nobody cares if I get shot."

2077
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,137
I think he still can change.

2078
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,639
Like, how I know,
like how you told us

2079
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:09,601
about how you were in a gang
and stuff, and how you changed.

2080
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:11,312
But you know also
it takes time.

2081
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:12,938
It took time for me.

2082
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:15,190
It took a long time for me.

2083
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:16,942
You tell me like where he's at,

2084
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:20,321
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go to his
house and I'll talk to him.

2085
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:21,989
I mean, I wish
your cousin was here

2086
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,657
just to listen
to what you're saying,

2087
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:25,492
because I'm sure he'd probably
be touched and moved

2088
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:28,954
by how you feel about it, and
how concerned you are about him.

2089
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:32,958
And them guys would love to have
you, you know, in their circle.

2090
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,962
But when they see you doing
right, they see you doing good,

2091
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:40,090
it's like they look at that
and they envy that,

2092
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:42,551
because they wish they were
in your shoes.

2093
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,845
And these guys keep messing
with you, man,

2094
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:48,390
just call me, bro, call me.

2095
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,391
All right?

2096
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,100
Yeah.

2097
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,644
All right, cool, bro.

2098
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:53,979
All right, man.

2099
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,774
We were waiting for you
for the complete set.

2100
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:57,983
It looks great.

2101
01:34:58,068 --> 01:34:59,985
BOCANEGRA:
So who's doing the honor
of hanging them up now?

2102
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:01,987
Fit sort of in there

2103
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:03,989
and be careful not to poke
a hole through the canvas.

2104
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:05,074
Very creative.

2105
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,159
TEACHER:
So, yes, what
do you think?

2106
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,160
Right here?

2107
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,787
Line it up?

2108
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:10,996
BOCANEGRA:
The words that I painted

2109
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:13,707
are words that they themselves
came up with.

2110
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:14,375
STUDENT:
Wounded,

2111
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:17,920
dragged down,
painful, lonely,

2112
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:19,004
shattered, destroyed...

2113
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:22,508
BOCANEGRA:
That expressed what they felt
about violence.

2114
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:28,013
Revived, repaired, recovering,
fixing, curing...

2115
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,640
BOCANEGRA:
And about moving forward.

2116
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,893
Rejoice, hope, healed.

2117
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:38,982
(everyone clapping)

2118
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,859
BOCANEGRA:
What I see through
these paintings is

2119
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,028
they actually have a lot
of hope for the future.

2120
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,036
The same thing
that we've done in Iraq,

2121
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,038
we could do this right here
in our own backyard.

2122
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:55,999
NANCY PENDER:
Politicians say Chicago's
a warzone

2123
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:58,085
and they want the military
to fight back.

2124
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:00,045
Some lawmakers
want Governor Quinn

2125
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:01,505
to deploy the National Guard

2126
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,507
to Chicago's most dangerous
neighborhoods.

2127
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:09,054
LA SHAWN K. FORD:
And my conversation with
the National Guard was,

2128
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,014
"Is it possible for you
to come in

2129
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:14,059
and assist the Chicago
Police Department?"

2130
01:36:16,146 --> 01:36:18,230
"Shoot to kill"
back in '68.

2131
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,150
You endangering the lives
of all of us!

2132
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:26,655
He comes to the meeting to talk
about gangs, guns and drugs,

2133
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,116
but there's no talk of jobs,
contracts and opportunities.

2134
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:33,579
We got to defend our own people.

2135
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:37,082
We gotta solve our own problems.

2136
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,251
BOCANEGRA:
He has CeaseFire

2137
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,003
and their models
to stop the violence

2138
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:45,340
and in essence, that's just
a band-aid to this big issue

2139
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:46,592
that's going around us.

2140
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:50,387
BOCANEGRA:
Every single day, man,
they asking for jobs.

2141
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,097
They're like,
"I'm stuck right now, man.

2142
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,349
"Like, I don't even know
what to do.

2143
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:56,268
"Like, I'm feeling the pressures
from everywhere.

2144
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:57,603
I'm pretty much gonna be
homeless."

2145
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,731
All these things lead
to violence.

2146
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:04,109
Reducing the violence
is not a band-aid,

2147
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:08,530
it's actually the essential
pathway to a neighborhood

2148
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,324
being able to develop,

2149
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,868
for the schools to be able
to get better,

2150
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:15,287
for the kids to get rid
of their stress disorders,

2151
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,123
for businesses to feel
safe enough and well enough

2152
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:20,292
to be able to come into
these neighborhoods.

2153
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,586
HARDIMAN:
We don't have enough resources
to go around,

2154
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,129
so the doc really just wants

2155
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,547
to change the conversation
around violence.

2156
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,965
Let me finish, all right?

2157
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,425
If you can't feed
these young guys,

2158
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,135
they're not going
to listen to you.

2159
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:31,136
Bottom line.

2160
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,888
HARDIMAN:
Look, the African-American
community

2161
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:33,931
and the Latino community

2162
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:36,725
have been beaten down so long
with poor schools,

2163
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,728
lack of jobs,
hopelessness, despair.

2164
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,855
A lot of people
can't stick with peace

2165
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:47,194
if they don't have a stick
that they can hold on to.

2166
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:51,657
WOMAN:
Break the window, that's on you.

2167
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,200
Break it.

2168
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,368
You going to go to jail.

2169
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,164
I'm not worried.

2170
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:02,417
Ain't nobody putting no fear
in my heart.

2171
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:03,502
Get the fuck away
from my window.

2172
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,090
You ain't got no life.

2173
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,179
This is fucking for real.

2174
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:18,225
This is an everyday,
this is what they do.

2175
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,688
This is what they do
everyday, all day,

2176
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,941
and me being at this site
and being the only female,

2177
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,276
it's not working.

2178
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:28,193
It's not working.

2179
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,195
Okay, this what happened
at the site.

2180
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:32,906
He called me a bitch,
and I spit on him.

2181
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,492
And he came to my window
and spit on me.

2182
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,662
They, they wanna fight me.

2183
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:41,665
They trying to fight me when
I come back to the site.

2184
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,250
But I think I'm gonna just go...

2185
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,668
I'll call the house right now.

2186
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:47,713
Yes, sir.

2187
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,132
You promise me?

2188
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:59,266
Well, let me go ahead and call
my little people from the Greens

2189
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,018
and you know, we could go ahead
and do this,

2190
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:01,685
because I'm not worried.

2191
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,103
Caprysha, shut up.

2192
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,229
He not funna scare me.

2193
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:06,440
And you know, I'm funna hang up,

2194
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:07,441
'cause I'm funna
hang up this phone.

2195
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,484
I'm funna hang up.

2196
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:10,402
He's not gonna be good
until I see you.

2197
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:13,238
I'm gonna come out there.

2198
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:15,616
I'm not, I'm not, you know
I'm actually gonna fight them

2199
01:39:15,742 --> 01:39:16,617
without no problem.

2200
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:17,618
But why?

2201
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:19,703
Why you gonna risk bustin',

2202
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:22,414
getting cut, all of that,
scratched and all that?

2203
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,249
Why?

2204
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,084
You too pretty for that.

2205
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:31,131
My baby.

2206
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:33,050
You gotta be tired.

2207
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,052
You gotta be tired
of that fighting.

2208
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:37,262
You, they, you,
they 18 and 19, I ain't.

2209
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,305
But you can't
spit on nobody.

2210
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,100
That can start a war.

2211
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,268
That's why I be telling...

2212
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:44,436
Did you know that?

2213
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,688
That's why I gonna be telling
people I know you.

2214
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,273
But can't be spitting
on nobody though.

2215
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,275
So what,
knowing me or not.

2216
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:54,279
Them knowing that you know me,
that don't, it's your actions.

2217
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,282
You understand
what I'm saying?

2218
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,534
For real, Mommy,
do you for real?

2219
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:05,207
MATTHEWS:
Caprysha has been
through hell and back.

2220
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,292
It's tough.

2221
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:10,295
Caprysha.

2222
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:14,800
MATTHEWS:
Trying to process emotions about
not having a mom and dad around.

2223
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:22,140
I have a vision in my head
of my dad on this white horse

2224
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:27,813
riding through
79th Street, coming back for me.

2225
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:31,608
Me getting shot in the game
was God telling me,

2226
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:36,113
you got to make
your own choices.

2227
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:39,491
My family knew exactly
who did it,

2228
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:44,329
and I got a phone call from my
dad while I was in the hospital,

2229
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:47,541
telling me how sorry
he was, he apologized,

2230
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,751
it's gonna be some answers
for it.

2231
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:52,254
And why?

2232
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:53,714
Why, Dad?

2233
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,966
Leave that boy alone.

2234
01:40:56,092 --> 01:41:02,347
That was the last encounter
that I had with the game.

2235
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:07,352
And as I look back,
that was my first mediation.

2236
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:15,652
WILLIAMS:
How's that thing been doing
with you, job searching,

2237
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:17,195
everything else?

2238
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,905
MIKEY:
It's been hard.

2239
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,240
I ain't found no job yet.

2240
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:22,159
But I ain't gonna give up.

2241
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,369
WILLIAMS:
I been working with Lil Mikey
for a while.

2242
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,621
Even while he was in prison,
he kept stressing

2243
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:28,415
he wanted to apologize
to them people he robbed

2244
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:29,374
at the barber shop.

2245
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,381
We don't know how this might
turn out.

2246
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:37,632
We going to talk to them.

2247
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:41,386
If they accept it or not,
it's still like...

2248
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,388
I know I made a mistake.

2249
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,390
And I'm asking for y'all
forgiveness.

2250
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:49,728
You kinda nervous
going here?

2251
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:53,774
I think I'm gonna start feeling
it when I get in the shop.

2252
01:41:56,611 --> 01:41:58,403
MIKEY:
How you all doing?

2253
01:41:58,529 --> 01:41:59,446
I understand that...

2254
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:02,407
on August 21 , 2007,
that me and two other fellas

2255
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,868
came in here
and stuck the place up.

2256
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:09,414
I know I'm deeply,
I'm deeply sorry.

2257
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:10,415
I know I made a mistake.

2258
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:11,833
I was 15.

2259
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,419
And I was following the crowd,
but now I'm older.

2260
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,087
I'm more mature than I was.

2261
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:17,380
And I wanted to let y'all know
that I was sorry

2262
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,216
for what I did on my behalf.

2263
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,426
I don't know how these two other
brothers feel about themselves.

2264
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:23,011
But I know I made a complete 360

2265
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:28,809
doing my, uh, almost three years
of being incarcerated.

2266
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:36,066
Well, with me, my daughter
was in here and my baby.

2267
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:39,569
And you just don't know the
impact that you put on my life.

2268
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:43,448
Holding us with guns.

2269
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:46,117
I'm nervous right now
even meeting you.

2270
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:48,453
And I thank God that you have
changed your life,

2271
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:53,250
but you just don't know what
that have did to me and my kids.

2272
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,126
I deal with this every day.

2273
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:57,254
Every day of my life.

2274
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,464
Every day.

2275
01:42:59,465 --> 01:43:02,259
You came in here,
you asked for a haircut.

2276
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:06,888
You left back out,
you came back in.

2277
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,432
And you did this to my kids.

2278
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:13,270
And Jeremy held my baby
with a gun up to his head.

2279
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:15,730
And then felt on my daughter
with a gun.

2280
01:43:15,857 --> 01:43:20,443
And you told my co-worker Rhonda
that you were going to kill her,

2281
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:22,487
because she was calling
the police.

2282
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:24,781
My life was in your hands.

2283
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:27,951
I didn't know if you
was gonna kill me.

2284
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:30,871
My daughter kept saying,
"Mama, we gonna die."

2285
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:36,877
And I hold my babies and when
you want to tell your kids,

2286
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:39,045
when you want to protect
your kids

2287
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,882
and you can't at that moment.

2288
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:46,511
Y'all put up seven people
in the little bathroom.

2289
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:50,098
We didn't even know what was
gonna happen to us.

2290
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:53,393
And right now to this day he
never talk about that robbery.

2291
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:55,312
That was three years ago,
and he just made 13.

2292
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,813
He ain't never said nothing.

2293
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,523
I don't know
what's on his mind,

2294
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:01,526
but I just praying to ask God
don't let him hold that in.

2295
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:04,362
But I'm just glad that
you are a changed man.

2296
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:05,697
You look better.

2297
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:06,698
But you know what?

2298
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:09,534
I'm... I'm okay,
I'm a better person now.

2299
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:12,704
And I hope that you know,
you be a better man.

2300
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,164
That's all I'm saying.

2301
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,749
And I hope
that you are sincere.

2302
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:17,542
And that this man right here,

2303
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:20,086
I mean he helping you
and he making you a better man.

2304
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:24,549
You could've been dead and gone,
but God spared your life.

2305
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,593
This the father right here?

2306
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,136
I would like to see him hug him.

2307
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:33,224
Because you don't owe him
nothin', but you teaching him.

2308
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:36,561
And imagine
what he thinking about.

2309
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:39,272
So it take a lot of gut to walk
back on the surfaces

2310
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,565
that you did dirt on.

2311
01:44:40,566 --> 01:44:43,151
So many cats
we shake hands with

2312
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,236
and they're the same guys
that broke in our house,

2313
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:46,488
we just don't know it.

2314
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:49,699
Same ones raped our sisters,
our mothers, our daughters.

2315
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:53,495
And we know these young guys
today at his age,

2316
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:54,579
they don't come back.

2317
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:59,250
The fact that today you released
something in somebody

2318
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:02,504
and in yourself, you got
to run with that.

2319
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:04,589
All right?

2320
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,424
Yes, sir.

2321
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:09,052
It was hard.
Real hard.

2322
01:45:09,178 --> 01:45:12,097
Like to just relive
what she went through

2323
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:14,975
just in her, I mean,
in my eyes.

2324
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:16,559
But she went through it.

2325
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:23,441
When you first step in,
did you remember them?

2326
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,609
Uh-uh.

2327
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,111
You didn't remember them?

2328
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:28,238
Not at all.

2329
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,004
That'll be $8.25.

2330
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,046
All right.

2331
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,967
BOCANEGRA:
Today, 16 years ago...

2332
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,010
These are nice.

2333
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:53,847
I took someone's life
pretty much.

2334
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,223
And so...

2335
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,142
Hello. Hi.

2336
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,729
BOCANEGRA:
You know, on this date in honor
of the victim in my case,

2337
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,064
I try to do as many good deeds
as I can.

2338
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,942
I try to reach out,
to especially strangers.

2339
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,861
(woman speaking Spanish)

2340
01:46:15,745 --> 01:46:19,664
BOCANEGRA:
I've thought of,
hopefully, one day,

2341
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:21,332
going to my victim's family

2342
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:25,795
and really just expressing
to them how deeply sorry I am.

2343
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:30,508
And whether or not
they accept my apology,

2344
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,679
which I don't think they will,
I really just want to do this.

2345
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:38,683
It's just that right now,
I don't think it's still right.

2346
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:43,480
The last stop of today,

2347
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:47,108
we're going to the cemetery
to visit the family of Miguel,

2348
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:50,570
a kid who was shot and killed
a few weeks ago.

2349
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:55,116
Hello.
How are you doing?

2350
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:56,284
Doing all right?

2351
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,744
BOCANEGRA:
I spoke to Vanessa, his sister,

2352
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:00,830
about some of the issues that
are going in her home right now.

2353
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:06,711
BOCANEGRA:
Now, I never got to meet him,
you know, to be honest.

2354
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:08,713
I know he was a good kid.

2355
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:12,258
I actually brought,
um, a flower, too,

2356
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,719
that I wanted
to drop off, so...

2357
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,773
You mind putting this
on there for me?

2358
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:30,235
BOCANEGRA:
Miguel, he got shot in the head.

2359
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:33,988
Vanessa was actually there
when this happened.

2360
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:36,741
He pretty much died in her arms.

2361
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,411
I think that Vanessa
does feel that

2362
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:42,455
what happened to her brother
was her fault.

2363
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,749
But she can't blame herself

2364
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,752
because somebody else
was ignorant, had a gun,

2365
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:50,046
and shot her brother.

2366
01:48:21,787 --> 01:48:24,789
BOCANEGRA:
Man, that lady goes there
every single day.

2367
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:29,294
That's fucked up, man.

2368
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:32,172
BOCANEGRA:
So to me on this day, same day

2369
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:34,966
that the victim in my case died.

2370
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:36,968
This is it, man.

2371
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:39,262
This is the end result.

2372
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:42,265
You took a life, now you're
paying with your life.

2373
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:44,225
It's, like, "You dumb-ass."

2374
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:56,613
When he finally did go
and get locked away, I was like,

2375
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,282
in my mind I was like,
"No, this isn't happening."

2376
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:03,244
My parents were devastated.

2377
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,747
I mean, my mom, she needed
to sell the house here

2378
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:08,416
that we had in Chicago to pay
for the lawyer fees and...

2379
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:11,211
It was like a 180, you know.

2380
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:12,879
My dad was already
an alcoholic.

2381
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:14,255
He would get drunk,
you know,

2382
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:17,842
and he'd express, you know,
his sorrow.

2383
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:28,394
PAULA BOCANEGRA:

2384
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:43,868
CHILD:
No!

2385
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:54,587
WILLIAMS:
Lil' Mikey,
he showed some initiative

2386
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:59,550
on getting his own job,
his first real job.

2387
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:01,719
WOMAN:
Because if you don't get

2388
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,012
that grass up first,

2389
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:04,889
what's it gonna do is come
right through this paper.

2390
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:07,809
So there's a... there's only
one way to do this is

2391
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:09,978
to do it the right way
so we don't have to redo it.

2392
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:11,896
Okay? Okay?

2393
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:13,064
We got
an understanding. Okay.

2394
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:14,315
Thank you.

2395
01:50:16,402 --> 01:50:18,903
It don't come up.

2396
01:50:18,988 --> 01:50:19,904
She the boss.

2397
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:31,916
Being on the block, you ain't
gotta do this to make money.

2398
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:36,921
Being with my guys all day.

2399
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:39,507
Doing what I wanna do
when I wanna do it

2400
01:50:39,633 --> 01:50:41,301
and how I wanna do it.

2401
01:50:43,429 --> 01:50:49,100
But as long as I'm keeping busy,
I'm gonna be good.

2402
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:57,275
And as you can tell,
this is keeping me busy.

2403
01:51:02,948 --> 01:51:03,990
This is tiring.

2404
01:51:05,242 --> 01:51:06,534
But I can't complain.

2405
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,245
Life good right now, for me.

2406
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:20,131
I got a job.

2407
01:51:20,257 --> 01:51:24,302
All I used to hear,
"You're a class x felon.

2408
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:25,386
You can't do nothing."

2409
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:30,141
I'm doing something.

2410
01:51:43,989 --> 01:51:45,907
You gonna sleep good?

2411
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:51,704
Cuvelle, you don't got this kind
of cover, do you?

2412
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:54,999
That's yours right there.

2413
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,751
I got these.

2414
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:59,003
Here you go, Ja'on.

2415
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:36,374
"Oh, we just wanna know
what's the truth.

2416
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,751
Like what really happened
to your brother."

2417
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:41,963
They're just trying to seem like
they care, but they don't.

2418
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:44,090
The way we kind of spoke
about it is like,

2419
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:46,050
Vanessa will, like,
catch them off guard.

2420
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:47,260
You would say something like,

2421
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:49,554
"I know you're asking because
you really care about me"--

2422
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:52,056
which they don't--
"I'm doing great.

2423
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:53,266
Thanks for asking."

2424
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:54,934
And then...
Walk away.

2425
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,018
That's good.

2426
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:56,769
That's a good one.

2427
01:52:56,895 --> 01:52:58,396
And that way if any of 'em get

2428
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,939
in your face about anything,

2429
01:53:00,065 --> 01:53:01,065
then you just tell Eddie.

2430
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,237
SACLARIDES:
She's even doing things,
like, in his honor

2431
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:07,238
like the art group, right?

2432
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:08,239
Mm-hmm.

2433
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:09,574
What did he always
want to paint?

2434
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:11,534
He wanted to paint
the Virgin Mary,

2435
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,078
but he never got
the chance to do it.

2436
01:53:14,163 --> 01:53:16,247
You know.

2437
01:53:16,373 --> 01:53:18,541
Well, you can do it
for him.

2438
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:21,836
I don't know.

2439
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:24,922
I dreamt that...

2440
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:28,092
My mom went to pick me up at
school with my little sister.

2441
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,512
And then my brother came
from the door and he ran to me.

2442
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:33,556
He gave me a big hug.

2443
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:36,893
He told me, "I'm not dead,
I'm still here with you."

2444
01:53:37,019 --> 01:53:39,103
You think he's with you
right now?

2445
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:40,104
Yeah.

2446
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:42,815
I think so too.

2447
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:44,567
It gets better, believe me.

2448
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:48,112
For some reason,
time kind of heals things.

2449
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:49,113
You know.

2450
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:51,908
Yeah.

2451
01:53:57,206 --> 01:53:58,414
(door chime)

2452
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,750
MAN:
So what else are we doing
to make you beautiful today?

2453
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,585
I don't know.

2454
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:04,128
I was just going with the flow.

2455
01:54:04,213 --> 01:54:06,130
I start school
tomorrow.

2456
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:07,965
MAN:
Excellent.

2457
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,926
And this year's goal
is what?

2458
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:11,385
To graduate.
MAN:
I got you.

2459
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:12,720
Get my high school diploma.

2460
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:17,475
MATTHEWS:
She was saying that tomorrow's
the first day of school

2461
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:20,144
and I'm so excited,
and I was excited for her.

2462
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:22,772
She's going with
a fresh hairdo.

2463
01:54:22,898 --> 01:54:28,194
I went today and found out
school started three weeks ago.

2464
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,321
CAPRYSHA:
And I did go to school.

2465
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:33,032
You went to school when
you got the fuck ready to.

2466
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:34,992
You didn't go up there when it
was time for them to go in.

2467
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,161
Actually, yes, I did, Miss
Ameena, you don't know that.

2468
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:38,412
You don't know that.

2469
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:39,956
Caprysha,
your counselor said

2470
01:54:40,082 --> 01:54:42,166
you got there
when you got there.

2471
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:45,878
No, I got there at
8:55, before everybody.

2472
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,171
Caprysha.
Right.

2473
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:48,589
You didn't fight
hard enough

2474
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:51,342
for you to get up in that school
and do what you need to do.

2475
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:52,635
I ain't
gotta say nothing.

2476
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:55,805
Caprysha, don't nobody have
to kiss your ass

2477
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:58,766
for you to do what you need
to do for you.

2478
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,185
I'm still gonna be the same
person at the end of the day.

2479
01:55:01,186 --> 01:55:03,688
At the end of the day
doing what?

2480
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:05,189
Getting my life together
takes time.

2481
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:06,190
Time for what?

2482
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:09,193
You did two years
out of your life.

2483
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:12,196
Wasn't that enough time for you
to get your life together?

2484
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:16,284
What you do is you manipulate,
you do this and you do that

2485
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:18,202
and then you so ashamed
and afraid

2486
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:21,539
that when I ask you to be honest
with me, you can't.

2487
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:27,044
Do you wanna be loved?
Absolutely.

2488
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:28,379
Do you deserve to be loved?
No.

2489
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:30,214
Absolutely.

2490
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:31,215
Nope.

2491
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,134
First thing,
you gotta love you.

2492
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:34,552
Oh, I love myself.

2493
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:37,138
Caprysha, Caprysha.

2494
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:45,229
When I stopped allowing
the circumstances

2495
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,107
to dictate my life,

2496
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:51,068
when I let that
"fuck everybody" go,

2497
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,903
then I got real honest
with my feelings,

2498
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:56,574
I'm scared, I'm hurting.

2499
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,909
It's okay, though.

2500
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:03,914
CAPRYSHA:
Well, I'm not like you
to open up so easy.

2501
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:05,249
Sorry.

2502
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:07,251
I don't open up so easy.

2503
01:56:07,252 --> 01:56:09,128
I don't open up
so easy.

2504
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:10,963
I open up as needed for me,

2505
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:13,257
because I wanna get better
and continue to stay healthy.

2506
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:15,259
Why you choose not to?

2507
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,261
Because I like my life
how it is now.

2508
01:56:17,387 --> 01:56:18,971
You like your life
doing what?

2509
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:20,556
Shit.

2510
01:56:20,682 --> 01:56:21,641
All right.

2511
01:56:21,767 --> 01:56:24,268
Well, I can't aid
and abet shit.

2512
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:25,936
I flush shit.

2513
01:56:26,063 --> 01:56:28,272
You think everything's bullshit.

2514
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:29,523
You know what, you...

2515
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:30,900
You just said it.

2516
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:32,943
You can keep thinking
everything's bullshit though,

2517
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:33,986
real talk.

2518
01:56:44,289 --> 01:56:46,290
MATTHEWS:
You know, I remember being 19

2519
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,292
and being a scared girl
like that.

2520
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:50,086
You know, me being out there

2521
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:52,129
and doing a lot of things
that I did,

2522
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:56,258
I thought that I really was
getting back at the person

2523
01:56:56,301 --> 01:57:00,971
that I thought that
should come and get me.

2524
01:57:01,098 --> 01:57:04,308
And tell me you ain't gotta
live like that.

2525
01:57:06,895 --> 01:57:10,898
Man, if I could go back

2526
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:14,318
and make that pain go away
for me today...

2527
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:17,530
if I could do that, I would
do it in a heartbeat.

2528
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:24,328
And that's so... so painful
for me for her.

2529
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:27,331
Because she's gonna be
my age someday.

2530
01:57:27,332 --> 01:57:29,875
And it's gonna be
a whole bunch of regrets.

2531
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,342
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

2532
01:57:38,343 --> 01:57:40,803
I must be glutton
for punishment.

2533
01:57:40,929 --> 01:57:45,641
This sucker,
is there a sucker up there?

2534
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:50,229
Now sitting here talking to you,
there was 15 times

2535
01:57:50,355 --> 01:57:53,315
that I just wanted to get up
and walk away from you.

2536
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:55,359
But I didn't and I couldn't...

2537
01:57:55,444 --> 01:57:59,947
MATTHEWS:
I'm gonna be added on to the
people that fucked her around.

2538
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,366
I'm not gonna call her again.

2539
01:58:02,492 --> 01:58:07,455
You know, I'm gonna be available
for her at my availability.

2540
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:21,385
(phone ringing on other end)

2541
01:58:27,392 --> 01:58:29,477
WILLIAMS:
I called your mama last week;
she was happy, too.

2542
01:58:29,603 --> 01:58:31,437
Saying, "Kenneth called me
and told me he loved me!"

2543
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,314
She was happy.

2544
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:35,024
Yeah, I was happy,
but I was rude, too.

2545
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:38,319
When you call and tell me you
love me, I get worried,

2546
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:41,155
but I feel good
at the same time, to hear it.

2547
01:58:41,281 --> 01:58:42,656
Oh, so I shouldn't
have called.

2548
01:58:42,783 --> 01:58:44,825
No, you should!

2549
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:47,703
'Cause it makes me know that
y'all were thinking about me

2550
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:49,872
just as much as I'm
thinking about y'all.

2551
01:58:49,998 --> 01:58:51,916
TOYA:
Cobe made a difference
in their life

2552
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:54,293
by being with them one on one,

2553
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:57,004
because they never really had
a male role model.

2554
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:59,006
But it's all good, man,
just stay focused though.

2555
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:02,760
TOYA:
And I'm here
when you need me.

2556
01:59:02,886 --> 01:59:07,014
I'll call her,
I call my mama every day.

2557
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,432
Not every day.

2558
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:10,184
At least three times
out of the week.

2559
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,602
It's every day to me.

2560
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:13,103
(laughing)

2561
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:15,648
You need a haircut.

2562
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:18,442
Lord.

2563
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:24,657
What kind of influence
has Cobe been in your life?

2564
01:59:24,783 --> 01:59:27,117
Cobe been bad and good
influences on my life.

2565
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:28,369
Yeah, you know we want you

2566
01:59:28,453 --> 01:59:30,454
to become a professional,
young brother.

2567
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:33,040
I'm not close-minded
to the fact that, uh,

2568
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:34,500
if we can get
a younger brother here...

2569
01:59:34,626 --> 01:59:35,501
I'm open-minded to that.

2570
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:38,504
Now, I know we ain't never hired
no young people like that.

2571
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:39,672
I mean 18.

2572
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:42,842
You gonna really be a crusader
for peace now, you know.

2573
01:59:42,968 --> 01:59:44,385
For those who want
to listen.

2574
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:53,853
So, who's all that
down there?

2575
01:59:53,979 --> 01:59:57,982
My sister and me,
my mom and my dad.

2576
01:59:58,108 --> 01:59:59,483
That's your brother
up top?

2577
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,151
Mm-hmm.

2578
02:00:02,863 --> 02:00:05,072
You gonna put it up
in your room?

2579
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,490
No, his room.

2580
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:08,492
BOCANEGRA:
Her grades are declining.

2581
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:11,579
I'm just wondering, like, if
it has to do with her brother.

2582
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:15,583
She got into a fight,
and she was suspended.

2583
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:20,212
This person made a comment,
she was already enraged,

2584
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:22,882
and that was probably
her boiling point.

2585
02:00:23,008 --> 02:00:24,008
That was it.

2586
02:00:27,012 --> 02:00:30,180
One day you might have all the
strength you think you have,

2587
02:00:30,307 --> 02:00:31,515
and you think, "You know what?

2588
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:34,518
I could go continue on
with my life."

2589
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:36,520
BOCANEGRA:
You guys are going
to the cemetery still?

2590
02:00:36,646 --> 02:00:37,521
VANESSA:
Mm-hmm.

2591
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,023
How often are you guys
going now?

2592
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:43,736
Mmm, like try to go like
three days a week.

2593
02:00:43,862 --> 02:00:45,529
BOCANEGRA:
But then the next day,

2594
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:46,697
your emotions are triggered
by something,

2595
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:50,242
and it kind of puts them back
to square one.

2596
02:00:50,368 --> 02:00:53,829
So, I don't think people
ever get over it.

2597
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:58,334
CHILD:
I did it!

2598
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:14,558
(buzzer sounds)

2599
02:01:14,559 --> 02:01:16,435
Hey!

2600
02:01:16,561 --> 02:01:19,146
Hi!

2601
02:01:19,272 --> 02:01:20,564
Hey, hey.

2602
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:25,027
MATTHEWS:
24 hours after she walked off,
she was locked up.

2603
02:01:25,153 --> 02:01:27,237
She violated her parole,
not going to school,

2604
02:01:27,364 --> 02:01:30,491
staying away from the home,
as well as dropping dirty.

2605
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:32,451
This is my mother,
Ms. Ameena.

2606
02:01:32,577 --> 02:01:35,496

Where's the guard?

2610
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,377
It's not guard,
it's security staff.

2611
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:42,586
Oh, okay.

Hi, Sandy Eyebar.

2615
02:01:46,049 --> 02:01:48,133
She's pushing me to do school
so I can graduate.

2616
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:49,593
She's gonna graduate.

2617
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:51,595
I'm, you know, that's,
that was our goal.

2618

wasn't gonna come,

2621

I was happy to see her.
