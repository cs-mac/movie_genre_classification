1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,940
[Ah...this humiliation.]

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,060
[Ah...this disgrace...]

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,430
[I didn't forget it...]

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,200
We should do that.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,630
Do what?

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,420
- We should take revenge.<br>- Why the revenge?

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,280
[What is that?]<br>All the members come out!

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,360
What is this?<br>[Time for revenge. All of you come out now]

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,020
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to <br>you by The So! Pink Team @ Viki</i>

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,070
All of you wanted it

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,320
So I acquired it.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,060
- Yes!<br>- So I am gonna take my revenge.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,110
- What are you talking about?<br>- What is this?<br>- Bye Bye...

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,220
Want to try it right everyone?

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,610
Please don't do that. Please do not play,<br> "let's catch a fish" or anything like that.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,200
- No way! <br>- Ahh...

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,130
- Why are you doing that? <br>- Why, why, why?<br>- Hey guys...

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,880
- I will give you chance.<br>- Oh.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,710
I will give you.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,320
You are gonna give it.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,190
Stop right there. Just give it to us.

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,860
What is that flashlight?

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,840
- What is that really? <br>- Go, go, go.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,060
Giving it?

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,480
We hid it somewhere.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,200
Try it.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,550
We have a gift certificate for raw fish (sushi).

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,790
There's a piece of paper. How do we find a piece of paper?

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,250
- Pardon?<br>- Within 15 minutes.

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,480
- We have to go all the way there within 15 minutes.<br>- Is there a flashlight?

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,530
Flashlight is behind you there.

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,600
There is... this one?

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,060
- Yes that's all there is. <br>- This is a mini me, so tiny.

34
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,720
So then when we arrive it's 15 minutes?

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,010
- It's a mini me. This flashlight it too tiny. <br>- It's easy, I have walked there before.

36
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,670
You can go there in 5 minutes.

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,460
So then..

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,350
So you are staying here Mr. Producer?

39
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,420
Yes Yes, I will be staying here.

40
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,540
- Wait what the heck?<br>- Once you get there everything will be ready for you.

41
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,320
But wait, you should give us enough time to go look for it too. <br>Give us 15 minutes once we get there as well.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
So?<br>If Somin acts all cute then...I will give you 20 minutes.

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,420
*Boing Boing* <br>[Launching because of her cuteness]

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,560
That's so not adorable.

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,900
I think...

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,040
It's 7:05 right now. I will give you exactly 20 minutes.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,450
My head is starting to hurt.

48
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,340
It's really scary. Can we just not go?

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,830
You see what I have here now.

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,030
This is show twinkling and shiny.<br>Oh yeah, flashlight.

51
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,340
You should give us one more.

52
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,590
It's 7h18 right now.

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,910
We will give you 20 minutes.

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,430
Okay now go!

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,000
Flashlight...you take the lead. <br>Please move out of the way.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,940
I can't see anything that's in front of me.

57
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,610
Wait, what the heck...<br>What is it?!

58
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,180
I can't see anything! I can't see here either.

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,060
- It looks fun. It looks like a ghost will come from here. <br>- Aish...

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,570
I don't think we really need flashlights here.

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,060
- We can't see here you know.<br>- Wait, this here..

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,350
I can't see.

63
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,830
I can't see the way.

64
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,980
This is...

65
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,790
- There is raw fish? <br>- Please give it to us. <br>- What?

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,330
- What are we doing? Aren't we gonna go in?<br>- Go through there.

67
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,240
- WHAT?! I don't want to.<br>- No!<br>- We can all hold hands and go in there.

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,780
- I really don't want to.<br>- It's okay It's okay.

69
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,340
We could hold hands and go together.

70
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,100
Let's hurry up and go in.

71
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,600
Hold on a minute.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,740
- Just hold my hand. <br>- Come this way.

73
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,930
Gonna get scare it.

74
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,080
- It's so scary. <br>- OOOHHH~~~

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,360
What in the world!

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,810
We have to go inside in there.

77
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,070
I just discovered a grasshopper.

78
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,750
I think we have to go inside in there.

79
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,150
- Keep on going straight in there. Inside of there?<br>- Yeah...

80
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,300
You guys..no wait!

81
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,120
This place is so creepy.

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,050
- Bye Bye.<br>- Let's all gather. <br>- They are all gathering there.

83
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,510
You are not scared right?

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,430
This way...

85
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,710
Mr. Camera Director.

86
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,440
- Mr.Camera Director. Which way do we go? <br>- I think there will be something over here.

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,580
Don't do that!

88
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,010
- What! Get out!<br>- Look here..

89
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,900
Where do we go Camera Director?

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,410
What did you say was there now?

91
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,650
- Don't use the flash!<br>- Ahh!

92
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,550
Calm down and be quiet.

93
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,480
Mr. Camera Director, where do we go?

94
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,700
Please don't wiggle around like that.

95
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,130
Don't wiggle around.

96
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,010
Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?!

97
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,130
- Oh...It's Director Young Jin..<br>- I could see it all. I could see it all.

98
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,380
- Seriously, don't do that. Please come over here. <br>- Please come.

99
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,400
Seriously, why are you doing this.

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,660
Don't move. You guys...

101
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,740
Why are you doing this?

102
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,810
Why do you this? I am really okay.

103
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,230
I know...

104
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,630
Hey, take me too.

105
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,220
Don't come over. Please take me along.

106
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,200
- WHAT THE HELL!!!<br>- This totally sucks!

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,900
- I am so sorry for speaking out informally.<br>- Take your unnie too. Let's go together.

108
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,930
Unnie, take me too. Unnie, take me too.

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,230
What the heck is this? Is it a piece of string?<br>This is a piece of string.

110
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,180
- Unnie, take me too. <br>- There is a piece of string here.

111
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,190
Oh no there isn't. That string is totally worthless.

112
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,820
Paper!<br>I think that string looks like something we need.

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,470
Hey, Yena, take your unnie too. There isn't anything here.

114
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,480
What the hell are you?<br>Isn't that it?!

115
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,550
- What is it?<br>- Don't do that~!

116
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,970
Why do you do this to me for?!

117
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,460
Huh?

118
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,600
- You have to find number 3. <br>- This is number 2.

119
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,370
- There is no number 3.<br>- They said that this is number 2.

120
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,500
Where is this going to, Mr. Director?

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,830
Director, director... Are you not there Mr. Director?

122
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,880
Director, Director?

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,800
Over here? Keep on following it?

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,900
- Have to keep on following it. <br>- Hello there.

125
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,540
Please give us a hint here.

126
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,810
Give us another flashlight.

127
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,740
It's really okay.

128
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,900
So scary...

129
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,090
I came here before. What is that over there?

130
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,810
Hey Yena.. Don't tease me.

131
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,490
Really, what is that?

132
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,830
Oh...

133
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,100
- I know there is that thing here for sure. <br>- Should we go inside of there?

134
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,200
- This is not it.<br>- I didn't see that.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,900
You don't have to do that.

136
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,310
- Don't do that.<br>- Unnie, I will try to look for it quickly.

137
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,150
Where is it at?

138
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,650
- It won't be here.<br>- Here, here.

139
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,570
Go in there.

140
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,190
Number 3! Caught it... Catch it!

141
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,310
It's going out.

142
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,540
Let's go out.

143
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,730
- Please take the lead.<br>- Hurry up and follow.

144
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,920
- Finally...<br>- This was all you got huh?

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Hey...

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,710
Hurry up Hurry up.

147
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,830
Let's hurry up and leave now.

148
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,580
- Hello.<br>- Unnie, smile.

149
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,590
That thing.

150
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,930
Smile. Hello.

151
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,610
- Hurry up girls. <br>- Maybe we should go down.

152
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,800
We're found it.

153
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,690
Ta Da..Hehe..

154
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,330
- Is it number three?<br>- Yes.<br>- It's number 3.

155
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,940
- What it is this spider for? Seriously.<br>- We found it!

156
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,580
- What the heck man.<br>- It's 7:16pm now.

157
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,420
You have to hurry up and go now in order for you to pass.

158
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,850
- It's so dark<br>- Careful now.

How was it?

It was okay. We barely made it. What the heck is this?
