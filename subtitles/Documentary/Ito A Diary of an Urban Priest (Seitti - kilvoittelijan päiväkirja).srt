00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,887
The Wastelands are a haven for
the lawless and the immoral.

163
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:02,871
To send a Priest out there after such a
lot would be both ridiculous and futile.

164
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:06,694
This is best left
to the local authority.

165
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,899
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been
of great service to the Church.

166
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,902
If it weren't for the Priests, we
would have been overrun by the...

167
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,317
We are well aware of his accomplishments,
Monsignor Chamberlain.

168
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,581
Thank you. You may sit.

169
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,452
I am begging you.

170
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,460
Allow me to find her.

171
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,726
You must understand
something, Priest.

172
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:37,133
The sanctity of these
walls is absolute.

173
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,317
And the citizens from the
Cities have complete faith

174
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,913
in the Church's ability
to keep them safe.

175
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,274
You will not shake that faith.

176
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,184
What good is that faith
when it's a lie?

177
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:52,620
Questioning the authority of the
Clergy is absolutely forbidden.

178
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,996
If you take any action
to leave the Cities,

179
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:57,662
it will be seen as an act of
aggression against the Church.

180
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,133
You will be stripped from the Order
and excommunicated immediately.

181
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,276
Do I make myself clear?

182
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,271
I said do I make
myself clear, Father?

183
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,539
Yes, Monsignor.

184
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,610
Try to remember your vow,

185
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:21,347
to go against the Church
is to go against God.

186
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,760
(SCREAMING)

187
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:38,669
Come on, now.

188
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,809
Don't be shy.

189
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,583
Give us a kiss.

190
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,989
BLACK HAT: That's no way
to treat a friend.

191
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,762
Please. Let me go.

192
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:57,263
You're in there
for your own protection.

193
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,934
If I let you out,
you'll be torn apart.

194
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,767
Piece by piece.

195
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,075
My uncle's a Priest.
He'll come after me.

196
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,344
Really?

197
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,573
What makes you so sure?

198
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,714
He'll come after me.

199
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,181
He'll come after you!

200
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,048
Now that's something
I'm absolutely

201
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:21,729
counting on.

202
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,428
CHAMBERLAIN:
Judgment is final.

203
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,802
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,880
I sacrificed everything
to serve them.

205
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,413
Now they won't listen to me.

206
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,112
The war is long over.

207
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,621
You and the other Priests
did your jobs.

208
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,593
It's not over.
Not for me.

209
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:52,862
You can't break your covenant to hunt
down a small group of scavengers.

210
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,128
It would be sacrilege.

211
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:55,936
I have to.

212
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:00,708
That's what I was afraid of.

213
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:01,861
(DOOR BANGING OPEN)

214
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,880
GUARD 1: Move.
GUARD 2: Get out of the way.

215
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:05,941
Stand back.

216
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:13,891
If you go out there right now, you
risk stirring things up again.

217
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,919
You have to look at the bigger picture.
It's for the greater good.

218
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,498
Is this the world I fought for?

219
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,220
No,

220
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,797
but it's the only world
we have left.

221
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:32,209
I'm begging you,
don't do anything foolish.

222
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,150
Remember your vow,

223
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:38,551
to go against the Church
is to go against God.

224
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,854
Then I go against God.

225
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:54,991
(GRUNTING)

226
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,592
God help us.

227
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:17,424
PRIEST: Dear Father,
forgive me.

228
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,437
It was never my intention
to offend you.

229
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,868
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace

230
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,916
to sin no more, and to avoid
the near occasions of sin,

231
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,414
but I can't.

232
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:45,617
(BEEPING)

233
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:35,944
(ALARM SOUNDING)

234
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,463
(GUN COCKING)

235
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,947
HICKS: Lootin's not such
a good idea, mister.

236
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,435
Well, I'll be damned.

237
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:02,555
Vampires are a vicious lot.

238
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:05,398
I have seen a vampire

239
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:08,771
bite a man clean in half.

240
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:13,205
Salvation is right here
in my very hands.

241
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,473
Authenticated by
the Clergy themselves.

242
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,881
SALESMAN: Purchase this holy water...
Excuse me a minute.

243
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,817
...and keep your loved
ones safe tonight.

244
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,516
(GUNSHOT)
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

245
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,925
I am tired of you comin'
around here scarin' people

246
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,154
selling your superstition.

247
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,389
Show's over.

248
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,394
And it's time for you to go.

249
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,801
Give me one good reason
why I should.

250
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,307
That's one.

251
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:42,502
Two.

252
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:45,012
All right, all right!
All right!

253
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,806
Goddamn son of a bitch!

254
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,853
Now, y'all listen up.

255
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,786
This stuff is good for nothin'

256
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,528
but linin' that man's pockets
with your hard-earned cash.

257
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,941
VILLAGER: You don't know that.
You're just a kid.

258
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,867
We gotta do somethin'
to keep us safe.

259
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,468
Move out of the way!

260
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,617
I don't blame any
of you for bein' scared,

261
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:13,177
but the vampires are gone
and they're not comin' back.

262
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:25,859
You'll have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't too common out here.

263
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,956
Is it true what they say
about Priests?

264
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,394
You wield the hand of God?

265
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:40,008
How is he?

266
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,842
He's awake.

267
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,689
The Clergy took away a boy

268
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,698
and returned an old man.

269
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:08,577
After the war was over, Shannon
figured you'd come back.

270
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,282
I wanted to.

271
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,550
Didn't seem right anymore.

272
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:19,916
I couldn't save her.

273
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,727
I tried, but I never
had your gift.

274
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:29,796
You gave her a life
I no longer could.

275
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:32,803
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

276
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:38,480
Never a day went by when I didn't
wish she'd forget about you.

277
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:51,229
You find Lucy.

278
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:54,059
You bring her home safe.

279
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:57,764
And you promise me
somethin', brother,

280
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,008
kill 'em all.

281
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:10,482
Most people out here know the Clergy think
of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

282
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:12,316
And that's how we like it.

283
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:15,312
It means they tend to keep their
noses out of our business.

284
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,856
So you can imagine
how surprised I was

285
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,863
when they contacted me
askin' if I'd seen you.

286
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,099
Sayin' that anyone goin' after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.

287
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,872
Said she's in God's hands now.

288
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:34,446
Problem is, we both know outside
of a week, Lucy will be dead.

289
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:37,015
Or worse, infected.

290
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,177
So with all due
respect to God...

291
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,167
You're wasting your time.

292
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:54,900
No, no, no, you are not
cutting me out of this.

293
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,736
I am the one that
came and got you.

294
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,038
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.

295
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:04,713
What makes you think
you'll do any good out there?

296
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,103
You any good with a gun?

297
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:22,830
Better than I am with a knife.

298
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:25,669
We leave at dawn.

299
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,006
All right.

300
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:33,343
What's with all the bullets, anyways?
I thought Priests didn't use firearms.

301
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,850
We don't.

302
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:37,348
They're for you.

303
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,263
ORELAS: (ON PA)
God protects you.

304
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,401
The Church protects you.

305
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:00,941
ORELAS: You have been called
to serve once more.

306
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:05,481
One of your own
has broken his sacred vow.

307
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:08,585
His actions are a threat
to the entire Order.

308
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:15,559
You will find him
and bring him back to me.

309
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,004
Dead or alive.

310
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:31,643
PREACHER: "And I will teach transgressors
your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.

311
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:35,314
"Save me from bloodguilt,
O God, the God who saves me.

312
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,518
"And my tongue will sing
of your righteousness.

313
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,653
"And my mouth will
declare your praise.

314
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:44,433
"You do not delight in
sacrifice or I would bring it.

315
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:46,969
"You do not take pleasure
in burnt offerings."

316
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,495
What is it?

317
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:16,705
Vampire tracks are random.
Sets of two, three, four prints at a time.

318
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,071
But these are two by two.

319
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,177
It must have been

01:02:29,252 --> 01:02:31,049
Hicks, don't do this.

645
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:33,487
Tell me, or I will shoot
you where you stand.

646
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:37,560
It would be easier to face your bullet
here than to face what might lie ahead.

Why do you even care?

648
01:02:38,898 --> 01:02:40,708
She is nothing
but a stranger to you.

649
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,097
She's his daughter.

650
01:02:50,377 --> 01:02:52,487
She was just a baby
when the Clergy took me.

651
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:54,908
You're lying. I knew Owen.

652
01:02:55,016 --> 01:02:57,211
The child needed a father.

653
01:02:58,354 --> 01:02:59,946
We all made sacrifices.

Hicks,

655
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:10,457
if you do this,

656
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:14,272
it won't matter
if you find Lucy.

657
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:19,399
You won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.

658
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,310
You won't save her.

659
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,080
We ride out
and meet this together.

When the time comes, you blow the
tracks, then you get out of there!

661
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,043
What if you're still
on the train?

662
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:11,697

In the depths of that hive,

672
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:40,949
I crossed the threshold
between life and death.

673
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:42,846
And do you know what I found?

674
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:49,458
The Queen we had come to kill,
my angel of mercy,

675
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:55,457
she turned me into something that
had never existed in this world,

676
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,731
a human vampire.

677
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,002
Join me.

678
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:05,573
Accept the blood of the Queen,

679
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,811
and together, we can return
to the Cities as brothers.

680
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:13,345

681
