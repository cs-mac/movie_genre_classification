

2
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,013
Hey.

3
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,722
You haven't changed. Please, take a seat.

4
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,641
How is your sister?

5
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,893
I have three sisters.

6
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,647
The one with the big tits.
The one I always wanted to fuck.

7
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,486
I hear good things, Latif.

8
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,444
It says here you can shoot straight.

9
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,572
Officer material, promoted already.
Lieutenant.

10
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,246
Please, help yourself.

11
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,917
Juice?

12
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,673
I won't keep you guessing, Latif.

13
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,383
I want you to come and work for me.

14
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,519
-Work for you'?
-Here, in Baghdad.

15
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,354
Like old friends.

16
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,353
-We were friends, weren't we, at school?
-Classmates.

17
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,445
Didn't you once paint a picture
of my father'?

18
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,146
-You still have it?
-I gave it to you.

19
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,364
I have an awful feeling
I told him I did it myself.

20
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,287
Do you know who this is?

21
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,240
-Of course.
-No, no, no.

22
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,121
It is not who you think it is.

23
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,077
His name is Faoaz al-Emari.

24
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,001
Not Saddam. I see him all of the time.

25
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,834
In the newspapers, in the magazines,
on television.

26
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,716
Even I cannot tell who is who.

27
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,048
It is not so unusual, Latif.

28
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,760
Stalin had a double. He had dozens.
So did the Shah.

29
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,219
The country is at war.

30
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,396
My father cannot be expected
to be everywhere at once.

31
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,226
Half the time there is no good reason,
but the people, they expect it.

32
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,562
Add to that there is always the chance
some fucked-up Shi'a scum

33
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,613
will take a shot at him.

34
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,859
Look at yourself, Latif.

35
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,286
Look. Look, look.

36
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,409
Look at me.

37
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,956
We could be twins, no?

38
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,996
You are taller.

39
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,077
How much? This much?

40
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,044
Didn't they used to say
you looked like Uday Saddam Hussain?

41
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,171
Didn't they used to say that at school?

42
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,253
I want you, Latif.

43
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,098
I want you to be my fidai.

44
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,261
I want you to be my brother.

45
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,435
Don't say anything.

46
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,608
Take 10 minutes.

47
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,685
Think it over.

48
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,272
What happens if I say no?

49
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,028
Ten minutes.

50
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,345
He is shitting bricks.

51
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,970
His grandfather was a Kurd. It's a pity.

52
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,768
But the family's been in Baghdad
a long time.

53
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,390
His father's done well.

54
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,106
I believe he sells domestic appliances.

55
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,935
He's never said a word against the party.

56
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,570
Latif is the best we could find.
And we looked.

57
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,650
Well, I have to have him.

58
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,332
You will have whatever you want.

59
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,752
Everything I own will belong to you.

60
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,997
Uday,

61
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,962
I am my father's son.

62
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,675
I would give my last drop of blood for Iraq.

63
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,722
But when this war is over,
I'm going to work in his business.

64
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,271
I am the eldest son.

65
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,893
I have brothers and sisters.
I have given them my word.

66
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,983
-Sleep on it.
-Uday...

67
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,486
You are asking me to

68
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,614
extinguish myself.

69
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,218
Thought it over?

70
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,090
Please be clear about this, Latif.

71
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,012
Uday has chosen you. You belong to him.

72
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,974
You have about five minutes
to think about this

73
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,561
before a car pulls up
outside your house in AI-Adhamiya

74
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,972
and your family, every one of them,

75
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,402
your father, your mother,
your sisters and brothers,

76
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,984
is thrown into Abu Ghraib.

77
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,317
God willing, they will die quickly.

78
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,910
I've said too much.
You have about two minutes left.

79
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,923
You'll have a cook and four maids.

80
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,843
These pretty girls will get you
anything you feel like.

81
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,594
Strawberries in winter, figs in July.
Just ask.

82
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,895
But lay a finger on one of them
without prior permission

83
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,520
and you'll never walk upright again.

84
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,316
And these are Uday's rooms.

85
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,865
He wants you to use them,
now that you are to be his brother.

86
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,995
Leather sofas, Italian marble,
all designed by Gianfranco Giannelli.

87
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,327
Handmade shoes, suits,

88
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,502
Brioni, Versace, Armani, of course.

89
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:10,298
Silk ties, watches. Breitling, Cartier, Rolex.

90
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,091
Silk pajamas.

91
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,545
These are very nice.

92
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,255
Poor child never knows what to wear.

93
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,136
He changes his mind every five minutes.

94
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,933
Depends on what car he's driving.

95
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,764
Honestly, habibi, that boy, he wears me out.

96
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,474
You should probably clean yourself up.

97
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,126
No calls.

98
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,673
Incoming, yes. Outgoing, no.

99
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,732
My name is Munem Hammed al-Tikriti.

100
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,945
We're going to be seeing
a lot of each other.

101
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,699
I write to my mother once a week.

102
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,119
She's going to think that I got killed in Iran.

103
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,833
Inshallah.

104
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,786
Inshallah?

105
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,621
My family are going to think that I'm dead.

106
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,879
Let them think you died a martyr.

107
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,676
I know it's difficult,
but it's what Uday wants.

108
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,470
He will accept nothing less.

109
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,391
She will be knocking on the door
of every hospital in Baghdad.

110
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,436
When you say your prayers tonight,

111
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,061
when you tum out the light
and close your eyes,

112
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,733
this is what
you should be saying to yourself,

113
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,234
"Latif Yahia is dead. He died in Iran.

114
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,157
"May God have mercy on him.

115
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,949
"Now I am Uday Saddam Hussein."

116
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,324
Guten Tag.

117
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,660
Take off your clothes, please.

118
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,675
Cough.

119
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,221
One more time.

120
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,936
And one more time, please.

121
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,197
Uday is three centimeters taller.

122
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,112
We can use built-up shoes.

123
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,584
Look at that. He is perfect.

124
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,709
-Uday, this is boring.
-Shut up.

125
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,049
How can you sit here all night
looking at yourself?

126
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,923
-He looks great.
-He doesn't even look like you.

127
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,178
What?

128
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,009
His cock's too big.

129
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,975
What do you mean, his cock is too big?

130
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,156
Uday's life story. Learn it.

131
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,336
Come on, come on, tell me.

132
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,340
Shape of face, hair, nose, physique,
all in the high 90s.

133
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,763
-Good.
-Your eyes are five millimeters bigger.

134
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,466
-They can use make-up.
-And the teeth? What about the teeth?

135
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,465
Two peas in a pod.

136
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,852
-I was just trying the teeth.
-Smile. Go on, smile.

137
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,181
No, no, no. Like this.

138
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,232
And do the hair. Do the hair.

139
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,110
You like the Rolex.

140
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,441
Keep it.

141
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,249
You look good in blue.

142
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,628
Yes, it definitely suits you.

143
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,543
Latif hurry up.

144
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,721
-There's too much ice.
-Can I say blue is your color?

145
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,922
Shut up.

146
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,131
I like the way you fight.

147
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,206
You fight like me.

148
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,006
He fights like me.

149
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,884
I had a word with Dr. Linz.

150
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,139
He says your cock's too big.

151
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,846
We need to make a surgical reduction.

152
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,566
-A what?
-Chop a bit off.

153
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,773
-What?
-Not much.

154
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,521
Just a teeny-weeny.

155
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,526
Not much?

156
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,076
My cock is well-known in Baghdad.
The women, they talk.

157
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,822
I'm joking with you, you fuck.

158
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,715
This is Said Kammuneh.

159
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,764
He's a member
of the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

160
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,100
He has something to show you.

161
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,702
This is from the personal collection
of Uday Saddam Hussain.

162
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,671
That guy, he was a police officer.

163
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,177
We were on the same football team.

164
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,803
Great left foot. Good in the air.

165
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,978
I shot this myself. Wait a minute.

166
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,281
Good work, huh?

167
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,701
We got a lot of this shit
from the East Germans and the Russians.

168
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,368
See that guy'? That's Rakti, the wrestler.

169
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,666
He won a bronze medal in Moscow.

170
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,498
The President calls him
the sharp sword of the Republic.

171
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,540
You know that gas station
on Haifa Street by the lights?

172
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,750
The President gave him that.

173
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,128
The fat fuck's making 20 grand a month.

174
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,677
That's good money.

175
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,767
Look, I'll leave this with you.

176
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,657
-Seen enough?
-Enough?

177
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,830
Have I seen enough?

178
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,084
I remember the day Saddam Hussein
became president of this country.

179
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,800
I was still in short trousers.
We ran through the streets, shouting,

180
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,379
"Saddam! Saddam Hussain!
Saddam Hussein!" Firing our guns.

181
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,470
Even my father. Even my father.

182
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,970
This stuff, Munem...

183
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,394
These people".
I hope Said said something about this.

184
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,688
They're criminals, deserters.

185
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,108
Pornographers, counterfeiters,
murderers, of course.

186
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,231
Putschists. Enemies of the Republic.

187
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,985
Saddam Hussein built this country.
Never forget that.

188
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,034
The schools, the roads, hospitals,
the mosques.

189
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,779
He gave the Iraqi people
everything they want.

190
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,535
He demands only one thing in return.

191
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,538
Never raise a hand against his family.

192
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,707
Do so and you will suffer.

193
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,461
The people you love will suffer.

194
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,628
Do well here, work hard
and you'll be one of the family.

195
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,178
One day all this will be over. Inshallah.

196
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,180
Inshallah?

197
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,395
Only God knows when.

198
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,783
Come, come, come, come, come.

199
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,880
Munem disapproves. Look at him.

200
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,433
He's angry with me.
He thinks I should leave you at home.

201
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,971
-Who's this?
-Latif'? He's my brother.

202
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,859
Nobody must know this,
but Saddam, he has three sons.

203
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,061
You tell anybody this,

204
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,899
I will have to out your tongue out
with a razor and feed it to the cat.

205
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,453
Everything I own, I give to him.

206
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,912
You don't own me.

207
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,953
Sarrab, best fuck in Beirut.

208
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,882
Loosen your tie. Let me do it for you.

209
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,848
There. Isn't that better?

210
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,895
Ba careful what you say.

211
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,390
I can read your mind.

212
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,102
Are you really the President's son?

213
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,359
You know what they say on TV.

214
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,066
We are all the President's sons.

215
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,784
Hey!

216
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,371
Hey!

217
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,387
Look at him.

218
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,390
He can't keep his hands off that drag queen.

219
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,438
Poor Uday.

220
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,861
Sometimes I think he wants
to fuck himself to death.

221
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,905
Will you excuse me a moment?

222
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,497
Keys.

223
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,417
Give me the keys.

224
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,296
Give me the fucking keys!

225
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,013
Baby, I so love your tits!

226
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,516
I hope so, lover. You paid for them.

227
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,662
What have you done with my brother?

228
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,978
You sea, Munem?

229
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,523
Discipline. We must have discipline.

230
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,699
If we do not have discipline,
we have no control.

231
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,868
If we have no control, we have chaos.

232
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,446
If we have chaos, we have disorder.

233
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,421
You do understand, Latif? It is quite simple.

234
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,920
We must have discipline.

235
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,882
Got it?

236
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,183
Got it?

237
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,395
Good.

238
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,284
Latif. Five minutes.

239
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,179
Latif.

240
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,380
-No, no, no!
-We must have discipline!

241
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,548
Discipline! We must have discipline!

242
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,734
How was that, Munem?

243
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,571
Excellent.

244
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,029
Sorry.

245
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,250
Good.

246
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,783
Empty your pockets.

247
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,159
My grandfather,

248
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,168
he talks to me the same way ha did
when I was 10 years old.

249
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,828
God is great.

250
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,073
He gave me two sons.

251
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,868
Now I have three.

252
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,898
Make sure you give me no reason
to be angry with you.

253
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,483
And?

254
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,703
Uday, you owe me 50 dinar.

255
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,541
50 dinar?

256
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,164
You see?

257
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,999
Trying to get money from your brother
is like trying to get blood from a stone.

258
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,926
What?

259
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,593
It's not him.

260
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,050
What?

261
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,492
It's your turn, brother.

262
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,196
Fuck them. Fucking Kuwaitis.

263
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,083
I hate them all.

264
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,034
Worse than horseflies.

265
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,343
My brothers, welcome to Baghdad.

266
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,893
Fuck!

267
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,275
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

268
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,568
Fucking Kuwaitis!

269
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,487
I fucking hate Jews, I hate horseflies

270
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,984
and I hate fucking Persians,

271
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,567
but I hate fucking Kuwaitis more!

272
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,072
They insult us.

273
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,655
They are filth. They maul our women.

274
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,582
The Kuwaitis have been
stealing $280 million a year

275
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,251
from the oilfields at Rumaila.

276
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,839
$280 million a year!

277
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,963
You know we traced the weapon.

278
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,262
I just know the fucking Kuwaitis
are behind this!

279
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,680
I hope my father wipes them out.

280
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,138
No, I'm telling you this.
I don't care who knows it!

281
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,061
The age of the sheikhs is over. Over!

282
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,940
-What?
-It's me, habibi.

283
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,607
What are you doing right now?

284
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:32,066
I'm getting my nails done. Nice and sharp.

285
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,025
The better to scratch you with.

286
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,614
Did I ever tell you
how much I love your ass?

287
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,622
It's the best ass in Baghdad.
I'll see you soon.

288
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,707
Hey, you, you!

289
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,126
You'll meet many women.

290
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,218
Whores, wealthy women from AI Mansour

291
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,422
who come looking for a favor
and offer you favors in return.

292
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,348
Schoolgirls he snatches off the street.

293
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,432
-You'll be given your fair share.
-Ready, guys?

294
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:05,812
Never even speak to a woman
Uday has chosen for himself.

295
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,275
He is insane.

296
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,780
You know it, Munem.

297
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,076
He's insane.

298
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,156
You tum a blind eye. You have no choice.

299
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,329
I understand that.

300
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,628
You are a good man in a bad job.

301
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,830
Look at him.

302
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,712
He's psychotic.

303
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,715
Come on, kiss. Kiss more. More. Kiss, kiss.

304
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,094
Who wants to sleep with me tonight? You?

305
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,666
Through the window
of a British worker's Hat,

306
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,544
the Battle of Kuwait unfolds.

307
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,220
Saddam Hussein, very simply,
you cannot bully your neighbor

308
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,844
You cannot wipe him out,
a member of the Arab League,

309
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,300
a member of the United Nations.

310
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,306
Saddam Hussein!
The hero of the Battle of Qadisiyyah.

311
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,892
The knight of the Arab nations.

312
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,149
Direct descendant of the prophet.

313
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,196
Saddam the noble fighter.

314
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,655
Scion of the family of Imam al-Hussein.

315
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:44,581
Ladies and gentlemen,
Uday Saddam Hussain.

316
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,680
The age of the sheikhs is over!

317
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,015
With the help of Almighty God,

318
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,601
Kuwait has come home!

319
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,208
Hey, you. The teeth. You with the teeth.

320
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,051
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

321
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:24,006
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You!
NO, no, HO, DO. You, you, you.

322
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,727
Hey, you.

323
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,973
Don't be scared. Come for a ride.

324
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,227
Come on, get in the car.
I'll give you a lift home.

325
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,028
I'll take you back.

326
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,319
Hey, don't be scared.
Why do you run'? Why do you run?

327
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,620
Come on. Why are you running?
I'll take you home.

328
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,536
Come on.

329
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,501
Hey. How about you?

330
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,879
I love what you've done with your hair.

331
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,049
Hey, hey, hey!

332
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,633
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

333
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,138
It's all right.

334
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:14,064
You're beautiful. Don't be scared.
I'm not going to hurt you.

335
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,892
Brother, she's beautiful. You want her?

336
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,020
-Take.
-No!

337
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,653
What? What?
Don't fucking look at me like that.

338
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,324
-Like what?
-Like that.

339
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,778
I know that fucking look.
I know what you're thinking.

340
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,159
Think what the fuck you like.
I like cunt. I want cunt.

341
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,036
I see a cunt, I want to fuck it. I don't care.

342
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,368
I love my country,
I love my mother, my father.

343
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,078
But I love cunt more than I love God!

344
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,147
Does her mama know that she's out?

345
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,319
You know this man?

346
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,660
This is Kamel Hannah.

347
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,039
He's my father's greatest friend.

348
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,835
He tastes his food.

349
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,544
Did she get a note from her teacher?

350
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,385
See this watch?

351
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,928
You see this watch?

352
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,600
How much you think a watch like this costs?

353
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,771
How much? How much you think
a watch like this costs? $10,000.

354
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,645
It's a $10,000 watch.
My father bought him that watch.

355
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:26,070
Why? Why did my father buy Kamel Hannah
a watch like this?

356
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,772
Shall I tell you why? Shall I tell you why?

357
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,324
Shall I tell you why my father
loves Kamel Hannah so much?

358
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,529
-Because he gets his whores for him.
-Rubbish.

359
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,325
Our mother... Our mother
sits around the house and weeps

360
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:41,537
because of the whores
this man brings my father.

361
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,707
She wanders, she walks around the palace,

362
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,334
walks around the palace,
staring in the mirrors,

363
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,715
staring in the mirrors,
looking at herself like a fucking zombie

364
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,219
because of the whores
this man brings my father!

365
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,223
-Shall I kill him, brother?
-Uday.

366
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,065
What do you think, brother?

367
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,067
What do you think? Shall I kill him?

368
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,152
Kill your father's greatest friend?

369
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,906
He is a twittering little pimp
that has driven my mother mad.

370
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,910
-Maybe I'll lat you kill him for me.
-Uday.

371
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,079
No.

372
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,163
I don't know him. It's meaningless.

373
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,714
If I am going to kill somebody,
I want to know why I'm going to do it.

374
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,594
Uday.

375
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,306
Uday.

376
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,929
-You fucker!
-Easy, easy.

377
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,933
You should be ashamed of your...

378
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,612
Motherfucker.

379
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,234
Come into my bedroom. Come on.

380
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,407
Would you like a drink? A nice drink?

381
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,202
I like to drink whiskey.

382
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,664
Take it, here, here.

383
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,713
Would you like some?
Would you like some?

384
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,225
That's it. In just one. In one. In one.

385
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,155
You're very beautiful.
You're a very beautiful girl.

386
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,742
Beg me... Beg me to fuck you.

387
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,742
Beg me. Go on, beg me to fuck you.

388
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,832
He humiliate me.

389
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:53,843
Why not? Just say it.
Beg me. Bag me to fuck you.

390
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,091
-I can't.
-Come on.

391
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,922
-I...
-Yes?

392
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,134
-...beg...
-...beg...

393
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,185
...you... I can't.

394
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,138
-Go on.
-No.

395
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,692
-Beg me. Beg me.
-No.

396
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,365
Beg me! Bag me to fuck you.

397
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,162
Beg me to fuck you.

398
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,496
Beg me to fuck you.

399
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,042
Beg me to fuck you! Beg me!

400
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,007
-Beg! Beg! Beg!
-I beg...

401
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,387
Yassem! Yassem!

402
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,391
-Who's doing that?
-That pig, Kamel Hannah. Ha won't stop.

403
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,894
He says he doesn't take orders
from faggots.

404
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,205
Stop!

405
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,417
-Fuck you.
-I order you to stop!

406
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,167
I don't take orders from you!
I take orders from Saddam Hussain.

407
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,358
Uday, Uday...

408
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,115
No! No!

409
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,458
Boss, come on. Let's go.

410
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,009
Just get her out of here, okay?

411
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,601
He took pills, sleeping pills.

412
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,091
Give me the knife.

413
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,191
"A b o o d i 12"

414
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,270
You'll kill him.

415
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,355
The loss of blood and...

416
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,306
I should have gelded him at birth.

417
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:06,624
At 7:00 tonight the armed forces
of the United States began an operation

418
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,334
at the direction of the President

419
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,304
to force Saddam Hussein
to withdraw his troops from Kuwait

420
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,304
and to end his occupation of their country.

421
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,780
That's the latest Tomahawk cruise missile

422
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,823
to fly just over our position here.

423
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:35,237
Anti-aircraft gunners all around
have been trying to shoot them down.

424
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,491
I have said to the people of Iraq

425
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,918
that our quarrel was not with them,

426
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,255
but instead with their leadership

427
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,753
and above all with Saddam Hussein.

428
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:09,404
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.

429
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,606
Millions of dollars a year.

430
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,487
Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars.

431
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,034
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.
Millions of dollars a year.

432
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:23,038
From the oilfields.
From our oilfields at Rumaila.

433
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,043
Kuwait.

434
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,422
Kuwait, Kuwait.

435
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,125
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

436
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,303
Millions of dollars a year
from our oilfields at Rumaila.

437
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,847
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

438
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,510
Take the glasses off.

439
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,139
What are you doing hero?

440
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,098
-How did you get in?
-Do you want me to go?

441
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,191
Why are you wearing Ray-Bans
at 1:00 in the morning?

442
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,738
Take them off.

443
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,651
-I want to be sure it's you.
-Are you sure'?

444
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:58,910
I can always tell.

445
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,034
You cannot stay here.

446
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,741
Have you seen what's going on outside?

447
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:09,790
Hear what Saddam said on television?
"The mother of all battles"

448
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,634
Iraqi people are not stupid.
Nobody believes that crap.

449
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,675
Iraq is going to burn to the ground.
We won't see that on TV.

450
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,850
And Uday? Is he reporting for duty?

451
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:30,102
No. Uday has gone to bed
with a splitting headache

452
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,360
because Yassem AI-Helou forgot
to press his tweed hunting breaches.

453
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,326
He's a child. He'll tire of you.

454
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,032
He tires of everything.

455
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,206
One day soon, he'll tire of me

456
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,831
and I'll end up
at the bottom of the lake with the fish.

457
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:58,630
Today he's infatuated with you.
He's quite dazzled.

458
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,637
He thinks he made you up,
just like that, out of the dust.

459
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,811
Tomorrow he snaps his fingers
and you vanish.

460
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,105
But you can leave, Sarrab.

461
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,399
If I run away, he'll find me.

462
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,611
If he can't find me, he'll find my sister.

463
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,693
Who's going to protect me
from Uday Hussein? You?

464
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,697
This is the way it is in Iraq.

465
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,998
It's him.

466
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,927
Latif?

467
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,847
I cannot sleep.

468
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,103
Take a pill.

469
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,701
You may kiss me now.

470
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,224
You must go to Basra, my son.

471
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,819
-What did he say?
-It's not him.

472
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,698
-Of course it's him.
-You don't know your own father?

473
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,245
-It wasn't him.
-Of course I do. What did he say?

474
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,617
Basra.

475
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,449
Basra?

476
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,660
Fuck Basra.

477
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,621
Don't expect me to go.

478
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,781
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

479
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:22,037
Millions of dollars a year
from the oilfields at Rumaila!

480
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,169
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

481
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:30,720
What is Kuwait?
Who made up this country?

482
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,179
The thieving British!

483
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:40,225
In 1935 they picked up a pen
and drew a line in the sand.

484
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,641
Kuwait is a fantasy!

485
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,020
-look, Mother. It's me.
-Kuwait is a lie!

486
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,908
Kuwait is the province of Iraq!

487
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,010
The age of the sheikhs is over!

488
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,183
-Qusay?
-Uday.

489
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,936
-Are you watching?
-He didn't fool me, my brother.

490
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,109
You can tell? How?

491
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,694
For one thing he's sober, and second
he's not foaming at the mouth.

492
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,347
It's a hit!

493
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,845
-Let's go!
-Go! Go! Go!

494
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,380
You've lost a lot of blood.

495
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,712
We might have to lose the little finger.

496
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,258
Who's going to tell Uday?

497
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,307
Take more. Take more.

498
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,684
Monsieur:

499
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,937
What? What?

500
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:35,567
The little finger. Right hand.
They're doing their best.

501
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,614
Fuck!

502
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,216
Is it you?

503
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,432
It's me.

504
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,695
The Americans are saying
Uday has been shot by the Shi'a.

505
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,742
But I know Uday is in Geneva,
gambling with his uncle.

506
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,196
He called me last night.

507
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:29,075
Yes, it is you.

508
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,758
-Where's Latif? Latif, with the finger?
-I'm busy. People are dying.

509
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,187
People are dying! People are dying!
People are fucking dying!

510
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,892
I know people are dying!
I know they are dying!

511
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,690
Men, women, Iraqi soldiers losing arms
and fucking legs. Brave people.

512
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,239
I don't give a fuck! Do you understand me?

513
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:45,784
Do you understand me? Fuck them!

514
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,987
-I don't give a fuck!
-You must go. Now.

515
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,616
GO, go, go, go. You must go.

516
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,712
Save his finger.

517
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,425
If you fail to save this men's finger,

518
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:05,554
I will kill every one of you.

519
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:19,147
Iraq's army is defeated.
Our military objectives are met.

520
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,819
Kuwait is once more
in the hands of Kuwaitis,

521
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,239
in control of their own destiny.

522
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,489
Oh, my God. Look at that.

523
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,114
I could fuck that. I could really fuck that.
Could you fuck that'?

524
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,285
Yassem.

525
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,333
I wonder if she's a virgin.

526
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,870
Do you think she's a virgin?

527
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,132
It's her wedding day. It is the best day
of her life. She is the man's bride.

528
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,336
Do you think she'll let me
stick my finger up her ass?

529
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,513
You think?

530
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,387
Come over. Come on.

531
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,810
Come.

532
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,979
I do like that dress.

533
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,397
Come here, darling.

534
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,980
You're beautiful, very, very beautiful.

535
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,687
You having a nice day?
Come, let me kiss you.

536
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,532
Very good. My brother.

537
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,901
Nothing serious.
As you can see, rumors of my death

538
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,568
-are scandalous lies...
-It's me.

539
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,271
...put out by the Americans.

540
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:13,734
Scandalous lies that insult
the intelligence of the Iraqi people.

541
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,707
Allahu akbar.

542
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,627
Allahu akbar?

543
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,296
Allah gives me nothing.

544
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,796
Everything I want I just take for myself.

545
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,607
Look at me.

546
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,776
I'm a fucking war hero.

547
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,450
Well, she's dead.

548
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,413
Find out who she is. Send them some
dinars for the damage. Are you deaf?

549
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:51,457
I said pick up the phone,
get hold of Said at the Olympic Committee.

550
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,416
-Do what I tell you.
-Do it yourself!

551
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,136
What? What did you say?

552
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,056
I said do it yourself.
I will not be part of this madness.

553
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,160
I will never let you go.
I will never let you go.

554
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,908
I love you too much.

555
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:31,917
Yassem.

556
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:51,107
I should have put a bulletin his head.

557
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,399
Then you would be just like him.

558
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,900
And you're not.

559
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,653
Praise God for that.

560
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,359
You're my Latif.

561
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,338
-You must go.
-No, he's gone. He's gone.

562
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:21,092
I know, but he'll be back. You must go.

563
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,765
How can you stand it'?
Why do you choose to live like this?

564
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,438
I didn't choose.

565
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,940
He chose me, just like he chose you.

566
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,510
You have a visitor.

567
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,316
I want you to do something for me.

568
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,836
I will look into this complaint.

569
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,506
If need be, I will talk to my father.

570
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,381
I'm a tired man.

571
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,963
I have a heart condition.

572
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,175
Look into my eyes. Look deep.

573
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,636
Can you see the pain there'?

574
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,768
This is the pain you give
to the people of Iraq.

575
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,396
Pain that never ends.

576
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,528
Today I have come to seek justice.

577
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,985
Will I be shown any compassion?

578
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,571
Justice. Compassion.

579
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,248
Fuck this!

580
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,916
Is this him?

581
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,542
Your daughter was a whore. She enjoyed it.

582
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,387
She was 14 years old.
No man has ever touched her.

583
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,136
God gave her beauty.
This was her downfall.

584
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,310
This is too much. You are a criminal.

585
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,605
-All of Iraq knows your crimes.
-You are a good man.

586
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,810
Give him 1,000 dinars for her time.
That is good money for a whore.

587
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,987
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

588
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,315
I'll put a fucking bullet
in your fucking head!

589
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,901
You, you, put a bullet in his head now.
Now!

590
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,861
-What has he clone?
-What has he done?

591
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,823
-He's a man who has lost his daughter.
-You heard what ha said about you?

592
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,408
-About me?
-About you, Uday Saddam Hussain.

593
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,118
It was not me who snatched her
off the street.

594
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,671
I didn't beat her.
If you want to kill him, kill him yourself.

595
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:03,091
You think you can pick and choose?
You think you can pick and choose?

596
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,338
You are nothing!
Without ma, you'd be hanging

597
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,091
from a fucking lamppost on Haifa Street.

598
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,515
I made you, Latif. I made you.
I gave you life.

599
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,218
If I want, I'll fucking take it away.
Now put a bullet in his head.

600
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:17,765
I'm not going to kill this man.
Kill me if you want.

601
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,393
-I don't care.
-You would die to save this man?

602
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,819
Go on, what are you waiting for'?
Kill me. Put a bullet in my head.

603
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:26,148
You're going to do it one of these nights
when the mood takes you.

604
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,948
Why not now?
Go on, put a bullet in my head.

605
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,618
Never. I love you too much.

606
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,905
No.

607
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,956
You love Uday.

608
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,544
You are not afraid to die?

609
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,963
You forget.

610
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,919
I died the day I came here.

611
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:47,134
You do not fear God.

612
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,180
Let me make this easy for you.

613
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,729
I don't believe it.
Somebody get this on tape.

614
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,227
Yassem! Come film this.

615
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,434
-This is better than a porno movie!
-Get me the hospital.

616
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:05,737
-Get out of my way.
-Yassem, film this. Film this.

617
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,025
Yassem! Yassem!

618
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,743
Yassem!

619
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:14,825
Get help.

620
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,166
He's the last person I'd be going out with.

621
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,924
-But he's my best friend.
-Well, you go out with him, then.

622
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,680
-Go out with who'?
-Nobody, Baba.

623
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,054
Am I missing something hers?

624
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,014
-I'll get it.
-Yes, Baba.

625
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,892
Gallalha's getting married next week.

626
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,060
Is she? That's good.

627
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,024
Makes life much easier for me.

628
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,810
Baba!

629
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,520
It's Latif!

630
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,662
Ju'an, run along, habibi.

631
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,537
Uday Saddam Hussein
invites you to a party.

632
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,961
His birthday.

633
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,126
He is never going to stop.

634
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,632
Son,

635
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,802
I don't want to know what you've done.

636
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:44,307
I want you to know
that I absolutely trust you.

637
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,607
And I am proud of you.

638
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,318
One day, when God wills it,

639
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,146
we'll have justice.

640
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,659
You must go.

641
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,913
You must leave this country,
go as far away as you can,

642
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,367
and don't come back
until Uday Hussein is dead and buried.

643
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,578
He will come looking for me.

644
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:14,125
He will come here. You know that.
He will come looking for you.

645
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,722
Go to this party, drink his whiskey.
We must look for the right moment.

646
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:24,553
-Don't ask me to do this.
-Latif, I am an old man.

647
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:28,481
My life is here.
Everything I have made of my life.

648
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,648
God gave me life, my son.

649
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,688
When he wills it, he'll take it away.

650
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,862
You will do as you are told.

651
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,263
You.

652
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:07,642
You, you, in the blue dress.
In the blue dress.

653
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,725
Get it off. Get it off, all of it.
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

654
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,484
Go on, take, take, take.

655
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,279
All of you, all of you. You, in the gold.

656
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:22,073
Give me... Take off your dress.
Take off your dress!

657
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,743
It's Uday's birthday party for my friends

658
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,917
and I want to see all of you naked,
all of you!

659
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:33,246
Come on! Come on, naked.
More. Blue clothing. Take it off!

660
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,457
Now, off. All of it. Take your knickers off.

661
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,758
Beautiful ass. Beautiful ass.

662
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,883
Come on! Take it off!
This is birthday celebration!

663
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,408
Good, good, good. I like it.

664
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,656
And you. Don't hide yourself.
Let me see you.

665
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:13,332
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You should show yourself.

666
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,039
It is a lot of beautiful people
for my birthday.

667
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,170
-That Mercedes....
-It's not for sale.

668
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,722
I heard you'd take 30,000.

669
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,674
There are two things I never do, Said.

670
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,510
I never pass wind in the presence
of the President of the Republic

671
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,391
and I never do business with pimps like you.

672
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:45,610
Latif! Latif!

673
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:46,990
God is great.

674
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,367
He gives my brother back to me.

675
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,837
-You didn't?
-I did. Come.

676
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,010
Come, come, come, come, come.

677
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:04,963
I quite enjoyed it.

678
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:08,015
It hurt like hell.
I thought I would need stitches.

679
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,260
What is Sarrab going to say?

680
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,022
Sarrab?

681
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,855
What is Sarrab going to say?

682
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,187
Why the fuck should you care
what Sarrab is going to say'?

683
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,526
Look at him.
Latif thinks because he looks like me,

684
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,862
he dresses like me, he sleeps in my bed,

685
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,571
he thinks he can fuck like me.

686
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,531
You think you can fuck my women?

687
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,242
He's jealous.

688
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,370
He wants to fuck you himself.

689
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,665
You know what this fucking Kurd
said to me?

690
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,626
I offered him 30,000 dinars
for that Mercedes.

691
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,588
He said he wouldn't sell it to a pimp.

692
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,139
Pimp? You called this gentleman a pimp?

693
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,308
-Gentleman'?
-He called you a pimp?

694
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,351
-Uday's.
-Uday's pimp? Uday's pimp?

695
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,805
-You called this man Uday's pimp?
-He's lying.

696
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,185
This man is my friend.

697
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:59,896
He is one of this country's
most successful businessmen.

698
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,693
Businessman?

699
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,988
What business is that? Cunt?

700
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:05,899
-Sit down.
-I'm leaving.

701
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,076
-Sit down.
-Arr-1 you leaving? No?

702
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,323
I am leaving.

703
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,995
Sit down. I'm talking to you.

704
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,033
What do you want from ma, Uday?

705
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:20,088
You belong to me, Latif.
You do as I say. Sit down.

706
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,584
You are going to have to shoot me
in the back.

707
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:22,836
Stop!

708
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,835
Stop! I order you to stop!

709
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:42,984
Fuck!

710
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:45,696
Take me with you.

711
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,990
You can't leave me here.

712
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,630
Kill him. He'd kill you.

713
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,134
I am not Uday.

714
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,759
Come on.

715
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,972
Keys.

716
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,656
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

717
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,456
You let him go.

718
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,410
He had a gun.

719
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,586
You had a gun.

720
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,004
He took it.

721
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,522
Fuck.

722
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:55,325
Second thoughts?

723
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,947
I should've put you out back there.
Would've been the smart thing to do.

724
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,455
-That's what Uday would have done.
-Not so smart.

725
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,878
Uday would have killed me first.

726
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,835
-Do you have any money?
-No.

727
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,417
-Nothing?
-I'm not a prostitute.

728
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,594
Too bad.

729
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,504
Do you ride?

730
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,103
Well, what does it say?
What does it say, Munem?

731
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,985
Uday Saddam Hussein has fled Iraq.

732
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,243
Sit down.

733
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,368
Who is this woman?

734
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,831
Some whore he met.

735
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,060
Uday will make an appearance
on the news at 1:00.

736
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,147
They're on their way here now.

737
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,352
She has no shoes on her feet.

738
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,742
This is what happens.

739
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,159
You give people an opportunity,

740
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,287
lift them up, let them eat at your table,

741
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,789
sleep in your bed.

742
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:57,416
And this is how they repay you.

743
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,709
Who is this?

744
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:43,796
I'm sitting here watching Ali
fuck your sister up the ass.

745
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,257
I'm not joking with you, Latif

746
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,802
Come back to Baghdad.

747
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,480
We can smoke a pipe together.

748
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,900
Fuck some women, drive some cars.

749
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,646
Don't tell me you need time to think.
Don't keep me waiting, brother.

750
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,324
Don't force my hand.

751
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:07,862
Come back, Latif.

752
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,240
I miss you.

753
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,667
I've got no one here to talk to.

754
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,329
Think of your mother and your father.

755
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,835
How did he get this number?

756
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,680
We just walked through the door.

757
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,928
Uday knows everybody.

758
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,806
These people in Malta
have a lot of business in Baghdad.

759
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,603
Half the people I know have money here.

760
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:34,930
They come to get their tits done.

761
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,732
We've got to get out of here.
We cannot stay hare.

762
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,946
We walk through the door
and he's on the phone.

763
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,365
He will never leave us alone.
I know him, has a fanatic.

764
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,692
He will never stop.
You're not listening to me!

765
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,656
Stop shouting at me!

766
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,209
I have a child.

767
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,377
A little girl.

768
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,170
Tara.

769
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:11,842
Nobody knows this, not even Uday.

770
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,562
She's with my sister in Samarra.

771
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:18,891
You have to help me.

772
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,648
You have to do something, Latif.
She's three years old.

773
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,229
I can't leave my daughter in Iraq.

774
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,612
You tell me this now?

775
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,994
I was too frightened.

776
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:34,573
-I didn't know what you'd do.
-This is insane.

777
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,124
You are insane.

778
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:40,663
-What kind of a woman are you?
-There's nothing else, wallahi, I swear it.

779
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,957
What do you expect me to do?

780
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,422
Who is the father?

781
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,754
Talk to him.

782
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,258
Do you even know who the father is?

783
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:59,310
Now that's Uday talking. I can hear it.

784
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,276
He's dead.

785
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,397
I spoke to my sister.

786
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,986
She knows a man who can drive
Tara to Amman. He wants US dollars.

787
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,573
It was you.

788
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:42,701
What do you mean?

789
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:49,042
How else did Uday know where I was?
There is no other way.

790
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,549
You never say anything nice, do you?

791
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,724
You never say I look pretty.

792
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:04,890
You never ask me how I'm feeling.

793
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:08,519
You never tell me you love me.

794
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:13,941
When you make love to me,

795
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:16,823
you're tender.

796
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:18,245
Only then.

797
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:25,582
Look at me, Latif.

798
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,423
Look at me.

799
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:32,800
What do you see?

800
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,512
Uday's whore?

801
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,721
-Is that what I am to you?
-I spoke to the operator.

802
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:45,810
He gave me a list of outgoing calls.

803
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,728
I didn't call the Iraqi Embassy three times.

804
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,657
It wasn't me
who called the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

805
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,359
I got scared.

806
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,536
I was calling my sister.

807
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,034
-I was scared for my daughter.
-It was you, Sarrab.

808
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,623
You.

809
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:14,001
You called Uday. You told him where I was.

810
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,460
It was you.

811
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,726
Take what you want, Sarrab.

812
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,600
There is money in the hotel room.

813
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,570
My poor Latif.

814
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,015
And how is Sarrab?

815
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:56,236
Did she tell you about her daughter
living with her sister'?

816
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:00,315
And you believed her.

817
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:02,947
Don't hang up the phone, motherfucker.
I have your father in my office.

818
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,871
Let me speak to him.

819
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,824
Come home, Latif.

820
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,164
Think of your father.

821
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,375
Come back to Baghdad.

822
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,750
I'm going to put your father on the phone.

823
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:21,211
I want you to listen
to what he has to say to you.

824
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,763
He's going to toll you what to do.

825
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:26,975
Here.

826
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,390
Speak to your son.

827
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,939
Are you well, my son?

828
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:42,073
Yes, I'm fine. Listen, I have a plan.

829
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:46,779
I'm going to say this once,
and it's my final word.

830
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:54,291
You will do as I tell you
or you are no longer my son.

831
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,385
Tell this evil son of a bitch

832
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,962
to goto hell.

833
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:10,969
Speak up, Latif.

834
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:14,063
What is it to be?

835
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,234
Goto hell.

836
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,363
Latif Yahia.

837
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:24,467
They took my father
to Uday's office that morning.

838
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,548
They dropped his body off
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

839
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:35,561
My mother was forbidden
to give him a decent burial.

840
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:40,855
She was told to bury him in the garden.

841
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:48,571
Nothing will bring my wife back.
Or your father.

842
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,411
Why have you come here?

843
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,368
What do you want?

844
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:41,669
Hey, girls! Girls!

845
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:43,712
You, come and talk to me.

846
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,310
Hey, you. Come here.
Come. I'll take you home.

847
01:40:57,385 --> 01:41:00,810
With the pretty hair.
You're very pretty. No, you are.

848
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:05,398
Please, come on. Where are you from?

849
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,038
Trying to get away from me, huh?

850
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,581
He's stopped.

851
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:29,008
Come on. Are they your friends?

852
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,344
Move. Ali. Ali, Yassem.

853
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:23,562
Get the fuck out! Move!

854
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:29,185
Yassem! Yassem!

855
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,770
Ali! Ali! No!

856
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,901
-No! Yassem! Yassem!
-This is for my wife!

857
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:56,008
Latif?

858
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:00,349
No! Please stop!

859
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:04,812
No! No!

860
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,775
Out of my way!

861
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:23,243
Move!

862
01:43:28,578 --> 01:43:29,921
You, stop!

863
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:31,498
Move, move!

864
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,632
Stop!

865
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,651
Clear the area!

866
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,573
Clear the area!

867
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,118
Move!
