1
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,203
I'm the man.

2
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:06,553
Are you okay?

3
00:01:07,363 --> 00:01:08,513
I'm totally okay.

4
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,602
By the way, what happened to your arm?

5
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,312
Is it because of the earthquake?

6
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:25,393
It's not broken, is it?

7
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:27,813
It's nice.

8
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:32,012
What's so nice when you're injured?

9
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,563
Are you really okay?

10
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,973
It feels so nice when you worry about me.

11
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:44,092
Since I'm already hurt,
I should've broken it.

12
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,683
What nonsense is that?

13
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,213
You can't fool me twice.

14
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,402
- Does it really hurt?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:56,403
Let me see.

16
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,403
Let me see.

17
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,243
Whatever.

18
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,392
Thanks...

19
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:14,503
...for accepting my love.

20
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:17,662
I'm sorry...

21
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,013
...for making you wait.

22
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,872
We are here.

23
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:27,502
My place is over there.

24
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:29,393
Oh, this is where you live.

25
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,593
I don't want to say bye.

26
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,283
Go. You said you needed to go right away.

27
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:39,443
Alright.

28
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,973
You can go in first, Secretary Jung.

29
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,383
You can go first, Director.

30
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:44,452
You first.

31
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,823
You go first, Director.

32
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,603
You go ahead. I'll go
after I see you go in.

33
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,523
Then...

34
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:53,163
Shall we count one, two, three
and leave at the same time?

35
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:55,762
Sure. Okay.

36
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,642
But then...

37
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,753
let's not do this, okay?

38
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,633
Okay.

39
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,103
- So embarrassing...
- Right.

40
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:03,824
- Play it cool.
- Sure, let's play it cool.

41
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,912
One.

42
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:07,743
Two.

43
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:08,743
Three.

44
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,282
What is this?

45
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:14,712
Jeez.

46
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:15,852
What is it?

47
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,852
Oh, really. Why aren't you going?

48
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,793
I really thought you were leaving.

49
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:22,492
Excuse me.

50
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,493
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,183
Go ahead.

52
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,563
I was really scared.

53
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,003
She is really leaving.

54
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:37,732
She will turn.

55
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,852
She will turn...

56
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,502
She will turn...

57
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,793
She will turn...

58
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,123
Coach

59
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:00,763
Oh, shit.

60
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,933
King of High School. Episode 9.

61
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:11,873
One.

62
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:13,453
Unless...

63
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,502
Two.

64
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:16,113
I'm...

65
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,263
crazy...

66
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:18,973
One.

67
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:20,863
How dare...

68
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,053
Two.

69
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,553
...would I sneak out?

70
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:30,893
One.

71
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,023
Unless...

72
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,523
That crazy dork.

73
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,532
He's doing this for an hour
already. He might die doing that.

74
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,513
Thank God we made up an excuse for him.

75
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,094
But why did that dork sneak out anyway?

76
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,353
How would I dare sneak out?

77
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,482
You, punk.

78
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,983
You can have an emergency.

79
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,152
But you left without telling me?

80
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,153
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,683
You finally struck out three times.

82
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,323
Huh?

83
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,092
I won't let this go this time.

84
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,812
We'll talk again after the league is over.

85
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:08,663
Got that?

86
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:09,713
Okay, sir.

87
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:13,232
Manage properly, okay?

88
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,233
Follow me.

89
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:15,463
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:24,302
You went crazy. You are completely crazy.

91
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:28,112
What's up with you? Why did you
sneak out? Where have you been?

92
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:29,412
I have my reasons.

93
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,683
Oh, hey.

94
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,653
Hey, hey.

95
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:39,222
I think he completely went
mad with too much punishment.

96
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,373
I think he got his head
injured along with his arm.

97
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:45,863
Stop it already.

98
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:47,113
Let's just go.

99
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,572
Hey, friends.

100
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:55,383
This hyungnim really loves you.

101
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,463
Jeez, crazy bastard.

102
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:12,822
Let me get up.

103
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,673
Hey, hey. Up.

104
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:19,593
My legs.

105
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,483
They don't belong to me any more.

106
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:24,463
Stop it.

107
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:25,502
They are not mine.

108
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,753
They are not his.

109
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,572
I really want to go.

110
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:31,873
Please let's go.

111
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,472
Yes, I'm home safely.

112
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:36,313
Are you home as well, Director?

113
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:41,063
How can I wait until Monday?

114
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,983
I miss you so much already.

115
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:48,552
Oh my, Director.

116
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:49,423
What...

117
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,973
We were together just a minute ago.

118
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:56,162
Oh, but your arm is hurt, and...

119
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,203
you can't rest because of work.
I'm worried.

120
00:06:58,903 --> 00:06:59,903
Huh?

121
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,802
Oh, that...

122
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,732
You know, after a business trip...

123
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,153
you need to take care of a lot of things.

124
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,813
Hubby Lee, did you enjoy
my fried tofu sushi?

125
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,213
You know...

126
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,143
We should...

127
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:14,833
When we finish work on Monday...

128
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,483
Wait for a second.

129
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,123
Hubby Lee.

130
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,052
Did you enjoy my fried tofu sushi?

131
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,453
You must be tired because
of the hard training.

132
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:26,423
Fighting.

133
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:27,293
If you are busy, we can hang up now.

134
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:28,992
Oh, no, no.

135
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:30,643
It was a text message from a friend.

136
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:32,163
So...

137
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,513
When we finish work on Monday...

138
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,483
let's have our first date.

139
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:42,923
Date?

140
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:47,043
I like that.

141
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,552
Is there anything you want to do?

142
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,163
What I want to do...

143
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,983
I'll think about it.

144
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,392
Director.

145
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,973
Take a rest now.

146
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:02,293
Okay.

147
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,263
What?

148
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,203
Gosh...

149
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,072
Unni, are you seeing someone?

150
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,772
Huh?

151
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:16,773
How did you know?

152
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,112
Am I an idiot?

153
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,234
You're making it so obvious.

154
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:20,873
What is it?

155
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,634
So, you finally decided
to see the director?

156
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:28,573
Then you should have
told your sister first.

157
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,022
You were saying you shouldn't see him.

158
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:32,893
When did you decide to see him?

159
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,523
Today is our first day together.

160
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,974
Oh, my. You're almost tickled pink. Are
you an elementary student or something?

161
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:40,532
Have him come over someday.
I'd like to meet him.

162
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,533
Sure.

163
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,842
Oh, god.

164
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,342
You...

165
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,403
You didn't... did you?

166
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:52,913
You wicked dork.

167
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:54,842
Is this for real?

168
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:57,592
Are you saying you decided
to date that popcorn sister?

169
00:08:57,593 --> 00:09:00,903
Popcorn sister, popcorn sister...
should I just pop those corns?

170
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,422
So, with that popcorn sister...

171
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,343
you went like this?

172
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,973
Oh, my. Oh, my.

173
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:11,862
By the way...

174
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,292
what are you really gonna do?

175
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,293
That pop...

176
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,102
I mean... that popcorn sister...

177
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,583
You said she is in her late twenties.

178
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,523
Her late twenties...

179
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:24,002
Age is not a problem here.

180
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,043
She doesn't know a thing about you.

181
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:31,742
You are Lee Hyung Suk, a 28-year-old super
ultra elite director of Comfo from Germany.

182
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:32,743
Out of breath...

183
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,882
Anyway, she knows you as Lee Hyung Suk.

184
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:38,004
She can't even imagine you as Lee Min Suk,
an eighteen year old high schooler.

185
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,492
This is a problem. A big problem.

186
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,492
What are you gonna do?

187
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:43,623
Do you think it makes sense?

188
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,563
Of course.

189
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:46,393
Sure.

190
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,583
I won't think of anything from now on.

191
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,763
What?

192
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,763
What?

193
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:52,403
I mean...

194
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,133
The fact that I like that woman...

195
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:57,943
I mean...

196
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,003
That noona...

197
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:00,793
Noona means older sister or older
female from a male perspective.

198
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,103
Noona.

199
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:01,103
Noona, right.

200
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:05,112
My feeling that I care
about the popcorn sister.

201
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:07,782
I'll only think about that. Nothing else.

202
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:10,082
I only believe in that and keep going.

203
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,083
Come on here.

204
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,982
You were so romantic there.

205
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:16,622
I really envy you. You
have everything, punk.

206
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,073
Congrats, huh?

207
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,193
You... you did...

208
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:24,692
- Did you do chup chup with lips?
- Chupa chupa.

209
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:25,932
Chupa chupa?

210
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,303
Oh, man.

211
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:30,102
How old do you think we are?

212
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,073
Chupa?

213
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:32,102
Chu?

214
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,853
What's up with chu chu? What was that?

215
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,723
Chu, chu...

216
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,943
Hey, what's next then?

217
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:48,003
I don't know. I don't know.

218
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,493
King of High School

219
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,093
Father, your food tastes extra
good today. Really, so good.

220
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:10,542
I haven't been to the market lately.

221
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,773
We are having the same food.
Overreacting...

222
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,012
You like it?

223
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:15,643
I like it.

224
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:16,643
Completely, no joking.

225
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,652
Gramps.

226
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:19,553
Wow!

227
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,733
Why are you looking...

228
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:22,823
extra handsome today?

229
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:24,173
Handsome guy!

230
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:25,523
Handsome guy!

231
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:25,893
Handsome guy!

232
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:26,973
Handsome guy!

233
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:30,863
I'm going.

234
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,263
Need to go.

235
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:32,993
Are you in a hurry?

236
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:33,933
Yes, I am.

237
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,683
Oh, Gramps.

238
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:38,873
Father.

239
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:41,202
I'm leaving.

240
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,202
Good-bye, Director.

241
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,393
Did he have a sweet dream or something?

242
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,173
Oh, my.

243
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,443
Is it your first love or something?

244
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:55,582
Yoo Ah.

245
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,323
How is it?

246
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:57,622
What do you think?

247
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:00,252
Really... You got me all curious.

248
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,233
What kind of ahjussi is it?

249
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:03,993
The scarf is...

250
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,232
I'm dying to see him.
Bring him over soon, okay?

251
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,233
Okay.

252
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,553
Director.

253
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,333
Hello.

254
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,133
Hello.

255
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:15,903
Oh, my.

256
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:17,073
You have something there.

257
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,303
Director.

258
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,912
Always dress up nicely, please.

259
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,042
What is that?

260
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:24,963
We all know you're his secretary.
Enough with all that nagging.

261
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,082
By the way, Soo Young...

262
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,452
why are you all dressed up today?

263
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,853
Do you have a date?

264
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:33,123
Oh, no...

265
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,752
Your hair...

266
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,462
You're wearing mascara, too.

267
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:39,463
You're right.

268
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,992
You're wearing perfume, too.

269
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:42,993
It's just cologne.

270
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,032
Can't I even wear mascara and perfume?

271
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,033
Soo Young.

272
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:52,823
All she has to say is no.
Why get mad at us?

273
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,512
Hello.

274
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:55,723
Oh, hello.

275
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:05,482
Hello.

276
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,492
Good morning.

277
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,722
Assistant Manager Yoon. Good morning.

278
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:09,723
Hello.

279
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,332
Soo Young, you must have
something nice going on.

280
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,383
Oh, no.

281
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,623
You're not telling the truth.

282
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,772
Something must be going on.

283
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,773
Nothing's going on...

284
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:03,783
Did you happen to hear about that person?

285
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:05,563
You know, long time ago...

286
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,203
who used to work as a
chauffeur for Lee Jung Soo.

287
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:09,833
Lee Jung Soo's chauffeur?

288
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:11,963
Oh...

289
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,733
the one with unique way of speech...

290
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:15,922
His name was...

291
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:16,623
Choi something...

292
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,103
Right. Chauffeur Choi.

293
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,099
Well...

294
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:23,192
After what happened to Lee Jung Soo,
I haven't heard anything.

295
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:24,953
Why bring up Chauffeur
Choi all of a sudden?

296
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:26,663
I think...

297
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,632
a few days ago...

298
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,383
I saw a man who looked like him.

299
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,424
Alright then. You can leave.

300
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,853
Alright then.

301
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,682
Jung Soo Young. Really...

302
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,922
I really didn't think of you
that way. I feel betrayed.

303
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,353
Excuse me?

304
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,673
You should get a conscience at least.

305
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:59,362
This is so good. You must have
enjoyed this everyday by yourself.

306
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:00,363
Oh, boy.

307
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:01,493
Director.

308
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:03,432
God.

309
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,703
Not that much. You slapped me too hard.

310
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:09,772
I didn't slap that hard.
Does it hurt a lot?

311
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,172
Touch it. Touch it.

312
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,612
You thought I would say that.

313
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,723
I won't be fooled anymore.

314
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,342
Speechless.

315
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:18,712
Speechless. You already figure me out?

316
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,912
We only dated for a few days.

317
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,833
Jeez, my life is ruined.

318
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,053
Try this, too.

319
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,062
Oh, it's so nice...

320
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,692
to eat while looking at the sky.

321
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,133
I feel like going out somewhere.

322
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,132
Let's go.

323
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,133
Excuse me?

324
00:15:39,134 --> 00:15:40,253
Let's go out.

325
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,602
Weekend starts tomorrow,
so we can go tomorrow.

326
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:45,842
Seriously?

327
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,212
Where to?

328
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,442
Well...

329
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:52,782
Hm... where should I take
you to make you happy?

330
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:53,783
Right.

331
00:15:54,513 --> 00:15:57,852
I'll get it all planned out today.

332
00:15:57,853 --> 00:15:58,853
You, Jung Soo Young...

333
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:00,352
can just come along...

334
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,703
You can bring things like
this, and just come.

335
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,062
Yeah!

336
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,613
Oh, yeah!

337
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,193
I have to work.

338
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:11,062
It's alright.

339
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:11,913
- Only ordinary workers...
- Director.

340
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:12,303
Huh?

341
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,033
This is your entire schedule for today.

342
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,473
I don't care how busy it is.

343
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:20,813
Come up all the way and
bother me when I'm eating?

344
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,963
I really don't understand you.

345
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,269
Just leave.

346
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,812
Go back to your work.

347
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:27,933
Just leave.

348
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,382
I can't...

349
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,852
...even enjoy my food.

350
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,953
I don't have anywhere to relax.

351
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:37,403
Isn't it too much?

352
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:40,843
Well...

353
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:43,043
Ji Dae Han wanted to buy me a coffee...

354
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:51,532
You said only ordinary workers come here.

355
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,023
I know. Why is he here?

356
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,223
It's my birthday today, and
what rotten luck I have!

357
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,013
Let's go together.

358
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:01,943
Oh, my.

359
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,012
- Director.
- You scared me.

360
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,082
What if someone sees us?

361
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,352
No one will. It's okay.

362
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:07,882
Gosh!

363
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:08,883
Director.

364
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:13,692
I'm a modern woman who can draw a line
between public and private matters.

365
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,422
Even before I establish
myself as a secretary,

366
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:18,783
I can never let people talk about
my private life behind my back.

367
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,363
There, there. There you go again.

368
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,702
Hey, Secretary.

369
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:25,703
Take this please.

370
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,173
Go first. Lead the way.

371
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:31,973
Let's go. Go.

372
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,013
You looked good together.

373
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,843
You and Director Lee.

374
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,503
Cheap women don't attract me much.

375
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:59,633
I mean...

376
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:03,623
You seem to change your mind
rather quickly, Jung Soo Young.

377
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,842
It's just advice.

378
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:09,863
I apologize if I was presumptuous.

379
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,182
Yes.

380
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,763
You were a little presumptuous.

381
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:16,753
Director Lee...

382
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,523
Do you really like him?

383
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,393
Yes, I do.

384
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,532
At least he is not like someone...

385
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,413
who is different inside out.

386
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,272
Oh, today...

387
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,443
...is Assistant Manager Park's birthday.

388
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,682
Shouldn't we have a party for him?

389
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:44,483
Oh, really?

390
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:45,812
Oh...

391
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,752
I'm too old to have a party.

392
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,382
It's alright.

393
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:56,022
If we didn't know, it would've been okay. But we
can't let it pass like that now that we know.

394
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,023
Assistant Manager Park.

395
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,662
We are going to sing a
song for you as a gift.

396
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,262
You treat us to lunch, okay?

397
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,553
Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

398
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:04,979
Song?

399
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:09,272
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

400
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,323
We sang a song. We sang a song for you.

401
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:13,373
Alright then...

402
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:15,272
Lunch is on me.

403
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:17,083
Wow, yeah!

404
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:19,542
- Director.
- Yes.

405
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:22,313
Today is Assistant Manager Park's birthday and
he's buying us lunch. Why don't you join us?

406
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,733
Oh... birthday...

407
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,792
You know on summer days,
cold ramen is the best.

408
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:31,992
Enjoy, enjoy.

409
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:34,232
Can I order chicken teriyaki or something?

410
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:38,563
If you don't have enough kkakdugi or pickled
radish, I'll bring it for you. Refills are free.

411
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:42,272
It looks yummy. Let's eat up
quickly and go back to work.

412
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:43,423
Sure.

413
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:44,863
No meat...

414
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,843
We haven't been weekend
mountain-climbing that much this spring.

415
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:50,992
We did a lot last year though.

416
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,412
That's right. It was so windy back then.

417
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,253
We are so fickle, aren't we?

418
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,533
Now it's brought up...

419
00:19:58,283 --> 00:19:59,422
shall we go mountain-climbing?

420
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:01,082
- Tomorrow is a holiday.
- Huh?

421
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,423
Mountain-climbing sounds good.

422
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,702
I was worrying about my fat belly
anyway. What about you guys?

423
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:10,063
Of course, I will. Doing nothing
on the weekend is so boring.

424
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,132
I am going, too. I have
nothing to do this weekend.

425
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,263
So am I. Nothing to do.

426
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,762
I...

427
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:18,432
don't think I can go. I need to visit my
mother. She wants to make seaweed soup for me.

428
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,243
Oh, that's a pity.

429
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:24,143
So, everyone will attend except
Assistant Manager Park, right?

430
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,242
Oh, oh... I...

431
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:30,762
have something with my family.
So I don't think I can go.

432
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,812
Oh...

433
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,282
Me, too. My friend is
getting married that day.

434
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:39,762
Oh, oh... What's going on?
Our important member...

435
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,763
Director Lee can't miss
it. It's so disappointing.

436
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:43,692
Oh, it's okay.

437
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:47,702
This time, only people who can make it can
go. We can go all together next time, okay?

438
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,363
Sure, sure.

439
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,082
Of course.

440
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,763
- The food here is good, isn't it?
- Sure.

441
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:57,412
By the way, our director...

442
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,572
Isn't he a little fishy these days?

443
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,742
What about him?

444
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:03,142
I mean, he whistles all day long.

445
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,752
He said he'd miss out
on the weekend outing.

446
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,703
His face looks so good.

447
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,833
It's fishy.

448
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:11,914
I think he's seeing someone.

449
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,362
You felt it, too, unni. I totally felt it.

450
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,692
With his career, personality,
and good-looks...

451
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,113
And he is so young...

452
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,362
What kind of woman would a
man like our director date?

453
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,303
I'm curious.

454
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,772
It's me. It's me.

455
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,523
I said it's me. Me!

456
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:32,812
Oh, gosh. I was once...

457
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,333
...really busy dating on weekends.

458
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:38,452
I miss those good old days.

459
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:42,152
When I went on a trip with my
boyfriend and missed the last bus...

460
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,182
That night...

461
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,592
our history began...

462
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:46,922
Really...

463
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:51,373
He knew what time the last bus was. He was saying
he lost his wallet and trying to kill time.

464
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:53,483
I found out later...

465
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,042
he was planning to miss
the last bus after all.

466
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,043
And? So?

467
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:59,772
What about it?

468
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:02,132
I pretended to go along.

469
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,072
What does a woman need
at a moment like that?

470
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,972
- Playing innocent...
- Oh, my god.

471
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,912
You're right. It's obvious what guys want
when they want to get out of the city.

472
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,913
That's their goal.

473
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:16,482
If he doesn't touch me on a trip like that,
it means he is not sexually attracted to me.

474
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,433
I will get so pissed off.

475
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:30,802
I'll get it all planned out today.

476
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:32,212
Jung Soo Young...

477
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:33,432
You can just come along.

478
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,732
Only come along...

479
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,733
- What's up?
- Oh, god.

480
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:39,502
What's that? What's up again?

481
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,523
Did you see a ghost or
something again? Huh?

482
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:43,573
Anyways...

483
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:45,992
You know, about outing...

484
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:46,763
I thought...

485
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:48,152
...about it a little.

486
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:52,322
Since it's our first time, let's make
it a trip. How about Namiseom?

487
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:55,343
I mean, we can ride a train.

488
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:58,053
Sounds good.

489
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:00,262
But...

490
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:03,143
I have something urgent to
do, so please excuse me.

491
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,333
What's up with her again?

492
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:10,804
She's so different. She
is not boring at all.

493
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:17,742
When I went on a trip with my
boyfriend and missed the last bus...

494
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:18,743
That night...

495
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:21,082
our history began...

496
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,982
It's obvious what guys want when
they want to get out of the city.

497
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,582
That's their goal.

498
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,583
Namiseom?

499
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:28,542
Soo Young, you're here.

500
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:31,243
So he's planning to spend some
time and stay there for one night?

501
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,222
- Oh, my... Really...
- Can you confirm it with the director and...

502
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,703
- Is he really?
- ...hand it over to the General Affairs Team?

503
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:38,163
Please?

504
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:41,762
That's what I was going to say...

505
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:44,583
...and you are gone. It's been
awhile since I was ignored.

506
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,703
One shot.

507
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:52,342
I was going on a date with my boyfriend.

508
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:53,843
Does he have any other intention?

509
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:55,412
What should I do?

510
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:57,833
FYI, the place is Namiseom.

511
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:12,462
I'll bet my whole porn collection
on that he has other intention.

512
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:13,163
Namiseom?

513
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:14,732
Isn't that classic?

514
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,172
100% impure intention! No, 200%.

515
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:18,202
Are you in elementary school?

516
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:19,672
Your boyfriend's intention is so obvious.

517
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,103
All guys are wolves.

518
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,502
What do you mean?

519
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,393
Go to the lingerie store
and get a sexy night gown.

520
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:42,022
I sent you the analysis of the teams
that we are going to have games with.

521
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:42,893
Study them thoroughly.

522
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,662
Oh, Coach.

523
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,743
He analyzed them really well.

524
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,283
What's going on?

525
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,623
What brings you all the way here?

526
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,842
This is the analysis from the Project Team.

527
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,412
This is the information on
the Y-Tower Mall remodel.

528
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:02,892
I don't like to come here anyway.

529
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:06,173
However, I have a special order from the
President to share it with the directors.

530
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:08,852
Oh, let's see...

531
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,052
I'm busy. It's messy here, so...

532
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,053
put it over there.

533
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:13,613
Look at it and give me your opinion.

534
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:20,713
And what? What's up? What? What again?

535
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:24,062
Let's move our meeting
next week one hour later.

536
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:25,063
I have something.

537
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:26,302
You can do as you like.

538
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:27,303
Sure.

539
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,262
Regarding Lee Hyung Suk.

540
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,113
You were suspicious of him, and...

541
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,042
you said you have a way to find out.

542
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:39,212
So...

543
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,012
is that going well?

544
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,552
I felt he was trying to hide something.

545
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:44,833
So I was going to find it out.

546
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:47,573
But it didn't work out well.

547
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,863
It didn't work out too well, you say...

548
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:55,192
There must be something
you can't do, I guess.

549
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:58,353
He seems to have visited Germany
after he joined the company.

550
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,783
I don't know what he's cooking up.

551
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:03,173
I can't even...

552
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,203
...guess in the least.

553
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:05,603
So...

554
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,923
Are you saying you are giving up like this?

555
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,043
No, I'm not.

556
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,343
I will try other routes.

557
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,463
He's up to something for sure.

558
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,803
I was going to buy you something nice.

559
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,022
What's up with spicy
rice cake on the street?

560
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,863
There's nothing as good as this.

561
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:28,413
Why do you keep staring?

562
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:31,043
I didn't.

563
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,113
You did.

564
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,003
Oh, no.

565
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,402
Is something on me?

566
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:36,403
Nothing's on you.

567
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:42,273
Oh, jeez. It's all over you.

568
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:44,313
Come on.

569
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:45,893
What is that?

570
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:49,233
There's rice cake here.

571
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:51,983
It's fine.

572
00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:54,123
Oh, my.

573
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:56,953
Oh, Director.

574
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:58,303
Why are you so messy?

575
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:05,343
Oh, we are already here.

576
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:07,312
You can go now.

577
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,313
Already?

578
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,902
I want to talk more and...

579
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,102
Please go now.

580
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,103
I have no time.

581
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:14,923
You scared me.

582
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:17,212
What? What time?

583
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:18,642
You have an appointment?

584
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:21,542
No, I mean, we are going to be
together all day long tomorrow.

585
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,483
You need to go and take a rest.

586
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,282
Okay.

587
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:26,922
Oh, let's just do that then.

588
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:27,982
I'll go.

589
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:28,883
See you tomorrow.

590
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:29,933
Bye.

591
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:33,253
Go.

592
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:37,762
Go safely. Don't trip.

593
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:38,832
Okay.

594
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,833
See you tomorrow.

595
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:52,993
Welcome.

596
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:59,563
I'd like to look at some
comfortable underwear.

597
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:04,422
That's a new product.

598
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:06,952
It's hot item these days.

599
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,823
Are you going on a honeymoon?

600
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,423
It just looks so interesting.

601
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,893
- Take your time.
- Thanks.

602
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:22,702
Oh, my.

603
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,302
It looks so comfy.

604
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,303
So stretchy...

605
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:33,953
What?

606
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,313
Namiseom?

607
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,203
Yeah. What?

608
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,593
This, this...

609
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:43,992
You will go far. Really far...

610
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:46,662
How can you be so smart
about things like that?

611
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:48,633
So you're going there on a date, and...

612
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,332
what, what... you missed
the last ferry, and...

613
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,073
and you find a place for the night and...

614
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,823
Oh, god. It makes me so hot.

615
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:00,943
You punk.

616
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,493
You punk.

617
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,982
That's the only thing you can think of.

618
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:07,382
- Here's the Donburi you ordered.
- Thank you.

619
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:08,353
Thanks.

620
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:09,752
You like that, don't you?

621
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:12,053
We are normal.

622
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:15,143
We are just young blood.

623
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,092
Jeez.

624
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,093
Namiseom?

625
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,133
Idiots.

626
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:23,513
What the hell are you looking at?

627
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:27,032
Yeah, I am Lee Min Suk, an
eighteen-year-old high schooler.

628
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,273
Then can I do it just because
I say I want to do it?

629
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:34,542
So the situation is rather...
what about it?

630
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:35,313
Huh?

631
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:35,843
Hey.

632
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:38,712
People's mind and body usually...

633
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,663
...don't go together.

634
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:45,882
We are eighteen-year-old high schoolers.

635
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,173
And we have someone we
love right next to us.

636
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:49,493
Then we grab like this...

637
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:51,622
Come here. Come on.

638
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,392
Oh, no, no, oppa.

639
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:57,063
- You said you were going to just hold hands.
- Come on.

640
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,462
Are you going to live...

641
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:00,463
...like that forever?

642
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:01,803
I think so.

643
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,373
Forever?

644
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,722
Stop playing dumb.

645
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:07,643
Hey, I'm eating.

646
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:08,373
You got scared, right?

647
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,373
Yeah.

648
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,442
How can you do this to me now?

649
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,312
I have an unexpected appointment.
Let's drink another time.

650
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,252
You can't, really.

651
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:20,622
I rejected all other invitations because
you asked me to drink with you first.

652
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:21,483
I mean...

653
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:24,522
I have to go and look after
my kid if you do this to me?

654
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,922
So what are you saying?

655
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:28,093
Do you want me to cancel my
appointment in order to play with you?

656
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,443
Of course, you should.

657
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:31,893
Okay then...

658
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:32,893
You can go.

659
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,783
Don't drink too much.

660
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,972
What should I do now?

661
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,523
Okay, okay.

662
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,073
Here you go.

663
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,912
Tell your wife to buy what she wants.

664
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,223
Managing Director...

665
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,213
I'll be loyal.

666
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:51,403
Oh, god.

667
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,133
Do you think you should do this?

668
00:30:56,623 --> 00:31:00,393
I really... I won't get
caught, okay, Team Leader?

669
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:01,463
Team Leader.

670
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:04,792
Culture Money $5...

671
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:06,943
That little... I will...

672
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:10,883
What am I gonna do with this?

673
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,102
Team Leader Kim.

674
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:13,803
Oh, yes.

675
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,272
Director Yoo.

676
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,502
Are you going home?

677
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:16,903
Yes.

678
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:18,343
Are you going home now?

679
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:22,442
I finished work a while ago, but Managing
Director Han asked me to go for a drink, so...

680
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:23,842
What am I saying...

681
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,682
I was about to have a drink with my friend.

682
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,643
But we couldn't find time,
so I was just leaving.

683
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:28,853
Oh, I see.

684
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,382
Then shall we go for a drink
since both of us got stood up?

685
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:32,383
Excuse me?

686
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:40,743
I don't know. I really don't.

687
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,193
I don't know.

688
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,783
I'm home.

689
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:51,992
What are you doing?

690
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,993
What is that?

691
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,493
I put a hot patch on.

692
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,612
I stood up all day long,
and my legs are killing me.

693
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,712
What did you buy?

694
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:01,812
Hey, you.

695
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:02,982
Oh...

696
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:04,222
What is it?

697
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,223
Bag.

698
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:07,722
You said it's only for one day.

699
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:09,143
Why did you pack your make-up?

700
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,013
Are you going to spend the night, unni?

701
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:16,262
What...

702
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:18,202
You little thing. How can you say that?

703
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,163
Yoo Ah. You think this unni...

704
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:20,163
this unni...

705
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:22,432
...taught you like that?

706
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:23,942
You're fishy.

707
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,472
Give me your bag. I need to check.

708
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:28,712
What? What are you checking?

709
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,363
Go inside and study.

710
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,493
When did I ever study?

711
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:34,962
Don't even think about
spending the night there.

712
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:36,682
I'll tell on you to Mom right away.

713
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:37,683
Yoo Ah.

714
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,132
I've had it too long.

715
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,262
Oh, my.

716
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:51,023
There won't be any side
effects, will there?

717
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:57,502
It's such an honor.

718
00:32:57,503 --> 00:32:58,742
How...

719
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,242
can you, Director Yoo...

720
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:03,042
...ask me to be a drinking buddy first?

721
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:07,082
This is where the Retail Team comes often.

722
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,903
- I don't know if you like it, too.
- Yes.

723
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,082
You can talk comfortably
when we meet privately.

724
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,223
I am way younger than you.

725
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:15,623
Oh, my.

726
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:21,312
Oh, I feel so good. Director Yoo...

727
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:22,432
Right, Jin Woo.

728
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,533
You punk. You're so cute.

729
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:28,183
Wait. This hyung will give
you an allowance today.

730
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,332
I'll give you an allowance. Here you go.

731
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,472
Allowance...

732
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:33,353
You can spend it. Freely...

733
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:34,673
Right.

734
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:39,612
Seriously, the Retail Team atmosphere is
very good since you make it so comfortable.

735
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,193
Oh, no.

736
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,912
Especially Director Lee Hyung Suk...

737
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,712
and you seem so special.

738
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:50,022
We are not special at all. Not at all.
I really don't like him. So annoying.

739
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:52,953
- Hoobae means lowerclassman.
- He is your hoobae from high school, right?

740
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,243
How was he in high school?

741
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:55,993
High school?

742
00:33:58,393 --> 00:33:59,892
- He was picky.
- Picky?

743
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,913
That punk is so annoying.

744
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:05,602
He thinks of sunbae as shit.

745
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:11,012
When he passed by, it was like cold
wind started blowing. So cold...

746
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,013
Lee Hyung Suk...

747
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:16,063
That punk finally stabbed
me in the back, and...

748
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,443
Stabbed you in the back?

749
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:20,752
Oh, no...

750
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:21,753
A long time ago...

751
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:24,153
A long time ago...

752
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,323
I'm saying he did it a long time ago.

753
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:27,553
As time goes...

754
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,422
You know him, too. That punk...

755
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:31,632
What do you think of him?
Is he like that anymore?

756
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:35,103
Now he is so sly. So sly. He is so...

757
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,863
He comes to work for fun. For fun.

758
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:41,073
Now he has changed.

759
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,503
By the way...

760
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,573
Did Director Lee Hyung Suk...

761
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:47,843
happen to visit Germany...

762
00:34:47,844 --> 00:34:49,213
Lee Hyung Suk...

763
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:51,743
That punk is annoying.

764
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:53,453
That jerk...

765
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:57,982
He gives me such a hard time
that I feel like dying.

766
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:00,422
What? Why? What did Director Lee do?

767
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:01,593
I mean, that bastard...

768
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:04,363
That bastard always gives me bullshit.

769
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:07,763
I do all the work for him, and
he always orders me around.

770
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,563
It's all because of that Lee Hyung Suk.

771
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,972
Taxi, taxi!

772
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:13,773
Wait.

773
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:14,773
I'm not going home.

774
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:19,843
Come on, come on.

775
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:21,689
I won't go home.

776
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,773
I'm not going.

777
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:24,513
I'm a free man.

778
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:25,483
Please go.

779
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,325
I'm a free man. How about
a second round, huh?

780
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:28,713
Jin Woo.

781
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,623
- It's me, hyung.
- Please take him safely.

782
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:31,653
Hey.

783
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:34,053
So many nice places...

784
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,323
Oh, Son.

785
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:41,093
What are you doing?

786
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:42,293
Huh? Hm...

787
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,233
Strategy. I'm reading strategies.

788
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:46,433
Strategies?

789
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:47,333
Strategy analysis?

790
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:48,973
Yeah, right. Strategy analysis.

791
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:51,733
Yeah.

792
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:53,903
It's high time for you to read those.

793
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,249
Nothing like that.

794
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:56,273
Right.

795
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:57,313
I won't say a thing.

796
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:58,043
I'm serious.

797
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,183
If you don't have any training tomorrow,

798
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,653
do you want to go grocery shopping with me?

799
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:06,553
That's a good idea. Yeah, but
I do have training tomorrow.

800
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,793
Oh, my. When the game is over,

801
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,093
he should let the kids rest for a few days.

802
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,739
Alright.

803
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,562
Don't enjoy too much. Take a rest.

804
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:16,593
It's not like that.

805
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:17,839
I really mean it.

806
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:18,603
Goodnight.

807
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,663
It's not.

808
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:20,603
Adieu.

809
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:21,903
I'm saying it's not.

810
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:23,103
No.

811
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:26,573
No, Father. I mean. Really. God.

812
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:34,493
Perhaps...

813
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,029
Jung Soo Young.

814
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:42,053
Gosh.

815
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:11,603
What is it? Was I sleeping or what?

816
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,723
Let's just sleep, Soo Young.

817
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,522
Oh, my.

818
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:18,843
I'm so tired.

819
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:21,613
Let's sleep.

820
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,403
Oh, god.

821
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:40,523
Oh, no.

822
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,763
No, no. C'mon.

823
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,583
Really...

824
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:54,193
No way.

825
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:22,823
Oh, gosh.

826
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:24,953
I'm late. Gosh!

827
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,623
King of High School

828
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:30,713
Why is she late?

829
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,063
Director.

830
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,513
What is it? What took you so long?

831
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:40,973
I'm sorry. I overslept.

832
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:43,302
Jeez...

833
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:45,272
Just like a kid going on a picnic...

834
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,642
You didn't sleep soundly, right?

835
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:47,712
Yeah.

836
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:48,643
Just like a kid...

837
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:49,643
Oh, my.

838
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:50,773
What?

839
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:52,733
We are late. Let's hurry.

840
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:54,653
Let's hurry.

841
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:57,163
Who came late anyway?

842
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:58,823
Let's go together.

843
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:02,352
Wow...

844
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,222
Yeah, Namiseom.

845
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,223
The weather's so nice.

846
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:08,693
What do you want to do first?

847
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:12,453
What? Do what?

848
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,032
Again, again. Why are you doing this?

849
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:16,834
Huh? You skipped your
breakfast or something?

850
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,872
You want to stroll a little or...

851
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:20,873
...eat something?

852
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,443
I don't feel like eating yet.

853
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:24,573
Okay, then let's go.

854
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,663
Namiseom.

855
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:28,983
Namiseom.

856
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:30,882
Hey, ahjussi, we want two bicycles.

857
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:31,923
Can I have your ID please?

858
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:34,603
You need an ID for a bicycle?

859
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:43,593
Oh.

860
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,403
Oh, I left my ID at home.

861
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:50,683
We can use yours. You can give him yours.

862
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:53,943
I don't carry it either.

863
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,572
I don't have it with me. What should we do?

864
00:39:56,573 --> 00:39:57,473
What are you saying? I saw...

865
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:58,612
No, no.

866
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,543
I saw it for sure.

867
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:00,083
That's just a card.

868
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,083
There it is.

869
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:02,413
Your ID card.

870
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,283
I look exactly the same.

871
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:12,993
It's true.

872
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:15,963
So cute.

873
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:17,933
Baby fat...

874
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,933
So chubby that I feel like biting...

875
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:22,783
Please.

876
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,433
So cute. What am I gonna do?

877
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,802
It must be quite a long time ago.

878
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:28,503
Long time ago.

879
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,673
It must be. With chubby
cheeks and all that.

880
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:56,603
Thank you.

881
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:49,883
One, two, three.

882
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:53,992
Why?

883
00:41:53,993 --> 00:41:54,993
Huh?

884
00:41:55,453 --> 00:42:00,292
It's really nice. It's so nice coming here
with you and walking with you holding hands.

885
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:01,293
So romantic.

886
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,332
Wow, look at all those trees.

887
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
Wow.

888
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:09,273
That...

889
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,102
That must be a pension.

890
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:16,472
They all look the same and gather
together like that. So cute.

891
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:17,782
How can they be so cute?

892
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:18,583
Oh...

893
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,413
Pension?

894
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,052
Yeah, pension. Look over there.

895
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:22,912
Why did he start talking about
pensions all of a sudden?

896
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:23,952
Now that it's almost time to go...

897
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:25,682
is he working it?

898
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,183
With all the people here...

899
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:30,193
I need to take a picture of
this. Of course, I should.

900
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:33,593
It's gone.

901
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:35,432
What?

902
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:36,992
- My cell phone.
- Oh, no.

903
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:37,733
Gosh.

904
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:38,802
Your cell phone?

905
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:39,803
Look for it carefully.

906
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:40,932
I...

907
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,202
until a moment ago...

908
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:45,902
...remember holding it
with this hand. Wait.

909
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:47,723
There's no way I put it in the bag.

910
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:50,713
It's not here.

911
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:52,743
Where is it?

912
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:56,882
Oh, restaurant...

913
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:58,883
I must have left it at the restaurant.

914
00:42:59,283 --> 00:43:00,722
Res... restaurant?

915
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:01,683
Yeah.

916
00:43:01,683 --> 00:43:02,623
Oh, jeez.

917
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:06,893
He knew what time the last bus came, and he was
saying he lost his wallet and trying to kill time.

918
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:09,513
I found out later...

919
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:12,713
he was planning to miss
the last bus after all.

920
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:16,732
Oh, everything fits perfectly.

921
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,353
Is he putting up a show?

922
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,212
I was holding it the whole time.
It's absurd.

923
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:27,653
I was looking for it all over
the place, but I can't find it.

924
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:29,482
You don't have it?

925
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,583
This can't be happening. I was really...

926
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:36,282
I remember holding it in my hand
before I entered the restaurant.

927
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:36,753
Then...

928
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:37,922
why don't I...

929
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,352
...give you a call?

930
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:40,243
Oh, go ahead.

931
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:41,762
Can you try to look for it one more time?

932
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,582
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

933
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,993
This is so strange.

934
00:43:45,363 --> 00:43:47,712
I was holding it and going inside...

935
00:43:47,713 --> 00:43:50,903
I don't remember leaving here,
but when I entered here...

936
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,702
Oh, right. Someone called and I got it.

937
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,703
Director.

938
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,443
Can you hear the vibrating sound from here?

939
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,303
I don't.

940
00:43:57,613 --> 00:43:58,613
I do.

941
00:43:58,613 --> 00:43:59,243
I hear it.

942
00:43:59,243 --> 00:43:59,813
I can't hear it.

943
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:01,332
I just heard it. Just now.

944
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,912
- You heard it?
- Look in there.

945
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:04,522
It can't be.

946
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:06,483
I searched it already.

947
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:08,593
I don't see it.

948
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:13,222
It was here. Because of the tissues...

949
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:15,362
I couldn't hear it well
because it was covered.

950
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:17,522
What is it? What's up
with this awkward acting?

951
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:19,032
It's true.

952
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,632
He is playing a trick to kill
time and miss the train.

953
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:24,652
I found it. I got it here. Thank you.

954
00:44:24,653 --> 00:44:27,073
Let's go. We ran so hard for nothing.

955
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:31,973
What should I do?

956
00:44:32,413 --> 00:44:34,642
What if he makes up other
excuses and tries to kill time?

957
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,982
Should I just let it pass this time again?

958
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:38,242
What should I do?

959
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,303
What should I do?

960
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:44,082
It's almost time for the
ferry. I'm so bummed.

961
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,033
Is it just me?

962
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:46,352
So what?

963
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:49,422
What are you trying to say? Are you
saying we should spend the night here?

964
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,263
Right.

965
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:52,723
Let's take a picture to prove we were here.

966
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:55,483
Come on up here.

967
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:57,403
Let's take a picture.

968
00:44:58,233 --> 00:44:59,402
Okay.

969
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:01,872
Take it with my phone and
I'll send it to you later.

970
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:02,403
Right.

971
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:03,572
Okay.

972
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:05,853
Come on. Take it now.

973
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:07,973
One, two, three.

974
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:12,683
What?

975
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:15,362
He looks just like Assistant Manager Park.

976
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:16,563
Oh, Park Heung Bae.

977
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:20,229
Assistant Manager Park.

978
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:20,753
Huh?

979
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:22,652
- That's Assistant Manager Park.
- What are you talking about?

980
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:23,653
Should I do that, too?

981
00:45:24,843 --> 00:45:26,322
Sure, sure.

982
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,963
What, what? You want me to
buy mixed bean paste, and...

983
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:29,893
Oh, jeez.

984
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,963
Okay, got it. Sure...

985
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,622
Oh, god.

986
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:38,473
Why do all the mosquitoes
in Namiseom bite me?

987
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,243
Oh, boy... It feels so
good to be back home.

988
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,562
He's gone.

989
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:47,083
He's really gone. It's fine.

990
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:49,752
Wow, no way. Don't grab me. It's hot.

991
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:51,352
Nonsense.

992
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:55,402
Assistant Manager Park said he'd
visit his mom, and here is where...

993
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:56,492
Wow...

994
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:57,822
His mom lives here?

995
00:45:57,823 --> 00:46:01,092
Oh, my. What a small world. This is
why you should be nice all the time.

996
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,092
Wow, crazy. Wait, it's hot.

997
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,462
I am so taken aback.

998
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:05,133
Wow!

999
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,533
Where are you going? Wait
for me. I'm in shock.

1000
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,072
Wow!

1001
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:11,532
It doesn't make any sense. So shocking.

1002
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:17,393
How can we meet at a place like
this? It's beyond my imagination.

1003
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:19,633
We don't have enough time.

1004
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:21,992
We only have short time.

1005
00:46:21,993 --> 00:46:24,862
We don't have enough time. We should hurry.

1006
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:26,023
Let's go quickly.

1007
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:27,953
Why?

1008
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,522
Why do we need to hurry again?

1009
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,452
- We need to go. We are late.
- Why?

1010
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:34,423
We are late. Please come with me.

1011
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:36,813
Come on, come on.

1012
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,432
Whew...

1013
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:42,962
So scared.

1014
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:48,272
I was so scared of missing the ferry.

1015
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,693
It's so fortunate.

1016
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:53,582
By the way... there in Namiseom...

1017
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,192
If he doesn't touch me when
we're at a place like that,

1018
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:57,093
it means he's not sexually attracted to me.

1019
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:00,522
I will get so pissed off.

1020
00:47:00,523 --> 00:47:01,633
It's so amazing.

1021
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:02,723
This...

1022
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:06,202
If you just come back without anything happening,
then you are not a woman, and he is not a man.

1023
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,042
Don't you think so?

1024
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,293
It's nonsense.

1025
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,692
Oh, jeez...

1026
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,333
I ran so much, I'm hungry again.

1027
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,413
Good. I brought this with me.

1028
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,203
Would you like some?

1029
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:24,453
Secretary Jung, want some?

1030
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,072
You don't want any?

1031
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:27,313
You go ahead.

1032
00:47:27,823 --> 00:47:29,193
Do you want some water then?

1033
00:47:33,913 --> 00:47:35,133
You don't feel like it either.

1034
00:47:36,903 --> 00:47:39,343
Oh, so tired.

1035
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:46,483
What is it? What again?

1036
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:52,402
You should tell me so that I'd
know. What are you mad about?

1037
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,583
I'm not mad.

1038
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:57,453
Please tell me. Come on.

1039
00:47:57,803 --> 00:47:58,953
I'm not mad.

1040
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,773
I won't let this go until you tell me.

1041
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,542
Please let go.

1042
00:48:04,543 --> 00:48:05,703
I need to go to the restroom.

1043
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:09,922
You need to tell me what made you mad.

1044
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,552
Then I can apologize or do something.

1045
00:48:12,553 --> 00:48:13,673
So frustrating...

1046
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,322
Black bean noodles.

1047
00:48:16,323 --> 00:48:18,373
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

1048
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:24,113
I think you'll go bankrupt pretty soon.

1049
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,503
What did that jerk say?

1050
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,423
I don't know.

1051
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:30,672
Wang San's black bean noodles are the best.

1052
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:32,152
I think he said something bad.

1053
00:48:32,153 --> 00:48:33,153
I don't care.

1054
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,712
Hey, I wish...

1055
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:39,232
yours is as good as this, so that
we don't have to order like this.

1056
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,933
That's what I'm saying.

1057
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,123
Huh?

1058
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,123
Hey.

1059
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:53,262
Who in the world is this?

1060
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:57,193
Isn't this Director Lee Hyung Suk
who went on a date with a "woman"?

1061
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:02,003
Hey, Duk Hwan. It's an SOS.
I'm not joking. I'm dead serious.

1062
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:04,073
What, what? Did something happen?

1063
00:49:04,193 --> 00:49:08,272
No, I mean, we had a good time
so far. But the popcorn sister...

1064
00:49:08,273 --> 00:49:10,172
...got so pissed off all of a
sudden. What's up with this?

1065
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:13,043
What should I do? I don't
know what to do first.

1066
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:17,412
Hey, I'm all ears. Describe
what's been happening so far.

1067
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,573
Since when was she like that?

1068
00:49:18,683 --> 00:49:19,683
Ah...

1069
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,092
Oh, that... It was that.

1070
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:27,172
What? You don't even know how women
think. You ignorant director punk.

1071
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,442
Hey, okay.

1072
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:31,383
Okay, I'll take care of it. Hang up, punk.

1073
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,862
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

1074
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:35,713
I...

1075
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:40,202
should have known women are
sensitive to that kind of thing.

1076
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:41,053
What?

1077
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:42,572
I mean...

1078
00:49:42,573 --> 00:49:45,172
when we took a picture in Namiseom...

1079
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:49,542
I pulled myself back and that
makes your face look this big.

1080
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:51,212
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

1081
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:52,363
What are you talking about?

1082
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:55,752
- Director.
- Huh?

1083
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,152
- I'll go.
- Isn't this it?

1084
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:58,452
That's not it?

1085
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,153
I'll go.

1086
00:49:59,153 --> 00:49:59,723
You should tell me.

1087
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:00,813
Please let go of me.

1088
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,072
Jeez, what a temper you have.

1089
00:50:03,073 --> 00:50:04,562
Oh, no. Please.

1090
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,563
What is it?

1091
00:50:05,663 --> 00:50:08,333
What is it? Why is it full
of underwear and toiletries?

1092
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:09,913
Oh, no.

1093
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:12,272
No, no.

1094
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:12,903
What the...

1095
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:13,953
It's a scarf.

1096
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,802
Is this a scarf, too?

1097
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:17,124
I was about to layer my clothing.

1098
00:50:17,543 --> 00:50:20,262
This. This is an arm warmer.

1099
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:21,713
Arm warmers are all closed.

1100
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,822
Why do you mean, "Ah"?

1101
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:39,733
It's not what you think. I didn't
bring all this for tonight.

1102
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:42,533
I mean...

1103
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:44,762
Perhaps...

1104
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:47,332
No one knows what will happen.

1105
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,142
Tomorrow..

1106
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:51,543
Something can happen to us.

1107
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:54,623
So I was just ready.

1108
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:00,662
You are right.

1109
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:01,663
I came prepared.

1110
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,532
People said...

1111
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:05,842
when you go to a place like this,

1112
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:08,943
men and women are thinking
about the same thing.

1113
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:11,602
Otherwise, you are not even a man.

1114
00:51:11,603 --> 00:51:13,813
They said he is not looking
at you as a woman.

1115
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:18,012
What am I to you?

1116
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,303
Am I a woman to you, Director?

1117
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:22,772
Am I a man?

1118
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,703
Or am I a hermaphrodite or something?

1119
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:28,693
Am I not attractive as a woman?

1120
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:33,383
Why do you like me?

1121
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:35,563
Why are you dating me?

1122
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,303
Never mind.

1123
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:42,543
What am I saying?

1124
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:50,432
Jeez.

1125
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,083
Really...

1126
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:56,233
Oh god, please slow down.

1127
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:59,102
Why do you walk so fast?

1128
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,172
What?

1129
00:52:00,173 --> 00:52:01,862
This is so unfair.

1130
00:52:01,863 --> 00:52:05,542
This feels so unfair if
you think of me like that.

1131
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:06,782
I also...

1132
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,852
couldn't sleep last night because I was
so excited about being with you all day.

1133
00:52:10,853 --> 00:52:12,722
You really don't know...

1134
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:14,172
...I like you, Jung Soo Young?

1135
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,822
I like women for sure, not men.

1136
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:17,703
What are you talking about?

1137
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:19,963
Eh?

1138
00:52:20,823 --> 00:52:22,233
You will fall down.

1139
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:28,652
Do you even know how much I held back?

1140
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:31,202
I was next to you all day, and
my heart was pounding like crazy.

1141
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:34,042
I had a hard time holding
it back. Shouldn't I have?

1142
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:34,893
Shouldn't I have?

1143
00:52:34,894 --> 00:52:37,272
Then I won't from now. Like this.

1144
00:52:37,273 --> 00:52:37,893
Gosh.

1145
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:39,713
Like this...

1146
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:44,883
Look at you...

1147
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:47,573
You are so unpredictable, Jung Soo Young.

1148
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:49,983
Come here.

1149
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:52,272
No?

1150
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:54,413
One, two, three.

1151
00:52:57,963 --> 00:52:59,292
Oh, my.

1152
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:00,662
Jeez.

1153
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:02,453
You know how much I like you.

1154
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:05,132
Don't ever doubt that, okay?

1155
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,242
I'm crazy about you, Jung Soo Young.

1156
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:08,853
So crazy, okay?

1157
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:11,049
It's hot.

1158
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:12,043
Jeez...

1159
00:53:12,044 --> 00:53:13,324
Let's stay like this for awhile.

1160
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:15,443
I'm hot.

1161
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,002
Really?

1162
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:18,633
Are you really hot?

1163
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:19,383
I'm hot.

1164
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,613
Seriously?

1165
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:27,873
If you are hot, let's go.

1166
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:29,843
Where?

1167
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:35,903
Director.

1168
00:53:35,904 --> 00:53:37,213
Where are we going?

1169
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:44,372
Wow.

1170
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:45,772
Director.

1171
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:47,743
How did you think of this place?

1172
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:49,142
You said you were hot.

1173
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,982
It's not hot here.

1174
00:53:50,983 --> 00:53:51,983
Let's go in.

1175
00:53:54,433 --> 00:53:55,473
I'm really good, right?

1176
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:56,833
So good.

1177
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,353
How do you skate so well?

1178
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:00,992
- Director.
- Huh?

1179
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:02,762
What are you bad at?

1180
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:04,943
That's right. I should be a
professional or something.

1181
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:07,962
What about hockey?

1182
00:54:07,963 --> 00:54:09,083
- Hockey?
- Right.

1183
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:12,502
Hockey players are so cool.

1184
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,372
Cool? I don't like it.

1185
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:17,053
Okay, then speed-skating?

1186
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:19,112
What about figure skating?

1187
00:54:19,113 --> 00:54:19,673
Figure?

1188
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,673
Figure.

1189
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:25,062
I'll teach you. Come on.

1190
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:27,512
Isn't it too hard?

1191
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,113
Rhythm is important here. One...

1192
00:54:29,283 --> 00:54:30,053
One...

1193
00:54:30,054 --> 00:54:31,302
Two...

1194
00:54:31,303 --> 00:54:32,503
One...

1195
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,023
Two...

1196
00:54:34,043 --> 00:54:34,843
Gosh...

1197
00:54:34,843 --> 00:54:35,753
It's not that hard.

1198
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:36,323
Oh, my.

1199
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:37,342
Take my hand.

1200
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:38,392
One...

1201
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:39,393
Two...

1202
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:40,563
One...

1203
00:54:40,563 --> 00:54:41,563
Two...

1204
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:33,342
It's so cold.

1205
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,912
I'm so cold.

1206
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:36,782
So cold, so cold.

1207
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:37,783
Drink this.

1208
00:55:42,123 --> 00:55:43,822
Where did you get this?

1209
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:44,823
This?

1210
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:47,392
It was lying on the corner.

1211
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:49,232
Someone must have thrown it away.
It's warm.

1212
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:51,392
I brought it since it didn't stink.

1213
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:54,153
You are a little...

1214
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:57,183
...good at handling things.

1215
00:55:58,473 --> 00:56:01,253
Jung Soo Young, you are a little...

1216
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:03,643
...tiring.

1217
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:06,382
I need to take care of everything
for you. A little tiring.

1218
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:08,063
Full of protective instincts.

1219
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:10,803
So charming...

1220
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:12,063
Full of chores for me.

1221
00:56:14,683 --> 00:56:16,322
Anyways...

1222
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:18,743
From what I see...

1223
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:20,922
you can skate quite well.

1224
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:21,623
Huh?

1225
00:56:21,624 --> 00:56:22,822
I mean...

1226
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:25,792
Wait. Secretary Jung that I know of is...

1227
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:30,132
a person without a trace
of any athletic abilities.

1228
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,223
You must have played on the ice.

1229
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:34,872
In fact...

1230
00:56:34,873 --> 00:56:37,393
my father taught me a
little when I was a kid.

1231
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:40,582
You know, around the place
where I used to live...

1232
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:43,812
there was a frozen pond every winter.

1233
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:45,183
So...

1234
00:56:47,553 --> 00:56:48,553
But...

1235
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,622
when did your father...

1236
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:53,723
...pass away?

1237
00:56:55,093 --> 00:56:57,743
He died of a traffic accident
when I was in high school.

1238
00:56:59,493 --> 00:57:00,833
It must've been so hard for you.

1239
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,632
Then...

1240
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:07,383
you've been living with your sister
ever since? How long has it been?

1241
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:12,342
We came to Seoul together
when I was twenty.

1242
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:14,023
It's been about eight years now.

1243
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:17,612
Now that I think about it...

1244
00:57:17,613 --> 00:57:21,012
you said you have a hyungnim. Right?

1245
00:57:21,013 --> 00:57:22,013
Yeah.

1246
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:23,933
I have one jerk hyung.

1247
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:27,703
How is he? Is he like you?

1248
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:31,622
Well, some say we are alike...

1249
00:57:31,623 --> 00:57:33,932
I think we are similar, too.

1250
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:37,932
But then we have completely different
personalities. Completely different.

1251
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:41,272
Your hyungnim must have such
a nice personality then.

1252
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:42,273
Huh?

1253
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:44,543
Just kidding.

1254
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:48,623
I really want to meet him
someday. I'm curious.

1255
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:51,063
Right, I want to see him, too.

1256
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:53,763
You want to see him?

1257
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:56,852
Your hyungnim?

1258
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,082
I mean, I want to show him.

1259
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:58,723
Oh...

1260
00:57:58,723 --> 00:57:59,383
Right. Show him...

1261
00:57:59,383 --> 00:57:59,723
Gosh.

1262
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:01,603
I always mishear.

1263
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:05,213
You, Jung Soo Young... Really...

1264
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:07,562
Your ears must be full of wax.

1265
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:08,582
Gosh.

1266
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,963
Director.

1267
00:58:15,973 --> 00:58:17,302
Jeez.

1268
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:18,593
By the way...

1269
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:21,542
I really...

1270
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,423
don't know anything about my girlfriend.

1271
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:25,454
How were you when you were little?

1272
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:27,803
Were you unique like this?

1273
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:29,613
No, I wasn't.

1274
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:31,883
Nothing unique about me.

1275
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:34,922
Then were you cute and pretty like this?

1276
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:36,603
You got that right.

1277
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,522
You know that kind of kid...

1278
00:58:40,523 --> 00:58:43,992
who doesn't make any
trouble or stands out...

1279
00:58:43,993 --> 00:58:46,413
but then doesn't study at all...

1280
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:47,953
That's me.

1281
00:58:50,103 --> 00:58:53,593
I used to daydream during
classes and imagine things.

1282
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:55,483
I know those type of kids.

1283
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:58,982
What were you like as a student, Director?

1284
00:58:58,983 --> 00:58:59,993
- Me?
- Yes.

1285
00:59:03,813 --> 00:59:05,063
I think you were cute.

1286
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:27,223
Gosh. So scared.

1287
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:29,223
Director.

1288
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:31,173
Oh, my.

1289
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:34,582
Oh, my. You might catch a cold.

1290
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:36,412
We should...

1291
00:59:36,413 --> 00:59:38,712
go for something hot so that
we won't catch a cold. Hello.

1292
00:59:38,713 --> 00:59:40,422
Something hot, okay?

1293
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:41,682
Oh, no.

1294
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:44,192
I need to go home right now.
My sister will be so mad at me.

1295
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:48,963
Why hurry? Going now or going in thirty minutes
won't make any difference. Let's just go.

1296
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:52,743
You are here on Sunday.

1297
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,383
I have some business to take care of.

1298
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:04,462
I can't.

1299
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:05,542
I really need to go.

1300
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:07,833
My sister is waiting for
me to come home, so...

1301
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:14,432
Look what happened.

1302
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:17,023
You won't catch a cold if you eat this.

1303
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,153
You really mind your sister a lot.

1304
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:23,843
Is your sister hot-tempered or something?

1305
01:00:25,363 --> 01:00:26,492
No, not that.

1306
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:29,562
Even though she is a
little younger than me,

1307
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:31,453
she is more like unni than me.

1308
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:35,103
Thank you.

1309
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:36,103
Oh, it looks so good.

1310
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:37,623
I can smell it.

1311
01:00:42,283 --> 01:00:43,364
I don't need salted shrimp.

1312
01:00:47,053 --> 01:00:48,302
You don't eat salted shrimp?

1313
01:00:48,303 --> 01:00:49,273
You, too?

1314
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:50,273
Yeah.

1315
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:55,103
I can't. I must be allergic
to it or something...

1316
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:56,693
It gets itchy all over, right?

1317
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:58,612
Yeah, it's really itchy.

1318
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,732
Your lips get swollen.

1319
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:00,713
Yeah, swollen.

1320
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:02,492
We are the same. Speechless.

1321
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,832
Speechless.

1322
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,032
I'm not kidding. It's so serious.

1323
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:07,033
High-five!

1324
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:09,383
We are the same, the same.

1325
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,393
Strategy analysis...

1326
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:47,323
What is it?

1327
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:52,733
Is he into hockey or something?

1328
01:01:58,253 --> 01:01:59,333
I'll take some of yours.

1329
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,093
No, you can't.

1330
01:02:11,363 --> 01:02:12,983
How can he not have anything here?

1331
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,003
Did he delete all his data already?

1332
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:31,483
Hyung...

1333
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:38,152
Oh, my. If you get this serious,
then I'll seriously take yours.

1334
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:39,192
Come on.

1335
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,073
From Lee Hyung Suk
- Am I too late? It's hyung.

1336
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,913
I just will.

1337
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:23,323
What?

1338
01:03:23,493 --> 01:03:24,723
What?

1339
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:28,142
You can go back to the office, Soo Young.

1340
01:03:28,143 --> 01:03:30,763
A secretary doesn't need

01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:34,392
Do you know how cheesy it is the way
you behave toward Secretary Jung?

1342
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,482
She may be a special woman to you, but...

1343
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,683
she's just a secretary to me.

1344
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,313
I love someone.

1345
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:42,563
Don't bother me.

1346
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:43,563
Take this.

1347
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:45,973
Why do you keep appearing before me?

1348
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:49,193
Don't go. Stay with me.
