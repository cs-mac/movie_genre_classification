15
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,332
- Did you arrive early, Auntie?
- No, I just arrived

16
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,417
- What's your father doing?
- Working

17
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,961
He didn't meet
his deadline yesterday

18
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,263
Moths have just ruined
your uncle's striped trousers

19
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,644
- Could you mend them for Katsuyoshi?
- Wouldn't he look odd in such trousers?

20
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,773
It doesn't matter.
You could just snip the legs off

21
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,277
- I can probably mend them
- Have a go

22
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,658
- Here
- You brought them with you?

23
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,245
Don't spend too long on them.
They won't last long anyway

24
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,455
But reinforce the seat

25
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,684
Good to see you

26
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,147
I was expecting to see you
at Shimbashi Station so I waited

27
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,025
I missed my train

28
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,619
Thank you for waiting.
We will now proceed

29
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,992
Pass me a pencil rubber

30
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,501
Can't you find it?

31
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,588
Found it

32
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,259
"Friedrich List..."
It's spelt without a 'z'

33
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,844
"L-I-S-T"

34
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:14,766
I thought so.
Liszt with a 'z' was the musician

35
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,062
1811 to 1886...

36
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,899
I'm from the electricity company.
I'm here to check your meter

37
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,526
Please come in

38
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,654
May I borrow a stool to stand on?

39
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,282
- Yes...
- Where is it?

40
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,659
In the corridor, under the stairs

41
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,661
- Thanks
- Not at all'

42
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,335
Thanks

43
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,474
Professor, was List really
a self-made man?

44
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,229
Yes, and he became
an excellent economist

45
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,150
He detested bureaucracy...

46
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,361
- It's 3 kilowatts over!
- Thanks

47
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,411
How many pages do we have so far?

48
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,663
- 12 or 13 pages
- I see

49
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,084
That means 6 or 7 more to go

50
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:49,653
I'm home

51
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,113
- Hello, Mr. Hattori
- Hello

52
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,782
Making copies?

53
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,284
Thank you.
That saves me the trouble

54
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,746
- How was your aunt?
- She went straight home

55
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,957
- Make us some tea, will you?
- Yes

56
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:08,338
- Can you stay this evening, Mr. Hattori?
- No, I have to rush off

57
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,008
Why? I can go to Tokyo
with you tomorrow

58
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,344
Tokyo? What for?

59
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,137
To the hospital

60
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,890
And I need to buy you a shirt collar

61
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,943
By the way, Professor...

62
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:35,198
...that last mah-jong game we had,
we did over-calculate

63
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,783
Did we?

64
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:42,330
- You mean 8 and 16?
- So I won after all

65
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,335
Say, Noriko!

66
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,505
Noriko!

67
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,011
- Is Sei at home?
- Why?

68
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,597
Go and ask. We'll have a game

69
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,642
- Have you finished?
- Well, almost

70
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,604
No game till then

71
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,818
What about our tea?

72
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,922
- Did you bring the manuscript?
- Yes, it's fine

73
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,127
Do you want to sit down?

74
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,254
No, I'm fine

75
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,776
Will you be home at the usual time?

76
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,321
Yes, unless there's a faculty meeting

77
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,366
Take care

78
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,255
Uncle!

79
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,258
- Have you just got here?
- No, yesterday morning

80
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,010
- You've put on weight, Nori?
- Have I?

81
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,932
- Where are you off to?
- Shopping

82
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,101
- May I join you?
- But aren't you busy?

83
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,895
- No, I've finished
- Really?

84
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,607
Oh, an art exhibition is on.
Shall we go?

85
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,444
- I need sewing machine needles
- Very well, let's go

86
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,495
Art Group Exhibition in Ueno
Sponsored by The Mainichi Newspaper

87
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,255
Takigawa Restaurant

88
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,970
You must be tired, Nori

89
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,015
I really enjoyed it.
I haven't been to Ueno for ages

90
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,311
But you know, things have changed

91
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,440
Did you see the boy aiming
at the pigeon on the statue?

92
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,443
Just like William Hart!

93
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,237
Here you go

94
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,240
Professor Shigeno was here yesterday

95
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,451
Oh? Is he still in town?

96
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,496
- He said he was leaving today
- I see...

97
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,585
By the way, this is Somiya's daughter

98
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,671
Really? And so grown up!

99
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,759
- That little girl with the fringe?
- The very same

100
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,597
Fancy that.
Your father comes here often

101
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,933
Welcome!

102
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,774
Do you want sake?

103
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,569
Nori, do you want some?

104
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,530
- No, I don't drink
- Do you want something else?

105
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,117
- Or do you want something to eat?
- I'm fine for now

106
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,162
- Let me pour you a drink
- All right

107
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,333
- Shall we order something?
- Be right with you!

108
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,217
You know, Uncle...

109
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,054
I heard that...

110
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,639
What is it?

111
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,727
- ...that you got remarried
- Yes, I have

112
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,647
- I feel sorry for  Isako
- Why?

113
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,775
Well...it's a bit strange, isn't it?

114
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,862
It doesn't seem so.
They're getting on quite well

115
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,531
I wonder.

116
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,869
- I'd find it distasteful
- What, my new wife?

117
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,666
- No, you, Uncle
- Why?

118
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,420
It seems...impure

119
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,755
- Impure?
- It's dirty

120
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,427
Dirty? Now I'm really in trouble

121
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,470
I'm dirty, uh?

122
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,893
- Any better?
- Not at all

123
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:05,940
No good, eh? What am I going to do?

124
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,567
Here you go

125
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,779
- So I'm impure, am I?
- Yes, you are

126
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,073
I'm in serious trouble, then!

127
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,315
I'm home

128
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,947
- I'm back. And we have a guest
- Who?

129
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,164
I wasn't planning on coming round
but I ran into Nori in Ginza

130
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,832
What was it this time?

131
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,085
I was at the Ministry
of Education again

132
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,505
A present for you, Father

133
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,885
Oh... Where did you find these?

134
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,475
No wonder we couldn't find them
in the house

135
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,146
- Here
- Oh, the Takigawa! Did you go there?

136
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,650
I made her keep me company

137
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,653
- Would you like more sake, Uncle?
- Sounds good

138
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,697
- Do we have any?
- I'll have it hot

139
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,700
- How was your blood test?
- It went down to 15

140
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,786
That's good

141
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,498
She looks well

142
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,544
It was all because of forced labour
during the war, wasn't it?

143
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:55,049
And she had to run around
to get food on her day off

144
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,302
What an awful time.
No wonder she suffered

145
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,891
- We don't have anything special
- Thank you, Nori

146
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,193
All your family's well in Kyoto?

147
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,780
- Yes, but it seems I've sinned
- What do you mean?

148
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,491
Nori said I was impure

149
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,326
- Who was?
- Me

150
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,954
She said I'm dirty. s that right, Nori?

151
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,747
I don't know!

152
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,919
s   Isako well?

153
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:37,550
She's going around saying that
marriage is life's graveyard

154
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,303
She's 25 but refusing to get married

155
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,599
Come to think of it, she might be right

156
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,644
Nothing I can do about it, though.
How about Nori?

157
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,065
I suppose it's time for her
to start thinking about it

158
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,069
She's 27, right?

159
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,952
- It's only lukewarm
- Oh, I'll...

160
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,580
- Make the next one hotter
- I will

161
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,963
- s the ocean near here?
- About a 15-minute walk

162
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,757
That far?

163
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,469
- s it that way?
- No, this way

164
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,807
- s the shrine over this way?
- No, that way

165
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,561
- Which way is Tokyo?
- Tokyo's that way

166
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,649
- So that means east is that way
- No, east is that way

167
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,653
- Oh? Has it always been that way?
- Of course it has!

168
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,282
No wonder ancient warlords
liked this area

169
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,284
It's a real labyrinth!

170
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,013
Are you all right? You're not tired?

171
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,682
I'm fine

172
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,989
So which type do you think I am?

173
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,660
Well, you're not the jealous type

174
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,540
- On the contrary, I am
- I wonder

175
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,878
Whenever I slice pickles, they stick
together. That means I'm jealous

176
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,675
That's just the way you use the knife
and the chopping board

177
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,512
There's no connection
between pickles and jealousy

178
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,683
So you prefer pickles stuck together?

179
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,479
I don't mind if my pickles
are stuck together

180
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,022
Really?

181
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,878
Young people today are
so different from our day

182
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,131
Take the bride last night.
She's from a nice family...

183
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,551
...but she ate everything on her plate
and even drank sake!

184
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,599
Eating sashimi with lips
covered in lipstick! I was so shocked

185
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,060
Don't blame her. We haven't been
able to get it for a long time

186
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:46,066
But at my wedding,
I was too nervous to touch any food

187
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,527
But you'd eat it now, though

188
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,323
Never! Anyway, it's difficult to say

189
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,743
- You'd eat it!
- I wonder

190
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,704
- You would
- You think so?

191
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,539
But not sashimi

192
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,625
- Yes, you would
- Would I?

193
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,168
You would

194
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,257
I don't like weeping brides...

195
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,761
...but behaving like that
just shows the parents up

196
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,138
Can't be helped nowadays

197
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,932
How about Nori?

198
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,684
She wouldn't weep

199
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,771
No, I'm talking about
her getting married

200
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,859
- She's recovered, hasn't she?
- Yes, she has

201
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,612
She should've been married
a long time ago

202
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,407
- What about that fellow?
- Who?

203
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,786
- That assistant of yours
- Oh, Hattori?

204
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,746
Well, how about him?

205
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,959
He's nice, but I don't know
what Noriko thinks

206
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,755
They get along,
but there's nothing between them

207
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,968
But you can't tell
how she feels inside

208
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,428
- Can't I?
- No, you can't

209
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,390
- They're the young generation
- So?

210
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,225
- Why don't you ask?
- Who?

211
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,977
- Nori, of course
- Ask what?

212
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:08,399
- Ask her how she feels about him
- I see. Perhaps I should try

213
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,318
Yes, or we'll never know

214
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,322
One can never tell

215
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,048
I'm home!

216
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,385
Welcome home. You're early

217
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,733
- Was the train busy?
- No, I got a seat

218
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,529
Your aunt gave us some pickles.
They're in the bag

219
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,783
This says the PEN club meeting
is on the 28th

220
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,495
- At the country club this time
- It's this Saturday

221
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,875
Mr. Hattori was here

222
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,295
- When?
- Around noon

223
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,757
Do you want dinner now?

224
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,345
We went out cycling together

225
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,016
- You and Hattori?
- It was really nice by the beach

226
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,041
- What did Hattori want?
- Nothing in particular

227
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,970
Noriko! A towel!

228
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,474
Here

229
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,313
- You rode together on his bike?
- Of course not! I borrowed a bicycle

230
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,338
- We're running out of soap
- Really?

231
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,972
- My sash
- Here

232
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,772
The beach must've been nice today

233
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,775
- Yes, we went as far as Chigasaki
- Really?

234
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,020
I've added something to your rice

235
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,867
What do you think of Hattori?

236
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,081
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Hattori...

237
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,250
He's quite nice

238
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,922
Would he make a good husband?

239
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,758
I'm sure he would

240
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,510
Would he?

241
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,055
- He's very gentle
- Yes, you're right

242
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,311
I like his type

243
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,943
Your aunt was wondering...

244
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,071
About what?

245
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,282
About you and Hattori...

246
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,621
- What is it?
- Tea! Some tea, please!

247
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,670
What's so funny?

248
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,216
He's already been engaged
for some time

249
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,803
A very pretty girl

250
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,306
- Three years below me at school
- Really?

251
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:37,644
He'll tell you all about it soon.
I know the girl very well

252
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,146
s that so?

253
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,650
I was wondering
what to get for a wedding gift

254
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,277
I see...

255
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,156
So Hattori is getting married?

256
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,450
What would be a nice gift?

257
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,914
- So he's already engaged...
- Yes

258
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,608
Tell me. What would you like?

259
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,361
- Well...
- What kind of gift?

260
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,198
As it's from the professor,
I'd like something to keep

261
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,494
Anything from 2,000 to 3,000 yen

262
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,372
- I wonder...
- Any good ideas?

263
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,082
I'll think about it

264
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,584
- With your fiancée?
- I will do

265
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,215
Noriko, Mari Iwamoto's playing
in concert. Want to come?

266
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,093
- When?
- Tonight. I've got tickets

267
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,886
How nice!

268
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,392
Did you buy it for me?

269
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,310
- Yes, I did
- Really?

270
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,854
- Of course
- I wonder...

271
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,441
But I can't

272
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,569
- I don't want to cause trouble
- It'll be fine. Let's go

273
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,114
- No...
- She wouldn't mind

274
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,865
I'd rather not

275
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,414
Are the pickles all stuck together?

276
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,458
Yes, and my knife isn't very sharp

277
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,450
Mari Iwamoto - Solo Violin in Concert
Tokyo Theatre

278
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,360
Good evening!

279
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,737
- Who is it?
- Uncle?

280
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,240
- Is that you, Aya?
- Yes

281
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,335
- Good evening
- Come in

282
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,338
- Is Nori in?
- She'll be home soon. Come in

283
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,977
Please sit down

284
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,989
I was just on my way
back from Hayama

285
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,574
I see

286
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,827
I've been hearing good things
about you

287
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,372
- About what?
- That you're very busy

288
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,040
Not that busy

289
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,085
There's a great demand
now for typists

290
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,839
Don't call me a typist.
I'm a stenographer

291
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,632
I beg your pardon

292
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,388
- And you can do English shorthand?
- Yes, I can

293
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,557
- That's great
- Not really

294
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,100
It's great

295
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,939
- So you're not short of money
- Well, I do all right

296
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,524
I see

297
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:42,115
- Did your parents say anything?
- About what?

298
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:47,621
- About you remarrying
- No, not recently, thank goodness

299
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,625
- Once was enough?
- Do you mean, marriage?

300
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,669
I wouldn't say that

301
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,881
- What was his name?
- Who?

302
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,883
- Your ex
- Ah, Ken

303
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,010
Kenkichi, wasn't it?

304
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,471
- Have you seen him since?
- Not once

305
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,599
- What would you do if you did?
- I'd glare at him

306
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:13,021
- You hate him that much?
- I'd run away. I really detest him

307
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,024
Really?

308
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,450
- I'm back!
- Welcome back

309
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,329
- What is it?
- My legs have gone numb

310
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,707
You're here, Aya!

311
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,668
- Evening
- Welcome back

312
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,836
- We've just been chatting
- Are you staying?

313
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,630
- Yes
- Let's go upstairs

314
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,883
- What about dinner?
- I already had some. Have you?

315
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,302
- Yes, I've eaten
- Let's go

316
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,364
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Were there many people?

317
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,866
About 15 people,
including Miss Camellia

318
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,370
And Professor Murase?
Was he frothing at the mouth as usual?

319
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,958
Yes, he spat all over the place.
Even in our tea!

320
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:19,087
No one near him touched their tea.
I was fine, I was sitting far away

321
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,214
- Did she come?
- Who?

322
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,384
- She married after school
- Miss Ikegami?

323
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,429
She was there,
but she was being a bit sly

324
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:32,434
When Camellia asked her how many
children she had, she said three

325
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,770
But she actually has four.
She's hiding one!

326
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,482
- Four, already?
- Yes, that's right

327
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,444
- And you remember 'Pollack'?
- Ah, Miss Shinoda

328
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,488
She's leaving her broadcasting job
to get married

329
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,950
- To whom?
- A notable family in Mikawashima

330
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:53,204
- Really?
- Well, that's my guess

331
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,003
- Oh, thanks
- Some bread and tea

332
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,757
- Thank you, Uncle
- Will this do?

333
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,426
- Oh, there's no sugar
- No?

334
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,638
- It's fine, Father, I'll get it
- All right, I'm off to bed, then

335
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,808
- Night, Aya
- Goodnight

336
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,982
- Do you want some bread?
- Later

337
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,653
- He forgot the spoons, as well
- I know

338
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,156
Was she there? Miss Watanabe?

339
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,992
Kuro? No, she wasn't

340
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:35,163
She's pregnant now.
A big one. Seven months

341
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,752
- When did she get married?
- She hasn't yet

342
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,636
How awful!

343
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,223
These things happen.
Divine providence, you know

344
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,977
That leaves only you and
Miss Hirokawa unmarried

345
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,231
- Really?
- When will you get married?

346
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,193
- I won't
- Hurry and get married

347
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,862
- No way
- Go on!

348
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,282
Look who's talking.
You don't have the right to say that

349
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,035
I do. And with authority!

350
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,788
No, you don't. You're a divorcee

351
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,833
I do! It was my first innings!

352
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,211
I'll get it right next time

353
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,465
So you're still playing the game?

354
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,885
Of course! I chose the wrong ball
in the first round

355
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,887
I'll hit the right one next time

356
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,682
So, come on and get married

357
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,852
What's so funny? I'm being serious

358
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,146
Don't you want to eat some bread?

359
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,232
- Later!
- I'm starving

360
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:49,112
- I'm fine
- I'll eat by myself, then

361
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,159
- Actually, I will have some
- I'll go and prepare some

362
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,619
- Do you have any jam?
- Yes

363
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,246
Just a little bit

364
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,957
- But you mean a lot really
- Yes!

365
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,362
Bu-chan?

366
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:17,909
Why aren't you playing baseball?
Have you had a fight?

367
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,376
Bu-chan! Why are you so angry?

368
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,589
It's not dry yet, the enamel

369
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,010
- What enamel?
- On my bat

370
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,846
- Oh, did you paint it red?
- Yes, I did

371
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,852
So you splashed the paint everywhere.
Your mother will be so cross

372
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,731
- She already is cross
- And you cried?

373
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:52,443
I did not! Go away, Noriko!

374
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,196
Big talk coming from a crybaby

375
00:42:56,156 --> 00:43:00,201
What? I'll get you with this!
Go away, Nori!

376
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,869
Shut up, Bu!

377
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,956
- Noriko!
- Has your guest gone?

378
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,500
She's leaving. Please come down

379
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,505
You're not allowed out today!

380
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,565
This is Somiya's daughter, Noriko.
This is Mrs. Miwa

381
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,113
I'm Miwa.
I often see you in Kita-kamakura

382
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,200
- Forgive me for staying so long
- Not at all

383
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,079
- Goodbye
- Thank you for coming

384
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,550
Noriko, come with me

385
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,891
Sit down there

386
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,563
What is it, Auntie?

387
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,440
Well...

388
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,819
Isn't it time you got married?

389
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,739
Oh, that? Please, Auntie, it's fine

390
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,451
It's not fine. Now sit down

391
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,960
I've found a nice fellow.
Won't you at least meet him?

392
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,049
Mr. Satake's a science graduate
from Tokyo University...

393
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,885
...and from an old family
in Matsuyama

394
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,638
He works for Nitto Chemicals

395
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,974
His father used to be
the director there before the war

396
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,312
He's 34. Just right for you

397
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,400
And his office speaks very highly
of him. What do you think?

398
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,321
Hey, who was that American actor...

399
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,324
...in that baseball film recently?

400
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,411
- Gary Cooper?
- Cooper, that's him

401
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,956
He looks just like him
Especially around his mouth

402
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,999
But not the top half

403
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,547
Listen, how about it?
Won't you meet him?

404
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,882
He's a fine man, really

405
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,551
Won't you?

406
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,138
I don't want to get married yet

407
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,682
Not yet? Why ever not?

408
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,979
Well, there'll be problems
if I get married

409
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,605
Like what?

410
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,941
My father

411
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,194
It's fine, I'm used to it...

412
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,906
...but he can be very difficult

413
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,535
If I leave him, he'll be in trouble

414
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,582
But you can't help that

415
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,337
But I'm the one
who understands him the best

416
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,966
Leave your father out of this.
What about yourself?

417
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:10,433
- I don't want to do it like that
- Then you can never get married

418
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,353
That's fine with me

419
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:27,742
Listen, Nori...you know
that Mrs. Miwa you just met?

420
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,411
Think she'd suit your father?

421
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,372
What do you mean?

422
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,375
Your father will need someone
if you’re no longer there

423
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,047
I was wondering
if she would suit him

424
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,424
Come here and sit with me

425
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,516
She had a good husband...

426
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,853
...but he died, leaving the poor woman
with no children.

427
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:01,442
What do you think of her?
She's a sound woman with good taste

428
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:07,073
- Does father know about this?
- I did mention it to him recently

429
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,118
What did he say?

430
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,289
He was polishing his pipe,
but he didn't object to the idea

431
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,961
Then why do you need my opinion?

432
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,881
But I need to know
how you feel about it

433
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,134
It's up to him, isn't it?

434
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,697
Welcome home.
How was it at your aunt's?

435
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,743
Nothing special

436
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,079
The bath's ready.
The temperature's just right

437
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,395
Hey...

438
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,900
- What?
- What happened at your aunt's?

439
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,403
What is it?

440
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,031
Is anything wrong?

441
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,218
Where are you going? Hey!

442
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,429
Shopping

443
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,314
Excuse me?

444
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:35,114
- Hello
- Oh, hello. No one's home today

445
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,954
- They went out this morning
- Oh, I see

446
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:47,126
They told me they were going
to see a Noh play

447
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:52,631
Then would you give them this
when they get back?

448
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,343
- Yes, of course I will
- Tell them I came to thank them

449
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,514
Certainly. Sorry for your trouble

450
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,308
Goodbye, sir

451
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,265
I'll go and chop some wood

452
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,018
Hey, come and look at this

453
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,315
That's Mr. Hattori, isn't it?

454
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:56,320
- I thought he was marrying Noriko
- Me, too

455
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:00,491
sn’t it an amazing photo?
It looks just like him

456
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,327
And the bride looks so beautiful

457
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,677
Today's Noh was really quite good

458
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,140
Shall we go to the Takigawa to eat?

459
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,353
What shall we do?

460
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,859
I have to go somewhere

461
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,654
- Where?
- It's nothing

462
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,157
- Will you be home late?
- I don't know

463
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,586
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Noriko

464
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,714
I've been busy baking shortcake

465
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,926
I put in too much vanilla,
but they're delicious

466
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,345
Let's go to the other room

467
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,641
Goodness, your hands are cold

468
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:32,312
Fumi, bring the cakes
to that room, will you?

469
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,168
What gave you that idea?

470
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,923
Tell me, why?

471
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,095
No special reason

472
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,235
Will you try some?

473
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,696
- Is it very difficult?
- What?

474
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,825
- Becoming a stenographer
- No, it's not that difficult

475
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,035
I can manage, after all

476
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:32,622
Come on, try some. It's delicious

477
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,878
But why are you doing it now?

478
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,465
What are you trying to do?

479
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,592
I told you, no particular reason

480
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,470
You can't work for no reason

481
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,891
I wouldn't be doing it,
if Ken had been a decent man

482
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,355
I only started work
because I got divorced

483
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,276
- Someone like you should get married
- Save your advice

484
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:05,280
- I'll advise you anyway
- I don't want such advice

485
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,616
Just get married for no reason!

486
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,872
- Aren't you going to eat it?
- I don't want it

487
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,041
- Have some!
- I don't want to

488
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,502
- It's delicious
- I've had enough

489
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,297
Just a little piece.
I made it. Try some!

490
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:26,593
- I don't want to
- Eat it. I'll make you

491
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,097
- I don't want it!
- No need for hysterics. Fine, then!

492
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,018
This is why you should marry

493
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,191
- Where are you going?
- Home

494
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,527
Home? Are you really leaving?

495
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:47,447
I thought you'd stay over!
Stay overnight!

496
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,479
I'm home

497
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,068
Where have you been?

498
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,237
At Aya's

499
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,704
I got a letter from your aunt

500
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:41,126
She wants you to visit her on Saturday.
The day after tomorrow

501
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,497
She's mentioned it to you, then,
hasn't she?

502
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:27,339
Go and meet him.
He'll be there as well

503
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,510
- Can't I refuse?
- Just go and meet him once

504
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,140
If you don't like him,
you can turn him down

505
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,104
Noriko!

506
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,441
Come here

507
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,739
Sit down

508
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:04,668
Your aunt must've told you already,
but his name is Satake

509
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:10,215
I've met him,
and he seemed like a nice fellow

510
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:16,346
I'm quite sure you'll like him

511
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,556
Just go and see for yourself

512
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,772
You can't remain like this forever...

513
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,483
...you have to get married some time

514
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,237
I think it's the perfect time

515
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,617
What do you think?
Your aunt's been concerned about you

516
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,288
- You know?
- But I...

517
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,378
I just want to be with you

518
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,589
That's impossible

519
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,719
It would be most convenient
for me if you stayed, but...

520
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,513
- Then why not...?
- No, that won't do

521
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,727
I've been using you
for far too long

522
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:08,481
I couldn't let you go,
and I must apologise for that

523
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,281
It'll be a huge worry to me
if you don't get married soon

524
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:20,201
But if I marry,
what are you going to do?

525
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,328
I'll manage

526
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,167
- How?
- I'll get by

527
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,879
- That's not good enough for me
- Why not?

528
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:36,968
Your shirts and collars...
you'd leave them dirty

529
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,471
And you wouldn't shave in the morning

530
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,432
Well, I'll shave in the evening

531
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:48,271
If I wasn't here to clean up,
your desk would be a mess

532
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:54,110
You'd end up eating burnt rice,
like that last time you tried to cook

533
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,198
I can see you'd be in trouble

534
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:05,371
But...what if I were to release you
from these worries?

535
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,669
For instance, if someone else
were to look after me?

536
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,174
- Which someone?
- It's only an idea

537
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:22,764
So, you're going to do
what Uncle Onodera did...

538
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,936
...and take a wife?

539
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,524
Will you remarry?

540
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,903
The woman we saw today?

541
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,572
You've decided?

542
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,199
Honestly?

543
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,618
Really?

544
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:34,627
Stay away, Father.
Go downstairs. Please!

545
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,141
Anyway, go and visit your aunt
on Saturday

546
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,102
We're all so worried about you

547
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,025
You will go, won't you?

548
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,652
Please

549
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,512
It'll be sunny again tomorrow

550
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,972
What did Nori say?

551
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,725
She's not said anything about it

552
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:17,647
Nothing? It's been a week
since I introduced him

553
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:20,483
I have to give his family an answer

554
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,778
I realize that

555
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:30,910
I don't want to push her
and complicate things

556
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,580
His family has approved of her

557
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,334
Noriko shouldn't find
anything bad about him

558
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:44,007
Nori likes him.
I think she really likes him

559
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:03,776
Why did Nori go to Tokyo today?

560
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,487
You're too easy-going on her, Brother

561
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,990
I must have her answer today

562
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:14,162
- When is she back tonight?
- I don't know

563
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,839
Look, I found a purse

564
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:30,136
It's a good omen!
The wedding will go ahead

565
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,305
Shouldn't you turn it in?

566
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:36,142
I will, but it's such a good omen.
Let's go

567
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,635
So what was he like?

568
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,845
What type was he?

569
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,847
- Was he fat?
- No

570
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,766
- Skinny, then?
- No

571
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,601
Then which was he?

572
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,562
He used to play basketball
when he was a student

573
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:26,275
Is he good looking? What's he like?

574
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:29,570
My aunt thinks
he looks like Gary Cooper

575
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:33,366
Amazing!
You always liked Gary Cooper

576
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,828
But I think he looks more
like our local electrician

577
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,996
Does he look like Gary Cooper?

578
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,707
Yes, very much so

579
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:45,670
What? Then they both
look like Gary Cooper?

580
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,215
I'll give you a slap!

581
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:56,055
But well done to you
for going to the introduction

582
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,684
It sounds good

583
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,812
Don't think too much about it,
just get married!

584
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:10,319
There aren't many good men around.
Grab him while you can

585
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,905
- I can't bear it...
- What?

586
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,908
- Arranged marriages
- Don't ask for too much

587
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:19,620
You'll never get married
unless it's arranged

588
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,747
- But...
- But what?

589
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:27,128
If you liked someone,
could you go up and propose to him?

590
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:31,883
You don't have the courage.
You'd just squirm and blush

591
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,845
- That's true
- An arranged marriage suits you fine

592
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:37,513
I proposed, though...

593
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:42,101
...and look what happened to me.
It didn't work out.

594
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,189
Men are sly and can't be trusted

595
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,901
They show only their good side
before marriage...

596
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,196
...but once they're married,
their bad side comes out

597
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,699
Love doesn't always mean
a happy marriage

598
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,952
- I wonder...
- It's true, it's the same

599
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,748
If you don't like marriage,
you can always leave him

600
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:06,334
Of course you can, don't worry

601
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,004
All you need to do is smile at him

602
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:13,758
He'll fall for you,
then you take control

603
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,553
- Surely not
- Yes, that's how it works

604
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,306
- Do you think I'm joking?
- I wonder!

605
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,808
Yes, that's the smile!

606
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,977
Try that. I guarantee it'll work

607
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,022
Nori's late

608
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,318
Shall I come another time?

609
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:35,988
Wait a little longer.
She should be on the next train

610
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,032
Really?

611
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:40,576
I hope she approves

612
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:46,999
- She will. I know she likes him
- You think so?

613
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:52,004
She's shy. She's old-fashioned
for her generation

614
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,131
You think so?

615
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,639
Think she might be bothered
by something trivial?

616
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:04,934
- Like what?
- Mr. Satake's first name

617
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:09,355
- Kumataro Satake?
- "Bear Boy"

618
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,608
It's a fine name. Sounds strong

619
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:20,283
You're much more old-fashioned.
She wouldn't mind such a thing

620
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:25,496
Doesn't it make you think
he might have a thick, hairy chest?

621
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,166
These things do bother young girls

622
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,670
If she marries him,
what should I call him?

623
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,965
"Kumataro-san" sounds so crude...

624
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:40,886
..."Kuma-san" is too common,
but "Kuma-chan" is even worse!

625
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,433
But we've got to call him something

626
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:49,812
That's my point!
I'm thinking of calling him "Ku-chan"

627
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:53,441
- Ku-chan?
- What do you think?

628
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,904
Oh, she's back!

629
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,999
- I'm home
- She's coming

630
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,085
Well, that was definitely when...

631
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,837
- I'm home
- Welcome back

632
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,464
Welcome home

633
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:20,343
- I'll go and ask her how she is
- Hey...

634
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,511
- What?
- Be tactful

635
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,263
Don't worry!

636
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,820
Oh, welcome home, Nori-chan

637
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,364
Hello

638
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:45,785
About that meeting...

639
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,913
...have you thought
any more about it?

640
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,294
What do you think?

641
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,721
I think it's a splendid arrangement,
don't you?

642
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:18,818
Well, say something.
What do you think?

643
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,905
- Yes
- You will?

644
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,326
- Yes
- You will! Really? You will marry?

645
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,914
Thank you. I'll notify them

646
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,751
That's all right, then?

647
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,004
Oh, how wonderful. I'm so relieved!

648
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:54,353
- How did it go?
- She'll marry. Just as I thought

649
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,105
Really? That's good

650
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,400
Listen, I have to run now.
What a relief

651
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:04,363
- I'll tell them immediately
- Yes. Thank you

652
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:08,701
- I can still catch the 9:35
- Yes, but you'd better hurry

653
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:16,041
Now my worries are over.
I'll sleep soundly tonight

654
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,211
I'll come again to discuss
the date and other things

655
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:22,047
- Drop by to see me some time
- I will

656
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,725
- I told you that purse was a good omen!
- You'd better report it

657
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,977
Of course I will

658
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:42,151
- I won't lock it. Goodnight
- Thanks. Take care!

659
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:48,073
- Bye!
- Ah, bye!

660
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,100
- Your aunt just left
- Did she?

661
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,270
She was really happy

662
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:21,273
Are you sure about your answer?

663
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,860
Yes

664
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,905
You're not just giving in, are you?

665
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,409
No

666
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,995
You're not reluctant to go, are you?

667
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:40,501
- No, I'm not
- I see. That's all right, then

668
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,980
- Did you sleep well on the train?
- Yes

669
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:47,526
So did I. When I woke up,
we were already at Seta

670
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:50,195
I completely missed
Nagoya to Mawbara

671
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,201
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I feel refreshed

672
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,037
- Are you tired, Nori-chan?
- No, not really

673
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,580
Really?

674
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,252
I'm glad you came

675
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:54,426
- Noriko's getting married soon
- Really?

676
01:22:55,595 --> 01:23:00,265
- This is our last trip together
- Congratulations! That's wonderful news

677
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,936
Congratulations, Nori-chan

678
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:08,649
Hey, Nori-chan, what's he like
compared to me?

679
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,943
There's no comparison

680
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:16,615
- Who's better?
- Of course, you're much nicer, Uncle

681
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:18,575
Oh, is that true?

682
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,621
Shall I treat you?
How about lunch today?

683
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,915
- Shall we go to Hyotei?
- That'd be nice

684
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:30,295
- Misako wants to meet Nori
- Really? I'd like to meet her, too

685
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,589
But the "Impure One" is coming, too

686
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,301
Is that all right?

687
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,972
Kyoto is very nice. It's so relaxing

688
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:27,686
There's nothing like this in Tokyo.
It's so dusty there

689
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:31,231
Do you come to Kyoto often,
Professor?

690
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:35,360
Not for years. This is my first time
since the war ended

691
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:37,237
I see

692
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:50,584
Uncle!

693
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,970
Nori, how do you feel
about the "Impure One"?

694
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:03,722
You're so mean

695
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,557
Tell me what you think

696
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:07,726
What's this "Impure One", Father?

697
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,687
Hmm? I'm filthy, right, Noriko?

698
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,873
We walked a lot today

699
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,877
- Aren't you tired?
- No

700
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:22,467
Last time I was here, the bush clover
was in magnificent bloom

701
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:27,139
What are you going to do tomorrow?

702
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,391
Misako's coming to see me
around 10:00

703
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:33,312
Where are you going?
You should go to the museum

704
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,699
- Shall we get some sleep?
- Yes

705
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,993
I'll turn the light off

706
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:15,604
I'm afraid I was very rude
to Uncle Onodera

707
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:19,608
What about?

708
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:22,194
His wife is such a nice person

709
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,656
They make a wonderful couple

710
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,910
I shouldn't have called him "impure"

711
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:34,039
Don't let it worry you

712
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:39,920
- It was an awful thing to say
- He didn't take it seriously

713
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,631
- Do you think so?
- It's fine

714
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,509
It's fine

715
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,847
Father...

716
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:57,062
...I was feeling angry
towards you, but...

717
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,432
I'm glad Nori decided to get married

718
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,019
She'll certainly make a good wife

719
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:25,609
Having a son is better.
Daughters are no good

720
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,742
Once you've raised her,
she leaves and gets married

721
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:40,665
If they don't get married,
you only worry...

722
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:44,419
...and when they do get married,
you feel let down

723
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:48,256
Can't be helped.
It was the same when we got married

724
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:49,674
That's true

725
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,725
Father, hand me those

726
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,357
How time flies

727
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,235
We just arrived,
and now we're already leaving

728
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,157
But I've really enjoyed Kyoto

729
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:57,951
I'm glad we came

730
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:01,872
One can't have everything,
but I wish we'd had a day in Nara, too

731
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:07,878
Oh, this...

732
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:13,967
I wish we'd done this
more often together

733
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,846
This will be our last trip together

734
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:23,894
Once we get home, you'll be so busy.
Your aunt will be waiting

735
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:29,566
I hope we get seats on the train

736
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:38,658
I couldn't take you to visit many places,
but your husband will

737
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,286
He'll take good care of you

738
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,290
What is it?

739
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:50,295
What's wrong?

740
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:51,880
I...

741
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,676
I just want to be with you, like this

742
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:05,435
I don't want to go anywhere.
I'm happy being with you like this

743
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,397
I'm happy just as I am

744
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,402
Marriage couldn't make me
any happier

745
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,907
I'm happy the way things are now

746
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:20,825
But, you see...

747
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:24,913
No, no. You can remarry, Father

748
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,708
I just want to be at your side

749
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,128
I love you dearly, Father

750
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:36,258
My greatest happiness
is to be with you

751
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:42,931
Please, Father...

752
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:45,267
Why can't we stay as we are?

753
01:32:46,852 --> 01:32:51,856
I don't believe that marriage
will make me any happier

754
01:32:52,024 --> 01:32:53,775
That's not true

755
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,654
It's nothing like that

756
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:02,617
I'm already 56

757
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:07,038
My life is nearing its end

758
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:14,004
Yours is just beginning.
A new life is just about to start

759
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:18,466
A life which you and Satake
will build together

760
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,722
A life apart from me

761
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:29,394
That's how both life and history
progress

762
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:38,278
Marriage may not bring you
happiness from the start

763
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:45,076
It's wrong to think that marriage
will instantly make you happy

764
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:50,540
Happiness is not
something to expect...

765
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,710
...but something you create

766
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,713
Happiness isn't about getting married

767
01:33:56,839 --> 01:34:03,094
Happiness lies in the couple
creating a new life together

768
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:07,098
It may take a year or two...

769
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:12,604
...or even five or ten years' work
to create that happiness

770
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:16,566
Only then can you claim
to have become a true, married couple

771
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:22,822
Your mother wasn't happy
in the beginning

772
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:27,369
We had our troubles for years

773
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:34,042
So many times I found her weeping
in a corner in the kitchen

774
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:37,128
But your mother put up with me

775
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,549
You must have faith in each other

776
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,178
You must have love for each other

777
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:52,977
Show Satake all the warmth
and affection you've shown me

778
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,980
All right?

779
01:34:57,316 --> 01:35:01,986
Then your new, true happiness
will emerge

780
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:05,990
Understand?

781
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:09,994
You understand, don't you?

782
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:16,751
- Sorry for being so selfish
- You understand, then

783
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:23,967
- It was very selfish of me
- Well, I'm glad you understand

784
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:28,680
I didn't want you to get married
feeling the way you did

785
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,601
Marry him
and I'm sure you'll be happy

786
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:35,603
It's not difficult

787
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:39,315
I'm sure you'll make a great couple

788
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:43,153
I'm looking forward to it

789
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:49,409
Soon we'll laugh about this talk
we're having tonight

790
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,913
I'm sorry...

791
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:59,169
...for worrying you all the time

792
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:04,841
So...just be happy.
All right?

793
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:12,056
- I'm sure I'll be happy
- Of course you will

794
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:17,145
I know you can do it,
I have no worries

795
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:20,565
Be happy

796
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,647
I got worried
when it started raining last night

797
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:03,608
I'm glad it cleared up

798
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:06,319
- Rain would've ruined the day
- Yes

799
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,366
- Where did you go on your honeymoon?
- Yugawara

800
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:16,204
Noriko's going there, too.
Are there buses only from the station?

801
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,958
- No, you can get a cab
- Oh, there are taxis?

802
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,295
- Professor, you're wanted upstairs
- Very well

803
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,132
Your daughter's such a beautiful bride

804
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:32,637
- Go upstairs and have a peek
- Very well...

805
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:38,476
She makes a wonderful bride

806
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,484
- Oh, she's ready now, Brother
- I see

807
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:49,237
- Is the car ready?
- It's arrived

808
01:37:57,329 --> 01:38:00,665
Thank you. Thank you all

809
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,587
All ready, eh?

810
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,728
- We'll go on ahead
- Please do

811
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,939
- I'll take this along
- Thank you

812
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:48,129
Nori-chan, do you have your fan?

813
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,098
You're such a beautiful bride

814
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:03,811
I wish your mother could see you

815
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:11,986
Well, shall we get going?

816
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,739
We don't want to be rushed

817
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:19,160
Do you have anything
to say to Nori?

818
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:22,789
- No, I have nothing more to say
- Really?

819
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:26,334
Nori-chan, let's go, then

820
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,606
Father...

821
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:59,409
These many long years...

822
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:04,497
...thank you for everything

823
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,796
Be happy, and be a good wife

824
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:17,635
Be happy

825
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,811
Remember, be a good wife

826
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,820
Shall we go, then?

827
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,513
Aya-chan, want some?

828
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:50,770
This is my third

829
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,357
I can handle five

830
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:57,777
- Once I drank six and I fell down
- Did you?

831
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:00,613
Here you go

832
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:03,908
Professor Onodera came here
with your daughter recently

833
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:05,618
- That's right
- I was amazed

834
01:42:05,744 --> 01:42:08,621
So grown up.
She's not with you today?

835
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:12,083
We just saw her off at Tokyo Station.
She got married

836
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:14,752
Did she? And you saw her off?

837
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:17,588
- Many congratulations
- Thank you

838
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:19,423
Thank you!

839
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,429
Uncle...

840
01:42:32,938 --> 01:42:37,191
- Where will she be by now?
- I'd say around Ofuna

841
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:40,611
Probably.
You'll be lonely from now on

842
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,948
Not too much

843
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:46,117
I'll get used to it

844
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:48,369
Ready for your fourth?

845
01:42:56,795 --> 01:42:58,254
Listen, Uncle...

846
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:02,842
- Are you really going to remarry?
- Why?

847
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:07,388
It worried Noriko. That's what
seemed to bother her the most

848
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:13,603
Don't do it. Why would you
do it again? You mustn't

849
01:43:14,646 --> 01:43:17,064
All right? I mean it

850
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:22,486
But if I'd said otherwise,
she'd never have got married

851
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:30,995
You're wonderful. Amazing!
I'm so impressed

852
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:36,417
Don't worry, you won't be lonely.
I'll visit you often. Really

853
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:39,420
Please do, Aya-chan

854
01:43:39,504 --> 01:43:41,130
I certainly will

855
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,424
I feel wonderful

856
01:43:47,262 --> 01:43:48,930
I'll take my fifth!

857
01:43:57,814 --> 01:43:59,607
That's my fill

858
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:04,654
Remember to visit me.
I'll be expecting you

859
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:09,700
Of course, I promised.
I don't tell lies like you do

860
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:11,535
What?

861
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,871
Or at least not so convincingly

862
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:21,212
It couldn't be helped.
It was the biggest lie of my life

863
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:04,714
- Welcome home
- Evening

864
01:45:05,757 --> 01:45:09,927
- Did she get off all right?
- Yes, thank you

865
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:13,556
That's good.
I offer you my congratulations

866
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:16,350
- I'm indebted to you
- Not at all

867
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:18,811
Goodnight

868
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,273
Give my regards to Sei

869
01:45:25,193 --> 01:45:27,778
Goodnight, then

870
01:45:27,904 --> 01:45:29,280
'Night
