1
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:09,520
 
 

2
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,815
 

3
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,402
 

4
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:19,000
Come in.

5
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,716
What is this ridiculous thing? Come here.
- It's called the Windsor knot.

6
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:30,554
It's like a noose.
- I got it at a Playboy's Guide to Style.

7
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:35,435
Oh my gosh, stick with the encyclopedia.
Got you where you are.

8
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:43,736
I mean, don't get me wrong, Sandy's a cool
chick but it's not like you're gonna marry her.

9
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,655
You're not gonna marry her, are you?

10
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:49,535
I don't have any thought of what I'm doing
next week. Never mind, the rest of my life.

11
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:55,458
Well, you could figure it out because I'm sure as shit Sandy has.
And you can bet your ass that her parents have some pretty
strong opinions on the subject.

12
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,168
And what's that suppose to mean?

13
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:01,548
Just think how they don't like their perfect
little princess banging big bad wolf.

14
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:06,178
I'm not banging her, Lex.
I'm dating her, faithfully.

15
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:11,142
Alright, next year when she's at Stanford
and you're slumming in at State...

16
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:18,234
I'll give you two months before she finds some
pre-med and you meet the entire cheering squad.

17
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,613
Oh, yeah? What about you and TJ?
- I wanna show you something.

18
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,829
Subtle.
- Gotta love it, right?

19
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:30,497
Is that wash off?

20
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:05,829
Chad, what is it?
- You gotta go.

21
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,386
Layla's here.

22
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:27,394
Wait, what? I thought you
said you broke up.

23
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,315
I lied.

24
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,739
You asshole. How could you...?
- Have you seen your body?

25
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:40,326
But I thought you said...
- You thought I said what..?

26
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,998
You never were a match for thinking.

27
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:54,467
Hey, pass.
- Nice arm...

28
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,719
For a girl.

29
00:05:56,886 --> 00:06:03,394
Maybe I'll play college football too, huh.
- I got three words for you, TJ. Random drug test..

30
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:08,775
Too early for beer, ain't it?

31
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:15,490
You put all the others?
- Scholarships don't come on line everyday, Jake.

32
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:21,497
True, dude. Well, like every other day.
- One day they'll just stop coming, believe me.

33
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:22,999
Hey, daddy.

34
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:31,593
Going to the graduation party tonight?
- God, I hope not. TJ, do me a favor. Keep things under control, will you?

35
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,891
You're really embarrassing to bust my whole family.
- Rated G, PG at the worst.

36
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:47,110
It's rare to find students so qualified in the
same school and they belong in the same family.
-- Thank you, sir.

37
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,823
May your future be as bright as your past.
- Hear, hear.

38
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,038
Well, after college I'd like to become a doctor just like you.
- Then we'll be colleague someday.

39
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:02,586
Eli wants to be a doctor too, don't you Eli?
- Oh well, no actually, I was looking...

40
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:05,881
Actually my little brother wants to become a pirate.

41
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:13,348
I don't wanna become a pirate.
That's such fictional, I mean...

42
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:18,771
Well anyone that becomes valedictorian after
skipping a grade can do whatever he wants.
- Well thank you. Thank you very much.

43
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,984
You must be very proud.
- We are.

44
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:30,659
Then you'll even be more proud to learn that I'm
recommending both Sandy and Eli for full academic scholarship.

45
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,459
Just consider it a graduation
present for your parents.

46
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:41,379
We're going to Stanford.
- We are.

47
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:46,843
Well, enough of that boring stuff.
What are you two gonna get into this summer?

48
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,388
Just a little charity work, sir.

49
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,998
Ladies.

50
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:21,341
You're an asshole.
- I love you too.

51
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:25,596
Let's do some fucking shots.

52
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,435
New king in town, bitches.

53
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:35,189
All bow down before my lengthy lance.

54
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,861
You're so wet, good.

55
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:51,875
Have you ever wonder what I'd be like
to live in another time and place?

56
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:58,633
Like to exist in a completely formed reality
where societal conventions don't apply.

57
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,136
Like in France or something?

58
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:04,932
No, like, like...

59
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:09,729
I really wish I was a pirate.

60
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:14,525
Eli, you're so random.
- No seriously, think about it.

61
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:21,784
Like think about it. I can be a pirate
just like, sail over the world.

62
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,995
Have a parrot.

63
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:30,502
Crunches a sword and then rips a bodice.

64
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,214
What's a bodice?

65
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,761
Hey, there's my girl.
- Hey, baby.

66
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:43,225
Wasn't sure what you wanted? So I got vodka or rhum.
- How about both?

67
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:47,897
Whoa, easy. Whoa, whoa. What are you Irish?
- My mom thinks I'm staying at Hannah's tonight.

68
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:52,026
Then I'm gonna get a second round.
- Hey, come here.

69
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,029
I love you.
- I love you too.

70
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:03,039
You're so goddamn hot.
- Yeah, don't you forget it.

71
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:08,169
Oh if you ever cheat on me
I swear to God I'd kill the guy.

72
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:13,843
Don't worry baby. I don't want
anybody else. Not now, not ever.

73
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,264
Yeah, you hear that? This ass belongs to me.

74
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,860
Cheers.

75
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,576
I'm done here. I'm fucking wasted.

76
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,754
Hold it.

77
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:07,612
Jennifer Atkins back in my jeep,
driver's at the glass, summer school.

78
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,950
Ride that stick, baby.

79
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,912
You're a whore.

80
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:19,458
Alright, alright, alright. Dominic Sperduto...

81
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:26,091
9th grade, 50-yard line
at the football field.

82
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,429
Sperduto?
- What, he was good.

83
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,891
He was hairy, but it's good.

84
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,693
Shut up.
- What about you, Eli?

85
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:54,164
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.
- And what's that gotta do with you. Spill it, fish fag.

86
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:00,504
Fine. Your mom. Last night.

87
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,727
You don't know why it's always about my mother.

88
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:17,149
Eli, I wanna make fun of Chad just ask
him about the training in Tijuana.

89
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,574
I wanna hear about Sandy.

90
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:29,370
You know, sometimes some memory
lane should never be discussed.

91
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,793
But my first kiss, now that was pretty hot.

92
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,547
Boring.
- Wait, wait. I wanna hear it.

93
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:45,430
Okay. Well, it was in the graveyard. You remember it?
- I remember it.

94
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:49,977
We were playing the game.
- I was there.

95
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,856
We were all there.
- Oh yeah, the game.

96
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:58,278
That was so fun.
- I was so scared.

97
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:03,826
Surrounded by all those dead bodies, so quiet.
I was the last one left.

98
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:08,164
And you were all out there looking
for me. Hunting me.

99
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:13,712
My heart was pounding, knowing that any second
someone was gonna jump out and grab me.

100
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,801
I didn't know whether I was gonna
have a heart attack or an orgasm.

101
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:23,014
Oh God, that sounds so hot.
- I'm hot.

102
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:24,891
And wet.

103
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:33,442
Grab the beers.
- Grab the beers.

104
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:49,460
Who wins? Who wins?
The Chad wins.

105
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:54,383
You cut through the fucking... You went the complete
wrong way. That's not even the course bro.

106
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,681
We gotta to have a complete rematch.
There's no fucking way that that is gonna be the result.

107
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:28,546
Oh whoa, careful kids. God's watching.

108
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:32,760
Okay, while we're here are we gonna
play or we're just gonna make out?

109
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,137
I vote play.
- Me too.

110
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,558
Alright dipshits, huddle up.
- Okay, everybody hold a hand.

111
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:44,356
Dude, this is so gayish.
- Oh, go back, wash mop head.

112
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:47,318
Okay, who's the ghost?
- Can I play?

113
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:54,284
You scared the crap out of me, little momma.
- I'd really like to play.

114
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:58,038
It's my favorite game.
- I bet it is, baby.

115
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:04,337
I know all the best hiding spots.
- That's what I'm talking about.

116
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:10,594
I don't know, it's kinda weird.
- You got it bro, girls are so weird.

117
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:14,932
Come on, let her play.
You might get lucky, Eli.

118
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:22,232
Oh come on Eli, I'll protect you.
- You're in.

119
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,279
Come here.

120
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:31,075
Alright, spread it out.
- Wait, wait. What are the rules again?

121
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:36,164
One person's the ghost. Everybody else hides,
once you're caught you turn into a ghost.

122
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:39,042
Last one alive wins.

123
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:43,881
Alright, who's the ghost?
- I am. I am the ghost.

124
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:46,259
Okay, come on.
- Here we go.

125
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:52,516
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

126
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:57,856
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

127
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:02,902
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

128
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:08,034
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

129
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,666
Midnight.

130
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,569
Layla's a ghost.

131
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,410
Lex is a ghost.

132
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,164
Chad's a ghost.

133
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,212
And Mitchell's sacked and lost.

134
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,095
This is so stupid.

135
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:08,018
Hannah's a ghost.
Fucking ghost, yeah.

136
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,205
Sandy's a ghost.
- You go that way. We'll get her.

137
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,970
You're the only one left. You won.

138
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:46,937
What are you doing?
- Do you remember me?

139
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:52,526
Do you remember me?

140
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,869
Hey, be careful.

141
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,875
You will.

142
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,225
Hey, where did she go?

143
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,395
Sandy, what happened?

144
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:31,654
The girl just jumped.
- What happened?

145
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,034
What happened?
- The girl she just jumped off the cliff.

146
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:45,336
We've been over every inch ground
down there and I'm telling you there's no girl.

147
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:50,258
It's gotta be something.
People are just disappearing.

148
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:55,973
I hate to say this boss but,
maybe she's just making it up.

149
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,979
I think I'm gonna be sick.

150
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,486
Everything okay, daddy?
- Yeah, baby.

151
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:14,786
Look, ah, there's nothing down there.
- Wait, wait, but Sandy saw her jumped.

152
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:20,418
I know, I know. That's why we're here,
that's why we're gonna stay here until I make sure everybody's safe.

153
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,879
So what do we do?
- Keep looking for her.

154
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:28,969
You, you take her home.
Don't worry, if she's here, we're gonna find her.

155
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:36,978
She's dead, isn't she?
- Sandy, nobody's dead.

156
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:41,858
I saw her jumped.
- Maybe she's hiding.

157
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:46,363
Maybe planning a joke or something.
- Dude, why don't we just get home?

158
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:51,995
There's nothing we can do tonight, you guys.
Let's call it a night.

159
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,585
Are you okay?

160
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,713
I know what I saw.

161
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:09,806
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

162
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:13,977
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

163
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:17,565
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time

164
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:22,737
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

165
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:13,920
Sister Dolores says
it's my magic breath.

166
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:19,343
That's a pretty flower.
- They're called forget-me-nots.

167
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,305
You put them over the graves.

168
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:27,060
How come?
- So you don't forget the dead.

169
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,523
But I don't know any dead people.

170
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,236
I do.

171
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:40,616
Oh, sad.
- That's okay.

172
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:47,541
Sister Dolores says that if my faith is strong
enough, I can have all the friends I want.

173
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:56,969
But I only want you.

174
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:02,933
Bestfriends?

175
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,023
Friends forever.

176
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:32,967
Good morning.

177
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:39,600
We should leave.
- Do we have to?

178
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,940
Stop it.
- Doesn't feel like you want me to stop.

179
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:59,873
What's wrong with you? Are you okay, baby?

180
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:12,387
I wished we break up.

181
00:23:17,685 --> 00:23:21,355
What? Why?
- I'm over it.

182
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,194
Why did I not do it right?

183
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm just not feeling it.

184
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:40,836
It's Hannah, isn't it?
I knew it, I know you're into her.

185
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,839
Look, I just don't wanna be
tied down to anybody.

186
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,804
Don't you fucking dare.

187
00:23:56,354 --> 00:24:00,816
Fine. It's yours.
Swim for it.

188
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:08,893
Are you okay?

189
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,646
Wait.

190
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:34,865
Do you have anything smaller?
- Here.

191
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:39,413
Perfect. Let Chad see what he's missing.

192
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:43,834
Wait, I thought you were over him.
- I am. - So what happened?

193
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,132
Let's just say, I wasn't wearing panties at the party.
- Hannah, you didn't.

194
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:53,720
Oh, I most definitely did.
- What about Layla?

195
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:56,765
Who?
- If she finds out, it's gonna be major drama.

196
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:59,852
Hold on. Chad is seeing someone else?

197
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:07,777
What a dick. Of course, if it wasn't for his massive...

198
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,907
It's kinda hot .

199
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:19,249
Hey, take it easy with my brother, okay. He likes you.
- Really?

200
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:26,758
I didn't see anything. Not that there's
anything to see, of course, there's something to see.
There's a lot to see.

201
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:32,138
I just, I didn't, I didn't see it.
- Turn around, goofball.

202
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:37,144
Will this make me look like a slut?

203
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:42,442
You look...

204
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,946
pretty.

205
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:57,458
Don't you have something to pack?
- No, actually I'm good to go.

206
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,878
Eli, go pack again.

207
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:17,731
Got you
- You got me, Pete.

208
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,611
You always get me, man.
- That's 'coz you smoke too much.

209
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:26,449
You know, you better lay off that shit if you wanna
make babies with that lovely little woman here.

210
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,954
Do you got something for me?
- I sure do.

211
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,957
Absolutely.

212
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:38,046
How about that? Ain't that a beaut?

213
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:43,260
All of the check, huh.

214
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:52,353
What the hell if she's worth it, right.
- Don't come calling me Monday saying you're hangover now.

215
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,276
Hangover? I'd probably still be drunk.
- Oh shit, wait a minute? Do me a favor, will you?

216
00:28:57,443 --> 00:29:01,448
Check one, two and three
the safety guards.

217
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,838
Where can I put these?
- Hey, you guys.

218
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,425
What's up?
- Hey, Cecilia.

219
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,887
What's up with the stripes?
- I have to work.

220
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:25,892
Are you serious?
- Yeah, I know it sucks, I need to get rid of my tan lines.

221
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,227
Sure, you do.

222
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,813
Unbelievable.

223
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:37,780
Have you no shame?
- Of course not, you know that.

224
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:39,698
Where is Layla?

225
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:49,293
Hi, Jake.
- Hey, CC.

226
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,215
How is it? You'll have a drink from me, okay.
- Yes, ma'am. I'll have two.

227
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:58,387
TJ's gonna be here at seven,
the beer's gonna be chilled on ice.

228
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,285
Don't mind if I do.

229
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,923
Hey, Suzie Q. You missed me?

230
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,858
You want some?

231
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,756
Sweet.

232
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,517
You're good.

233
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:24,025
What up, sweet Melissa? Looking sexy.

234
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:26,652
You're so in shape baby, huh?

235
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:34,119
Mary Jane, we meet again?

236
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,922
What's up, baby?
Feeling a little tight today, huh.

237
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:46,133
You need a little lube?

238
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,240
Is that you, Pete?

239
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:13,872
Note to self:
Drugs are bad.

240
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,673
Out here to scream, baby.

241
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,820
Hey, who is there?

242
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:05,139
Don't make me kick your ass, man.

243
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,733
Are you okay?

244
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,239
First thing I wanna do when we get there,
is take a long nap in the sand.

245
00:33:57,405 --> 00:34:04,455
Think back with Pina Colada
just forget about everything for a while.

246
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:07,876
If you need company let me know...

247
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:16,511
We forgot about the beer.

248
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:21,099
Wait, isn't TJ bringing the beer?

249
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,310
Who?
- TJ.

250
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,480
I'll call him.

251
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,112
What's with her?
- I don't know.

252
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,115
She's been acting weird all day.

253
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,465
Who wants some?

254
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:56,306
Come on, I'll not let them right here.
- I mean, what a lovely day to go to the beach.

255
00:34:56,473 --> 00:35:00,185
Hey, any word?
- No, nothing.

256
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,606
But don't worry I gonna sort the whole
mess out when you guys are gone.

257
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:07,610
Well, if you find her, will you call me?
- When I find her, you will be the first person I'll call.

258
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,362
Thanks, Zack.

259
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:12,783
Alright, you kids have fun.
- We always do.

260
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:17,163
Well, not too much fun okay.  And for Christ's
sake, keep a leash on my daughter, will you?

261
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,040
Only if it's leather.

262
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:31,637
Sure you can't come?
- Miss me okay.

263
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,909
Hey, let's see what you got?

264
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:57,375
Oh Eli-e, let us see what you got.
- Loser buys beer.

265
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,962
Come on, Eli. Don't be a pussy.
Be a tiger.

266
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:07,094
Please, Jake. Not now.
- I'm not a tiger.

267
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:09,096
I'm a pirate.

268
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:28,869
Where is he?
- Wait, wait, wait, where is he?

269
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:31,246
You're winning.

270
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:42,967
Watch out.

271
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:05,868
No way.

272
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:27,434
Oh shit, I always had you.

273
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,314
Yeah well, now you
have beer to go.

274
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:31,840
Sandy?
- What the hell?

275
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:42,478
This is our game.
- This is my friend. Jake.

276
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:48,985
This is our game.
- I was gonna get you, I just forgot.

277
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:55,617
What are they doing here?
- It's okay, they're cool. They're my friends.

278
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,287
You're ruining this.

279
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,957
What's wrong with her?

280
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:15,348
It's nothing. She's cool.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

281
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:24,858
Hey Sandy, you coming or what?
- Sandy, are you okay?

282
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:32,534
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

283
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,661
It's fun, huh?

284
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:48,260
What's wrong?
- A new clerk.

285
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:52,682
Hannah, you have an advantage here.
Two rounds.

286
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,687
No way, they always card me.
- Don't look at me, I can't even grow a mustache.

287
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,440
Oh you can't even grow a pube, Eli.

288
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,860
What's going on?
- Strategy.

289
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:08,199
I told you that we should wait for TJ.
- Guys, I got this under control.

290
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:12,453
Wait, no no wait...  -- Yeah, she is.
- She isn't gonna...

291
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,628
Can I help you?
- I sure hope so.

292
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:24,092
You have something hot for me?
- We have hotdogs.

293
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:26,761
I'm starving.

294
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:31,184
How much?
- $1.50 for the regular, $2 for the footlong.

295
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,562
I'll take the biggest one you got.

296
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:43,739
Forgot my wallet. See.
- I guess, I can lend you some change.

297
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:48,453
Well, aren't you sweet?
Wait, let me help you.

298
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,248
What are you doing?
- What's this?

299
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,917
Oh my...

300
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:35,381
Holy shit, she's gonna screw that dude.
- So what? He's hot.

301
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,973
I don't need to see that.
- Wait, is nobody bothered by this?

302
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:49,689
Why would this bother us?
She's getting naked.

303
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:57,531
How can she do this to TJ?
- What's with you? You're talking crazy.

304
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,116
Me?

305
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,953
Who the hell is TJ?

306
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:04,981
Is somebody out there?

307
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,662
Screw this.

308
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,089
You, dude, hadn't come up yet.
Let's go.

309
00:44:07,218 --> 00:44:10,806
Are you okay, man?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

310
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:15,811
Alright. Move your ass right at the market.
- Sure, I'm there.

311
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:15,462
Somebody fucking help me.

312
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:37,404
Are you ready?

313
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:44,035
Where is your bike?
- I left it at the house, remember?

314
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,833
Come on, get in.

315
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:57,384
Oh my God, just hit me.
We're done, we're graduating.

316
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:02,223
I'm graduating.
I'm graduating.

317
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,808
Dude, that was awesome.
- That was awesome.

318
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:11,317
Get back in the car. What the hell is going on?
- What do you mean?

319
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:14,445
Yeah, Sandy, what're you talking about?
- Where's my stuff?

320
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:17,365
I mean, where are the beach chairs?
Where's your bogey board?

321
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:23,915
Why would you bring a freaking bogey board to the mountains?
- I have nothing to say to you.

322
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,543
Excuse me?
- How about TJ?

323
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:33,550
Who the heck is TJ?
- I don't wanna be with anybody else.

324
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:37,471
Not now. Not ever. You're thrash.
- Fuck you, Sandy.

325
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:41,893
Just because you're Cin"the fucking"rella doesn't
give you the right to judge the rest of us.

326
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,980
Do me a favor, Lex and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus, Jake, wake up!

327
00:46:46,147 --> 00:46:50,653
You think it's just me? She thinks you're thrash too,
she thinks our whole family's garbage.

328
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:54,365
Stop the car.

329
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:05,086
Sandy, what the hell is going on? You're acting like a lunatic.
- You know, this is Chad's car.

330
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:08,548
Who's Chad?

331
00:47:11,134 --> 00:47:17,474
Pretty boy asshole. The guy who drives this car.
Oh yeah, you fucked him yesterday, how about that?

332
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:21,855
Sandy, come on. You're freaking me out, alright.
- She's out of her goddamn mind.

333
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,690
Shut up.

334
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:26,777
Sandy, what the fuck is going on?

335
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:32,533
What is this, Jake? Is this some kind of joke.
- I don't know, Sandy. You tell me.

336
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,037
Whatever it is, it's not very funny.

337
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:38,999
Get in the car.

338
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:44,922
No, wait. Dad said that I wasn't gonna let you drive.
- Eli, get in the goddamn car.

339
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:08,073
This can't be possible.
- Wait, Sandy.

340
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,360
Eli, stay here.
- Wait, maybe I should go...

341
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:42,987
I said, stay here!

342
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:58,588
Can you like turn the
music or something?

343
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:02,635
What's wrong with her?
- She's fucked up.

344
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:08,558
What are you talking about? Sandy's the smartest girl I know.
She's class president. She's going to Stanford.

345
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:13,689
Well, the more perfect someone life's seems
the more fucked up they probably are.

346
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:19,362
I don't know what that makes you, Mother Teresa?
- Nope, just honest.

347
00:49:19,529 --> 00:49:23,658
Well, at least I can figure out
what I'm worth to fucking fuck first.

348
00:49:26,745 --> 00:49:28,455
You're a bitch, Lex.

349
00:49:29,874 --> 00:49:34,087
What the fuck do you mean?
- Jesus, Hannah, chill out.

350
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,307
Guys?

351
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:36,182
It was like he was never here.

352
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:16,938
Oh my God, Eli. What happened?
What are you doing?

353
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:28,575
Dude, I didn't mean it.

354
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,060
Oh shit.
- Where's Lex?

355
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,510
Alexis?

356
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:43,018
Help me.

357
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:51,945
Where are you?

358
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:06,211
Where are you?

359
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,617
I'm gonna need a shovel.
To dig with anything.

360
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:17,541
Sandy, are you hurt or what? What happened?
- She was right here, I swear. She was right here.

361
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,212
Don't just stare there, help me.
- Stop it. Stop it.

362
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:23,590
This can't be happening.
- Jake, what is going on?

363
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:28,846
I swear, she was right here.
- Stop, stop. You're not making any sense.

364
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:33,768
She was right there.
You saw it, didn't you?

365
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:39,066
You were right here.
Eli, you saw it, didn't you?

366
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:43,822
Saw what?
- That thing, that fucking thing who
dragged her to the goddamn ground.

367
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:46,157
Dragged who?
- Lex.

368
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:52,790
How can you not remember them?
Don't look at me like that.

369
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:55,918
I'm not crazy.

370
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,646
I don't wanna do this.
- Jake, you were dumber than I thought you were.

371
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:22,615
What the fuck do you want?
- Nothing, sir.

372
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:27,662
Nothing. Get the fuck out of my office
- But, I...

373
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:31,167
Sandy's just worried
about that girl.

374
00:57:33,377 --> 00:57:36,672
And I told you I'd call.
- Zack, you don't understand.

375
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,299
Shut up.

376
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,771
Her name is Angela Smith.

377
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,693
See, I told you I'd call.

378
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:04,329
I've been talking to the school but the girl she was
looking for, yeah she dropped down, the seventh grade.

379
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:09,376
This was some fucking nuns out there at the old convent.
Which if memory serves it right next to your graveyard.

380
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:13,047
Case closed.
- What do you mean, case closed?

381
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:19,429
I mean, the goddamn case is closed.
- People are disappearing.

382
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,391
Jake, let's just get out of here.
- People are dying.

383
00:58:22,557 --> 00:58:25,143
Sandy, come on please. Let's just go.
- You have to believe me.

384
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:29,816
Is she on drugs? She's on fucking drugs, isn't she?
- Nobody's on drugs, this was a bad idea. Let's go

385
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:32,777
Hey, get back here.

386
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:39,493
Where are you going now?
- We have to hurry.

387
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,664
And go where?
- You heard, she lives at the convent.

388
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:47,585
Yeah, not exactly what I had in mind for a Saturday night, see ya.
- You can't leave we have to stay together.

389
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:52,049
And do what? Breaking to
a freaking convent? No, thanks.

390
00:58:52,216 --> 00:58:57,723
Are you trying to get arrested? Coz then, we should just go back inside.
- We have bigger problems than being arrested.

391
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:02,561
Yeah, you got that right.
- I'm talking about Angela Smith, okay.

392
00:59:02,728 --> 00:59:06,399
That's it. I'm going home, bye.
- You're gonna die.

393
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:12,113
It's not cool.

394
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:27,505
Which is it, Sandy? You wanna help with the time
or you're gonna act like a crazy person? Coz I'm not going.

395
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:31,135
Please, Hannah. I'm begging you.

396
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:38,060
Maybe we should just go home.
- Can't do that.

397
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:41,897
Coz this asshole is gonna
be there waiting for me.

398
00:59:42,064 --> 00:59:47,362
What about our house?
- Right. With her like this?

399
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:54,244
Who's gonna get the blame for that?
Not you, guys.

400
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:58,540
Jake, you don't understand.
- I don't understand? I don't understand what's going on.

401
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:02,087
I don't understand what you want from me?

402
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:06,091
or what the hell is going on
with this convent or this goddamn girl?

403
01:00:07,175 --> 01:00:09,470
I don't understand any of it.

404
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:22,109
But if it's that important to you...

405
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:25,363
I'll go.

406
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:29,534
We'll all go.

407
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:35,291
Not tonight.
But tomorrow morning.

408
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,507
We have to stay together, then.
- Then we'll stay together.

409
01:00:42,674 --> 01:00:44,426
All of us.

410
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,824
Anybody out there?

411
01:01:06,284 --> 01:01:08,369
Now, coz if there is...

412
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:14,835
I'm ready, I'll take him.

413
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:22,135
But seriously, though.
Whatever it is, I got your back.

414
01:01:22,302 --> 01:01:24,179
You know what I mean?

415
01:01:25,263 --> 01:01:27,516
Do you believe me, Eli?

416
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:36,902
I believe that you believed it.
And that's good enough for me.

417
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:43,493
I didn't really wanna go to the mountains, anyway.
- I did.

418
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:48,581
Actually, I was really looking forward to it.

419
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:54,254
Really? Eli?
Want no dirtbags around?

420
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:57,592
Oh Jake, just you.

421
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,594
And your ticket.

422
01:02:01,137 --> 01:02:05,935
Here, give this to Sandy.
- I don't know, Hannah?

423
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:09,647
Oh, come on. She needs to sleep.

424
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:18,824
Come here a second.

425
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:32,506
Not exactly how we planned to
spend the night, is it?

426
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:42,183
You remember last fall when the scouts
were all over me and I was just out of my mind.

427
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,147
I thought I was going crazy.

428
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:52,612
But the night before state you showed up
with all the wine and blankets and what did we do?

429
01:02:54,656 --> 01:02:59,161
We laid up in the roof and...
- fell asleep watching the stars.

430
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:04,667
You showed me the best thing I could do
was just forget about everything.

431
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:10,424
You were right.
- You lost the game, Jake.

432
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,677
But I played great.

433
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:19,684
Is it me?

434
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:23,898
Did I do something wrong?

435
01:03:30,946 --> 01:03:34,826
I know I'm not what
your parents want.

436
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,957
But I need to know
if I'm what you want.

437
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:45,505
You are what I want, Jake.
I love you.

438
01:03:47,716 --> 01:03:49,551
I love you too.

439
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:09,824
She's really out.

440
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:16,873
My God. Who needs beer?
- Me.

441
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:22,380
I'm gonna check out the pool.
Eli?

442
01:04:26,426 --> 01:04:29,638
Oh come on, walk me. Make sure I'm safe.

443
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:35,437
I mean, we're all suppose to stay together.
- I can handle her. It's okay.

444
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:37,147
Are you sure?

445
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:41,526
Absolutely.

446
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:47,158
Okay, just a sec.

447
01:05:00,256 --> 01:05:06,513
I'm sure you know what you're doing .
- Doing, doing. What do you mean?

448
01:05:08,265 --> 01:05:10,893
Someone showed me this once.

449
01:05:15,023 --> 01:05:17,359
What are you doing?

450
01:05:17,525 --> 01:05:19,402
Is that a vagina?

451
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:27,078
Consider this...

452
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,334
the keys to the kingdom.

453
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:37,423
Looks like a treasure map.
- Well, sailor.

454
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:42,387
You follow the arrows,
the glorious bounty awaits.

455
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:48,811
That'll work?
-Only one way to find out.

456
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:52,064
Ready?

457
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,027
He's ready.

458
01:06:20,346 --> 01:06:25,144
It's cold.
- That's coz you're all the way over there.

459
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,566
What if she's right?

460
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:37,115
What if we're on some kind of
physical or metaphysical danger?

461
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,330
Then we don't have any time to waste.

462
01:06:44,373 --> 01:06:48,378
I'm serious.
- So am I.

463
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,799
I'm gonna move a little bit closer, okay.

464
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,600
How come you never
asked me out, Eli?

465
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,439
You always have a boyfriend.

466
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:09,568
I would've said yes.

467
01:07:09,735 --> 01:07:15,241
You seem to always be with a
guy that look different from me.

468
01:07:18,703 --> 01:07:20,706
Can you forgive me?

469
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:30,175
I forgive you.

470
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:47,695
It's gonna be awesome, man.
- Here, put this in your pocket.

471
01:07:47,861 --> 01:07:51,324
And don't let her see it.
- What's wrong?

472
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:55,286
Maybe she's a big loser like her friend.
- I'm not a loser.

473
01:07:55,453 --> 01:08:00,668
Sandy, I don't feel so good.
- Come on, Sandy. This was your idea.

474
01:08:00,835 --> 01:08:05,381
Yeah, I mean, what's the big deal?
- We're gonna be late for dinner.

475
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:09,511
Yeah, whuzz.
- Everybody shut up. We're doing this, got it.

476
01:08:12,806 --> 01:08:15,018
Give me the paint.

477
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:29,616
Easy, easy.

478
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:39,128
Where did you learn that?

479
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,840
Whatever "that" was.

480
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:49,056
A gentleman never tells..

481
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:53,895
Well, a gentleman could never do that either.

482
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:57,357
Where are you going?
- To get us some drinks.

483
01:08:57,523 --> 01:09:00,777
Give you a chance to recharge.

484
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:07,493
Let me guess. This is where you disappear
and leave me cold and alone.

485
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:10,205
Cold? Yes.

486
01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:13,875
Alone? Not a chance.

487
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:17,046
Oh, just so you don't forget...

488
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,684
It's okay.

489
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,107
Jesus Christ, Sandy.

490
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:44,410
Sorry, you scared me.
- You see that sign?

491
01:09:44,576 --> 01:09:48,790
You break your neck,
we're ain't accountable.

492
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:57,925
Oh, creep.

493
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:19,950
Eli, come here, help me up.
She's gonna hurt herself, hold her up.

494
01:10:27,124 --> 01:10:29,794
Pull her legs.

495
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,802
I saw that mister.

496
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:44,269
I know you're there, asshole.

497
01:10:46,396 --> 01:10:48,815
Listen perv, don't make me call the...

498
01:12:06,028 --> 01:12:08,196
This isn't real.

499
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:13,286
This isn't real.

500
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:17,916
Please, get away.

501
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,836
Please, get away.

502
01:12:54,874 --> 01:13:01,006
There's my girl. I wasn't sure if
you wanted vodka or rhum.

503
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:03,217
Where is my brother?

504
01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:18,901
Sandy, where the hell are you?
- Eli, are you okay?

505
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:22,572
No, look, mom and dad are all over me.
I can't cover for you anymore.

506
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,700
Is Hannah with you?

507
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:31,833
Meet me at the convent, okay.
- Sandy, just come home. Sheriff Mitchell stopped by the house.

508
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:34,335
Please meet me there.

509
01:13:45,223 --> 01:13:47,308
I thought we're on a hurry.

510
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,428
May I help?
- Sorry to bother you...

511
01:14:19,595 --> 01:14:23,224
I'm Sandy Channing and this is my friend...
- Jake Mitchell.

512
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:26,519
The quarterback?
- Yes ma'am.

513
01:14:26,686 --> 01:14:32,610
Father Michael and I, we listen
to all the games on the Hi-Fi.

514
01:14:32,777 --> 01:14:36,739
I'm Sister Dolores. Please come in.

515
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:43,580
I'm sorry sister, I know it's late.
- What can I do for you?

516
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:46,501
We're here because of Angela Smith.

517
01:14:47,668 --> 01:14:52,423
How do you know her?
- I used to know her when I was little.

518
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:56,136
Of course.
- Sister, Sandy is just concerned...

519
01:14:56,303 --> 01:15:00,891
Is Angela her?
- Oh, I wish she was...

520
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:05,021
but it's just not practical,
I'm sure you understand.

521
01:15:05,188 --> 01:15:09,275
Do you know where she might be?
- At St. Mary's hospital.

522
01:15:09,442 --> 01:15:13,656
They're quite wonderful there.
- Is she hurt?

523
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:19,621
Angela is in coma.

524
01:15:20,747 --> 01:15:25,837
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed you knew.

525
01:15:26,003 --> 01:15:27,630
A coma?

526
01:15:29,382 --> 01:15:34,805
Thank you for your time.
- Well, I could show you her room.

527
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:43,064
I've kept her room just as she's left it.

528
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:49,071
Her doctors say that her condition
is permanent but well one hopes...

529
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:55,035
Oh well, the girls' floor...
- Mr. Mitchell can wait down here on the boys' floor.

530
01:15:55,202 --> 01:16:00,917
Can he come with me?
- I'll be fine. I'll stay here on the boys' floor.

531
01:16:02,335 --> 01:16:03,920
Please, come in.
Come in. Come in.

532
01:16:11,345 --> 01:16:16,894
Girls, girls, game time is over.
Ride along.

533
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:20,982
Say your prayers.
I'll be there and I'll tuck you in a moment.

534
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:25,779
A little rhyme I teach the children.

535
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:30,826
It helps to keep the nightmares at bay.

536
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:45,051
Do you believe in the devil, Mr. Mitchell?
- No, not really.

537
01:16:45,218 --> 01:16:50,348
Well, spend some time with these
little monsters, you'll believe.

538
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,312
So this is Angela's room?

539
01:16:57,147 --> 01:17:01,569
This is a week before
it happened.

540
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:05,240
Six years ago this June.

541
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:11,997
How was that possible?
- Oh, I ask the Lord that every day.

542
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:18,755
Doctors blamed genetics but I don't
know. She was small...

543
01:17:18,922 --> 01:17:22,217
and weaker than
the other children.

544
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:27,140
But I had faith that
God would protect her.

545
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:36,650
Angela believed in her own
kind of protection.

546
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:43,283
An angel?
- Faith is all-powerful.

547
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:49,540
If one truly believes in something,
one will make it come true.

548
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:57,424
Of course, we have to be careful
what we choose to believe in.

549
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:03,055
Duty calls. Forgive me.
I'll be right back.

550
01:18:13,192 --> 01:18:17,738
Hey, you play any football?
- Do I play football?

551
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,741
Toss here, kid.

552
01:18:21,284 --> 01:18:26,165
You see this arm? In Jefferson County,
it's worth more than your life.

553
01:18:29,043 --> 01:18:31,962
Nice arm. For a girl.

554
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,966
Kid, hey kid.

555
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,997
You gotta be kidding me?

556
01:19:10,172 --> 01:19:13,552
Hey kid, I've got your ball.

557
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:22,812
Speak, you little bastard.

558
01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:53,680
What are you doing?

559
01:19:56,683 --> 01:20:00,396
Did you know about these?
- What are they?

560
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:03,232
Why would she draw these?

561
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:07,570
Those can't be Angela's.

562
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:21,836
Just in case.

563
01:20:28,219 --> 01:20:29,929
Hey kid, is that you?

564
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:37,104
What is this thing?
- I don't know.

565
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:40,358
Whatever it is...

566
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,820
it's real.

567
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:44,163
What in God's name?

568
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:50,462
Who are you?

569
01:22:57,595 --> 01:23:01,350
He's gone.

570
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:09,067
What happened? Are you okay?
- It's too late. It's too late.

571
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:13,280
Look at this.
- I don't understand. What's going on?

572
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:17,285
It is the ghost.
- Ghost? What ghost?

573
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:20,746
From the game.
- Who are you?

574
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:24,710
You're not Angela's friend.
What do you want from her?

575
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:28,046
She's suffered enough.
- You get out of here.

576
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:31,842
Leave the poor girl in peace.
- God sees you, Ms. Channing.

577
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:34,554
God sees everything.

578
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:48,445
Who was that lady? And what the hell were you doing
out here in the middle of the freaking night?

579
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:53,784
It doesn't matter anymore.
They're all gone, it's over.

580
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:58,122
Sandy, nobody knows where you've been.

581
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:04,046
If you're in some kind of trouble,
you can talk to me.

582
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:09,092
It doesn't matter anymore, Eli. It doesn't matter.
- Stop saying that.

583
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,684
It matters to me.

584
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:22,066
You're my sister, okay.
If something is going on, please tell me.

585
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:24,276
So I can help you.

586
01:24:25,778 --> 01:24:27,656
You can trust me.

587
01:24:29,032 --> 01:24:33,453
You know that, right?
- I want you to listen to me, okay.

588
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:38,209
You do know that I love you and
I would never lie to you ever.

589
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:43,006
But what I'm about tell you is gonna sound
like the craziest thing in the world, because it is.

590
01:24:43,173 --> 01:24:47,344
And I know you're not gonna believe me, because
nobody believes me. But I need you to believe, Eli.

591
01:24:47,511 --> 01:24:49,054
I'm listening.

592
01:24:51,182 --> 01:24:54,936
When we're little, we used to
play games, you remember?

593
01:24:55,103 --> 01:24:59,900
In the graveyard?
- There was a girl, an orphan. Her name was Angela.

594
01:25:01,527 --> 01:25:08,660
Last night we played the game again, but we
weren't alone. Six people are with us, Eli.

595
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:15,168
Six of our friends, and I know you don't remember them,
but they were there and now they're gone.

596
01:25:16,335 --> 01:25:20,506
Gone? What do you mean gone?
- Something...

597
01:25:20,673 --> 01:25:23,552
This thing took them.

598
01:25:25,429 --> 01:25:30,894
This thing is connected to
Angela and the game?

599
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,021
It has to be.

600
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,836
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- I believe you.

601
01:25:57,882 --> 01:26:01,720
I believe you.
Why would you make it up?

602
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:04,139
I wouldn't.

603
01:26:29,626 --> 01:26:35,675
Let's figure this out. The game.
What are the rules of the game?

604
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:41,265
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
- Release the one ignored by heaven.

605
01:26:41,431 --> 01:26:43,642
That's Angela, right?

606
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:48,606
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

607
01:26:48,773 --> 01:26:51,568
That's obvious.

608
01:26:51,734 --> 01:26:57,116
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

609
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:05,375
That's it. Erased. Okay, that's it.
Erased by time. That makes sense now.

610
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:10,547
Okay, it doesn't make any sense at all,
but I think I know why.

611
01:27:12,758 --> 01:27:18,389
People are gone.
People I knew?

612
01:27:18,556 --> 01:27:23,604
You didn't just know them Eli they were your
best friends and now one by one they've been...

613
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:25,314
Erased.

614
01:27:30,487 --> 01:27:32,739
Alright, so how does it end? Midnight comes...

615
01:27:32,906 --> 01:27:37,119
It's not too late.
- So kill the ghost or seal your fate.

616
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:41,207
God, she's still alive. Angela's still alive.

617
01:27:41,373 --> 01:27:44,252
What does that mean?
- It means she has to die.

618
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:46,046
Who has to die?

619
01:27:47,464 --> 01:27:50,300
What's going on?
- Dad...

620
01:27:52,553 --> 01:27:57,225
We've been really worried about you.
- Step aside, son.

621
01:27:57,391 --> 01:28:00,771
Wait.
- You're sick, honey.

622
01:28:00,938 --> 01:28:05,025
She didn't do anything wrong.
- No, sweetheart. She just needs some help.

623
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:09,531
No, no. You're not going anywhere, alright. Sit down.
- Let go.

624
01:28:11,032 --> 01:28:13,701
You don't understand, please.

625
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:24,464
It's gonna be okay, honey.
- You'll get back to normal in no time.

626
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:27,425
We're gonna take very good
care of you, Ms. Channing.

627
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:30,346
Sandy, I'm here. I'm right here.
- Step aside.

628
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:37,228
For Christ's sake. Somebody hold him down.
- Sandy, tell me what to do?

629
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:42,025
Kill the ghost or seal your fate.
- What is she saying?

630
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,445
Kill her?
- Kill her.

631
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,031
You can't go any further.

632
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:53,288
I'll do it, Sandy. I'll do it.

633
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,155
Midnight.

634
01:29:25,658 --> 01:29:30,455
Stop. Let me go.
Let me go.

635
01:29:34,084 --> 01:29:39,465
Eli? Where is Eli?
- What is she saying?

636
01:29:39,632 --> 01:29:42,969
Who's Eli, honey?
- Is Eli one of her friends?

637
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:51,020
Sandy doesn't have any friends.
- Go to sleep, honey. We'll be here when you wake up.

638
01:29:52,772 --> 01:29:54,357
Angela Smith.

639
01:29:58,028 --> 01:30:02,199
That's strange.
Angela Smith is a patient here.

640
01:30:11,709 --> 01:30:14,296
I thought we could play the game?

641
01:30:14,463 --> 01:30:18,425
Who's playing?
- Just us.

642
01:30:32,441 --> 01:30:35,403
I'm sorry about last time.

643
01:30:37,364 --> 01:30:39,867
It's getting late. We should play.

644
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:54,049
Maybe we shouldn't play.
- No, I want to play.

645
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:56,468
Wait. Who's the ghost?

646
01:30:58,345 --> 01:30:59,764
You are.

647
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:06,771
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

648
01:31:09,233 --> 01:31:11,235
Run.

649
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,367
Help me.

650
01:31:32,092 --> 01:31:33,928
Midnight.

651
01:31:52,823 --> 01:31:55,827
Look at that shit.

652
01:32:13,472 --> 01:32:15,432
Who did this?

653
01:35:24,312 --> 01:35:26,649
I know what I've done...

654
01:35:32,947 --> 01:35:35,867
but I also know what you've done.

655
01:38:00,113 --> 01:38:02,658
You wanna play a game?

656
01:38:05,452 --> 01:38:11,167
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

657
01:38:11,334 --> 01:38:14,588
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

658
01:38:14,754 --> 01:38:19,760
I remember you. I remember everything.
- Eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

659
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:24,140
I'm so sorry.
- Midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

660
01:38:24,307 --> 01:38:27,978
Please. I was your bestfriend.

661
01:38:31,857 --> 01:38:38,281
All I wanted was you.
- I'll never forget you. I promise.

662
01:38:50,253 --> 01:38:53,173
Friends forever. Is that it?

663
01:39:19,202 --> 01:39:21,497
Well look at you.

664
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,000
It's a miracle.
