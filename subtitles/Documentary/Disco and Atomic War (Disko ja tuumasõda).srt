1
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,719
That's me, Jaak.
I am 8 years old in this photo

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,219
I live in Tallinn, in a newly-built
residential area called Oismae...

3
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,836
that is always expanding

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,348
My life is wonderful,
because I can watch Finnish TV

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,279
My father taught me
how to take photographs

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,078
Now I take photos of everything
that matters to me

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,839
The first photos I take are of...

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,316
commercials and films
shown on Finnish TV

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,799
Here, our relatives from
Southern Estonia are visiting us

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,379
They can't see Finnish TV there

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,068
It's Friday evening.
We're watching "Dallas", as always

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,209
But our relatives see "Dallas"
for the very first time

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,459
And they see a completely different "Dallas"

14
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,879
It is a captivating, spiritual seance...

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,379
and my mother is the medium

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,039
She interprets everything about
the strange characters...

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,552
their love affairs and relationships

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,359
But for the first time in their lives,
our relatives see...

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,839
people drinking whisky on the
rocks and working in skyscrapers

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,779
Men with perfect teeth and
beautiful, yet unhappy, women

21
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,555
And they are all millionaires

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,719
Then I promised Urve, my niece,
to write her every week...

23
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,939
about what is happening in "Dallas",
so she wouldn't lose her connection...

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,937
to that "real world"
she met at our home in Tallinn

25
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,839
In the beginning, there was
Miss Ellie and old Jock...

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,119
Bobby came too...
The police was there...

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,351
Everyone suspected Sue Ellen...

28
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,279
A film by Jaak Kilmi and Kiur Aarma

29
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,355
DISCO AND ATOMIC WAR

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,399
POEM: "The holidays aren't for slumbering,
get up and spread the joy"

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,079
"I wake up early and wash up,
I wash my little brother too"

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,399
"We run to the window,
a parade is passing"

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,999
"Oh, why are there so few
of these great holidays?"

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,939
We grew up during the Cold War

35
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,119
Estonia was occupied
and a part of the Soviet Union

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,529
Long live May 1st!
The International Day of Solidarity!

37
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,716
Long live the Soviet Union!

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,793
There was an iron curtain
between us and the free world

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,395
But radio waves seeped through it

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,719
And they sounded as if they weren't
coming from across the ocean...

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,676
but from the bottom of it

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,559
1,400 jamming stations in the USSR
transmitted static and whistling...

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,519
in between the wavelengths
of Western stations

44
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,274
Back then, radio was Estonia's
only connection to the free world

45
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,739
In the 1950s, the world
enters an era of television

46
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,870
In Tallinn, Soviet Estonian TV
(ETV) begins its broadcasts

47
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,352
Good evening, comrades.
Estonian Television begins its broadcasting

48
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,756
From us, in Tallinn, TV waves are
also spreading 80 km northward...

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,830
where Helsinki, the capital
of Finland, happens to be

50
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,449
But the Finns don't have their own
national TV channel yet

51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,954
The same year, Soviet Estonian TV launches
its Finnish-language programming...

52
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,999
where you can see happy
Soviet workers talking

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,039
...then, the workers
are happy about it

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,439
The workers are happy
about automating the process

55
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,439
Today, more and more production
is expected from everyone...

56
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,034
...so automating the process
is natural

57
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,159
It's clear that this
propaganda channel was...

58
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,599
directed at Finland to spread
their red ideology here

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,979
We're amidst the Cold War and
Finland is no-man's-land

60
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,219
An outwardly Western country where...

61
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,659
nothing happens without
permission from Moscow

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,079
There are Soviet military bases
in Finland

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,759
The are rumours that the Russians
are setting up TV transmitters...

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,659
in their bases to drown Finland
in Communist propaganda

65
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,039
The Western secret services
are afraid of...

66
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,734
completely losing Finland
to the Russians

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,999
The fight took place mostly
in countries like Finland

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,599
The fight for souls

69
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,279
American diplomats in Finland realise...

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,839
that it is time to fight back

71
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,439
The secret telegrams from
the U.S. embassy to Washington...

72
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,919
demand an immediate response...

73
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,037
for launching Finnish TV
with Western support

74
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,119
And so it goes. Two years
after Soviet Estonia...

75
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,359
the Finns launch their own TV channel

76
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,799
At first, it is predictably
mild and cautious...

77
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,153
Welcome to our Christmas programme...

78
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,079
Then occurred the Prague Spring...

79
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,399
Czechoslovakia's uprising
against the Communist regime

80
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,039
Soviet Estonian media doesn't
cover the uprising...

81
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,599
as if nothing had happened

82
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,519
Soviet TV shows the
following images:

83
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,359
Here, the Czech people
welcome their Soviet guests

84
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,194
Here, you can see a lady chanting:
"Friendship! Friendship!"

85
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,039
80 km north of us, the Finns
see the following report:

86
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,479
Czechoslovakia has been
occupied for five days now

87
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,799
Large foreign troops are on the
move, especially in Slovakia

88
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,756
New units are brought in

89
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,359
This morning, the official
government of Czechoslovakia...

90
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,359
denied the Soviet news agency
TASS announcement...

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,679
which claimed there are armed
cars moving through Prague

92
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:28,010
Quite the opposite, the Soviet occupiers
are shooting ordinary people for no reason

93
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:44,553
The next day, an anti-Soviet demonstration
rages in Helsinki, the first since the war

94
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,559
It was very upsetting.
And a big disappointment...

95
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,192
for those who believed in the possibility
of a humane socialism

96
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,159
Here, the policemen
in white gloves...

97
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,039
remove some of the loudest
students from the Soviet embassy

98
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,559
But the Russians are still very upset

99
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,419
At the same time,
the Finnish TV director's car...

100
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,312
enters the embassy
through the back gate

101
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,119
The TV station is held responsible.
The director is ordered to explain...

102
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,679
why Finnish TV is spreading
lies and hysteria...

103
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,729
and ruining their friendly relationship
with the Soviet Union

104
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,799
It upset them very much.
But they couldn't do anything

105
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,939
The show had already aired.
And we didn't regret it either

106
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,799
In Tallinn, we watch the Finnish coverage
of Prague with interest and concern

107
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,237
By then, there are TV sets in most
Soviet Estonian homes

108
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:58,673
Then a new transmitter starts
construction near Helsinki

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,559
However, the specialists
notice at once...

110
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,479
that there's something very
strange going on

111
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,799
The Espoo transmitter wasn't directed
only at the Finnish mainland...

112
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,239
it had a circular diagram

113
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:25,229
At least half of the transmitter's
coverage was directed southward...

114
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,130
towards the Gulf of Finland

115
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,450
Are the practical-minded Finns
heating the Gulf just for fun?

116
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,598
Edward Lucas has done extensive
research on the Cold War

117
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,279
Western countries probably knew
that Finnish TV broadcasts...

118
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,309
reached Tallinn and
Northern Estonia as well

119
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,639
Naturally, the Soviet media thinks
Americans are behind this

120
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,519
They report that the mast was built
by an American company

121
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,599
Even more, they have built it
high enough...

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,219
for ideological waves
to reach Estonia

123
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,939
A newspaper rages:

124
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,519
"The Capitalist government of
Finland and the U.S. propagandists..."

125
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,199
"mean to dehumanise the Soviet people,
especially the youth..."

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,372
"with violence, cruelty
and sexual looseness"

127
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:49,158
They wrote that Finland wanted to
dehumanise the Estonian youth

128
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,399
That we were transmitting shows
to Estonia on purpose

129
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,914
It was complete nonsense!

130
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,599
Naturally, a forest of antennas
emerges on the rooftops of Tallinn...

131
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,079
its branches stretching
towards Finland

132
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,559
But you can't watch Finnish TV
with a Soviet TV set

133
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,519
The technical standard is different

134
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,559
You could see the black and white
images on Finnish TV...

135
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,851
but there was no sound

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,639
This is me, Joosep. And the weight
of our family's big secret...

137
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,119
is reflected in my eyes

138
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,139
When I was 9, our entire family
was involved in illegal business

139
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,579
Me, my father and mother

140
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,919
I knew that you could end up
in prison for things like that

141
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,230
So we had a strict procedure
concerning the telephone

142
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,095
It had to ring eight times

143
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:10,679
Then the caller hung up
and redialled immediately

144
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,159
Only then could we pick up
the phone

145
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,259
That was how my father's
clients called him

146
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,019
My father was an electronics engineer
at Tallinn Polytechnic

147
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,719
But he earned much more for
building Finnish TV converters

148
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,214
He built them at home, in his room
with heavy brown curtains drawn

149
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:35,793
I think all of father's colleagues
were building these blocks

150
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,159
The ideological virus spreading fast
from the West worries Moscow

151
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,613
The evil hand of the CIA
is seen behind every move

152
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:52,814
"TUPLA chocolate bar -
enough for two"

153
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,839
Soviet propaganda
fires back fiercely

154
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,439
In the State House of Political Education...

155
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,719
a room for the methods of
counterpropaganda is established

156
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,119
There, every propagandist can
quickly get a clear and...

157
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,696
in-depth overview of the methods
of counterpropaganda

158
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,119
In the Soviet films of our childhood...

159
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,619
the American secret services cruelly
hunt innocent Soviet people

160
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,399
The KGB gets a new leader,
Yuri Andropov, who is...

161
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,759
the man behind the bloody
suppression of the Prague Spring

162
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,039
He is a tough leader...

163
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,279
in control of the biggest
secret service in the world...

164
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,472
with thousands of agents
in hundreds of countries

165
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,479
Somewhere here,
in the KGB headquarters...

166
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,559
there is a special task force
for fighting the Western influence

167
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,779
They are responsible for what
goes on in our heads

168
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,419
Moscow sends a high KGB officer to head
a special committee inspecting Estonia

169
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,279
Secretly, a group of Estonian sociologists
are assigned to the committee

170
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,159
They are led by Hagi Shein, who,
as fate would have it...

171
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,259
later becomes the head of Estonian TV

172
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,319
It was a secret study designed to...

173
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,999
observe the Estonian viewers'
attitude towards Finnish TV

174
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,850
Especially young people's attitude

175
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,914
Finnish TV had become the most
watched channel in Estonia

176
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,719
The results were definitely worrisome
for the ideologists in Moscow

177
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,939
It bothered them,
it called for counteraction

178
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,899
Moscow sends orders to drown out
the Finnish TV signal

179
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,759
More and more TV masts
are built in Estonia...

180
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,969
bombing the waves with
Soviet programming

181
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,019
Our home coast, the southern
coast of the Gulf of Finland...

182
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,939
one of the most beautiful
places in the world...

183
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,000
has become the front line
of the Cold War!

184
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,359
But the American response
is clever

185
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,439
They are ready to bring out their new,
invisible weapon

186
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:53,679
Behind it, there was a skilled,
even genius, tactical plan...

187
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,159
for breaking up the Communist Bloc

188
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,439
Georgi Potcheptsov is a renowned
expert on ideological warfare

189
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,774
He has thoroughly researched
the methods of the Americans

190
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,233
Americans did a lot of work
with deflectors and tourists

191
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,231
You're a Soviet spy?
- No!

192
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,859
They were trying to understand
the nature of the Soviet person

193
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,430
Their minds were studied and
analysed to find a way inside

194
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,631
And it was found!

195
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,799
I have met people who have met
the head of CIA

196
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,319
Their plans were very precise...

197
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,439
regarding the means to use
in conquering the viewer

198
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,999
The chosen battlefield was what is now
known as "soft power"'

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,710
It was television, popular culture

200
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,479
There's the hard, forceful
power, like a tank...

201
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,711
and there's soft, entertaining
power, like a film

202
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,559
Finnish TV shows "Ninotchka"...

203
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,319
a feature film starring
the marvellous Greta Garbo

204
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,679
It is a story about
a female Soviet commissary...

205
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,959
who falls in love with
an American...

206
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,596
and betrays
the Communist ideals

207
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,439
For Moscow, showing that film
is a direct anti-Soviet act

208
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,679
So much so that the heads
of Finnish TV...

209
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,117
are called to Moscow
for a very serious talk

210
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,879
The Soviet Estonian party leaders
have their own suggestion...

211
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,039
a device should be developed...

212
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,399
to create captions for
Finnish broadcasts...

213
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,770
to overthrow the false
information! For example:

214
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,959
Disinformation! Champagne has been
produced in the USSR since 1928

215
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,979
That plan is found to be "at present,
impossible to carry out"

216
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,999
Or, to put it more simply,
nonsense

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,739
But the threat of the Russians
jamming the TV waves remains

218
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,479
By that time, Finnish TV has become
one of the main cracks...

219
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,371
for soft power to seep into
the Soviet Union unhindered

220
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,639
In Estonia, the underground
production of Finnish TV guides...

221
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,979
is a growing business
- At 7:40...

222
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,879
My grandfather had a friend
from wartime, Endel...

223
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,479
who worked in the district committee
(Endel) Did you get that?

224
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,879
My grandfather was
a school headmaster...

225
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,959
and he had a typing machine
in his office

226
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,079
So Endel gave the TV guide
to my grandfather...

227
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,479
and my mother got
a typed copy from him

228
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,999
Mother worked in a hospital

229
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,239
In the evenings, I helped her to
copy the Finnish TV guides

230
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,559
My mother sold them at work
for one rouble a piece...

231
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,575
I got 10 kopecks for each copy

232
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,159
Because of these TV guides,
I was a made man at school

233
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,879
At one point, we pulled a prank
with a couple of friends

234
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,150
I typed into the TV guides...

235
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:11,751
"Sex film at 2 AM"

236
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,979
I don't know if it's true...

237
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,468
but there were rumours of
many lit windows that night

238
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:30,919
The fight for the souls of our
generation begins in 1975

239
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,539
Although many of us
aren't born yet

240
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,269
The western countries make
a clever deal with the Russians

241
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,119
Today, the Soviet delegation
arrives in the Finnish capital...

242
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,359
to participate in the final stage...

243
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,199
of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe

244
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,679
The delegation is led by
comrade Leonid Brezhnev...

245
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,659
the Secretary General
of the Communist Party of USSR

246
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,079
The other members
of the delegation are...

247
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,179
Here, Brezhnev is signing
the Helsinki Agreement

248
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,319
The areas of influence of the sides
of the Cold War are laid out

249
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,219
The Western countries promise...

250
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,579
not to meddle with the Soviet
sphere of influence

251
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,819
In return, the USSR promises
not to jam the TV waves

252
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,397
The hook has been swallowed!

253
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,559
The Soviet Union probably thought
that the borders were now sealed

254
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,759
But, instead, they started to crack -
with more freedom of speech...

255
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,558
and other citizens' rights

256
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,990
Disco has become very popular
among the young people

257
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:55,991
But adults find this
dance move difficult

258
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,039
And then, one night, they showed
these moves on Finnish TV

259
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,959
One, two, three, four.
Let's lift our knees

260
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,669
And now, let's... disco!

261
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,514
Now, disco was everywhere,
including our school

262
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,452
These songs were stuck
in our heads...

263
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,332
and they were about love and
relationships

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,399
The news about the western dance
disease spreading in Estonia...

265
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,879
quickly reached Moscow

266
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,474
But this time,
nothing was done about it

267
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,518
Honour to our Leninist Party!

268
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,959
Andropov's cunning plan is launched

269
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,119
It is obvious that Brezhnev
is fading fast

270
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,799
Long live peace!

271
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,439
Behind Brezhnev's back, there's
a fierce struggle for power

272
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,239
Trouble on the ideological front...

273
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,679
is a trump card in the hands
of Andropov's KGB men

274
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,279
The horrified leader of Soviet Estonia
is scared for his own skin

275
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,519
He dashes to Moscow to assure...

276
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,751
that he will take control
of the situation himself

277
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,999
The men in power have a very
clear plan

278
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,239
The disco epidemic must be tamed

279
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,479
The racoon must become a poodle!

280
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,639
We have many neologisms
from the word "disco"

281
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,719
They've already become rooted...

282
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,639
just like a tree planted by a DJ

283
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,239
In every corner of the country...

284
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,719
activists from the Soviet
youth group Komsomol...

285
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,299
are told to master
the enemy's moves

286
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,809
A sexy form, but filled with
Soviet content

287
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,919
So, what are the problems
with disco dancing?

288
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,759
First of all, we are
reinventing the wheel here

289
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,079
Disco is danced all over the world,
but we didn't hear of it...

290
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,355
nor see what the others were doing

291
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,019
Alas, these moves are too late!

292
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,318
The rhythm of the times
is completely different

293
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,879
The Soviet Union attacks Afghanistan

294
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,777
Their relationship with the West
becomes very strained

295
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,999
In order to reinforce the home front...

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,551
the puppet rulers of the small
Soviet Republics are replaced

297
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,079
Moscow appoints a new
Party Secretary for Estonia

298
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,239
His name is Karl Vaino.
An old railroad man

299
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,979
He has to direct the local life
back onto the iron rails

300
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,279
And so, here's our generation
marching in front of the cameras

301
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,679
With paper flowers
and Estonian folk costumes

302
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,616
We are waving to Karl Vaino
and he is waving back

303
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,954
Instead of disco, the TV shows
a completely different dance

304
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,037
But somewhere far away,
there is a war raging

305
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,919
Karl Vaino makes his first visit
to Finland

306
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,351
An enormous bronze Lenin
is erected there

307
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,359
Everyone has a sour smile
on their face

308
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,377
Soviet Union is marking
its area of influence

309
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,479
But above that area,
through houses and cities...

310
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,110
over land and sea, the TV waves
float - uncaught!

311
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,139
At the beginning...

312
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,299
not all the villagers understood
what I was talking about

313
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,279
But in about one month...

314
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,759
they started asking questions
in the shop queue, like:

315
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,594
"So, what's new in 'Dallas'?"

316
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,359
When it snowed during winter...

317
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,519
I ran from house to house
with Jaak's letters...

318
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,879
and everywhere, my visit was
long awaited

319
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,239
Everyone wanted to know
what had happened in "Dallas"

320
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,879
And so I told them

321
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,299
Those, who were worthy

322
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,098
J.R. wants to prove to the judges that
Sue Ellen is an alcoholic

323
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,399
The sun is shining
and people are happy

324
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,632
A football game takes place,
followed by a rock concert

325
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,439
And then,
a proper youth riot...

326
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,279
against life in the ridiculous
Soviet Union...

327
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,690
something that Karl Vaino
has come to symbolise

328
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,239
The militia beats the rioters apart

329
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,999
The culprits are looked for
and found

330
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,039
Naturally, it is all the
punk rockers' fault

331
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,319
But how do the young people
in Soviet Estonia know...

332
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,535
how to be a punk rocker?
They've seen it on Finnish TV!

333
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,399
And whose fault is it that young
people watch Finnish...

334
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,079
rather than Soviet Estonian TV?

335
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,059
Naturally, the management
of Estonian Television

336
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,839
Here they are

337
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,497
They are ordered to come up
with measures against Finnish TV

338
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,959
The Programme Director,
Voldemar Lindstrom...

339
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,399
is called to Party headquarters...

340
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,179
and for starters, he gets
a harsh talking-to

341
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,639
Finnish TV was naturally
a headache for Party leaders

342
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:15,852
Estonian media was blamed for not fighting
against it with necessary means...

343
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:19,679
and for not spreading
different information

344
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,879
Now, "the necessary means"'
have to be found

345
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,519
The Party officials' plan
is this:

346
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,559
Estonian TV is watched
both here and in Finland...

347
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,439
so our channel should make
everyone believe...

348
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,159
how wonderful the life
in Soviet Estonia really is

349
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,191
It should take centre stage
in its full glory

350
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,739
The school uniform consists
of a skirt and a jacket...

351
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,119
And indeed, Estonian shows do
become popular in Finland...

352
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,499
but in an unexpected way

353
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,776
It becomes source material for
several Finnish humour shows

354
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:14,400
(mocking jabber imitating a Soviet
official speaking Estonian)

355
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,619
Karl Vaino decides that such
mockery must end

356
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,619
A full-scale campaign against
Finnish TV begins

357
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,799
Vaino fires the first shots
of this war in Moscow...

358
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,799
at the Congress of the
Communist Party:

359
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,079
Due to its geographical situation...

360
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,239
Estonia is in the front line
of the ideological battle

361
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,219
In a place, where the fire of
anti-Soviet propaganda is fierce

362
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,259
Lately, the acts of the
ideological enemy...

363
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,839
have turned especially cruel and
mean!

364
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,515
It's psychological warfare!

365
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,114
Spring. The last episode of the
season. J.R. is alone in his office

366
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,459
Someone enters

367
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,959
Two shots!
J.R. falls down

368
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,916
End credits.
Who shot J.R.?

369
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,639
I posted a letter to Urve...

370
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,079
and promised to continue writing
in the autumn

371
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,334
Then I went to Young Pioneer camp,
like every summer

372
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,909
I got Jaak's last letter.
He wrote that J.R. has been shot

373
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:53,019
He grabbed his heart and fell.
There was blood...

374
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,239
But I couldn't tell the villagers
that...

375
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,079
nothing's going to happen
before the autumn

376
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,659
Everyone was so eager to
hear about it

377
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:07,217
And so I made up my own version
of what happened

378
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,179
Specialists confirm that...

379
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,412
the primary targets were the minds
of Soviet Estonian children

380
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,299
There are very interesting
CIA documents...

381
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,599
about the work to be done
with the youth

382
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,099
One very important thing
they considered was that...

383
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,415
that in 1985, a new generation
will enter the stage

384
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,952
Here, our generation runs to the stage
with flowers for Karl Vaino

385
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,139
We have no idea that...

386
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,139
a cunning plan is being hatched
at Party headquarters

387
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,299
The secret order signed by Vaino
mentions...

388
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,099
"the measures for neutralising the
influence of bourgeois television..."

389
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,859
"on the inhabitants of the Republic"

390
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,359
In this document, they shoot at
Finnish TV without aiming

391
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,179
The city and district committees
of the Communist Party...

392
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,179
as well as the other
central offices...

393
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,179
should make it their main task
to battle the...

394
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:42,879
politically hostile influence of
bourgeois TV

395
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,539
Strict orders and prohibitions
pour onto us from Vaino's offices...

396
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,735
like ice cold rain

397
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,339
When I was in the third grade...

398
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,219
my grandfather was taken to
the hospital with a floating kidney

399
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,131
My business went downhill

400
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,819
My grandfather was treated
at Karl Marx hospital, where...

401
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,339
the Finnish converters
were removed from TV sets

402
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,355
The same was probably done
in all state facilities

403
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,039
Grandfather said that's why
his kidney stopped floating...

404
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,173
it got so boring at the hospital
he just had to get back home

405
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,659
The countermeasures became
quite strange

406
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,139
For example, the Party's
attempts to remove...

407
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:50,351
antennas directed at Finland
from Tallinn's rooftops

408
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,979
This seemingly ordinary man,
Nikolai...

409
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,739
is one of the first victims
of the evil campaign

410
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,259
One fine morning, there are
some comrades with a saw...

411
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,379
on the roof of his home

412
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,979
They left one antenna standing
and took away the rest

413
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,353
They had been ordered to
"just take them all down"

414
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,659
We didn't have much to watch here

415
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,339
The Estonian films or
war movies from Russian TV

416
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,339
How long can you watch those?

417
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,179
I wanted to see what was
happening abroad

418
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,216
Finnish TV brought the
rest of the world to us

419
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,539
Important men, somewhere high up,
had no idea that...

420
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,099
they have acquired a
rather dangerous enemy

421
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,139
Nikolai happens to be
a passionate inventor

422
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,859
Soon, a counter-plan is born
in a kitchen

423
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,896
But we will get there...

424
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,099
Long meetings are held
and reports written...

425
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,939
about the battle
against Finnish TV

426
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,338
Especially in the regions where
Finnish TV can't be seen

427
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,579
Where it can be seen,
the meetings are shorter...

428
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,779
in order to make it to home
to watch Finnish TV

429
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:21,457
Brezhnev's Soviet Union has already
split into parallel realities

430
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,619
The devastating news about
the great loss to our country...

431
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:40,379
and to the Communist Party
hit the collective farmers very hard

432
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:46,619
For us, agricultural workers,
it was a particularly painful loss

433
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,659
Let us not forget that
it was Leonid Brezhnev...

434
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,579
under whose leadership
and direction...

435
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,732
the objectives for the agricultural
industry were devised...

436
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,800
It is 12:45 and...

437
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,499
...the coffin was lowered
into the grave

438
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,779
After the demise of Brezhnev...

439
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,695
the way to power is
finally open for Andropov

440
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:38,999
Dear comrades! Let me thank you
from the bottom of my heart...

441
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,019
The Soviet Union rediscovers
an old truth...

442
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,372
things aren't advancing because
people are stupid and lazy

443
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,590
An era of fervent campaigning begins

444
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,359
As a result of one of these
campaigns...

445
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,239
a People's Militia is compiled
of ordinary people

446
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,979
They patrol the streets at night
for aimless wanderers, drunks...

447
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,719
or thieves of public property

448
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,559
Dear members of the People's Militia

449
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:42,675
The patrol's mission for
today is this: we've planned...

450
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:47,319
Nikolai and thousands of
others have started...

451
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,639
building TV antennas
from junkyard scraps

452
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,799
I built my first antenna
for my own TV

453
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,539
Just find an iron pipe, I already
had a welding machine

454
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,399
I did have to steal
some pieces of pipe

455
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,755
That's how it all started

456
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:15,239
First, you needed a copper pipe

457
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,279
It was an interesting time,
an era of 'do it yourself'

458
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,439
First, I made one for myself.
Then, one for a friend

459
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,752
Then for a friend of a friend,
and so it went on

460
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,279
There were plenty of orders

461
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,292
After a while, I was mass producing
antennas

462
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,111
This is me, Toomas. Here's
me at home and here, at school

463
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,179
Those are the two places,
where I spend most of my time

464
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,959
After school, the children
whose parents worked late...

465
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,159
were taken to the grass field
by the school...

466
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,559
and told to form football teams

467
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,990
Usually, I was a reserve player

468
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,519
My mother was part of
the People's Militia

469
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,599
They were entitled to buy things
from the factory cafeteria...

470
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,959
that were not available in stores:

471
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,159
canned peas, frankfurters
and tangerines

472
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,079
In the evenings,
mother patrolled on the streets...

473
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,519
I was allowed to watch TV
until quarter to ten...

474
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,632
then I had to wash my teeth
and go to sleep

475
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,439
Sometimes, I watched a bit longer

476
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,152
I couldn't fall sleep anyway
before my mother came back

477
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,959
Across the gulf, in Helsinki...

478
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,039
electronics shops are being
bought out of one item:

479
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,679
microcircuits

480
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,719
What are people using
them for?

481
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,999
The time of colour television
has come...

482
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,359
and some enterprising Finns have
discovered a prosperous business

483
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,759
The chips, hidden in clothes or body cavities,
are smuggled to Estonia

484
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,279
Here, they are sold to scalpers
for a substantial profit

485
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,319
And they resell them to engineers
who use them for colour decoders

486
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,359
The chip was small, you could
fit 50 in one cigarette box...

487
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,919
and the currency rate between
Finnish marks and roubles...

488
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,659
was better with microchips
than with jeans

489
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,919
The Soviet customs officials
have to toughen up...

490
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,239
and start catching
the chip smugglers

491
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,199
"What are our Finnish guests up to?"
asks this propaganda film

492
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,039
Tallinn is the fourth most popular
destination in the USSR...

493
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,999
for tourists from capitalist
countries

494
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,999
Not all of them come here...

495
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,759
for their sincere interest
towards our way of life

496
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,199
A propagandist should never
forget this...

497
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,159
as he comes into contact with
foreigners every day

498
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:19,399
There is vileness, amorality and
an empty soul behind...

499
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:28,557
their superficial kindness.
That's the face of capitalism

500
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:32,658
Calling all law enforcement
officers!

501
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,939
Underground microchip sales
are prospering

502
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,576
An intensive campaign begins
to catch the speculators

503
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:46,677
- Hello
- Hello

504
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,799
One autumn evening in the early 1980's,
my father took me for a ride

505
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,759
He didn't say a word. We drove
somewhere in Mustamae district

506
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,479
I remember him constantly
glancing in the mirror

507
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,979
He parked the car away
from the entrance

508
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,859
I was to go in, take the elevator
to the 4th floor and...

509
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,720
ring the bell at
door number 45

510
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,479
That was how my father got
the chips to build new blocks

511
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,799
The man in a bathrobe
was a dealer

512
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,559
It was a strictly forbidden job

513
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,838
But that evening was
very important for me

514
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,350
Now, I was part of the same
secret society as my father

515
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,359
I wasn't allowed to talk about it
at school. And I didn't!

516
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,759
Hands on the table! Mouths shut!
Backs straight!

517
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,671
And what are you doing?

518
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:02,099
I took the no 7 trolley and
the no 26 bus home from school

519
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,671
But the other commuters
didn't know my true identity

520
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:13,539
In the autumn of 1984, Finnish TV
started showing "Knight Rider"

521
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,379
Just a few months later, it had
become an integral part of my life

522
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,071
It was about a car

523
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,919
With the push of a button, it
could jump over other cars

524
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,759
Michael Knight taught me to use
my watch to talk to cars

525
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,679
And I did talk...

526
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,859
to all 14 foreign cars I knew of
in Tallinn in those days

527
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,879
Dear members of the People's Militia

528
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,559
Three groups are heading
to residential areas

529
00:45:51,560 --> 00:46:01,259
Pay attention to cars and underage
persons gathering around them

530
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,399
There was a foreign car
in our yard too

531
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,375
A sailor had bought a Renault

532
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:12,119
It was the only car
that mattered

533
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,479
But one day, I saw a boy
from building no 37...

534
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,639
using his watch to talk
to MY car

535
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,076
I think I was quite upset

536
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,659
But soon enough,
everyone was doing it

537
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,474
All you needed was a digital watch

538
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,439
On February 9th, 1984, the Secretary
General of the Communist Party...

539
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,559
Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov,
passed away

540
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,159
The fervent campaigns end
just as suddenly as they started

541
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,754
Life goes back to normal

542
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,317
But the Americans are preparing
the final blow

543
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:29,453
First, as if by coincidence,
Finnish TV shows "Star Wars"

544
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,348
Of course, we, Estonian children,
are completely blown away

545
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:39,750
Flying saucers appear in
our asphalt drawings

546
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:42,959
This rare shot of a school play
shows...

547
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,379
the Soviet Estonian version of
Jedi Knights

548
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,999
There are hundreds of satellites
beeping above us in space

549
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,037
The superpowers have
their own star wars

550
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,220
Americans have challenged
the Russians

551
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:13,519
They launch satellites to destroy
the Soviet nuclear missiles

552
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,819
In return, the Russians want
to build missiles...

553
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,759
that penetrate the American
protective shield

554
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,779
But these missiles
are very expensive

555
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,632
The project had no connection
to reality. It was a daydream

556
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:34,639
The Soviet Union took the bait and
never caught up with America

557
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,719
I saw on TV that Michael Knight
visited Finland

558
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,188
It was the closest meeting we ever had

559
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,014
Estonians knew that soon,
there would be an atomic war

560
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,859
In the school hall, they showed
us films about atomic bombs...

561
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,499
and carried out bomb threat drills

562
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,879
Should an atomic bomb
fall on Tallinn...

563
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,359
we are to put on gas masks and
go to the school cloakroom

564
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,739
It doubled as our bomb shelter

565
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,599
Soon enough, a few of us
discover that...

566
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,299
if you push the filter of a
gas mask to your mouth...

567
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:28,519
you can make the sound of
Michael Knight's car, KITT

568
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,896
From then on, atomic war
seemed pretty cool to us

569
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:41,219
At the same time, the Soviet economy's
only focus is the military production

570
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,519
It is wise to hit the shops early
if you expect to get any goods

571
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,457
There's never enough of anything

572
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,819
Only canned squid and baranki
(dry bagels) are left

573
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:15,819
That's when we meet Vaiski -
the face of Finnish food ads

574
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,919
Meat counter ready for inspection
- Well, this is not an inspection

575
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,799
We're just looking at it
through the client's eyes

576
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,839
Oh, what a beautiful veal,
pork and lamb!

577
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,119
Vaiski and the army of
cutlets and steaks...

578
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,079
arrive on the front lines of the
Cold War during the hottest battle

579
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,999
For Estonians standing
in long queues...

580
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,799
Vaiski becomes nothing less
than a fairy tale hero

581
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,719
The message of the ad is an
effective propaganda weapon

582
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,079
"What good things will Vaiski
think up next?"

583
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,019
"A delicious roast. From a
particularly good fillet..."

584
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,479
The Estonian officials announce that...

585
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,239
the delicacies in the ads
are just plastic fakes and...

586
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,079
the Finns couldn't
afford them anyway

587
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,219
"The delightful sauce will
make your mouth water..."

588
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:11,233
And Mr Vaiski must be on the payroll
of the American secret service!

589
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,639
General Dreyfus of American
military intelligence has said:

590
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,519
"In the ideological battle
with Communists..."

591
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,157
"we do not need the truth,
we need subversion."

592
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,839
In addition to our good influence,
the influence of the Party...

593
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,599
there is another,
hostile influence...

594
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,479
continuously affecting
the Soviet people

595
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,759
We all know that they are
trying very hard to do this

596
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,799
The Finns were harshly criticised
for their "Americanness"

597
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,632
And we didn't know it was because
the Soviets felt genuinely threatened

598
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,799
LUNCH BREAK

599
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,079
The village talked of nothing
but "Dallas"

600
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,111
Even the band of the
collective farm sang about "Dallas"

601
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,919
But in the autumn,
the people of our village...

602
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,559
sent a joint letter to
Estonian Television and...

603
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,679
Party Central Committee,
stating that they have...

604
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,399
a collective farm with
record-breaking results...

605
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,879
a winner of the
Socialist Competition...

606
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,759
and wouldn't it be possible
to show "Dallas"...

607
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,719
on an Estonian
or Leningrad channel

608
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,959
It all led to very big trouble

609
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,919
A commission from the District
Committee came to investigate

610
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,119
People were questioned,
a meeting held, fingers pointed...

611
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,239
and it was explained to the people...

612
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,759
that this was not proper
entertainment for Soviet people

613
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,919
The head of the village board and...

614
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,137
the Pioneer leader
of the school were replaced

615
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,839
So we heard nothing more
about Dallas

616
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,639
I still waited for Jaak's letters,
but he had taken up football...

617
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,219
and didn't have time
to write anymore

618
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,275
I still have some of his old letters

619
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,239
An anonymous engineer writes
a letter to a newspaper

620
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,559
He recommends building
a gigantic metallic net...

621
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,319
in the gulf between
Estonia and Finland...

622
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,414
that would catch
the Finnish TV waves

623
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,999
Vaino likes the idea very much

624
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,949
The management of Estonian TV is
called to Party headquarters

625
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,379
As always, the meeting starts
with a harsh talking-to

626
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,139
They were very stern
and direct

627
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,279
We thought that they will shoot us
on the spot

628
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,839
Vaino was clear that
a system has to be built...

629
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:08,015
to prevent hostile channels
from spreading in Estonia

630
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,079
The TV management tries
to convince Vaino that...

631
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:19,900
such a net would be complicated,
expensive and still useless

632
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:32,439
Engineers suggested building the
net on an island in the Gulf...

633
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:41,020
to make it hundreds of meters tall,
so it could block the Finnish TV signal

634
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,799
An overall anxiety spreads

635
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,319
Among others,
Nikolai prepares for resistance

636
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,159
It is time to build a simple
but efficient invention:

637
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,539
A mercury antenna!

638
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:01,799
You had to cut off the tip
of a thermometer...

639
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:10,519
insert a hairline thread into the
tube of mercury

640
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:21,680
You push it into the mercury
and pull back a bit

641
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:25,959
Then you connect the thread
to your TV set

642
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:33,159
It receives the signal much better
than an ordinary antenna

643
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:40,559
But it jams the reception of other
receivers in a 3-5 km radius

644
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:48,259
Next to us, there was a missile
base with two nuclear warheads

645
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,899
It was inspected and
guarded very well

646
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,159
As soon as the antenna
starts to jam the waves...

647
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:03,253
they will try to locate
the source. And they'll find it

648
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,837
Then you had to quickly
unplug the antenna

649
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,159
The thermometer fever
spreads fast

650
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,869
The pharmacies of Tallinn are
emptied of their thermometer stocks

651
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,039
65 kopecks a piece

652
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,939
The authorities claim it is
due to a flu outburst...

653
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,859
but in fact, it was
a different kind of epidemic

654
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,919
Even more, the virus from Estonia...

655
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,357
spreads quickly
all over the Soviet Union

656
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,359
In many cities, videotapes with
Finnish subtitles are discovered

657
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,879
The narrator with the nasal voice
becomes famous

658
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,879
He sits in a basement
somewhere in Leningrad...

659
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,735
and dubs these films
into Russian

660
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,999
Hollywood movies reach
Estonia via Finnish TV

661
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,559
and from Estonia they spread
all over the Soviet Union...

662
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,658
from Lithuania to Turkmenistan

663
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,519
It would have been easy
to arrest The Nasal Man

664
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,672
But he remained free, so we know
that wasn't the authorities' plan

665
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:44,379
True enough, the real plan was
far bigger

666
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,839
Later studies claim that
for decades...

667
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:55,019
Soviet Estonia had been a
secret laboratory of the KGB

668
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,439
They researched what will
happen to a Soviet citizen...

669
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,154
when flooded with
hostile propaganda

670
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:13,139
In some areas, detailed
experiments were carried out

671
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:19,856
How else could they research
the impact of this sort of thing?

672
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:22,959
This explains the regular
TV audience surveys...

673
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,839
that were forbidden elsewhere
in the Soviet Union

674
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,719
These surveys can be compared to
obtaining intelligence data from...

675
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,330
a social environment in order
to create new weapons

676
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,119
Karl Vaino, who knew nothing
about the secret laboratory...

677
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,519
has been led to complain, to weep...

678
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,519
and conduct powerless campaigns
against Finnish TV

679
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,199
Soviet authorities did possess the
technology to block Finnish TV signals

680
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,199
Radio-technologically, the Soviet Union
was a very powerful country

681
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,879
The jamming transmitters would have
been produced in military plants...

682
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,413
and installed without any involvement
from Estonian technicians

683
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:17,839
We, Estonian children, have been
the KGB's lab rats for years

684
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,439
They've been preparing us
with the help of Finnish TV

685
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,479
We are meant to be the new
generation of Soviet spies...

686
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,439
raised amidst the influence of
western popular culture

687
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,958
But the deadly virus has
broken out of the lab

688
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:42,479
By the mid-1980s,
the KGB realises that...

689
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,013
the "soft power" of pop culture
is overpowering the regime

690
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,519
Furthermore, the empire is
falling apart at the seams

691
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,879
The price of oil dropped below
prime cost. Soviet Union earns less

692
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,035
The Space Race ate resources.
The result was an economic collapse

693
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:40,131
The memory of Konstantin
Chemenko will last forever

694
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,199
On the verge of collapsing,
the USSR starts...

695
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,959
to warm relations
with the Americans

696
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,879
The new leader of the
bankrupt country, Gorbachev...

697
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,399
must save the little
that's left to save

698
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,999
Meanwhile, the ever deluded
Karl Vaino relies on an old trick:

699
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,319
when the end is near,
act like everything is fine

700
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,959
We, the veterans of the
army and the Party...

701
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,192
are convinced that you,
our young friends...

702
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:22,430
will carry on the flag of peace,
good will and Communism

703
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,879
Instead of folk costumes,
the lab rats are now...

704
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,199
wearing parachute satchels
and we're marching

705
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,234
But there is an air of spring
and decay around us

706
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,879
That spring I decided...

707
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,639
I will not wear blue socks
and brown sandals

708
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,039
I will not!

709
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,459
The teacher sent me home
because of my sneakers

710
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,599
But I don't care

711
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,039
It's May. School's almost
out and summer will begin

712
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,239
But not just any summer,
THE summer

713
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,478
In 52 days, Finnish TV
will show "Emmanuelle"

714
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,499
It is a famous erotic movie

715
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,419
Fresh out of the hospital...

716
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,639
my grandfather sent
a cake box to his friends

717
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,479
Guess what was inside?

718
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,574
Yes, a Finnish TV block
made by my father

719
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:36,119
Meanwhile, Gorbachev is
on a world tour, like a pop star

720
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,319
His perestroika movement
has to demolish...

721
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,711
the harsh image of the Soviet Union

722
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,559
In Finland, Misha is welcomed
like an old friend

723
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,271
The nightmare is fading

724
01:02:55,272 --> 01:03:01,279
A lot of time has passed since the last
Soviet leader visited Finland

725
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,239
There's a feeling of change
in the air

726
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,319
Then, Gorbachev
flies to Tallinn

727
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,379
The meeting begins with
a harsh talking-to

728
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:18,599
My friend Karl Vaino tells me that
everything is fine in Estonia

729
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:24,319
But I know better. The leaders
have lost touch with the people

730
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,719
They are cooped up in their offices
and that leads to mistakes

731
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,059
They want to control everything

732
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,419
Even the customary kisses
now seem cold

733
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,199
Maybe this is when Gorbachev
whispers to Vaino...

734
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,518
that the expensive net in
the Gulf is a definite no-go

735
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:52,029
The visit is carried out
with bitter smiles

736
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:14,378
This is me, Jaak. It's summer and I'm
at Young Pioneer camp again

737
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:20,699
In the mornings, they woke
us with a blaring fanfare

738
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,839
You had to dress very quickly

739
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,399
Nobody knew why we
had to hurry...

740
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,799
because afterwards we
just lazed around

741
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,259
But even in my sleepy haze,
I knew: it's June 24

742
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,499
The day has arrived!

743
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,151
That evening, Finnish TV
will show "Emmanuelle"

744
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,893
Our relatives in
Southern Estonia...

745
01:04:46,894 --> 01:04:50,719
start driving to Tallinn
early in the morning

746
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,271
By lunchtime, only children and
old ladies were left in the South

747
01:04:56,272 --> 01:05:02,219
The rest headed to Tallinn
in their cars

748
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:06,659
Because in Tallinn you see
Finnish TV

749
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,919
By 4:15 PM, there are
112 cars parked...

750
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,299
on the football ground
next to our school

751
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,839
The sum of the licence plate
numbers is even for 63 cars...

752
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:25,590
and odd for 49 cars. There are
no foreign cars, only Russian

753
01:05:25,591 --> 01:05:28,671
The Polish Fiat doesn't count

754
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:31,399
Mother says that there must be...

755
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,312
a big party or song festival
somewhere

756
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,319
Today, we are making
nest boxes for starlings

757
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,499
The sides have to be sawed
into neat pieces...

758
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,859
and a hole drilled into
the front board

759
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,919
We are supervised by
our teacher

760
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,869
But when we look at each
other, we start giggling...

761
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,619
Dear members of the People's Militia

762
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:05,710
The patrol's mission for
today is this...

763
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,919
In the evening,
the streets are empty

764
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,450
Just a few pigeons... and
my mom patrolling somewhere

765
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:18,851
KVASS (bread drink)

766
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:27,119
"But everyone is watching it," I say.
"Not everyone," says my mom

767
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,219
"For instance, you will not
watch it"

768
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,657
I got even by not brushing
my teeth that night

769
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,799
At 10 o'clock, everyone goes to
brush their teeth

770
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,679
Half past 10,
it's bed call

771
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:54,159
Usually, we tell jokes
and giggle. But not today

772
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,919
On the other side of the wall,
in the teacher's lounge...

773
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,688
a TV is on.
Everyone is waiting

774
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,532
Suddenly, I realised
how this world works

775
01:08:00,533 --> 01:08:05,759
There are those who only get
a few coins for a TV guide...

776
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,979
and then those who get the
crisp banknotes

777
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,479
Those who fetch the cake box
from the dealer...

778
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,659
and then those who sell its
content for 400 roubles

779
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:25,597
And I didn't want to be
the loser any more

780
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,519
The TV signal was so weak that...

781
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,659
I decided to try out the
mercury antenna

782
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:00,997
It worked for me, but messed
up the neighbours' TV

783
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:05,939
As soon as I plugged it in,
they lost reception

784
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:11,039
I could watch for 30 min before a
jeep from the missile base arrived

785
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,239
So I unplugged the antenna

786
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,819
When the jeep left, I
plugged the antenna back in

787
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:27,511
Of course I kept watching

788
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,959
They said that if we
jam their radars...

789
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,399
they may accidentally
launch something...

790
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,052
and when that baby is out,
who knows what will happen

791
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,159
The atomic war doesn't
break out just then

792
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,893
Luckily enough, the erotic movie
ends before that

793
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,553
For some reason, I woke up
at 12:42 PM

794
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,954
It was light outside

795
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:34,232
I thought that war had broken out
and my mom's on the frontlines

796
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:38,519
But then I saw it - hundreds
of cigarettes glowing...

797
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:46,052
like fireflies on every balcony
of the opposing houses

798
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,899
A kind of bomb had been dropped
on Estonia and it ended the Cold War

799
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:05,156
The bliss of freedom soon
spreads all over the country

800
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:24,109
The Soviet Union surrenders
quickly and entirely

801
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:29,473
Only the men in fur hats
wave from the sinking ship

802
01:11:29,474 --> 01:11:33,119
But not all of them go
down with the sinking ship

803
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,918
Some of them have
their life boats ready

804
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,695
There are theories about the
KGB destroying the system...

805
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:15,299
just to be able to rebuild it again

806
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:24,999
Today's actions were actually
planned way back then

807
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:32,420
Loyal Vaino is not one of
the chosen few

808
01:12:32,421 --> 01:12:38,400
He gives up his post
in the summer of 1988

809
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:42,639
He immediately heads to Moscow
where he's still happily retired

810
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,139
He has never visited Estonia
during these 20 years and...

811
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:51,119
has given only one interview,
to a German TV journalist

812
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,079
"When did you realise that Estonia
would become independent...

813
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,479
and this process couldn't
be overturned?"

814
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:05,599
I believe that it's connected to
Finnish TV

815
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,079
People saw that life was
more free elsewhere...

816
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,277
that others had more
opportunities...

817
01:13:14,278 --> 01:13:19,479
their standard of life
was higher than in Estonia

818
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,490
They asked, "How can that be?"

819
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:27,380
"How can they have all that
in a rotting capitalism?"

820
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:35,035
That got people thinking

821
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:48,159
Despite being forbidden, there
were antennas on every balcony

822
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:55,025
Banning them made no difference

823
01:14:02,235 --> 01:14:08,300
Long live the workers of
the Soviet Union! Hurray!

824
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:11,800
And so we marched
to a song festival...

825
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:14,459
holding paper flowers and
wearing folk costumes

826
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,999
But we weren't waving to Karl
Vaino and he wasn't waving back

827
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,590
We were waving to ourselves,
in a completely different era

828
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:05,091
Urve, Joosep, Jaak and Toomas are
now leading completely ordinary lives

829
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:10,020
9 months after Finnish TV showed
"Emmanuelle", the birth rate in Estonia
soared to a high

830
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:12,930
There have been 37 sequels
to "Emmanuelle"

831
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:16,900
Nikolai works on a ship travelling
between Estonia and Finland

832
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,950
He has yet to patent his
mercury antenna

833
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:23,920
J.R. was shot by his mistress,
but he survived

834
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:28,500
The final episode of "Dallas"
aired in 1991 - the same year
the Soviet Union disappeared

835
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:33,558
The Cold War resumed after
a short break
