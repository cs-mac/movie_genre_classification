00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,606
<i>( orchestral music</i> <i>playing )</i>

2
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:02,575
<i>At rare intervals</i>
<i>there appears among us</i>

3
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:05,077
<i>A person</i> <i>whose virtues</i>

4
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,370
<i>Are so</i> <i>manifest to all,</i>

5
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,455
<i>Who has</i> <i>such a capacity</i>

6
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:12,268
<i>For relating to every sort</i>
<i>of human being,</i>

7
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,706
<i>Who so subordinates</i>
<i>his own ego drives</i>

8
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,313
<i>To the concerns</i> <i>of others,</i>

9
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:21,021
<i>Who lives his whole life</i>
<i>in such Harmony</i>

10
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:23,836
<i>With the prevailing</i>
<i>standards of the community</i>

11
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:26,025
<i>That he is revered</i> <i>and loved</i>

12
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:29,880
<i>By everyone with whom</i>
<i>he comes in contact.</i>

13
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:34,778
<i>Such a man</i>
<i>Dalton Trumbo was not.</i>

14
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>( crowd chuckles )</i>

15
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,224
During the second world war

16
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,976
277 members of the guild
entered the armed services

17
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,061
To fight what was then called

18
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,978
The war against fascism.

19
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,938
Five of them did not come back.

20
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,002
Within six years
43 of those who did return

21
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,087
Were denounced
as un-American,

22
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,484
Stripped of their
names and passports

23
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,193
And blacklisted.

24
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:20,320
I presume that over half
of our members

25
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,612
Have no memory
of that blacklist

26
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:25,115
Because they were children
when it began

27
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:27,824
Or not yet born.

28
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,055
To them I would say only this:

29
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,786
That the blacklist

30
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:39,079
Was a time of evil

31
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,996
And that no one
on either side who survived it

32
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:46,166
Came through untouched by evil.

33
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,250
Caught in the situation
that had passed

34
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,897
Beyond the control
of mere individuals,

35
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,607
Each person reacted
as his nature,

36
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:57,421
His needs, his convictions

37
00:03:57,422 --> 00:04:00,234
And his
particular circumstances

38
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:02,736
Compelled him to.

39
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,133
There was bad Faith and good,

40
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:08,050
Honesty and dishonesty

41
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,239
Courage and cowardice,

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,427
Selflessness and opportunism,

43
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,450
Wisdom and stupidity,
good and bad

44
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,430
On both sides.

45
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:20,348
And almost every
individual involved,

46
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:22,954
No matter where he stood,

47
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,350
Combined some or all

48
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,435
Of these antithetical qualities

49
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:31,811
In his own person,
in his own acts.

50
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:34,835
Interviewer:
<i>Dalton Trumbo... he's a very</i>
<i>distinguished film writer.</i>

51
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:37,127
<i>He's won academy awards.</i>
<i>He's a letter writer too.</i>

52
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,733
<i>And they're obstreperous.</i>
<i>They're funny.</i>

53
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,818
- <i>They're eloquent.</i>
- Trumbo: <i>Well, I suppose so.</i>

54
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:43,797
Interviewer:
<i>And so these letters</i>
<i>that you wrote</i>

55
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:47,028
<i>Dealing with yourself,</i>
<i>your independence,</i>
<i>your stubbornness...</i>

56
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,737
Trumbo:
<i>Words are lost on the air...</i>
<i>the spoken word.</i>

57
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:53,072
<i>You never know</i>
<i>really what you said</i>
<i>in the last conversation,</i>

58
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,156
<i>Whereas if you sit down</i>
<i>and write</i>

59
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,866
<i>A concise definition</i>
<i>of your problem,</i>

60
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,847
<i>It commands</i>
<i>the man's attention.</i>

61
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:02,347
Interviewer:
<i>So your letters</i>
<i>to all variety of people,</i>

62
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:04,327
<i>Friends and enemies</i>

63
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:07,870
<i>In 1942 to 1962,</i>

64
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,684
<i>You almost tell us</i>
<i>the story of our country</i>

65
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,810
<i>Through the eyes</i>
<i>of this very stubborn man</i>
<i>Dalton Trumbo.</i>

66
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,729
Trumbo:
<i>It was very lively</i>
<i>two decades...</i>

67
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,334
<i>Very lively.</i>
<i>One was rarely bored.</i>

68
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,419
Interviewer:
<i>All your warts</i>
<i>are here too,</i>

69
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:24,024
<i>'cause you're pretty...</i>
<i>you're rough, you know,</i>
<i>at times.</i>

70
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:27,462
"warty warty"...
I prefer the word
"abrasive."

71
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:29,548
- <i>Abrasive.</i>
- <i>But "warty"</i>
<i>is just as good.</i>

72
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,528
Helen Manfull:
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>the correspondence</i>

73
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,507
<i>As a processor</i>

74
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:36,217
<i>At the Wisconsin center</i>
<i>for theater research.</i>

75
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,614
<i>And they were collecting</i>
<i>the materials</i>

76
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:41,427
Of the Hollywood 10.

77
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,033
One of the collections
that I got to process

78
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,221
Was the collection
of Dalton Trumbo...

79
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,931
Box upon box upon box.

80
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,308
It's the story
of an absolutely devoted

81
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,809
And passionate family man,

82
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,518
<i>Trumbo's love</i> <i>of his wife Cleo,</i>

83
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,500
<i>Of their</i> <i>three children.</i>

84
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,833
<i>It's the story</i> <i>of the blacklist</i>

85
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,919
<i>And what it did</i> <i>to people.</i>

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,420
<i>It also</i> <i>made me aware</i>

87
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,294
Of what it means

88
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,692
To be true to your principles

89
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,090
And to be willing
to stand up for what
you believe

90
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,382
No matter what
the consequences are.

91
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:19,257
Trumbo's this person

92
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:21,862
With an unbelievably strong
sense of Justice, you know,

93
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,364
And what's right.

94
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,449
And the letters for him

95
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,845
Are his, as it were, forum

96
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,555
To express that.

97
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,744
He was so opinionated
and so passionate

98
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,974
And so inventive
and sharp and funny

99
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:41,663
That you just didn't
win an argument with him.

100
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:45,416
He would be one of our heroes

101
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:48,229
Because he was an iconoclast.

102
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,564
He just plain was
a little grandiose, I think.

103
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,545
He wasn't confrontational
in the sense

104
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,420
He went out
looking for trouble.

105
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:56,984
It seemed to come to him.

106
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,171
Dalton was a contrarian,
you know.

107
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,152
He had fights.

108
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:05,111
I'm just glad he never
had a fight with me.

109
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:09,176
Trumbo:
<i>I think of myself</i>
<i>as an extremely peaceable man.</i>

110
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:13,136
<i>God knows I never wanted</i>
<i>to fight in my life,</i>

111
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:17,307
<i>But sometimes I think</i>
<i>they're forced upon</i>
<i>a peaceful man.</i>

112
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,665
My father
always had an ambition
to become a writer.

113
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,644
And once he gets started,

114
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,730
Publishing his first book

115
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,335
In 1933 or 1934,

116
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:39,399
By 1940 he's published
three novels,

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,484
<i>Won a national</i> <i>book award</i>

118
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,922
And written
about 20 screenplays.

119
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,008
And he's been nominated
for an Oscar also.

120
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,966
So he has, you know,
sort of a brilliant

121
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,427
Seven-years beginning.

122
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,822
Up to about 1945

123
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:58,053
<i>He was the highest-paid</i>
<i>screenwriter in Hollywood.</i>

124
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:02,221
<i>He had a contract</i>
<i>without a morality clause.</i>

125
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:05,036
He was very very successful.

126
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:07,641
Everybody wanted

127
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:10,559
To use the name
of Dalton Trumbo.

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,623
He probably was the best writer

129
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,916
At that time.

130
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,209
And then it all fell apart.

131
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,024
Newsreel announcer:
<i>In Washington, the committee</i>
<i>on un-American activities</i>

132
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,941
<i>Opens new hearings</i>
<i>in a jam-packed caucus room.</i>

133
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,025
<i>Here charges</i> <i>of red influence</i>

134
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,527
<i>Directed against</i>
<i>the motion picture industry</i>
<i>are aired.</i>

135
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,923
This committee
under its mandate

136
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:34,007
From the house
of representatives

137
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,613
Has the responsibility
of exposing

138
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:39,218
And spotlighting
subversive elements

139
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,095
Wherever they may exist.

140
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:44,637
McCarthy was seeing communists

141
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:47,764
In congress,

142
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:50,890
In the white house,
in the army,

143
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,851
And especially in
the movie industry,

144
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:59,227
And especially
with the writers.

145
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:02,666
Man:
<i>What about Mr. Dalton Trumbo?</i>
<i>Do you know Mr. Dalton Trumbo?</i>

146
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,752
Yes, I know
Mr. Trumbo.

147
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,461
<i>Mr. Trumbo was the editor</i>
<i>of the official</i>

148
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,441
- <i>Publication of the guild,</i>
<i>was he not?</i>
- Yes, that's true.

149
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:12,150
Yes, at one time
Dalton Trumbo was editor
of "the screenwriter,"

150
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,131
The monthly publication of
the screenwriters' guild.

151
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:16,111
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>that Dalton Trumbo</i>
<i>was a communist?</i>

152
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,507
Well, certainly I have
no information on that

153
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,593
Beyond what I've heard
here this week.

154
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,198
People joined
the communist party
because it was doing something.

155
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:25,387
It was an effective instrument.
It was doing things

156
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,782
That they felt should be done.

157
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:31,221
It was opposing
the rise of fascism

158
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:33,202
All through Europe.

159
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,328
It was helping those
who were refugees.

160
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:37,996
I remember as a kid

161
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:40,393
The conversations would be
about the soviet union.

162
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,644
<i>This was</i> <i>the depression.</i>

163
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,936
<i>The country was</i>
<i>in a depression.</i>

164
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:47,063
Socialism, communism
seemed like somewhat
of a solution

165
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,355
To everybody being out of work.

166
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,898
Russia had been our allies
through the early 1940s.

167
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,503
<i>And then all of a sudden</i>
<i>they became our enemy.</i>

168
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:57,485
It is my duty
to place before you

169
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,151
Certain facts

170
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,548
About the present
position in Europe.

171
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:05,091
An iron curtain has
descended across the continent.

172
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,385
Newsreel announcer:
<i>A growing struggle</i>
<i>between two great powers</i>

173
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,574
<i>To shape</i> <i>the postwar world.</i>

174
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,241
<i>On orders</i> <i>from the Kremlin</i>

175
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,012
<i>Russia had launched</i>
<i>one of history's</i>

176
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,618
<i>Most drastic political,</i>
<i>moral and economic wars...</i>

177
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,284
<i>A cold war.</i>

178
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,370
Trumbo:
<i>We were ready for war</i>

179
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:23,224
<i>And felt it was coming.</i>
<i>And people didn't want it,</i>

180
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,413
<i>But they were frightened.</i>

181
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,332
<i>And with the public</i>
<i>that frightened</i>

182
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,145
One can understand

183
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:33,542
How things like this
could happen.

184
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,315
If you want to scare a country,

185
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,544
You go after its royalty.
And Hollywood was our royalty.

186
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,838
<i>And they had two rounds</i>
<i>of witnesses.</i>

187
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,922
<i>And the first round</i> <i>were mostly</i>

188
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,632
<i>Either friendly witnesses</i>
<i>or executives.</i>

189
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,445
<i>The committee wanted</i>
<i>to bask in the publicity glow</i>

190
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:52,614
And fame of the stars
and of Hollywood.

191
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:55,635
This is a foul philosophy...
this communistic thing.

192
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:58,345
I would move
to the state of Texas
if it ever came here

193
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,743
Because I think that Texans
would kill them on sight.

194
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,201
( crowd laughs )

195
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,224
If I had my way about it
they'd all be sent back

196
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,828
To Russia or some other
unpleasant place.

197
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,538
<i>( applause,</i> <i>gavel pounds )</i>

198
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,352
I don't believe
it's a political party.

199
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,333
I believe
it's an un-American thing.

200
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:19,083
And I feel that they really
ought to be smoked out

201
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,065
And shown up for what they are

202
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,774
So that all the good
free causes in this country,

203
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,380
All the liberalisms
that really are American

204
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,090
Can go out without
the stain of communism.

205
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:33,465
And then they called...
I believe it was 19 people.

206
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,071
And eventually

207
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:38,572
It boiled down
to the Hollywood 10.

208
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,553
Trumbo:
<i>Well, we were called</i>
<i>originally</i>

209
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,845
<i>"the unfriendly 10."</i>

210
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,305
<i>And I like that</i> <i>much better.</i>

211
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:45,868
Interviewer:
<i>Unfriendly to what?</i>

212
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,849
Trumbo:
<i>To that committee</i>
<i>and to anybody else</i>

213
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,931
<i>Who interfered...</i>

214
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:53,267
<i>Who tried to force</i>
<i>a compulsory confession</i>

215
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,081
<i>Of beliefs, Faith,</i>
<i>anything else.</i>

216
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,190
An official purpose of theirs

217
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,898
Was to discover
communist propaganda

218
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,400
In the films that
these folks had written.

219
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,277
It's a fallacy to think
that they got

220
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,506
Overtly leftist themes
into films,

221
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:19,008
But as many scholars before me

222
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,196
Have noted quite elegantly,

223
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:23,176
What they did is

224
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:26,095
They were able to shift subtly

225
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,282
Some of the archetypes

226
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:31,097
That were really important
in American films
of that era.

227
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,390
You wrote from a particular
point of view, you know.

228
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:36,724
The irony to me

229
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:41,622
Of all these
radical communist writers,

230
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:44,645
You know, was that
what they were trying
to do really

231
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:46,728
Was to be good liberals.

232
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,710
What <i>is</i> democracy?

233
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:54,859
Well, I was never
very clear on it myself.

234
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,923
Like every other
kind of government,

235
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,902
It's got something to do

236
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:03,509
With young men killing
each other, I believe.

237
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,530
Why don't old men
kill each other?

238
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,344
Well, the old men
are needed to keep
the home fires burning.

239
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:12,678
Couldn't the young men
do that just as well?

240
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,971
Young men don't have homes.

241
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:17,055
That's why they must go out
and kill each other.

242
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:21,328
When it comes my turn,

243
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,517
Will you want me to go?

244
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,790
For democracy

245
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,125
Any man would give
his only begotten son.

246
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,293
That was it.

247
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,794
He understood it now.

248
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,504
He had told them his secret.

249
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,484
And in denying him

250
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:45,715
They had told him theirs.

251
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,278
He was the future.

252
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,987
He was a perfect picture
of the future.

253
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:52,801
And they were afraid
to let anyone see what
the future was like.

254
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:55,407
Already they were looking ahead.
They were figuring the future.

255
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,595
And somewhere in the future
they saw war.

256
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,681
To fight that war
they would need men

257
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:03,014
And if men saw the future
they wouldn't fight.

258
00:14:03,015 --> 00:14:05,933
So they were masking
the future.

259
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:10,205
They were keeping the future
a soft quiet deadly secret.

260
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:13,540
They knew if all the people
all the little guys,
saw the future,

261
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,728
They would begin
to ask questions.

262
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,439
They would ask questions
and they would find answers

263
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,836
And they would say to the guys
who wanted them to fight

264
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,859
They would say,
"you lying thieving
sons-of-bitches,

265
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,671
We won't fight.
We won't be dead.

266
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,381
We will live.
We are the world.
We are the future.

267
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,298
And we won't
let you butcher us
no matter what you say,

268
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,863
No matter what speeches
you make,

269
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,739
No matter what slogans
you write.

270
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,343
Remember it well,
we we we are the world.

271
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,012
We are what makes it go round.

272
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,199
We make bread
and cloth and guns.

273
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,222
We are the hub of the wheel
and the spokes and
the wheel itself.

274
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,035
And without us you would be
hungry naked worms.

275
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:50,015
And we will not die.

276
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:53,559
It will not be us who die.

277
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,539
It will be you.

278
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,102
It will be you...

279
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:59,187
You who urge us on to battle,

280
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:02,521
You who incite us
against ourselves,

281
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:06,273
You who would
have one cobbler
kill another cobbler,

282
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,774
You who would have
one man who works

283
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,588
Kill another man who works,

284
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,339
You who would
have one human being
who wants only to live

285
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,196
Kill another human being
who wants only to live.

286
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:22,426
If you tell us
to make the world
safe for democracy

287
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,511
We will take you seriously

288
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:27,845
And by God
and by Christ
we will make it so.

289
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,451
Make no mistake of it
we will live.

290
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:32,640
We will be alive

291
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,141
And we will walk and talk
and eat and sing

292
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,059
And laugh and feel and love

293
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,831
And bear our children

294
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:43,269
In tranquility, in security,

295
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,751
In decency,
in peace."

296
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:53,378
Very much what my father
took to be his politics

297
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,463
Was the constitution
of the United States

298
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,443
And the first 10 amendments.

299
00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:00,048
That for him outlined

300
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,132
A reasonable way

301
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,217
That human beings could live

302
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,779
Within a society,

303
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,260
<i>That it guaranteed</i>
<i>the individual specific rights</i>

304
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,492
<i>And that it limited</i>
<i>the rights of the state,</i>

305
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:15,681
<i>It limited the influence</i>
<i>of religion.</i>

306
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,119
And that very much
was his idea about
what the west was.

307
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,516
It was an open place.

308
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,288
<i>The ranch was</i> <i>fairly isolated.</i>

309
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,165
<i>There would be</i> <i>days on end</i>

310
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,936
<i>Where you do not see</i>
<i>any kind of automobile.</i>

311
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:29,020
<i>So the sighting</i>
<i>of an automobile</i>

312
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,146
<i>Is really exciting</i>
<i>for my older sister and me.</i>

313
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,127
It doesn't mean
that the car is
coming to us,

314
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,419
But there's a possibility.

315
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,295
<i>And this one did.</i>

316
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,693
<i>And so we went out</i>
<i>and we opened up</i>

317
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,672
<i>A rather large,</i> <i>heavy gate</i>

318
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:45,277
And brought the man
into the house.

319
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:47,362
And he was the process server.

320
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:50,905
So that's how my father
received his subpoena...

321
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,614
With the help of his children.

322
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,490
The man knocked on the door

323
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,576
And you got that pink slip.

324
00:16:57,577 --> 00:17:01,117
The first thing
you did was go out

325
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,036
And try to sell your house
before anybody discovers,

326
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:07,475
So you could at least
get a fair price for it,

327
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,768
Or as fair as possible.

328
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,477
Don't let anybody know.

329
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,457
Keep it quiet.

330
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,542
Get as much work as you can in

331
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,564
Before it becomes public.

332
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:22,274
Save every penny you have.

333
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,191
Sell what assets you have.

334
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,171
And get ready

335
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,652
To become nobody.

336
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,947
Man: <i>Do you solemnly swear</i>
<i>that the testimony you're</i>
<i>about to give</i>

337
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,927
<i>Is the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth,</i>

338
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,177
- <i>So help you God?</i>
- I do.

339
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:39,260
<i>Sit down.</i>

340
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,242
<i>Could you state</i> <i>your full name?</i>

341
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,907
Dalton Trumbo.

342
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,993
<i>When and where</i>
<i>were you born, Mr. Trumbo?</i>

343
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:47,286
<i>I was born</i>
<i>in Montrose, Colorado,</i>

344
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,932
<i>On December 9th,</i> <i>1905.</i>

345
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,600
<i>What is your occupation?</i>

346
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:54,373
<i>My occupation is</i>
<i>that of a writer.</i>

347
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,457
<i>I have some other questions,</i>
<i>Mr. Trumbo,</i>

348
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,540
<i>I'd like to ask you.</i>

349
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,356
<i>Are you now or have you</i>
<i>ever been a member of</i>
<i>the communist party?</i>

350
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,856
<i>Mr. Stripling, you must</i>
<i>have some reason</i>

351
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:05,420
For asking me this question.

352
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,879
You can address the committee.

353
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,753
You do.
I understand

354
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,943
That members of the press

355
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:14,797
Have been given an alleged
communist party card

356
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,883
Belonging to me.
Is that true?

357
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:18,550
No, that's not true.

358
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:21,155
- <i>You're not asking</i>
<i>the questions.</i>
- I was.

359
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:23,866
- <i>The chief investigator</i>
is asking the questions.
- I beg your pardon.

360
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:25,533
<i>Now are you or have you</i>
<i>ever been a member...?</i>

361
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,721
<i>A number of Hollywood</i>
<i>personalities</i>

362
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:29,492
Took the first amendment...

363
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,098
Not the fifth amendment
against self-incrimination,

364
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,557
But the first amendment

365
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:35,642
<i>To refuse to answer</i>
<i>their questions</i>

366
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:38,351
<i>About their political</i>
<i>backgrounds.</i>

367
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:41,060
Well, Mr. Stripling,
I think that there's

368
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,187
A question of
constitutional rights
involved here.

369
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:45,542
I don't believe
that you have...

370
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,835
<i>When did you learn</i>
<i>about the constitution?</i>

371
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,024
<i>Now just tell me</i>
<i>when you learned</i>
<i>about the constitution.</i>

372
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,524
Stripling:
Mr. Scott, could you
tell the committee

373
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,505
<i>Whether or not</i>
<i>you are now or have ever been</i>

374
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,068
<i>A member</i>
<i>of the communist party?</i>

375
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,027
I believe that question
also invades my right
as a citizen.

376
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:03,466
I believe it also invades
the first amendment.

377
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,905
I believe that I should not
engage in any conspiracy

378
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:08,991
With you to invade
the first amendment.

379
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:11,075
Man:
<i>Well, now we can tell</i>
<i>even from that answer</i>

380
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,576
- <i>Whether you're a member</i>
of the communist party.
- <i>( Laughter )</i>

381
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,557
Victor Navasky:
<i>If you take the fifth</i>
<i>amendment</i>

382
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:18,370
You're talking about
your right not to be
incriminated.

383
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,350
Well, they didn't feel
they had committed
any crime.

384
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,163
Well, they believed
that their freedom of speech

385
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,873
Was being abridged.

386
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,166
I believe I have the right
to be confronted

387
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,396
With any evidence
which supports
this question.

388
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,480
I should like to see
what you have.

389
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,461
- Man: <i>Well, you would?</i>
- Yes.

390
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,233
- ( laughter )
- <i>Well, you will</i>
pretty soon.

391
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,629
<i>The witness is excused.</i>

392
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,006
<i>Typical communist tactics.</i>
<i>Typical communist tactics.</i>

393
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,196
<i>Typical communist</i> <i>tactics.</i>

394
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:54,010
"dear Sam, it's 4:00 am.

395
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,929
And I've been working
since 10:00 last night...

396
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,535
Back at last
to the hours I love.

397
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,827
And all night
it's been snowing.

398
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,807
I just flash the spots on

399
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,621
And the sight is
wonderfully soothing
and beautiful.

400
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,330
No corners
anywhere in the world,

401
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:12,769
Everything round
and smooth and immaculate.

402
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,479
The kids and Cleo are asleep.

403
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,565
The house is in order.

404
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,751
The machines all
function smoothly.

405
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,149
The larder is full.
And I feel,

406
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,128
For the moment at least,

407
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,256
That I am the luckiest
and most contented man
in the world.

408
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:30,590
If you were here
we would break a bottle

409
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,987
And light the fire
and watch the falling snow.

410
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:35,073
And I would tell you
all about it.

411
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:38,720
That being impossible,
I shall write.

412
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,867
First I shall
tell you something

413
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,577
Which would embarrass
us both greatly

414
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,557
If I were to speak it.

415
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:52,058
Separated from people
as I have been,

416
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,144
I have had a great deal of time

417
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:57,686
To observe the reactions
to the present troubled times

418
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:00,604
And I have seen many
betray themselves.

419
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:04,564
I have seen many fail
at any decent test
of conduct,

420
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,586
Some of them my friends.

421
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:09,672
And I have shucked them off

422
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:13,006
With as little feeling
as I would toss away
a nail paring

423
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:16,862
And have experienced
no sense of loss
in the process.

424
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,987
But through this whole
interesting experience

425
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,176
My respect for you has deepened

426
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:24,886
And my affection
has grown more profound,

427
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:27,180
Not only for the money
you lent me,

428
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:29,264
Although that was
a life-saver

429
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,557
And a great
demonstration of Faith,

430
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,057
But for your attitude toward me

431
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:36,871
And other persons
and toward life itself,

432
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:38,955
For your willingness

433
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:41,352
To Grant me
any belief I cherish

434
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:43,959
So long as it is not
harmful to others,

435
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,042
Even when you disagree with it,

436
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:49,168
And for your personal
sense of outrage

437
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,252
When that right is denied.

438
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,649
This and this alone

439
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,359
Makes decent men
and decent society

440
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,339
And is rare

441
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,737
And is why I feel warm
in the knowledge

442
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,238
That we are friends.

443
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:14,493
<i>Perhaps I should not be</i>
<i>as angry as I am</i>

444
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:16,889
<i>Against the weaklings,</i>

445
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,287
<i>Cravens and liars</i>
<i>who have succeeded</i>

446
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:21,788
<i>In banning me</i>
<i>from motion pictures,</i>

447
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,289
<i>For I feel</i> <i>the sense of relief</i>

448
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,374
<i>And a sense</i> <i>of buoyancy</i>

449
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,979
<i>At no longer being</i> <i>an employee.</i>

450
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,896
I'm sure I should never
have had the courage

451
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,774
Or perhaps one should say
the foolhardiness

452
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:36,169
To have left it voluntarily.

453
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,087
My feeling now,
as of today that is

454
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,172
With the hope
of succeeding elsewhere,

455
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:45,236
Is still strong in me
that I shall never
return to films,

456
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:47,842
That if metro
asked me back tomorrow

457
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:50,968
With all forgiven,
I should refuse.

458
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,302
Hunger, of course,
could in time alter
that decision,

459
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:57,742
But for the present it stands.

460
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,181
Well, now enough.

461
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:04,099
I hope all things
go well with you.

462
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,434
Cleo and I send you our best.

463
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:10,144
And the children
have just risen.

464
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:12,541
They've started shouting
through the house

465
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,938
At the discovery of the snow.

466
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,732
Oh, say hello to my friends

467
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,899
And piss on my enemies."

468
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,130
I've learned that
total adjustment to society

469
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:29,633
Is quite as bad
as total maladjustment,

470
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:32,445
That principled disobedience
of unjust law

471
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:36,092
<i>Is more Christian,</i>
<i>more truly law-abiding</i>

472
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,698
Than unprincipled respect,

473
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,784
That only freedom can tame

474
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:42,762
The wild, rebellious,

475
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,368
Palpitating heart of man.

476
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,390
Encagement... never.

477
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:51,413
- <i>( air raid sirens blaring )</i>
- Trumbo: <i>Wherever there's</i>
fear, there's hysteria.

478
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,602
<i>And wherever there are people</i>
<i>who whip up fear</i>

479
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,373
<i>For their own</i> <i>purposes,</i>

480
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,458
<i>They will produce</i> <i>the hysteria.</i>

481
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:00,791
<i>And they will try</i>
<i>to do it again.</i>

482
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:03,501
The fact that he followed

483
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,524
The usual communist line

484
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:10,171
Of not responding
to questions of the committee

485
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:13,922
Is definite proof
that he's a member
of the communist party.

486
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:17,466
Therefore, by a unanimous vote

487
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:20,072
<i>The subcommittee recommends</i>
<i>to the full committee</i>

488
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:23,511
<i>That Dalton Trumbo</i> <i>be cited</i>

489
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:25,595
<i>For contempt</i> <i>of congress.</i>

490
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:27,159
<i>The committee</i> <i>recommends</i>

491
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,138
That appropriate action
be taken

492
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:31,224
By the full committee
without delay.

493
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:34,140
Navasky:
<i>After the hearings</i>

494
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,122
<i>There was this meeting</i>
<i>at the Waldorf.</i>

495
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:38,621
<i>They united on a policy</i>

496
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,602
<i>Which basically was,</i>

497
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:42,688
<i>"we don't believe</i>
<i>in a blacklist,</i>

498
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,980
<i>But we're not going to</i>
<i>employ anyone</i>

499
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:48,731
Who has been involved
in any way, shape or form

500
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,502
With the communist party.

501
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:52,900
Eric Johnston:
<i>We will forthwith discharge</i>

502
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:55,609
<i>Or suspend without compensation</i>

503
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,589
<i>Those in our employ</i>

504
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,611
And we will not reemploy
any of the 10

505
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:03,112
Until such time
as he is acquitted

506
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:05,718
Or has purged himself
of contempt

507
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,698
And declares under oath

508
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:10,199
That he is not a communist.

509
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,159
You have the scapegoat.
You have the communists.

510
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:18,015
There were about 80,000
communists in the country

511
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,975
At the peak
of the party's success.

512
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:26,353
You know, they weren't
as dangerous as the elks

513
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:29,896
And didn't have nearly
as many guns.

514
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:33,440
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>After the Waldorf agreement</i>
<i>is signed</i>

515
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:36,357
<i>By the various producers</i>
<i>and studios</i>

516
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:39,275
And the blacklist
is established,

517
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,880
<i>My father's position</i> <i>became</i>

518
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:44,903
That he would have
to accept the idea

519
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,987
That the blacklist existed

520
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,801
And operate under
those conditions,

521
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:52,302
Which meant finding work
in another way.

522
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:54,073
They lost their jobs.

523
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:57,930
<i>They were personae non grata</i>
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

524
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,681
<i>And they began writing</i>
<i>under assumed names.</i>

525
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:04,287
And it was really,
you know, contrary

526
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:06,684
To what this country
is all about.

527
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:10,019
I have the feeling

528
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,457
That if you give

529
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,855
Most people

530
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:18,043
In the world

531
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:22,733
A choice between
enough food for
their children

532
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,712
And shelter

533
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:27,214
And clothing

534
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:33,780
In return for their
freedom of speech,

535
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:36,280
That they will go

536
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:39,511
For the food, the shelter

537
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:43,784
And the necessities.

538
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:47,640
And freedom of speech

539
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:51,288
Becomes a luxury

540
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:56,082
For which few fight
at the most.

541
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,882
<i>"dear guy,</i>

542
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,281
<i>I have had several days</i>
<i>to ponder our discussion</i>

543
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:20,260
<i>Of the Saturday</i>
<i>before Christmas.</i>

544
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,762
<i>Though I have not yet</i>
<i>had the opportunity</i>

545
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,117
<i>To talk it over</i>
<i>with the others,</i>

546
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:26,513
<i>I have had second thoughts</i>
<i>of my own</i>

547
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:29,430
And a strong impression
I didn't make myself clear

548
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,410
As to my real opinions.

549
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:34,954
That day a prominent
and liberal producer

550
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,039
Whose motives
I do not at all doubt

551
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,644
Was quoted as saying
to one of us:

552
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:43,083
'look, you people
are simply stubborn
and foolish.

553
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:44,959
The committee
and its requirements

554
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,668
Are a part of our time;
They are the law;

555
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,754
They are the country;
They are the flag.

556
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,316
That's the way it is,

557
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:53,401
And those who refuse
to recognize this

558
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:55,380
No longer arouse sympathy;

559
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,360
They only isolate themselves

560
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,445
And prevent their voices
from being heard.'

561
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,570
I know and can read
the first amendment

562
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:04,551
As well as anyone else.

563
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,156
I know it is
the basic law of this country.

564
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:09,449
I know that if it goes,

565
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,533
All will go.

566
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:15,285
Thus, the court has
presented us with a dilemma

567
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,996
That lies at the heart
of all philosophies
and religions,

568
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,080
The dilemma best symbolized

569
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:22,059
In the Faustian legend:

570
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,186
Yield up your principles
and you shall be rich;

571
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:27,269
Cling to them and you shall be

572
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,876
Less prosperous
than you presently are.

573
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,481
That's the problem:

574
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,460
Choice.

575
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:36,858
Not compulsion: Choice.

576
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,463
Committee or no committee,
law or no law,

577
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:42,485
Capitalism or no capitalism,
movies or no movies,

578
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,819
It is the constant
necessity to choose

579
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,218
That dogs every action
of our lives,

580
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:50,823
Every minute of our existences.

581
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,906
Who is it then

582
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,991
Who compels us to inform?

583
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,972
Who is it that denies us work

584
00:28:57,077 --> 00:29:00,410
Until we seek out the committee
and abase ourselves before it?

585
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:03,120
Since it is neither the court

586
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,787
Nor the law nor the committee,

587
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,560
The man who compels informing

588
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,956
Can only be
the employer himself.

589
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,665
He is the one
who urges us to inform,

590
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,896
And he is the one
who withholds work from us
until we do.

591
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:19,064
He is, in fact,
that same liberal producer

592
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:21,358
Who was quoted
at our Saturday discussion.

593
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,442
It is he and not the committee

594
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:26,152
Who applies the only lash
that really stings...

595
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:28,236
Economic reprisal:

596
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:30,425
He is the enforcer
who gives the committee

597
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:33,342
Its only strength
and all its victories.

598
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,947
Disliking the nasty business
of blacklisting

599
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,553
But nonetheless practicing it
every day of his life,

600
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:41,159
He places upon his country
and his flag

601
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,139
The blame for moral atrocities

602
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,370
That otherwise
would be charged
directly to himself.

603
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:49,287
And thus, since informing
has nothing to do

604
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,372
With the law
and the country
and the flag,

605
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,185
And since the necessities
of his life as he sees them

606
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:57,207
Oblige him to enforce
what the committee
can never compel,

607
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,500
And since
without his enforcement

608
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,689
The committee would have
no power at all...

609
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,294
What he actually said

610
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:07,212
Is that <i>he</i> is the law

611
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:10,131
And the country and the flag.

612
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,383
Thinking back to our producer

613
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,988
And his concept
of country and flag,

614
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:22,636
I am more than ever bewildered.

615
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:25,449
I wonder if he has
really seen this country,

616
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,472
If he has really seen
these American people,

617
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:30,661
If he has really
seen that flag.

618
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,516
If he has, and his
conclusions are honest,

619
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:37,121
He has seen something
I never imagined

620
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:41,603
And don't believe
exists."

621
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:44,416
Trumbo:
<i>My mother and father</i>
<i>always refused...</i>

622
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:48,065
<i>Declined to state</i>
<i>their political affiliation</i>
<i>in primaries.</i>

623
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:51,190
<i>And I learned</i>
<i>to decline to state.</i>

624
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:55,255
<i>I learned that certain things</i>
<i>were not anybody's business,</i>

625
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,964
<i>And that if you</i> <i>allow them</i>

626
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,049
<i>To encroach</i> <i>upon this area</i>

627
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,551
<i>Then they can</i>
<i>ask you anything...</i>

628
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:05,781
<i>About your wife,</i>
<i>about your children</i>

629
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,386
<i>About your politics.</i>

630
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:11,931
<i>They might even...</i>
<i>and I can imagine</i>
<i>a time in this country</i>

631
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:15,681
<i>When they may</i>
<i>bring democrats up</i>
<i>to the platform</i>

632
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,767
<i>And say, "have you now</i>
<i>or have you ever been</i>

633
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:20,267
<i>A member of</i>
<i>the democratic party?"</i>

634
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,976
Mitzi Trumbo:
<i>My father loved it</i>
<i>when he could be</i>

635
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:25,790
<i>In some kind of</i>
<i>magnificent battle</i>
<i>with somebody.</i>

636
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:29,125
<i>I always loved</i>
<i>hearing his perspective</i>
<i>on anything,</i>

637
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:31,940
<i>But especially political,</i>
<i>because he was just</i>
<i>so astute.</i>

638
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:33,814
He was really smart.

639
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,378
He was very funny.

640
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:37,776
<i>He was charming.</i>
<i>He was very charming.</i>

641
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:40,484
<i>He would</i> <i>enchant people.</i>

642
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:42,570
<i>He could also</i> <i>be difficult,</i>

643
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:44,550
<i>Grumpy and cantankerous</i>

644
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,320
<i>And had a temper.</i>

645
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,926
<i>He was a terrible</i>
<i>money manager.</i>

646
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:51,012
As soon as money
came in for a script,

647
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:53,616
He'd spend it
is the only way
I can think about it.

648
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,493
My father's relationship
to money is

649
00:31:55,494 --> 00:32:00,494
<i>He never managed</i> <i>to save any.</i>

650
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:04,141
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>this was always</i>
<i>the problem.</i>

651
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:06,642
He was consistently
catching up.

652
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:10,185
So all of his plans,

653
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,271
You know, or all of his dreams

654
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:15,188
To actually become
financially independent

655
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,897
Never had a Chance
in the face of the things

656
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:20,191
<i>That he was interested</i>
<i>in doing with the money</i>

657
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:22,275
<i>At the time,</i> <i>which was like,</i>

658
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:24,777
<i>"maybe we should put</i>
<i>a lake in there,"</i>

659
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:26,652
<i>That kind of thing.</i>

660
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,090
<i>And so, as he was being</i>
<i>unemployed by the studio</i>

661
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,800
And his contract canceled,
he was in the middle

662
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,885
Of improving the ranch again.

663
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,513
"dear burglars:

664
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,596
Our baby sleeps in one bedroom

665
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,577
And we sleep in another.

666
00:32:44,578 --> 00:32:46,662
When she yelps at night
we cannot hear her.

667
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,642
A man said you were the people

668
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:51,247
To see about such things.

669
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,956
Can you install a speaker
in her room and one in ours

670
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:56,041
So we can gossip
back and forth with her

671
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,916
During the wee small hours?

672
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,001
Not one of your
solid gold outfits,

673
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:02,606
Something sensible
and serviceable.

674
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,003
I am not a rich man anymore.

675
00:33:05,004 --> 00:33:08,859
Now let's all get together
and see if we can arrange

676
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,089
A decent, modest little
outfit for an old customer

677
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,383
Without screwing him
to death in the process.

678
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:16,884
Irritably yours,

679
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:18,864
Dalton Trumbo."

680
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,139
"my dear Mr. Fourness:

681
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,119
Your letter has arrived

682
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,975
And been put to the only
sensible use I could think of.

683
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:35,955
When we reds come into power

684
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,874
We are going to
shoot merchants
in the following order:

685
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,416
(1) those who are greedy,
and (2) those who are witty.

686
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:45,855
Since you fall
into both categories

687
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,461
It will be a sad story

688
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:52,212
When we finally
lay hands on you.

689
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:56,068
I had hoped time might have
improved your character,

690
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:58,986
But the prices you quote
convince me otherwise.

691
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:01,799
You still cannot imagine
a happy moment

692
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,885
Which does not find your fist

693
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:06,803
In somebody else's pocket.

694
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:08,887
Since I have
little choice in the matter,

695
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,284
I must yield.

696
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,888
Send the set described
and with it

697
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,973
A man for installation.

698
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:19,413
I have no intention
of creeping about the house
on all fours

699
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,497
With a wire in one hand
and a hammer in the other

700
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,894
And my larynx
clogged with tacks.

701
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,811
The Bill should be sent
to my business manager

702
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,104
Whose name is Rex Cole.

703
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:32,647
I have employed him
because he hates creditors

704
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:34,837
And does not pay them
too promptly.

705
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,859
You will feel better
over the Thanksgiving
and Christmas season

706
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,943
If you have something
to look forward to

707
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,924
During the hangover period
which follows;

708
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:43,903
And I tell you quite frankly

709
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,883
That it will probably be
60 days

710
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,863
Before you get your money.

711
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,949
Considering what
you've done to me,

712
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,699
I ought to make you wait
the full nine months.

713
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,555
Please extend my good wishes
for the holiday season

714
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,369
To everyone
in the thuggery."

715
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,599
My father's poem
for my birthday

716
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,892
In 1951, I'm 10 years old,

717
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:09,643
Is precisely the kind of fun

718
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:13,396
That he likes to have
with language,

719
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,105
With, in this case, meter.

720
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:19,128
<i>So there is</i>
<i>an enormous playfulness</i>

721
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,213
<i>That really has</i>
<i>no outlet, you know,</i>

722
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:23,193
<i>In any other way.</i>

723
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:28,506
"about 10 years ago today

724
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:30,591
(or rather, in the night)

725
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:32,571
Your mother turned to me to say

726
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:34,239
A thing that gave me fright.

727
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,323
She whispered
with surpassing Joy,

728
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:38,096
'my darling husband dear,

729
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:39,659
<i>We're going to have</i>
<i>a little boy.</i>

730
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,534
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>he's almost here!'</i>

731
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:43,618
I leaped at once
onto the floor,

732
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,495
Fell flat upon my face,

733
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,162
Jumped up and ran
against the door,

734
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,350
Fell down again...
same place.

735
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,643
I scrambled into suit and hat,

736
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:54,040
Fell down the stairs,
slid through the hall,

737
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,021
<i>Did handsprings</i> <i>like an acrobat</i>

738
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,897
<i>To where the car stood</i>
<i>in its stall.</i>

739
00:35:57,898 --> 00:36:00,085
<i>I packed your mother</i> <i>into it</i>

740
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:01,752
And started through the night

741
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:03,940
To-whoop, to-whee,
to-lickety-split,

742
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:06,025
To-wheedle-de-wham,
what a sight!

743
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:08,109
Then halfway to the hospital

744
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,193
The engine's feeble pop

745
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:12,174
Brought mother and me
and unborn you

746
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:14,050
To an absolute dead stop.

747
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:17,800
<i>"oh dear, oh me,</i>
<i>oh double-alas</i>

748
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,093
<i>And mercy,"</i> <i>cried my heart,</i>

749
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,075
<i>"the car has just</i>
<i>run out of gas,</i>

750
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:24,678
<i>And having stopped,</i>
<i>won't start!"</i>

751
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,555
I raced away to a standard sign

752
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:27,911
For a bucket full of gas,

753
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:29,683
Filled up the tank
with an old hose line,

754
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,348
Which I threw away
on the grass.

755
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,537
Then off again
with the speed of light

756
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,518
(the tires and mother whining)

757
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,915
Like a startled baboon
through the dark of night,

758
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,000
My eyes all wild and shining.

759
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,500
We got to the place
in a mile-long slide,

760
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:47,189
And seven minutes later

761
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:50,003
You arrived
with a mouth as wide

762
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:52,921
As a full-grown
alligator.

763
00:36:52,922 --> 00:36:55,005
Your mother looked at me,

764
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:57,402
And I looked grimly
back at her.

765
00:36:57,403 --> 00:37:00,112
'what'll we name it?'
I said with a sigh,

766
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:04,594
And she said,
'Christopher.'

767
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:10,846
<i>And that's how it happened,</i>
<i>my little son,</i>

768
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:15,119
<i>My grim and glare</i> <i>and starey,</i>

769
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,558
<i>My gloom and glum</i>
<i>and fearsome one,</i>

770
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,956
My beautiful and scarey!

771
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:25,020
Happy birthday from daddy.

772
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:29,085
Dalton Trumbo...
prisoner #7551."

773
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:35,962
The guys went to jail in '50.

774
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,879
And that was a big shock.

775
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,485
That was a real shock
to all of us.

776
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:43,257
Only two people stood trial.

777
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:45,342
Jack Lawson stood trial first,

778
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:47,217
<i>And then I.</i>

779
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,303
<i>Both Jack and I</i> <i>were judged</i>

780
00:37:49,304 --> 00:37:51,385
<i>Guilty of contempt</i>

781
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,721
Of the 83rd congress
I think it was.

782
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:58,472
And as far as I'm concerned,

783
00:37:58,473 --> 00:38:00,661
It was a completely
just verdict.

784
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:04,204
I had contempt
for that congress

785
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:07,643
As I've had contempt
for several since.

786
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:10,457
All through the appeals
things got very tight.

787
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,375
Everybody was working,
scrambling terribly hard.

788
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,252
Navasky: <i>It went all the way</i>
<i>up to the supreme court.</i>

789
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,273
By the way, they thought
they were going to win.

790
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:20,672
Trumbo:
<i>Every law review</i>
<i>in the country</i>

791
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,338
<i>Thought we would win.</i>

792
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,361
<i>Now we didn't win.</i>

793
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:29,945
<i>Others saw something</i>

794
00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:33,802
<i>That we had not had</i>
<i>the advantage of seeing.</i>

795
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:36,719
They saw 10 men
sell their houses,

796
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,325
Say goodbye to their kids

797
00:38:39,326 --> 00:38:42,764
<i>And go off to jail,</i>
<i>lose their jobs</i>

798
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,953
And then be subjected

799
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:47,453
To public disgrace
and punishment.

800
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:50,267
<i>I have</i> <i>three children.</i>

801
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:52,559
<i>I have a nice wife.</i>

802
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,749
<i>Why should I</i> <i>go to jail?</i>

803
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:02,669
<i>"my darling,</i>

804
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,108
<i>You know what I was</i>
<i>thinking last night?</i>

805
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:09,756
I was thinking of the night

806
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:12,360
A weary, frightened,

807
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,904
Tearful girl
climbed into my car

808
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:18,301
And let me drive away with her.

809
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,281
And I was thinking

810
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,367
Of the truly remarkable person

811
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,972
She has turned into.
And I came to the conclusion

812
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,952
<i>That the night</i> <i>in question</i>

813
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,932
<i>Was the luckiest one</i>
<i>of my life."</i>

814
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,684
Mitzi Trumbo:
<i>Yes, my parents' courtship</i>
<i>was a famous family story.</i>

815
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:36,331
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>he had a friend</i>
<i>named Earl Felton</i>

816
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:40,499
Who told him that he had met

817
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,417
The woman that my father
should marry.

818
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:46,544
And my mom worked
in a drive-in stand.

819
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:48,628
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>My mother came out,</i>

820
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:50,713
Served them dinner,
whatever it was,

821
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:53,109
And my father proposed to her.

822
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,401
My mother rejected him.

823
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:58,737
She married...
I believe he was the cook
at the drive-in stand.

824
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,967
I don't know
if she did this
in defiance or what.

825
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:04,573
Jean Rouverol:
<i>Trumbo was dismayed</i>

826
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,658
<i>When she married</i> <i>this fellow</i>

827
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:08,949
<i>Whom he had met somehow</i>

828
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,556
<i>And didn't trust</i> <i>worth a darn.</i>

829
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:16,140
So he put a detective
on this other man

830
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:19,788
And in due time discovered

831
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:22,289
That the man was
already married.

832
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,375
So to his great delight

833
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,770
This invalidated
Cleo's marriage

834
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:29,897
To his competitor

835
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:32,189
And before too long

836
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,379
<i>Cleo had chosen Trumbo.</i>

837
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,755
"two days hence
will be our 13th

838
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:40,735
Wedding anniversary.

839
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:43,549
I have been lying here
on my bunk

840
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,988
Thinking about it.

841
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,968
<i>The 13 years</i>

842
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:50,948
<i>Seem so short a time</i>

843
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,952
<i>Because it has been</i>
<i>so happy a time for me.</i>

844
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:00,016
<i>All that is any good</i> <i>in my life</i>

845
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:01,891
<i>Has grown out of it.</i>

846
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:06,164
<i>I think back on each year</i>
<i>of it with pride.</i>

847
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,249
<i>I think our children</i>
<i>take pride in it,</i>

848
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,104
<i>And will take more pride</i>
<i>as they grow older.</i>

849
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:14,397
I think the three things

850
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,377
I want most
when I get out of here:

851
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:18,462
<i>I want</i> <i>(1) a good drink,</i>

852
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:21,795
<i>(2) a rare steak,</i>

853
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:25,132
<i>And (3) a symphony.</i>

854
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:31,801
More and more I realize
that when I emerge
from here

855
00:41:31,802 --> 00:41:34,822
I must make the choice
of what kind of writer
I want to be.

856
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:37,011
And I think it would be
better for all of us

857
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:38,993
If I returned
to writing novels,

858
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:41,597
With the occasional foray
into the theater.

859
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:45,036
It will probably
take years to recover

860
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:48,892
From the blow dealt
by the blacklist.

861
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,186
But the discovery of friends
who would rally around

862
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:53,165
With such incredible generosity

863
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:57,647
Perhaps makes the whole
experience worthwhile.

864
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:04,524
Much love...

865
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:08,694
Dalton Trumbo...
prisoner #7551."

866
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:14,529
( chuckles )

867
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,551
"p.s. As for the problem
of your children,

868
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:19,531
I have no solution,

869
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:22,971
Except that I will adapt
myself to the solution

870
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:25,055
Which you conclude
is reasonable.

871
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:26,930
It is your problem.

872
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:29,223
<i>They are, after all,</i>

873
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:34,330
<i>The fruits of your own</i>
<i>unbridled lust.</i>

874
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:39,957
And if they now
appear inconvenient,

875
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:44,022
Remember the Joy
of their conception."

876
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:51,108
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>In 1951 when he gets out</i>
<i>of jail</i>

877
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:53,922
My father came back
to the ranch

878
00:42:53,924 --> 00:42:57,153
And all the attendant
problems of

879
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,758
"how do we start again?
What are we going to do?

880
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:02,572
What's the world
look like now?"

881
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:05,907
<i>Is it your opinion, senator,</i>
<i>that we're any nearer</i>

882
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:09,450
A war with soviet Russia
than we were a year ago?

883
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:11,536
As far as war is concerned,
we're at war

884
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:13,514
With the communist
half of the world.

885
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:15,600
That war wasn't started by us.

886
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,310
It can't be ended by us
except by ultimate victory.

887
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:20,601
It wasn't only McCarthy.

888
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:22,685
It was an attitude
in the senate,

889
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:25,499
In the house un-American
activities committee.

890
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,417
Communism in reality
is not a political party.

891
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,398
It is a way of life,

892
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,482
An evil and malignant
way of life.

893
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,608
It reveals a condition
akin to disease

894
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:37,693
That spreads like an epidemic.

895
00:43:37,694 --> 00:43:40,819
And like an epidemic,
a quarantine is necessary

896
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,112
To keep it from infecting
this nation.

897
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:45,614
Jean Rouverol:
<i>About this time</i>
<i>the government was beginning</i>

898
00:43:45,615 --> 00:43:48,324
<i>To recondition</i>
<i>the relocation centers</i>

899
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,824
<i>That the Japanese had been</i>
<i>interned in during the war</i>

900
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,805
<i>For members</i> <i>of the left...</i>

901
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:55,722
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>concentration camps</i>

902
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:57,701
<i>For American radicals.</i>

903
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,724
<i>And that was</i>
<i>really frightening.</i>

904
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:03,330
We had had a long period
of unemployment,

905
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:06,456
Which had scared
the living dickens out of us.

906
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:09,165
So we realized

907
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:11,354
That there was a gray list

908
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:13,334
That was beginning
to affect us.

909
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:15,315
<i>But I had dinner</i> <i>with the kids</i>

910
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:17,398
<i>And the doorbell rang.</i>

911
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:20,733
I went to the door
knowing exactly what
I would find.

912
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,818
And I looked through
the Judas hole

913
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:26,570
And it was two men in hats
on the front porch.

914
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:28,445
And they asked for Hugo

915
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,635
<i>And I said</i>
<i>that he wasn't there.</i>

916
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,719
<i>And they asked</i> <i>where he was</i>

917
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,699
<i>And I said</i> <i>I didn't know.</i>

918
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:36,992
And they looked
at each other and
off they went.

919
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:41,159
And, oh, I was a wreck.

920
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,932
And I came back to the table

921
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,703
<i>And I telephoned Hugo.</i>

922
00:44:44,704 --> 00:44:47,100
<i>He came on the phone</i>
<i>and I said,</i>

923
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,809
"honey, get on your horse."

924
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,789
And there was a pause

925
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,603
And he said, "no shit."

926
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:57,313
And we were on the run.

927
00:44:57,314 --> 00:45:00,022
We all agreed
that maybe we should all
leave the country

928
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:02,212
Because we couldn't see
any way out.

929
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:05,234
We couldn't see
what lay in store for us.

930
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,798
"old boy, my limited view
of the economy of Hollywood

00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:14,196
Indicates it's not too good.

932
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:16,176
Employment extremely low,

933
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:18,155
Many deserving hacks starving.

934
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:20,657
I find enough to do
but don't enjoy doing it,

935
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:22,430
Stall a great deal of the time.

936
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:25,555
I just slunge around
and bipper at people,

937
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,161
And dream of the time
I'll be shed of everything.

938
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:30,765
I'm impatient
for something to happen,

939
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:32,537
Good, bad or indifferent.

940
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:34,414
I want to move somewhere.

941
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:36,706
I think we might
live handsomely

942
00:45:36,707 --> 00:45:39,729
And grow rich in Mexico.
Don't you?

943
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,064
<i>I'm perfectly willing</i>
<i>to go anywhere</i>

944
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:45,774
<i>That I can live</i>
<i>not, perhaps, in peace,</i>

945
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,753
<i>But certainly</i> <i>in luxury.</i>

946
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,734
<i>If I could spend</i>
<i>the next five or 10 years</i>

947
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:51,714
<i>In Mexico city</i> <i>or its environs</i>

948
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,692
And earn say
40-50,000 a year,

949
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,256
Which isn't at all improbable,

950
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:57,342
And pay Mexican income taxes

951
00:45:57,343 --> 00:45:59,841
And stash enormous
sums of cash away...

952
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,823
Hell, I'd go for it instantly.

953
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:05,053
Cleo and I intend to
swoop into Cuernavaca

954
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,554
And quiz Gordon Kahn
about living costs,

955
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,055
Schools, rents,
<i>mordito, inmigrantes</i>

956
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:12,139
And the virgin of Guadalupe...

957
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,327
All of which he is said
to know more about

958
00:46:14,328 --> 00:46:16,309
Than any other living person.

959
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,538
Naturally, we shall share
our findings with you.

960
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:22,040
We all send you <i>felicitaciones,</i>

961
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,645
<i>Y 'misereres',</i> <i>y fraternidades</i>

962
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:27,147
<i>Y 'comisereres'."</i>

963
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:31,106
Ring Lardner

964
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:34,128
And Hugo butler and Ian Hunter

965
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:36,109
Were my father's
closest friends

966
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,194
And had been during the '40s.

967
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,069
And all of the families

968
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,466
Ended up at some point

969
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,862
In Mexico city.

970
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:48,093
We all moved to Mexico.
First it was...

971
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:49,865
<i>The butlers</i> <i>and the Trumbos</i>

972
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,263
<i>Went down in this</i>
<i>caravan together.</i>

973
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:54,763
<i>And we followed</i> <i>in January.</i>

974
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:56,744
<i>I think they went down</i>
<i>in November.</i>

975
00:46:56,745 --> 00:47:00,391
I've heard stories
about ring and Hugo

976
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:04,351
And Ian and pop.
And there are actually

977
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,644
Some photos somewhere
of them wrestling.

978
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:08,727
So this is the wrestling.

979
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:11,750
This is my dad...

980
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:13,835
This is ring.

981
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:16,231
And that's Hugo.

982
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:20,921
And this unflattering
picture here...

983
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,901
This is Trumbo.

984
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:26,132
I think these are legs,
and they would be Ian's.

985
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:28,946
Rouverol:
<i>Somehow or other</i>
<i>these four writers,</i>

986
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:31,135
Young writers,
all got together,

987
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:33,322
All had a wonderful
time together

988
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:36,970
<i>And made up a band,</i>
<i>a little band of brothers.</i>

989
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,096
<i>They were adorable together.</i>
<i>They were terribly funny.</i>

990
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:42,389
Mostly what they did
was have fun.

991
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,996
<i>They would think</i> <i>of pranks.</i>

992
00:47:44,997 --> 00:47:47,079
<i>They would drink,</i>

993
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,893
<i>Which was, you know,</i>
<i>a primary occupation.</i>

994
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:52,082
Kate Lardner:
<i>They were all</i>
<i>probably drunks.</i>

995
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:53,541
<i>I'm not sure</i> <i>about Hugo.</i>

996
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:56,043
Trumbo seems to have been
the most successful

997
00:47:56,044 --> 00:47:58,438
In being able
to drink and write.

998
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:00,418
"my dear son,

999
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,024
I am sending you two books
I think appropriate

1000
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:05,942
For a young man spending
five-sevenths of his time

1001
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:08,548
In the monkish precincts
of John Jay hall.

1002
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:11,673
The first is
'education of a poker player, '

1003
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:13,654
By Herbert O. Yardley.

1004
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:17,093
Read it in secret,
hide it whenever you
leave quarters,

1005
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,178
And you'll be rewarded
with many

1006
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,096
Unfair but legal advantages
over friend and enemy alike.

1007
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:25,430
The second book
I think you should share

1008
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:27,516
With your young companions.

1009
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:30,015
It is "sex without guilt,"

1010
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:32,621
By a man who will
take his place in history

1011
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:34,809
As the greatest humanitarian

1012
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,666
Since Mahatma Gandhi...
Albert Ellis, PhD.

1013
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:42,104
This good man has written
what might be called

1014
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:44,814
A manual for masturbators.

1015
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,482
The result

1016
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:49,087
(mailed in plain wrapper
under separate cover)

1017
00:48:49,088 --> 00:48:51,171
Is one of those
fortuitous events

1018
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:53,985
In which the right man
collides with the right idea

1019
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:56,069
At precisely the right time.

1020
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,612
This whole new approach...
this fresh wind

1021
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:01,698
Blowing under the sheets,
so to speak...

1022
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:04,928
This large-hearted appeal
for cheerful self-pollution,

1023
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:07,637
Invokes perhaps
a deeper response

1024
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:09,306
In my heart than in most.

1025
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:11,598
For I (sneaky, timorous,

1026
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,036
Incontinent little beast
with my paphian obsessions)

1027
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,017
Was never wholesomely at home

1028
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:18,893
With my penile problem...

1029
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:21,081
All because of that maggoty,

1030
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:23,478
Mountainous pustule
of needless guilt

1031
00:49:23,479 --> 00:49:27,021
That throbbed
like an abscess
in my young boy's heart."

1032
00:49:27,022 --> 00:49:29,731
This is an exercise
of language and style.

1033
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:33,795
He's just read Nabokov.
He's playing with it.

1034
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:37,338
He's entertaining me.
He's entertaining himself.

1035
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:39,423
"on warm Summer nights

1036
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:41,507
While exuberant
girl-hunting contemporaries

1037
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:43,487
Scampered in and out
of the brush

1038
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:45,572
Beneath high western stars,

1039
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:48,281
I, dedicated fool,
lay swooning in my bed

1040
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,948
With no companion

1041
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:52,450
Save the lewd
and smirking demons

1042
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,223
Of my bottomless
guilt."

1043
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,098
The first thing I did
was start laughing,

1044
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,974
And the second thing I did
was get a dictionary.

1045
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,266
"cowering there
in seminal darkness,

1046
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,350
Liquescent with
self-loathing,

1047
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:06,519
Attentive only
to the stealthy rise
and crafty-ebbing

1048
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,811
Of my dark scrotumnal blood,

1049
00:50:08,812 --> 00:50:10,791
Fearful as a lechwe

1050
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:13,502
Yet firmer of purpose
than any rutting buffalo,

1051
00:50:13,503 --> 00:50:16,836
I celebrated
the rites of Shuah's son

1052
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:18,816
With sullen resignation.

1053
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:21,213
Poor little chap
on a Summer's night,

1054
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:23,298
Morosely masturbating...!

1055
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:24,758
( clicks tongue )

1056
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:27,466
Even now, more than
three decades later,

1057
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:30,071
Even now when I forget
a friend's name,

1058
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,157
Or mislay my spectacles,

1059
00:50:32,158 --> 00:50:36,950
Or pause...
In mid-sentence idiocy...

1060
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,346
Even now such lapses

1061
00:50:39,347 --> 00:50:41,743
Set a clammy chill
upon my heart.

1062
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:43,411
It's then,

1063
00:50:43,412 --> 00:50:45,496
While panic tightens
my sagging throat,

1064
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:47,372
That I whisper to myself:

1065
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:50,602
'it's true after all.
It <i>does</i> make you crazy.

1066
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:53,936
It <i>does</i> cause
the brain to soften.

1067
00:50:53,938 --> 00:50:57,792
Why, oh why did I
like it so much?

1068
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:00,919
Why didn't I stop
while I was still
ahead of the game?'

1069
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,045
Ah well...
little good to know it now:

1070
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:06,131
The harm's done, the jig's up,

1071
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:09,777
You're thoroughly rattled.
Better you'd been born
with handless stumps.

1072
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:11,549
I recall

1073
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,154
A certain chill winter night

1074
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:16,030
On which my father took me

1075
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,636
To one of those
Calvinist fertility rites

1076
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:21,554
Disguised as
a father-and-son banquet.

1077
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:24,471
Master of the revels
was an acrid old goat

1078
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:26,452
Named Horace T. McGuiness.

1079
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,431
He opened his discourse

1080
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:30,725
With a series
of blasphemous demands

1081
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:33,331
That the almighty agree
with his ghastly notions,

1082
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:35,622
And then got down
to the meat of the program

1083
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:38,749
Which, to no one's surprise,
was girls.

1084
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,771
When you go out
with a young lady,
he slavered,

1085
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:44,689
You go out
with your own sister.

1086
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,357
It seemed plain to me

1087
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:49,692
That if one day
I did burst upon the world

1088
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:53,651
As the hymeneal Genghis khan
of my dreams,

1089
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,299
I would be in
for an extremely
incestuous time of it.

1090
00:51:57,301 --> 00:52:00,009
I can still hear
that demented old reprobate

1091
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,344
Howling his
bill of particulars
against poor Onan,

1092
00:52:03,345 --> 00:52:05,740
The bible's first
recorded masturbator,

1093
00:52:05,741 --> 00:52:07,826
Shaking his fist at us

1094
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:10,326
And sweating like
a diseased stoat.

1095
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:14,078
'he wasted his seed!

1096
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,413
Oh monstrous, shameful,
nameless act...

1097
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:20,122
He spilled it right out
onto the ground!

1098
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,790
<i>All</i> of it!'

1099
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,875
And this <i>displeased</i> the Lord,

1100
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:28,147
And the Lord
<i>slew</i> him!"

1101
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:31,482
Yet the more I think on it,

1102
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,775
The more positive I become

1103
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,652
That you will never
truly be able

1104
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,735
To comprehend in all its horror

1105
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,653
That interminably
sustained convulsion

1106
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:42,425
Which was your father's youth.

1107
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,342
It's only reasonable
that this should be so,

1108
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:47,740
Since you had
so many advantages

1109
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:50,553
That were denied to me.
To name but three of them...

1110
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:52,533
A private room,

1111
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:54,514
A masturbating father,

1112
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:57,120
And Albert Ellis, PhD.

1113
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:02,955
I carried the ball
for all of us,

1114
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:04,935
And carried it farther

1115
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:07,021
Than anyone had a right
to expect.

1116
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:09,416
I was the Prometheus

1117
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,396
Of my secret tribe...

1118
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,376
A penile virtuoso,

1119
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:15,460
A gonadic prodigy,

1120
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:17,858
A spermatiferous thunderbolt;

1121
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,941
In fine,

1122
00:53:19,942 --> 00:53:23,591
A masturbator's
masturbator."

1123
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:26,612
( blows air )

1124
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:31,614
I dreamed of living

1125
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:34,219
In luxurious exile
in Mexico city.

1126
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,617
Well, it was luxurious
for the first year.

1127
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:39,534
It was absolutely hellish
for the second year

1128
00:53:39,535 --> 00:53:41,514
Because I had assumed

1129
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:44,328
That I could get
a little underground work
from the north.

1130
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:46,934
It turned out
that I could get none.

1131
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:50,060
And I was sort of
heroically broke.

1132
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:53,186
Rouverol:
<i>Cleo was staunchly loyal</i>
<i>to Trumbo...</i>

1133
00:53:53,187 --> 00:53:55,167
<i>Staunchly loyal...</i>

1134
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:58,397
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that he stood for.</i>

1135
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,690
<i>So she accepted</i> <i>what had to be.</i>

1136
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:03,087
<i>By now the Trumbos</i>
<i>had kind of used up</i>

1137
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:04,964
<i>Most of their</i> <i>reserves</i>

1138
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:07,464
<i>And they knew</i> <i>that it was...</i>

1139
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:10,070
<i>They were going to have to</i>
<i>sooner or later come back,</i>

1140
00:54:09,966 --> 00:54:11,946
<i>And it had better be</i> <i>sooner.</i>

1141
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:15,279
There were ideas that
perhaps there were ways

1142
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:17,885
Of breaking into
the Mexican film industry

1143
00:54:17,886 --> 00:54:19,971
Or something like that.

1144
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:22,888
For my father none of this
ever paid off.

1145
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:34,142
"dear Dorothy and Seniel:

1146
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:36,123
To start in,

1147
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:40,083
I was a fool for moving
south of the border.

1148
00:54:40,084 --> 00:54:42,272
The line of supply
to my living source

1149
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:44,357
Was so tenuous
that when I did work

1150
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:46,441
The people who owed me for it

1151
00:54:46,442 --> 00:54:48,629
Mistook my absence
for my death,

1152
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,922
And simply did not pay

1153
00:54:50,923 --> 00:54:53,006
Without the strongest
kind of pressure

1154
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:54,673
Being exerted.

1155
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:57,070
We lived out an old truism:

1156
00:54:57,072 --> 00:54:59,571
'the first time you see Mexico

1157
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:02,490
You are struck
by the horrible poverty:

1158
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,762
Within a year you discover
it's infectious.'

1159
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:09,576
I'm as broke
as a bankrupt's bastard.

1160
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:12,702
When I arrived from Mexico,
I pulled into town

1161
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:15,308
With a wife,
three children,
a dog, a cat,

1162
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:18,121
One mortgaged jeep,

1163
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:20,623
And $400 in my pocket.

1164
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:23,229
There were other problems.

1165
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,312
I had lost all my
life insurance

1166
00:55:25,313 --> 00:55:27,605
During that disastrous
Mexican holiday.

1167
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:29,377
I lived on borrowed money

1168
00:55:29,378 --> 00:55:31,566
For the last nine months
of the visit.

1169
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:34,484
I couldn't even get
my furniture out of storage

1170
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:38,860
Because of a $1,200
storage Bill I couldn't pay.

1171
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:42,299
I sat down
in a motel in Pasadena

1172
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,384
With a dog, cat and one child,

1173
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:46,468
While Cleo and the two girls

1174
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:48,449
Moved in with my sister.

1175
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,262
Most of my black market
connections

1176
00:55:51,263 --> 00:55:53,348
Had dissolved
during my absence,

1177
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,953
And it was like trying
to find work at midnight

1178
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:58,141
In a thick fog among strangers.

1179
00:55:58,142 --> 00:56:00,954
Hence I started at the bottom,

1180
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:02,934
Like any newcomer,

1181
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:05,853
For as little
as $1,000 a script.

1182
00:56:05,854 --> 00:56:08,457
In the first 18 months

1183
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,855
I wrote 12 scripts...

1184
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:15,753
Which normally would take
between four and six
years to do.

1185
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:18,671
The necessity of keeping
the money grinding in

1186
00:56:18,672 --> 00:56:21,276
Made it impossible for me
to take as much as a month off

1187
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,674
And gamble on an original
which might sell for enough

1188
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:27,216
To give me more gambling room.

1189
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:32,010
Also, I am overly timid
and evasive

1190
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:34,511
When I owe money

1191
00:56:34,512 --> 00:56:37,951
And I can't see
just how I'm going to
pay it back.

1192
00:56:40,453 --> 00:56:44,307
This letter, then,
is an apology

1193
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:47,435
Which I hope you will be
generous enough to accept.

1194
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,749
I enclose a check for $50,

1195
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,147
Which I shall now be able
to repeat every month

1196
00:56:55,148 --> 00:56:58,272
Until the money
you so very graciously
lent me

1197
00:56:58,273 --> 00:57:00,879
Is paid off in full."

1198
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,091
One of the objects
of a blacklist

1199
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:13,905
Is to deprive the victim

1200
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:16,405
Of economic security

1201
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:19,949
And to drastically lower
his living standards

1202
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,034
To the point
where he will yield.

1203
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:24,847
Well, that being
their objective,

1204
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:28,599
My objective is to maintain
those living standards
in spite of it.

1205
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,664
Trumbo began to work
very very hard
and very fast.

1206
00:57:32,665 --> 00:57:35,268
<i>And he would have</i>
<i>three stories</i>
<i>going at once</i>

1207
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:37,354
<i>Because he was beginning</i>
<i>to have to sell stuff</i>

1208
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:39,854
<i>Under other names</i>
<i>or with a front.</i>

1209
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:41,730
So there were a lot of secrets.

1210
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:44,232
He had many, you know,
different names.

1211
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,045
And the phone would ring

1212
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,025
And it was never
the wrong number

1213
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:51,215
As far as I was concerned.
I'd always just
call my dad.

1214
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:53,299
Trumbo:
<i>I had 13 pseudonyms,</i>
<i>all told.</i>

1215
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,112
<i>I had Irish names.</i>
<i>I had Jewish names.</i>

1216
00:57:56,113 --> 00:57:58,508
<i>I had Anglo-Saxon names.</i>

1217
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:01,010
<i>Give them their preference.</i>

1218
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,617
<i>So you say</i>
<i>Sam Jackson calling</i>
<i>or Doc Abbott</i>

1219
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:06,637
<i>Or Theodore Flaxman</i>
<i>or Evelyn Dumain.</i>

1220
00:58:06,638 --> 00:58:08,098
My dad...
his best friend,

1221
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:10,807
One of the members
of this group, was Ian hunter.

1222
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:12,787
And Ian had an academy award.

1223
00:58:12,788 --> 00:58:16,121
Ian's was for this
beautiful movie called
"Roman holiday."

1224
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:19,873
<i>It wasn't until I was</i>
<i>in my early 30s</i>

1225
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:24,249
<i>That I learned</i>
<i>that Ian had not written</i>
<i>"Roman holiday."</i>

1226
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,376
<i>Trumbo had written</i>
<i>the original story.</i>

1227
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:29,877
<i>Ian had fronted for Trumbo.</i>

1228
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:33,004
<i>Ian hadn't been</i>
<i>blacklisted yet.</i>

1229
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:36,026
And when the credits
were redistributed

1230
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:38,840
Sometime in the '90s to Trumbo

1231
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:41,447
<i>The whole experience</i>
<i>was embarrassing.</i>

1232
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:45,198
<i>Just the blacklist</i>
<i>is a little bit more</i>
<i>complicated.</i>

1233
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,531
It just has these
repercussions.

1234
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:51,451
I thought a little wine
might be good.

1235
00:58:53,536 --> 00:58:55,097
Shall I cook something?

1236
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,077
No kitchen.

1237
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,372
Nothing to cook.
I always eat out.

1238
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,933
Do you like that?

1239
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:03,540
I like this knowledge
what one likes.

1240
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,250
Is it...?

1241
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,522
No, it isn't.

1242
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:15,940
Ray Murphy was a young man

1243
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:18,338
My father met
in the south pacific.

1244
00:59:18,339 --> 00:59:20,839
<i>Ray later became</i>
<i>a front for my father.</i>

1245
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,548
<i>And we needed</i>
<i>the money as usual</i>

1246
00:59:23,549 --> 00:59:25,840
When the script sold.

1247
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:28,551
And my father was expecting it

1248
00:59:28,552 --> 00:59:30,531
And it wasn't coming.

1249
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:32,198
So he made inquiries

1250
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:34,491
And a few weeks later
discovered

1251
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:37,617
<i>That Ray Murphy</i>
<i>had died suddenly.</i>

1252
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:41,369
"dear Mrs. Murphy,

1253
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,495
I want to tell you
about your son

1254
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,205
And my relationship with him,

1255
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:50,435
And of my wife's sorrow
and my own

1256
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:52,521
That he is no longer living.

1257
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,375
It has been
my privilege, since 1945,

1258
00:59:56,376 --> 00:59:58,252
To be Ray's friend.

1259
00:59:58,253 --> 01:00:01,691
It came about
in the following manner:

1260
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:04,609
In June of 1945

1261
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:07,216
A party of six or seven
war correspondents

1262
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:10,132
Embarked from
San Francisco by air

1263
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:14,197
On a three-month tour
of pacific battle areas.

1264
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:17,636
<i>Among the correspondents</i>
<i>were Ray and I.</i>

1265
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:19,721
<i>During the invasion</i> <i>of Borneo,</i>

1266
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,284
<i>Ray and I went ashore</i>
<i>in a landing craft</i>

1267
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,577
<i>Between the first</i>
<i>and second waves,</i>

1268
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,348
Dodging mortar fire

1269
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:27,640
As we sprinted across the sand.

1270
01:00:27,641 --> 01:00:31,184
From a slit trench outside
the governor's palace

1271
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:33,684
Ray and I spotted a hilltop

1272
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:36,290
Which we believed
would give us a better view

1273
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:39,312
Of what was going on,
and decided to climb it.

1274
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:41,606
When we finally reached
the top of the hill

1275
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:44,002
We found an abandoned AA Gun

1276
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,504
That had been knocked out
by naval fire,

1277
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:49,526
And no sign of a human being.

1278
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,609
We took what cover we could

1279
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,008
When we heard sounds
of approaching troops,

1280
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:56,821
Thinking the Japanese
were returning.

1281
01:00:56,822 --> 01:01:00,364
Moments later a grim-looking
Australian assault group

1282
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,448
With fixed bayonets appeared

1283
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:05,262
Expecting to meet the enemy.

1284
01:01:05,263 --> 01:01:08,180
Well in advance
of our armed forces,

1285
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:10,160
As it turned out,

1286
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:15,371
Ray and I had accidentally
captured the hill.

1287
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,977
<i>On the fourth day</i>
<i>of the campaign,</i>

1288
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:20,687
<i>The outcome being</i> <i>beyond doubt,</i>

1289
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:23,708
<i>Our group decided</i>
<i>to return to Tawi Tawi.</i>

1290
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:26,626
Once off we retired
into the main cabin.

1291
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:30,795
Somewhere off Japanese
occupied celebes,

1292
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:33,400
The alarm signifying
an air attack

1293
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:35,588
Went off in the cabin.

1294
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:37,985
It could only mean that a zero

1295
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:40,592
Had risen from celebes
and was attacking.

1296
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:43,613
I was on the top bunk.
I looked down.

1297
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:46,948
Ray was lying full length
on the floor

1298
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:49,657
Between two other men,
his helmet on.

1299
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:52,159
He looked up at me

1300
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,451
And although his face was,
I daresay,

1301
01:01:54,452 --> 01:01:56,640
As pale as my own, he smiled.

1302
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:58,620
Then he said,

1303
01:01:58,621 --> 01:02:02,684
'goodbye, Trumbo.'

1304
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,769
I cannot quite describe

1305
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,270
My emotions at that moment.

1306
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:10,814
Perhaps I thought of
my own son, then only four;

1307
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:13,939
Perhaps I thought
of my father long dead;

1308
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:18,733
I certainly felt that a son
not my son

1309
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:22,069
Had chosen me
from among that company

1310
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:26,028
As the one he wished
to say goodbye to,

1311
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:28,426
And that a father
not his father

1312
01:02:28,427 --> 01:02:30,615
Had responded.

1313
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:33,532
The fact,
as it later turned out,

1314
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:37,388
That there was no zero
within a hundred Miles
and no danger.

1315
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:40,619
That the whole incident
was a ludicrous mistake
of nerves

1316
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,808
On the part of the crew

1317
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:45,413
In no way diminishes
my memory of that moment,

1318
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:50,624
Nor the surge of love
I felt for your son.

1319
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:57,084
We managed to correspond
intermittently ever since.

1320
01:02:57,086 --> 01:02:59,065
Ray went to India,

1321
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,774
And later published
his first novel;

1322
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:06,256
I went before
the house committee
on un-American activities

1323
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:09,486
And later
served my first term
in a penitentiary.

1324
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:11,572
I was at that time,
as I am now,

1325
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:15,635
Blacklisted
by motion pictures,
publishers, and magazines.

1326
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:18,242
It was typical
of his generous nature

1327
01:03:18,243 --> 01:03:21,992
That he offered
to collaborate with me
for motion pictures,

1328
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:24,077
And to put his name alone

1329
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:26,994
To the product of our
mutual endeavors.

1330
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:31,372
It was typical of my need
that I accepted.

1331
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:33,664
During our last visits,

1332
01:03:33,665 --> 01:03:36,582
<i>In a moment</i>
<i>of temporary depression</i>

1333
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:39,500
<i>Common to young men</i>
<i>who are both sensitive</i>

1334
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:42,002
And intelligent
beyond their years,

1335
01:03:42,004 --> 01:03:43,982
Ray told me

1336
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:46,691
That he thought
he believed in nothing;

1337
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,818
He felt himself
a complete cynic.

1338
01:03:49,819 --> 01:03:52,840
It was, of course, not true.

1339
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:55,550
A day or two later

1340
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:57,426
When he brought a copy
of my novel

1341
01:03:57,427 --> 01:04:00,032
'Johnny got his gun'
for me to inscribe,

1342
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:02,532
I wrote in it
what I really felt

1343
01:04:02,533 --> 01:04:06,492
About him and his future.

1344
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:10,660
He telephoned me
the next day to thank me.

1345
01:04:10,661 --> 01:04:13,891
He said, 'I hope
I can live up to it.'

1346
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,975
I should have told him then,

1347
01:04:15,976 --> 01:04:18,372
And now have only you to tell

1348
01:04:18,373 --> 01:04:21,292
That he already had."

1349
01:04:25,564 --> 01:04:27,649
Man:
<i>Prisoner, show yourself.</i>

1350
01:04:33,693 --> 01:04:37,340
( coughing )

1351
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,946
Give me the name
and you're back
on full rations.

1352
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:44,947
Just one name.

1353
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,658
I was born skinny.

1354
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:52,765
Then you'll die.

1355
01:04:55,995 --> 01:04:58,496
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>In 1957 or '58</i>

1356
01:04:58,497 --> 01:05:02,039
<i>The situation</i>
<i>in Hollywood in terms of</i>
<i>blacklisted writers is</i>

1357
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,437
Unless you cooperate
with the committee,

1358
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:07,458
Unless you, you know,
do what it asks you to,

1359
01:05:07,459 --> 01:05:09,125
You won't be employed.

1360
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:12,668
Navasky:
<i>The next generation</i>
<i>of witnesses</i>

1361
01:05:12,669 --> 01:05:15,274
<i>Faced a different</i>
<i>sort of choice.</i>

1362
01:05:15,275 --> 01:05:17,777
<i>They could take the first</i>
<i>amendment like the 10</i>

1363
01:05:17,778 --> 01:05:20,485
<i>And then their assumption was</i>
<i>they'd go to prison;</i>

1364
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:22,883
<i>They could take</i>
<i>the fifth amendment</i>

1365
01:05:22,779 --> 01:05:24,341
<i>Which would keep them</i>
<i>out of prison,</i>

1366
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:26,009
<i>But they would then</i>
<i>be blacklisted;</i>

1367
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,822
<i>Or they could cooperate</i>
<i>with the committee.</i>

1368
01:05:28,823 --> 01:05:32,052
If they did that and admitted

1369
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,034
That they had been members
of the communist party,

1370
01:05:34,035 --> 01:05:36,639
The next question was, "and who
else was a member with you?"

1371
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,931
<i>Larry parks was</i>
<i>the first witness</i>

1372
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:41,121
In the new round
of witnesses in 1951,

1373
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:44,350
And parks was ready
to talk about himself.

1374
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:47,164
He was ready to talk about
why he joined the party,

1375
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:50,498
Which he said was
because it was the most
liberal thing around

1376
01:05:50,499 --> 01:05:52,376
And then he got out.
And he said,

1377
01:05:52,377 --> 01:05:55,709
"but don't make me name names.
Don't make me play
the informer."

1378
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,003
<i>Don't present me</i>
<i>with the choice</i>

1379
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:00,713
<i>Of either being in contempt</i>
<i>to this committee</i>

1380
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:02,796
<i>And going to jail</i>

1381
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,880
<i>Or forcing me</i>

1382
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:06,966
<i>To crawl through the mud</i>
<i>to be an informer.</i>

1383
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,840
<i>I beg you</i>

1384
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:11,342
<i>Not to force me</i>
<i>to do this."</i>

1385
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,219
Navasky:
<i>They insisted</i>
<i>that he name names</i>

1386
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,928
And from then on
you had to name names

1387
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:18,741
In order to get cleared
by the committee.

1388
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:21,346
It is only a matter of time.

1389
01:06:21,347 --> 01:06:23,118
You think so?

1390
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,828
He's on half rations now.
You can't exist on that.

1391
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:29,579
Forced to choose between
starvation and telling,

1392
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,081
What would <i>you</i> do?

1393
01:06:32,082 --> 01:06:34,894
We're not talking about me.
What would <i>you</i> do?

1394
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:37,292
I looked hard at Dalton
and I thought,

1395
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:40,417
What is it about this Guy
that would not...

1396
01:06:40,418 --> 01:06:43,232
Which would make him say,
"no, I'm not giving names."

1397
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:48,130
<i>And that was</i>
<i>a psychic death kind of.</i>

1398
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:51,256
Because you just
lost everything.

1399
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,487
You were never to work again.
You were never to have
any money.

1400
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:56,571
You went to jail.

1401
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:58,863
I remember doing an interview

1402
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,635
<i>With Adrian Scott</i>

1403
01:07:00,636 --> 01:07:02,721
<i>Who was one of</i>
<i>the Hollywood 10.</i>

1404
01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:05,117
<i>I visited him</i> <i>in his home</i>

1405
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:08,452
<i>And all of the furniture</i>
<i>was gone.</i>

1406
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:13,350
He was sitting on the floor

1407
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:16,788
With a crate in front of him

1408
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,291
<i>And a typewriter</i>
<i>on top of the crate,</i>

1409
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:23,041
<i>And on the wall was</i>

1410
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:25,544
A photograph
of Franklin Roosevelt.

1411
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:29,087
And that was all there was
in this house.

1412
01:07:32,005 --> 01:07:34,505
I'm really speaking
of the personal experience

1413
01:07:34,506 --> 01:07:37,111
Of a man who was fortunate
during this period.

1414
01:07:37,112 --> 01:07:41,696
It was a matter of total
disaster for others...

1415
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:44,927
Financial, matrimonial,

1416
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:48,053
For some of their children.

1417
01:07:48,054 --> 01:07:51,180
Wherever you are,
at some point somebody
discovers

1418
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,681
<i>That Dalton Trumbo</i>
<i>was Dalton Trumbo.</i>

1419
01:07:56,391 --> 01:07:58,995
Mitzi Trumbo:
<i>We clearly stood out.</i>

1420
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,602
<i>We were a different</i>
<i>kind of family.</i>

1421
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:07,855
Dalton Trumbo:
<i>It is that we were</i>
<i>thrust inward as a family.</i>

1422
01:08:07,856 --> 01:08:10,564
<i>We were thrust</i> <i>upon ourselves.</i>

1423
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:12,753
And we relied
upon each other more

1424
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:15,463
And trusted each other more
and helped each other more.

1425
01:08:18,589 --> 01:08:21,090
Mitzi Trumbo:
<i>I felt we were</i>
<i>a very close family.</i>

1426
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:29,218
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>What you need is a person</i>
<i>who is outraged</i>

1427
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,449
<i>By the fact</i>
<i>that Dalton Trumbo lives</i>
<i>in the neighborhood</i>

1428
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,534
<i>And, two,</i> <i>that his daughter</i>

1429
01:08:34,535 --> 01:08:37,660
<i>Actually goes to school</i>
<i>with their children.</i>

1430
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,287
Mitzi:
<i>It was beginning</i>
<i>fifth grade.</i>

1431
01:08:43,288 --> 01:08:45,268
<i>I think I was</i> <i>10 years old.</i>

1432
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,249
<i>And it was pretty awful</i>
<i>at school.</i>

1433
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,019
And I didn't tell them
about it,

1434
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,103
Because when you're a kid

1435
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:53,502
You pretty much think
it's your problem
to deal with,

1436
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:56,418
Until it got to the point

1437
01:08:56,419 --> 01:08:58,608
Where I just couldn't go
to school anymore

1438
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:02,151
And finally let them know
what was happening.

1439
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:12,156
"to Mrs. Eleanor
Barr wheeler,

1440
01:09:12,157 --> 01:09:14,761
Principal,
Annandale elementary school.

1441
01:09:14,762 --> 01:09:17,366
My dear Mrs. Wheeler,

1442
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:19,450
We entrusted to your care

1443
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:21,325
A happy, healthy,

1444
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:23,514
Comparatively
well-adjusted

1445
01:09:23,515 --> 01:09:26,223
<i>And demonstrably</i>
<i>intelligent child</i>

1446
01:09:26,224 --> 01:09:29,767
Who loved school,
adored her teachers

1447
01:09:29,768 --> 01:09:31,749
<i>And enjoyed</i> <i>the friendship</i>

1448
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,978
<i>Of her small circle</i>
<i>of contemporaries.</i>

1449
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:38,104
<i>Eight months later</i>
<i>you have returned to us</i>

1450
01:09:38,105 --> 01:09:40,606
<i>A spiritually devastated</i>
<i>human being</i>

1451
01:09:40,607 --> 01:09:43,629
<i>Who begs us not to send her</i>
<i>to school.</i>

1452
01:09:45,713 --> 01:09:48,317
I am informed
that within the P.T.A.

1453
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,401
And the bluebirds

1454
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:53,215
There have been a series
of small secret meetings

1455
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:54,987
Devoted to a discussion

1456
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:58,113
Of Mrs. Trumbo's character,
and of mine,

1457
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:01,553
And what to do about us.

1458
01:10:01,554 --> 01:10:05,200
Since no one
has come to our home
to discuss at first hand

1459
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,598
The problems which
so deeply trouble them,

1460
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:11,036
We have obviously been tried
and condemned in absentia,

1461
01:10:11,037 --> 01:10:13,850
And the verdict
has filtered down

1462
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:17,290
From parent to child.

1463
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,250
<i>Mitzi,</i>

1464
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,960
<i>Who started out</i>
<i>the school year</i>
<i>with many friends,</i>

1465
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:26,773
<i>Has found herself</i>
<i>in the past three months</i>

1466
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:28,961
<i>The object</i> <i>of the scorn</i>

1467
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:31,047
<i>And ridicule</i> <i>and hatred</i>

1468
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:34,797
<i>Of those</i> <i>she liked most.</i>

1469
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:37,403
<i>Small childish</i> <i>conspiracies</i>

1470
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:39,801
<i>Are directed</i> <i>against her...</i>

1471
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,675
Patterned in secret

1472
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:44,594
After the conspiracies
of the parents...

1473
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:47,615
And she is quietly
and incessantly persecuted

1474
01:10:47,616 --> 01:10:49,597
And boycotted and shunned

1475
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:52,098
As long as
the school day lasts.

1476
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:55,953
This slow murder

1477
01:10:55,954 --> 01:10:58,767
Of the mind
and heart and spirit
of a young child

1478
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,372
Is the proud outcome

1479
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:05,019
Of the patriotic meetings
held by a few parents,

1480
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,105
Under the sponsorship
of the P.T.A.

1481
01:11:07,106 --> 01:11:09,814
And the bluebirds.

1482
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,898
<i>I should like you</i> <i>to watch</i>

1483
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,983
<i>How decently and bravely</i>
<i>our daughter tries</i>

1484
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:15,755
<i>To suppress</i> <i>her bewilderment</i>

1485
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,943
<i>At her first encounter</i>
<i>with barbarism</i>

1486
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:20,445
<i>Parading as</i> <i>American virtue,</i>

1487
01:11:20,446 --> 01:11:22,737
<i>Barbarism which began</i>

1488
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:27,426
<i>At your school</i>
<i>among adult persons.</i>

1489
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:29,511
<i>Now that</i> <i>we have discovered</i>

1490
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:32,115
<i>The source</i> <i>of matzo's agony,</i>

1491
01:11:32,116 --> 01:11:34,410
We shall naturally secure
competent treatment

1492
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:37,222
To rid her of the scars
already inflicted.

1493
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,306
If it then seems advisable

1494
01:11:39,307 --> 01:11:42,015
We shall employ
competent counsel

1495
01:11:42,017 --> 01:11:43,683
To seek a court test

1496
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:46,186
Of the responsibilities
of the school

1497
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:48,374
And of school organizations

1498
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,812
For the mental health
of the children
entrusted to it.

1499
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:54,730
For it is within these
school organizations

1500
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:57,128
That Mitzi has suffered
an assault.

1501
01:11:57,129 --> 01:12:00,254
That the assault has been
upon her personality

1502
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,067
And that the injury
she has sustained is psychic

1503
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:06,610
Makes it no less real than if,
in a physical sense,

1504
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:09,320
The men and women
of the P.T.A.

1505
01:12:09,321 --> 01:12:11,197
And the officials
of the bluebirds

1506
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,844
Had incited their children
to trample her senseless

1507
01:12:14,845 --> 01:12:17,972
On the blacktop
of the playground."

1508
01:12:20,993 --> 01:12:24,328
Dalton Trumbo:
<i>That was the quality</i>
<i>of hatred.</i>

1509
01:12:24,329 --> 01:12:28,392
<i>It wasn't just against me</i>
<i>or our daughter.</i>

1510
01:12:28,393 --> 01:12:32,351
<i>It was against everything</i>
<i>that is strange,</i>

1511
01:12:32,353 --> 01:12:35,061
<i>Everything that is</i> <i>different.</i>

1512
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:38,500
<i>And that</i> <i>of course is...</i>

1513
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:44,023
<i>Is the beginning</i>
<i>of the apocalypse.</i>

1514
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:46,213
<i>( crowd cheering )</i>

1515
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:56,633
Rouverol:
<i>One Sunday Hugo and I</i>
<i>and Trumbo and Cleo</i>

1516
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,927
<i>Went to a bullfight.</i>

1517
01:12:58,928 --> 01:13:02,054
<i>Hugo identified</i>
<i>with the bullfighter</i>

1518
01:13:02,055 --> 01:13:04,138
<i>And Trumbo identified</i>
<i>with the bull.</i>

1519
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:09,660
So in this case
it was a bad kill.

1520
01:13:09,662 --> 01:13:12,996
<i>The bull was stabbed</i>
<i>through the throat</i>

1521
01:13:12,997 --> 01:13:14,664
<i>And bled profusely.</i>

1522
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:17,998
And Trumbo and Cleo
were absolutely livid.

1523
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:20,604
They were simply horrified.

1524
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,583
They could hardly speak.

1525
01:13:22,584 --> 01:13:24,773
<i>And within</i> <i>a couple of months</i>

1526
01:13:24,774 --> 01:13:28,732
Trumbo has gotten the idea
for an original,

1527
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:31,547
Which emerged finally
as "the brave one."

1528
01:13:34,673 --> 01:13:38,217
Trumbo: <i>On the day that</i>
<i>the academy nominations</i>
<i>were announced,</i>

1529
01:13:38,218 --> 01:13:40,822
<i>It was announced that</i>
<i>Robert rich was nominated.</i>

1530
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:44,469
Robert rich was one
of my father's fronts.

1531
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,865
Robert rich was
an actual person.

1532
01:13:46,866 --> 01:13:50,201
He was the nephew
of the king brothers
who had produced the picture.

<i>( fanfare )</i>

Dalton Trumbo:
<i>That night no one appeared</i>
<i>to pick up the award.</i>

1542
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:21,674
<i>The next morning six other</i>
<i>Robert riches announced</i>

1543
01:14:21,675 --> 01:14:24,487
<i>That they had written it</i>
<i>and demanded the award.</i>

1544
01:14:24,488 --> 01:14:27,197
That Oscar became

1545
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:29,698
The only unclaimed Oscar,
I believe,

1546
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,033
In the whole history
of the academy awards.

1547
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:35,950
I remember as a child

1548
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:40,120
Seeing a photo composite,

1549
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:43,247
<i>That they were</i>
<i>trying to reconstruct</i>
<i>who Robert rich was.</i>

1550
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:45,019
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>As a result there</i>
<i>came to be</i>

1551
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,791
<i>A search</i> <i>for Robert rich.</i>

1552
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:49,499
This was an opportunity
that my father seized upon

1553
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,313
And used

1554
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:55,961
<i>To bring the idea</i>
<i>of blacklisted writers</i>
<i>to a head,</i>

1555
01:14:55,962 --> 01:14:58,567
<i>That it couldn't be</i>
<i>ignored anymore.</i>

1556
01:14:58,568 --> 01:15:02,317
Mr. Trumbo, did you write
"the brave one"?

1557
01:15:02,318 --> 01:15:05,027
Well, you see,
I've been accused

1558
01:15:05,028 --> 01:15:07,215
Of writing many pictures
in the last 10 years

1559
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:09,613
During the period
of the blacklist.

1560
01:15:09,614 --> 01:15:12,426
So I've had to make a policy
about such questions.

1561
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:14,510
My policy is

1562
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:17,533
That I modestly refuse

1563
01:15:17,534 --> 01:15:19,825
Either to confirm or to deny.

1564
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:23,161
In this way I receive
just a little bit of credit

1565
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:26,391
From almost every
good picture that's made.

1566
01:15:26,392 --> 01:15:28,788
And for some reason

1567
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:31,394
<i>I never get blamed</i>
<i>for the scamps.</i>

1568
01:15:39,419 --> 01:15:42,128
"the name Robert rich

1569
01:15:42,129 --> 01:15:46,609
Lends itself
magnificently to jokes

1570
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,485
And may even be

1571
01:15:48,486 --> 01:15:51,194
The invention of a jokester.

1572
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:53,695
But it nonetheless contains,

1573
01:15:53,696 --> 01:15:56,300
As every really good joke must,

1574
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:00,053
An essential element of tragedy

1575
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:04,950
Or horror or disgrace

1576
01:16:04,952 --> 01:16:08,389
Or doom.

1577
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:12,454
Robert rich
is the unknown artist.

1578
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:15,476
He is the fugitive American
of our time.

1579
01:16:15,477 --> 01:16:19,958
And it is my purpose
and determination

1580
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:22,250
That his name
shall be remembered

1581
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:24,960
As a symbol
of this national disgrace

1582
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:27,878
Long after the blacklist itself

1583
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:32,047
Has been destroyed.

1584
01:16:32,048 --> 01:16:34,130
For I have seen the blacklist

1585
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:37,362
That produced Robert rich.

1586
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:40,071
I know its pain
and its frustration

1587
01:16:40,072 --> 01:16:41,738
And its horror

1588
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,823
And its shattering cruelties.

1589
01:16:43,824 --> 01:16:45,802
I have seen families

1590
01:16:45,803 --> 01:16:48,929
Rendered by it
destitute overnight.

1591
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,014
I have seen broken homes

1592
01:16:51,015 --> 01:16:54,765
And heartbroken children
and sorrowing friends.

1593
01:16:54,766 --> 01:16:58,308
I have seen its hideous
waste of talent

1594
01:16:58,309 --> 01:17:00,289
And of love,

1595
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:04,248
Of friendship and of life.

1596
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:06,333
I have long served

1597
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:09,356
In this lowly marching army
of the anonymous.

1598
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:11,336
<i>And walking among</i> <i>its ranks,</i>

1599
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:13,316
<i>I have seen</i>

1600
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:15,609
<i>The figure of death.</i>

1601
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:18,215
<i>And helplessly</i> <i>I have watched</i>

1602
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,611
<i>Decent men and women die</i>

1603
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:23,216
<i>Before their stories</i>
<i>had been told,</i>

1604
01:17:23,217 --> 01:17:26,134
<i>Before their work</i> <i>was finished</i>

1605
01:17:26,135 --> 01:17:29,885
<i>Before their normal span</i>
<i>of years had been lived out.</i>

1606
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:34,367
<i>Every trade,</i>
<i>every profession now has</i>

1607
01:17:34,368 --> 01:17:38,744
<i>Its roll call</i> <i>of honored dead.</i>

1608
01:17:38,745 --> 01:17:43,121
I can make no more jokes
about Robert rich.

1609
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:45,935
They turn sour on my tongue.

1610
01:17:45,936 --> 01:17:48,748
I can invent no more witticisms

1611
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:51,042
About the Oscar
he dares not claim

1612
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:54,793
Because that small,
worthless golden statuette

1613
01:17:54,794 --> 01:17:58,441
Is covered with the blood
of my friends.

1614
01:17:58,442 --> 01:18:01,150
I cannot laugh about it
any longer

1615
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:03,652
Because my belly is filled

1616
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:06,152
With the poison
of this blacklist

1617
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:09,279
And my heart is filled
with its grief

1618
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,365
And my ears roar with rage

1619
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:14,073
At its injustices.

1620
01:18:14,074 --> 01:18:17,200
And my heart for the first time

1621
01:18:17,201 --> 01:18:22,099
Is filled with something
very close to hate."

1622
01:18:24,912 --> 01:18:27,934
I have a daughter.

1623
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:30,539
She's 13 years old.

1624
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:35,229
I've been blacklisted
since she was three.

1625
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,208
She's known the title

1626
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:40,439
Of every motion picture
I've written in this study

1627
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,357
And she's kept
that title secret.

1628
01:18:43,358 --> 01:18:45,547
My parents and I
watched the academy awards

1629
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:48,673
The night that Robert rich won

1630
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:52,216
And I was so thrilled.
And I was saying,

1631
01:18:52,217 --> 01:18:55,238
"daddy, let's go
get it tomorrow.
Let's go pick it up."

1632
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:57,323
And he said,
"well, you know, we can't."

1633
01:18:57,324 --> 01:19:00,033
When her friends say to her,
as children do,

1634
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:02,638
"my father does so and so;
What does your father do?"

1635
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:07,432
This has confronted her
with a very real problem.

1636
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,516
It confronts her
with the problem...

1637
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,497
And has since she was three...

1638
01:19:11,498 --> 01:19:14,830
Of who her father really is

1639
01:19:14,831 --> 01:19:19,625
And what her father
really does.

1640
01:19:19,626 --> 01:19:22,229
I think

1641
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:26,815
I will give this Oscar,
if I get it, to that girl.

1642
01:19:26,816 --> 01:19:30,671
I think I will tell her,

1643
01:19:30,672 --> 01:19:32,963
"well, here is one secret

1644
01:19:32,964 --> 01:19:37,550
You no longer need
to be burdened with."

1645
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:39,842
I'll tell her,

1646
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:42,656
"we have our names
back again."

1647
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:46,511
I bring a message
from your master,

1648
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:49,638
<i>Marcus licinius Crassus,</i>

1649

<i>Commander of Italy.</i>

<i>merciful excellency,</i>

<i>Your lives are</i> <i>to be spared.</i>

1652

01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:06,521
<i>Slaves you were</i>
<i>and slaves you remain,</i>

1654
01:20:06,522 --> 01:20:09,751
But the terrible penalty

1655
01:20:09,752 --> 01:20:11,940
<i>Has been set aside</i>

1656
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:14,338
<i>On the single</i> <i>condition</i>

1657
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:18,297
<i>That you identify the body</i>
<i>or the living person</i>

1658
01:20:18,298 --> 01:20:21,946
<i>Of the slave called</i> <i>Spartacus!</i>

1659
01:20:32,993 --> 01:20:34,764

1660
01:20:34,765 --> 01:20:36,536
I'm Spartacus.

01:20:37,995 --> 01:20:39,662
I'm Spartacus.

- I'm Spartacus.
- I'm Spartacus.

1665
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:46,957
All:
I'm Spartacus.

1666
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:56,961
I'm Spartacus.

1667

<i>( slaves continue</i> <i>shouting )</i>

1668
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:13,114
You know, when you get close

1669
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:16,033
To 90 years of age

1670
01:21:16,034 --> 01:21:18,221
You look back

1671
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:21,973
And you try to remember

1672
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:27,079
The things that you're
not quite proud of

1673
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:31,039
And if there are the things
that you're proud of.

1674
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,436
I find one thing

1675
01:21:33,437 --> 01:21:36,251
That I was very proud of.

1676
01:21:36,252 --> 01:21:40,002
<i>I employed</i> <i>Dalton Trumbo</i>

1677
01:21:40,003 --> 01:21:45,108
<i>To write the screenplay</i>
<i>of "Spartacus."</i>

1678
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,297
Trumbo's name appears
on two films in 1960...

1679
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,485
<i>On "exodus"</i> <i>and "Spartacus"...</i>

1680
01:21:49,486 --> 01:21:51,571
<i>After years in which</i>
<i>none of his peers</i>

1681
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:54,071
<i>Could get credited</i> <i>on films.</i>

1682
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:55,843
I had lunch with Mr. Krim
and Benjamin

1683
01:21:55,844 --> 01:22:00,324
<i>And I said that I want</i>
<i>to give Trumbo credit...</i>

1684

<i>official screen credit</i>
<i>as Dalton Trumbo.</i>

1685
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:07,618
And they said to me,
"you have autonomy
of contract."

1686
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:11,475
If you want to give him
screen credit,

1687
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:14,809
We won't publicly
agree with you

<i>But we will not stop you.</i>
<i>Do whatever you like."</i>

1689
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:21,063
I know it. I feel it.
Either you compromise
or you lose.

1690
01:22:21,064 --> 01:22:23,460
We won't lose.

1691
01:22:23,461 --> 01:22:25,858
Kate Lardner:

1692
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:29,817

<i>going to see "exodus"</i>
<i>with my family.</i>

1693
01:22:29,818 --> 01:22:31,485
I sensed the family pride,

1694
01:22:31,486 --> 01:22:34,819
The pride of the community,

1695
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,883
You know, that this man's name

1696
01:22:38,884 --> 01:22:42,218
Was on the work

1697
01:22:42,219 --> 01:22:46,908
And it might make it
easier for the others.

1698
01:22:46,909 --> 01:22:49,098
Christopher Trumbo:
<i>Everything for him</i>
<i>comes down to</i>

1699
01:22:48,994 --> 01:22:50,869
<i>Some very simple</i> <i>attitudes</i>

1700
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:53,265
<i>And some very</i> <i>simple beliefs.</i>

1701
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:55,455
<i>And he just doesn't</i>
<i>stray from those,</i>

1702
01:22:55,456 --> 01:22:58,788
<i>Which goes back</i> <i>to his ideas</i>

1703
01:22:58,789 --> 01:23:00,873
About the first amendment,

1704
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:02,853
Freedom, what it is,

1705
01:23:02,854 --> 01:23:05,042
The way a man operates
in society.

1706
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:07,961
Donald Sutherland:
<i>We were talking and he</i>
<i>looked at us and he said,</i>

1707
01:23:07,962 --> 01:23:10,981
"don't forget
to be happy."

1708
01:23:10,982 --> 01:23:14,421
And I thought,
"God, reflected in that

1709
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:19,423
Must be so much pain
and suffering

1710
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:24,217
For the political
commitment he made

1711
01:23:24,218 --> 01:23:27,657
That put him
on that blacklist."

1712
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:29,949
All over the world...

1713
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,137
Here, there and everywhere...

1714
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:35,576
Is this immoral
assertion of power

1715
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:38,807
Over the most private
thoughts of men

1716
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:41,829
And the assertion by government

1717
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:45,477
That it has the power
to compel men to tell,

1718
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:48,082
To recant,
to disgrace themselves,

1719
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,271
To swear they were idiots,

1720
01:23:50,272 --> 01:23:53,605
To revoke their past
and to spit on their work.

1721
01:23:53,606 --> 01:23:55,691
This is what government wants

1722
01:23:55,692 --> 01:23:58,401
In greater or less degree
all over the world.

1723
01:23:58,402 --> 01:24:01,005
And this is what nobody...

1724
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:03,507
Nobody can do.

1725
01:24:04,862 --> 01:24:07,258
"I've delivered newspapers,

1726
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:09,863
Peddled vegetables,
clerked in stores,

1727
01:24:09,864 --> 01:24:12,260
Waited on tables,
washed automobiles,

1728
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,970
Picked fruit, hosed down
infected cadavers,

1729
01:24:14,971 --> 01:24:18,513
Shoveled sugar beets,
iced refrigerator cars;

1730
01:24:18,514 --> 01:24:20,597
Laid rails with a section gang,

1731
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,265
Reported for newspapers,

1732
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,350
Served an eight-year hitch
on the night shift

1733
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,017
Of a large industrial plant.

1734
01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:29,560
I looked at many
American faces:

1735
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:32,895
I've seen them
as flack burst around them

1736
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,188
9,000 feet over Japan;

1737
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:38,522
In a slit trench on Okinawa
watching the night Sky

1738
01:24:38,523 --> 01:24:41,232
To see where the next
bomb would fall;

1739
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:43,420
In an assault boat as they
moved toward a beach

1740
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:46,340
That tossed more violently
than the surf through which
they rode.

1741
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:49,152
I've counseled with
a paroled prostitute

1742
01:24:49,153 --> 01:24:51,862
On how she might escape
the clutches of a policeman

1743
01:24:51,863 --> 01:24:54,571
Who had caught her
and was stealing
half her earnings

1744
01:24:54,572 --> 01:24:57,074
And sending his friends
to her with courtesy cards

1745
01:24:57,075 --> 01:24:59,782
That entitled them
to take her without pay.

1746
01:24:59,784 --> 01:25:03,325
I've been asked
by Louis B. Mayer
why I had no religion,

1747
01:25:03,326 --> 01:25:06,140
And by a ranking member
of the state department

1748
01:25:06,141 --> 01:25:08,433
How I could bring myself
to work with

1749
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,933
'all those
Hollywood Jews.'

1750
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:14,268
I've seen American faces
in a congregational church
in New Hampshire,

1751
01:25:14,269 --> 01:25:17,187
Where a colleague and I
traveled with a bodyguard
of students.

1752
01:25:17,188 --> 01:25:20,833
I've seen their faces
in a miners' union hall
in Duluth

1753
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,606
On a night when
the wind off the lake

1754
01:25:22,607 --> 01:25:25,212
Blew the snow
so killingly and so deep

1755
01:25:25,213 --> 01:25:28,650
Cars couldn't be used
and everybody walked
to the meeting.

1756
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:31,464
I've seen their faces
in the banquet room
of a new York hotel

1757
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,860
When the American
booksellers' association

1758
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:35,945
Gave me a national book award;

1759
01:25:35,946 --> 01:25:38,551
And I've seen them again
in the jury box

1760
01:25:38,552 --> 01:25:41,364
As each of them twice said
'guilty as charged, '

1761
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:44,177
While one of them wept
as she said it.

1762
01:25:44,178 --> 01:25:47,096
While one of them
wept as she said it.

1763
01:25:47,097 --> 01:25:49,181
I've been stripped by Americans

1764
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:51,994
And paraded naked
with them and before them

1765
01:25:51,995 --> 01:25:54,287
And obediently bent over
on command

1766
01:25:54,288 --> 01:25:57,725
To present my anus
for contraband clearance.

1767
01:25:57,726 --> 01:25:59,914
I've lived with and trusted

1768
01:25:59,915 --> 01:26:02,312
And been trusted by
car thieves and abortionists

1769
01:26:02,313 --> 01:26:04,709
And moonshiners
and embezzlers and burglars

1770
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:07,731
And Jehovah's witnesses
and Quakers.

1771
01:26:07,732 --> 01:26:09,607
I've stood on a gray day

1772
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:12,316
In the fifth marine division
cemetery on Iwo Jima,

1773
01:26:12,317 --> 01:26:14,402
And looked off at the graves

1774
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:18,256
Of 2,198 Americans.

1775
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:20,342
In the center
of all those graves

1776
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,216
On a slim white pole

1777
01:26:22,217 --> 01:26:25,239
On a concrete pedestal
flew the American flag.

1778
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,512
And I swear it was not
the flag of informers.

1779
01:26:31,076 --> 01:26:33,263
And if I could take a census

1780
01:26:33,265 --> 01:26:36,181
Of all the American faces
I have seen

1781
01:26:36,182 --> 01:26:39,829
And of all the dead
whose graves I have
looked on...

1782
01:26:39,829 --> 01:26:42,435
If I could ask them
one simple question:

1783
01:26:42,436 --> 01:26:47,332
'would you like a man
who told on his friend?'...

1784
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,416
There would not be
one among them

1785
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:52,126
Who would answer yes.

1786
01:26:52,127 --> 01:26:55,774
But, show me the man
who informs on friends
who have harmed no one,

1787
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:58,380
And who thereafter
earns money he could not
have earned before,

1788
01:26:58,381 --> 01:27:01,611
And I will show you
not a decent citizen,
not a patriot,

1789
01:27:01,612 --> 01:27:03,798
But a miserable scoundrel
who will,

1790
01:27:03,799 --> 01:27:05,883
If new pressures arise
and the price is right,

1791
01:27:05,884 --> 01:27:09,634
Betray not just his friends
but his country itself.

1792
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:11,719
I don't know
one Hollywood informer

1793
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,428
Who acted
except under duress
and for money;

1794
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:17,346
Such men are to be watched.

1795
01:27:17,347 --> 01:27:21,306
I cannot imagine
they are not watched.

1796
01:27:21,307 --> 01:27:23,912
I've been noticing lately
that I sneak small naps

1797
01:27:23,913 --> 01:27:25,787
In the afternoon.

1798
01:27:25,788 --> 01:27:27,768
It's just a little
more difficult

1799
01:27:27,769 --> 01:27:29,748
To summon the energy
to write this letter

1800
01:27:29,749 --> 01:27:31,833
Than it was five years ago.

1801
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:35,376
Wine goes to my head
more quickly than it used to.

1802
01:27:35,377 --> 01:27:39,335
I walk forward
instead of running,

1803
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:43,712
And although there is
much life in me,

1804
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:46,214
Much is also gone.

1805
01:27:46,215 --> 01:27:48,923
So to sum up, I evaluate,

1806
01:27:48,924 --> 01:27:52,779
I calculate my course
more thoughtfully.

1807
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,488
There are certain men
at my time

1808
01:27:55,489 --> 01:27:59,449
Who have waged great battles

1809
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,429
And now look out upon the world

1810
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:03,202
From hilltops or from peaks

1811
01:28:03,203 --> 01:28:07,160
Where the horizon
must be immensely wider
and more revealing.

1812
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:11,225
But I, who have
only skirmished,

1813
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:13,205
Stand on a Ridge,

1814
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:15,706
Lower than I had hoped for

1815
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:18,833
And yet perhaps higher
than I deserve.

1816
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:21,751
The horizons
I had thought to see

1817
01:28:21,752 --> 01:28:24,565
Will probably be denied.

1818
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:27,691
I still hope
(if I conserve energy

1819
01:28:27,692 --> 01:28:29,985
And absorb the meaning
of my experiences)

1820
01:28:29,986 --> 01:28:32,172
That I shall be able to ascend

1821
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:34,465
One of the middle hills...
a little hill,

1822
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:36,655
But still a hill
and not a Ridge.

1823
01:28:36,656 --> 01:28:38,739
Be that as it will be,

1824
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:41,865
Even from my Ridge
I look back on two decades

1825
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:44,158
Through which good friends
stood together,

1826
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,137
Moved forward a little,

1827
01:28:46,138 --> 01:28:48,223
Dreamed that the world
could be better

1828
01:28:48,224 --> 01:28:49,785
And tried to make it so,

1829
01:28:49,786 --> 01:28:51,661
Tasted the Joy
of small victories,

1830
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:53,538
Wounded each other,
made mistakes,

1831
01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:55,413
Suffered much injury,

1832
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:58,226
And stood silent
in the chamber of liars.

1833
01:28:58,227 --> 01:29:00,728
For all this I am grateful:

1834
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:02,707
That much I have;

1835
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:05,521
That much cannot be
taken from me.

1836
01:29:05,522 --> 01:29:07,710
Barcelona fell,

1837
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:10,108
And you were not there,
and I was not there.

1838
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:12,087
And perhaps if we had been

1839
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:13,964
The city would have stood

1840
01:29:13,965 --> 01:29:16,255
And the world been
changed and better.

1841
01:29:16,256 --> 01:29:18,652
But we were here,

1842
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:20,737
And here together we remain.

1843
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:23,863
And our city won't fall.
And if it should,

1844
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:26,365
Better that we lie
buried in its ruins

1845
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:29,596
Than found absent
a second time."

Dalton Trumbo:
<i>We are not guaranteed</i>
<i>happiness.</i>

1847
01:29:44,813 --> 01:29:47,520
<i>We are only guaranteed</i>
<i>the right to pursue it,</i>

1848
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:52,939
<i>Which does imply that</i>
<i>we all have adversity.</i>

1849
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:58,046
<i>And it's not</i> <i>too bad.</i>

1850
01:30:39,629 --> 01:30:42,649
"I always thought of my life

1851
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:47,131
As a sequence of conflicts,

1852
01:30:47,132 --> 01:30:50,466
Each separate battle
segregated in my mind

1853
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:52,238
Under the heading,

1854
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,322
'my fight with these guys'

1855
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:57,761
Or 'my fight
with those guys.'

1856
01:30:57,762 --> 01:31:00,157
In thinking back, I now realize

1857
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:03,076
I have regarded each fight

1858
01:31:03,077 --> 01:31:06,514
As distinct and unrelated
to the other,

1859
01:31:06,516 --> 01:31:09,224
And have sometimes marveled

1860
01:31:09,226 --> 01:31:12,976
How one man can have
so many of them.

1861
01:31:12,977 --> 01:31:16,207
I now realize
it was all one fight;

1862
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:20,167
That the relation of each
to the other was very close;

1863
01:31:20,168 --> 01:31:23,398
And that I am
really no more combative
than any other man.

1864
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:24,857
It just happened in my case

1865
01:31:24,858 --> 01:31:27,046
That the original fight
once undertaken,

1866
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:30,381
Expanded marvelously into
what seemed like many fights,

1867
01:31:30,382 --> 01:31:33,819
And that the most recent
in a sequence of fights

1868
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,050
Is actually no more
than the current phase

1869
01:31:37,051 --> 01:31:39,655
Of the primary engagement.

1870
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:43,823
Since all men have at least
one fight in their lives

1871
01:31:43,825 --> 01:31:46,117
And are not considered

1872
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:48,723
Professional troublemakers
because of it,

1873
01:31:48,724 --> 01:31:52,578
The longer view reveals in me

1874
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:57,164
A citizen no less peaceful
than his neighbors."
