man into the wrong choice

22
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,801  X1:200 X2:497 Y1:474 Y2:500

27
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:54,995  X1:281 X2:416 Y1:474 Y2:495
Time to leave

38
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:24,275  X1:176 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:500
l guessed she wouldn't be coming

39
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,205  X1:334 X2:364 Y1:474 Y2:495
Lili

43
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,522  X1:180 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:500
You said you were giving it to me

44
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:04,995  X1:291 X2:407 Y1:474 Y2:495
But it's fine

45
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,640  X1:257 X2:443 Y1:474 Y2:500
lf you want it back

46
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,519  X1:269 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's fine with me

47
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,198  X1:174 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're second to me in everything

48
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,523  X1:179 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:500
So you're trying to get back at me

49
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,597  X1:334 X2:364 Y1:474 Y2:495
Lili

50
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:15,955  X1:148 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:500
What gives you the right to accuse me?

51
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,765  X1:208 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:500
Because l'm so good to you

52
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,845  X1:240 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:500
And you betrayed me

53
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,281  X1:315 X2:385 Y1:474 Y2:495
l didn't

54
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:22,846  X1:204 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're still saying you didn't

55
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,965  X1:196 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:530
You went to Cheng's studio to
have yourphotos taken

56
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:29,636  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:525
He blew them up and hung
them outside the studio

57
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,520  X1:178 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:500
And you say you didn't betray me

58
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,721  X1:215 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:530
Mother said she wanted to
have herphotos taken

59
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,565  X1:226 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:500
l was accompanying her

60
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:41,127  X1:207 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then where are herphotos?

61
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:41,843  X1:253 X2:447 Y1:474 Y2:500
She didn't take any

62
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:43,846  X1:320 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why?

63
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,681  X1:195 X2:505 Y1:474 Y2:499
l didn't ask, l didn't dare to ask

64
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:58,558  X1:222 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:495
You should have told me

65
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,284  X1:317 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:495

66
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,155  X1:256 X2:442 Y1:474 Y2:500
you would be mad

67
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,278  X1:225 X2:473 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss, how many please?

68
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:13,806  X1:227 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm looking for someone

69
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,240  X1:290 X2:409 Y1:474 Y2:495
Have a seat

70
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,879  X1:181 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss Wang, what would you like?

71
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,004  X1:315 X2:383 Y1:474 Y2:495
Coffee

72
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:40,799  X1:214 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
And a piece of cream cake

73
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:43,197  X1:260 X2:438 Y1:474 Y2:500
Sorry that l'm late

74
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,203  X1:206 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
We went to see my grandma

75
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,278  X1:182 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
Motherbrought the photos along

76
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:54,997  X1:303 X2:396 Y1:474 Y2:495
Grandma

77
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,477  X1:187 X2:511 Y1:474 Y2:500

78
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:01,356  X1:221 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
She said my eyes and
eyebrows don't look right

79
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,965  X1:290 X2:409 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's my fault

80
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:09,999  X1:149 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:500
My grandma is more beautiful than l am

81
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,357  X1:217 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:530
Old folks may find it
hard to accept new things

82
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,638  X1:257 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:500
l heard my photos

83
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,206  X1:193 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500

84
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,686  X1:271 X2:429 Y1:474 Y2:500
They look great

85
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:27,320  X1:228 X2:473 Y1:474 Y2:500
People say they're great

86
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,198  X1:218 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
l'm concerned with
what my relatives will say

87
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:35,885  X1:165 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:500
MrCheng, can you take them down?

88
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,799  X1:276 X2:420 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yourphotos...

89
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,645  X1:262 X2:436 Y1:474 Y2:500

90
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,640  X1:232 X2:467 Y1:474 Y2:500
People at the magazine

92
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,086  X1:184 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:500
My friends who saw yourphotos

94
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:04,005  X1:209 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:530
We should let you enterthe
Miss Shanghai pageant

95
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,039  X1:237 X2:460 Y1:474 Y2:500
They're willing to help

96
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:10,364  X1:206 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:500
Lili won't support me on this

97
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:16,324  X1:150 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thin eyebrows are no longerin fashion

98
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,881  X1:197 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thick eyebrows look healthier

99
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,526  X1:239 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:495
ls this a bit too thick?

100
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,477  X1:161 X2:539 Y1:474 Y2:500
Once is enough forthis kind of event

101
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:27,160  X1:167 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:500
Or else ourrelatives will laugh at us

102
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,443  X1:201 X2:497 Y1:474 Y2:500
Mrs Wang, you're too modest

103
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,440  X1:151 X2:546 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yourfamily is full of beautiful maidens

104
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,283  X1:263 X2:434 Y1:474 Y2:500
all worth adoring

105
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,477  X1:216 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:500
Who would dare to laugh?

106
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,164  X1:256 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:500
Awedding dress?

107
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,164  X1:259 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:500
She is just a child

108
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,923  X1:227 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:500
Mrs Wang, that's normal

109
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,686  X1:200 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:530
They change dresses several
times in beauty pageants

110
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,442  X1:163 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:500
They wearwedding dresses as well?

111
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,525  X1:178 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:530
The reason is,
l know how beauty pageants work

112
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,840  X1:163 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:500
Everyone wants to wearred or green

113
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,925  X1:217 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:530

226
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:33,035  X1:244 X2:454 Y1:474 Y2:500
Wandering the world

227
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:38,510  X1:235 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
Suffering the hardship

228
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:48,911  X1:199 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:500
To find you as my companion

229
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,749  X1:267 X2:431 Y1:474 Y2:500
Go to sleep first

230
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:53,425  X1:193 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
Where are you going this late?

231
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,954  X1:220 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
Some things can't be
discussed during the day

232
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,792  X1:269 X2:431 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll be right back

233
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,986  X1:198 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:500
Promise me you won't stay up

234
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:17,106  X1:149 X2:551 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then l won't know when you come back

235
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,467  X1:221 X2:478 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll wake you, is that fine?

236
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:23,913  X1:256 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're lying to me

237
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:55,234  X1:196 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:500
Stay quiet, they're all sleeping

238
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,751  X1:167 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao, your apartment is very pretty

239
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,350  X1:227 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
What good does that do

240
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:22,788  X1:209 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:500
when l'm always alone here

241
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:24,676  X1:315 X2:384 Y1:474 Y2:495
Then...

242
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:27,152  X1:190 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
we'll come visit you more often

243
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,467  X1:200 X2:497 Y1:474 Y2:500
And you'll find us a nuisance

244
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,389  X1:261 X2:437 Y1:474 Y2:495
How can that be?

245
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:34,151  X1:233 X2:465 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll be more than happy

246
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:36,989  X1:261 X2:436 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao, look at me

247
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:41,395  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:525
Do l look like one of those girls
on the calendars?

248
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:42,313  X1:271 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:495
How about me?

249
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:47,110  X1:166 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:500
Enjoy the taste of Beauty Cigarettes

250
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:50,314  X1:189 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
Enjoy the clean of Beauty Soap

251
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:55,989  X1:163 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, if you'd brought your camera

252
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:57,386  X1:251 X2:449 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then it'd be perfect

253
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:01,555  X1:206 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:530
Lili, it's a long time since
we had western style dinner

254
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,191  X1:228 X2:469 Y1:474 Y2:500
Wait till you're not busy

255
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:08,389  X1:205 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
The two of us go all the time

256
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:12,107  X1:180 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:530
That makes me hungry...
l'll go tell them to get some cakes

257
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:14,226  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

258
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:17,274  X1:216 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
We're just here to see you

259
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:19,234  X1:198 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:495
Just sit down and talk with us

260
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,596  X1:214 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:500
Lili, when does yourfather

261
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:25,350  X1:227 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500

262
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,070  X1:222 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt could be just a thought

263
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,189  X1:214 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
Very hard to read his mind

264
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:34,389  X1:220 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
How about you?
Leaving with yourfather?.

265
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,466  X1:308 X2:390 Y1:474 Y2:495
Ask him

266
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,869  X1:259 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:495
Let's wait and see

267
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,307  X1:182 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
Shanghai is a good place afterall

268
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,236  X1:242 X2:454 Y1:474 Y2:495
You've friends here?

269
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,865  X1:200 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yes, Lili... you met herbefore

270
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:58,625  X1:250 X2:448 Y1:474 Y2:500
They're here often?

271
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:02,073  X1:183 X2:515 Y1:474 Y2:500
No, we've not met for a long time

272
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:07,314  X1:180 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:525
Lili is my best friend from school,
remember?.

273
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:10,150  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
MrCheng is Lili's friend

274
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:13,470  X1:205 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:500
Nice to meet you both, l'm Li

275
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,070  X1:299 X2:400 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm Cheng

276
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:20,633  X1:143 X2:555 Y1:474 Y2:500

277
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,071  X1:312 X2:387 Y1:474 Y2:500
Really?

278
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,791  X1:156 X2:543 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then l must thank you wholeheartedly

279
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:29,836  X1:183 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
Did you prepare anything to eat?

280
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,396  X1:203 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:500
They said they're not hungry

281
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:33,992  X1:283 X2:414 Y1:474 Y2:500
How impolite

282
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:36,757  X1:163 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's not easy to have old friends here

283
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:39,756  X1:175 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
Go ask them to prepare something

284
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:44,428  X1:243 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:500
Seeing Qiyao's smile

285
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,155  X1:171 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
l knew l was no longerneeded here

286
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,915  X1:248 X2:450 Y1:474 Y2:499
Please, come inside

287
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:52,747  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:530
That night, l agreed to
leave Shanghai with Lili

288
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:05,391  X1:150 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:500
How come your eyebrows are like that?

289
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,748  X1:290 X2:410 Y1:474 Y2:500
Look good?

290
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,670  X1:221 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
They're not the type l like

291
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:20,673  X1:198 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:530
What do eyebrows have to do
with liking someone?

292
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,750  X1:316 X2:383 Y1:474 Y2:495
Look...

293
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,435  X1:302 X2:399 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yourhair

294
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:51,875  X1:302 X2:399 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yourhair

295
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:53,675  X1:252 X2:446 Y1:474 Y2:495
is darkerthan mine

296
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:02,394  X1:186 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:530
We Chinese referto marriage as
tying knots of hairtogether

297
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:05,396  X1:228 X2:473 Y1:474 Y2:500
lf you tie these together

298
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:08,551  X1:175 X2:523 Y1:474 Y2:495
Then aren't we husband and wife?

299
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:15,631  X1:204 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:495
You're the one who said that

300
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:23,386  X1:183 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:530
These businessmen in Shanghai
are going to be quite upset

301
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,832  X1:186 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:530
When they know you came from
Chongqing to investigate them

302
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:28,027  X1:221 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:500
That goes without saying

303
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:33,070  X1:181 X2:517 Y1:474 Y2:530
l bet they killed Hu's son to show
you what they're made of

304
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,634  X1:209 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:500
They've gone totally insane

305
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:39,757  X1:235 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
Have everything ready

306
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:40,792  X1:312 X2:388 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes Sir

307
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,716  X1:222 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
They're looking for death

308
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:48,353  X1:323 X2:375 Y1:474 Y2:495
Hello

309
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:51,517  X1:149 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss Wang, yourmotheris not back yet

310
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:52,950  X1:215 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thank you Not at all

311
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,391  X1:266 X2:432 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're quite late

312
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,746  X1:228 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
The food is getting cold

313
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,795  X1:175 X2:525 Y1:474 Y2:500
Take a rest, no need to be so busy

314
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,147  X1:184 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:530
Although l seldom socialize with
the neighbors

315
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:39,434  X1:209 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:495
l neverknow how to answer

316
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,068  X1:222 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
when they ask about you

317
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:48,268  X1:217 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:530
They just enjoy prying
so don't worry about them

318
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:57,710  X1:187 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:530
Need to do it up to your elbow...
Can't be lazy about it

319
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,474  X1:147 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:500
Hands... they can really betray your age

320
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:12,027  X1:218 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:525
lt's the anniversary of
father's death next month

321
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:15,314  X1:209 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:530
Let's hold a prayerritual for
him at the temple

322
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:21,955  X1:193 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:530
They say it's good forboth the
dead and the living

323
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:27,315  X1:204 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:530
Who are we doing it for after
all these years?

324
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,512  X1:294 X2:406 Y1:474 Y2:500
People say

325
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,027  X1:258 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:495
the dead still care

326
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:37,948  X1:205 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:495
how theirfamilies treat them

327
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:51,035  X1:156 X2:542 Y1:474 Y2:530
Chambers of Commerce ask people to
join the rally

328
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,715  X1:253 X2:445 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao, switch it off

329
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:57,553  X1:151 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:500
To oppose investigations of corruption

330
00:26:57,757 --> 00:27:02,273  X1:176 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:530
Such investigations are damaging
the prosperity of the city

331
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:05,713  X1:208 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:530
And creating conflict within
the nationalist party

332
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:16,869  X1:241 X2:459 Y1:474 Y2:500
Beautiful and elegant

333
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:27,116  X1:287 X2:411 Y1:474 Y2:500
Du Shiniang

334
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:40,796  X1:141 X2:558 Y1:474 Y2:500
Sorry to have landed in a pleasure house

335
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:41,674  X1:269 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:495
Officer Li here?

336
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,794  X1:293 X2:405 Y1:474 Y2:495
He's inside

337
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:52,476  X1:293 X2:406 Y1:474 Y2:495
Officer Li...

338
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:59,236  X1:183 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:525
Like a masterless flower dancing
in the wind

339
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:12,951  X1:149 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:500
Like willow cotton drifting away in tears

340
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:25,949  X1:311 X2:386 Y1:474 Y2:495
To be...

341
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,552  X1:267 X2:431 Y1:474 Y2:500
Have a cigarette

342
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:56,951  X1:230 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:500
Surrenderyourweapon

343
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,746  X1:186 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:500
Your superiors have gone home

344
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:10,195  X1:195 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:530
But l still have a few Shanghai
big shots behind me

345
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,473  X1:291 X2:408 Y1:474 Y2:500

347
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:44,114  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
ls it worth it? Doing this for Li?

348
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:47,627  X1:189 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:500
Search the place Yes Sir

349
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:52,028  X1:201 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:500
Go ahead and pull the trigger

350
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:54,751  X1:180 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:500
You'll hearfrom my father's army

351
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:09,112  X1:159 X2:539 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm the one who is shot in yourhouse

352
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:11,911  X1:201 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yourfatherwill hearfrom me

353
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:29,267  X1:287 X2:414 Y1:474 Y2:495
Start the car

354
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:37,548  X1:190 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
You contacted the right person

355
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:40,347  X1:278 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:500
Are you hurt?

356
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:44,229  X1:194 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
He said you helped him before

357
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:46,627  X1:218 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've helped a lot of people

358
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:51,030  X1:204 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've arranged a place foryou

359
00:30:51,397 --> 00:30:53,353  X1:296 X2:402 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thank you

360
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,586  X1:281 X2:419 Y1:474 Y2:495
Do remember

361
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:58,752  X1:174 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm not one of those you've helped

362
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:05,594  X1:223 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:500
Of all the people l've met

363
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,028  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
you're one of the toughest

364
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,712  X1:250 X2:448 Y1:474 Y2:500
ls Miss Wang here?

365
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:55,298  X1:164 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:495
When was the last time Li was here?

366
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,980  X1:215 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
More than two months ago

367
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,661  X1:228 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
How many days is that?

368
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:05,420  X1:171 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
Sixty eight days ago in the evening

369
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,775  X1:188 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:495
That was the last time l saw him

370
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,500  X1:273 X2:426 Y1:474 Y2:495
That was exact

371
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:16,700  X1:172 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:500
You really don't know where he is?

372
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:20,501  X1:226 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
You really think he'll tell

373
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:23,259  X1:207 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:495
a woman who lives off him?

374
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,342  X1:211 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:499
Sir, we haven't found much

375
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,334  X1:302 X2:396 Y1:474 Y2:495
That's it?

376
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,784  X1:222 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:525
We looked through every
drawer and this is it

377
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,577  X1:270 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:500
Rest is clothing

378
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,098  X1:261 X2:437 Y1:474 Y2:495
How can that be?

379
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:36,578  X1:173 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
What else do you think there'll be?

380
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,856  X1:234 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't think you've won

381
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,499  X1:293 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:495
Believe me

382
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:44,055  X1:280 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:495
We'll find him

383
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,660  X1:208 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've been with Li a long time

384
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,663  X1:235 X2:463 Y1:474 Y2:495
This woman is the one

385
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,423  X1:216 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
he's been with the longest

386
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,104  X1:253 X2:447 Y1:474 Y2:500
Disrespect me now

387
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,176  X1:231 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:500
and l can finish you off

388
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:58,853  X1:192 X2:505 Y1:474 Y2:495
with one word when he returns

389
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:13,863  X1:192 X2:509 Y1:474 Y2:525
Took us two days to line up for
the boat tickets

390
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,903  X1:187 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:530
Can't imagine how many people
are trying to leave Shanghai

391
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:25,575  X1:215 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:530
l thought we were going to
Japan orAmerica

392
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:26,860  X1:268 X2:430 Y1:474 Y2:500
Neverthought...

393
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:29,300  X1:137 X2:560 Y1:474 Y2:500
fatherwould finally decide on Hong Kong

394
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,216  X1:238 X2:460 Y1:474 Y2:500
Where is Hong Kong?

395
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,984  X1:289 X2:410 Y1:474 Y2:495
ln the south

396
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:45,502  X1:175 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:500
l heard it's a dirty and messy slum

397
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,861  X1:180 X2:517 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yourfatheris a big businessman

398
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,414  X1:243 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:495
He should know best

399
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:55,144  X1:162 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:500
You talk just like my very own Cheng

400
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,415  X1:201 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500
Still joking at a time like this?

401
00:33:57,705 --> 00:33:58,933  X1:325 X2:372 Y1:474 Y2:495
Miss

402
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,743  X1:299 X2:399 Y1:474 Y2:495
More tea?

403
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,261  X1:329 X2:368 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes

404
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:15,173  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

405
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:18,214  X1:293 X2:405 Y1:474 Y2:495
How's life?

406
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,264  X1:259 X2:438 Y1:474 Y2:500
Everything is fine

407
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,257  X1:285 X2:414 Y1:474 Y2:500
People say...

408
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,613  X1:223 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
Shanghai is too unstable

409
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,141  X1:219 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
lt's best to go some place
for a few years

410
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:32,341  X1:218 X2:481 Y1:474 Y2:530
Ride it out and come back
when things settle down

411
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,378  X1:299 X2:400 Y1:474 Y2:500
Perhaps...

412
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,894  X1:201 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:495
You should think about it too

413
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:39,424  X1:238 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500
Leaving just like that?

414
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,498  X1:221 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's easier said than done

415
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,943  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

416
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:48,937  X1:251 X2:447 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's yourhousehold

417
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:51,062  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:495
l know l shouldn't interfere

418
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:53,854  X1:225 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's none of my business

419
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,014  X1:323 X2:376 Y1:474 Y2:495
But...

420
00:34:56,345 --> 00:35:00,657  X1:221 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:525
That Officer Li can't even
take care of himself now

421
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:10,060  X1:231 X2:467 Y1:474 Y2:500
There's an old saying...

422
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:13,654  X1:167 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:530
Couples are birds in the same wood
that fly off when there's trouble

423
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:17,420  X1:153 X2:545 Y1:474 Y2:495
This crisis won't end in a month ortwo

424
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,694  X1:310 X2:386 Y1:474 Y2:495
Women

425
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:23,303  X1:184 X2:515 Y1:474 Y2:495
should think forthemselves first

426
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,214  X1:245 X2:452 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're leaving now?

427
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:42,937  X1:302 X2:394 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes Miss

428
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:44,937  X1:180 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:500
Please take good care of yourself

429
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:49,334  X1:136 X2:562 Y1:474 Y2:500
We no longerhave the honorto serve you

430
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,296  X1:279 X2:420 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't say that

431
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:54,895  X1:161 X2:537 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's going to be lonely here by myself

432
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,538  X1:297 X2:401 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt won't be

433
00:35:57,745 --> 00:35:59,383  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:495
You take care

434
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:03,734  X1:251 X2:447 Y1:474 Y2:500
l will and thank you

435
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:33,177  X1:258 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're MrCheng?

436
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:35,815  X1:237 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500
Sir, your guest is here

437
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:37,344  X1:307 X2:390 Y1:474 Y2:495
Come in

438
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,019  X1:190 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
Haven't seen you in a long time

439
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:49,620  X1:295 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:500
l was busy

440
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:54,777  X1:239 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:500
Nice to see you again

441
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:01,622  X1:243 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:495
Must be cold outside

442
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,298  X1:315 X2:385 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's not

443
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:12,583  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:500
How are you?

444
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:17,221  X1:327 X2:371 Y1:474 Y2:495
Fine

445
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,743  X1:291 X2:408 Y1:474 Y2:500
Did Qiyao...

446

00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,856  X1:182 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500

467
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:46,097  X1:136 X2:561 Y1:474 Y2:500

472
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,984  X1:197 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:530
He was gone just like that...
How can you be heartbroken?

473
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,658  X1:239 X2:459 Y1:474 Y2:495
He's dead! He's dead!

474
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:41,221  X1:167 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:500
He was thinking of me when he died

475
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,697  X1:199 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500

476
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:50,817  X1:203 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:500
And you all think l don't care

477
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:53,975  X1:237 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500
He made me lie to you

478
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:56,221  X1:269 X2:429 Y1:474 Y2:495
He'll come back

479
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:21,823  X1:138 X2:560 Y1:474 Y2:530
Qiyao believed loving someone was more
important than anything in life

480
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:26,178  X1:222 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:530
Yet my wife believed
we should love everyone

481
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,255  X1:227 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:530
That was what l heard
from the radio everyday

482
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:33,943  X1:219 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:530
And l was beginning to
believe what my wife said

483
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:36,337  X1:275 X2:425 Y1:474 Y2:495

484
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:43,184  X1:227 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:530
Aren't you tired working
so late every night?

485
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:47,936  X1:211 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:530
l can't sleep well
if l left any work unfinished

486
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,818  X1:196 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:500
Hasn't snowed for a few years

487
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,820  X1:211 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't just stare at the snow

488
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,413  X1:181 X2:517 Y1:474 Y2:500
Do you have enough clothes on?

491
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:21,861  X1:250 X2:451 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let's go out and eat

make brave new decisions

526
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:11,496  X1:202 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500

534
00:48:53,575 --> 00:48:54,849  X1:320 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500

535
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:59,930  X1:234 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
You irresponsible man

536
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:02,803  X1:237 X2:460 Y1:474 Y2:500

537
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:06,327  X1:185 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:500
Do you want to leave Shanghai?

538
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:18,204  X1:198 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:500

540
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:26,287  X1:235 X2:462 Y1:474 Y2:500
My love foryou is true

541
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:28,325  X1:325 X2:374 Y1:474 Y2:500

543
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:35,126  X1:187 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then perhaps l may believe you

544
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:06,488  X1:222 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
What can l promise you?

545
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:10,685  X1:325 X2:374 Y1:474 Y2:500

546
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:13,608  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500

551
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,968  X1:212 X2:485 Y1:474 Y2:500

552
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:35,963  X1:210 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:530
Lili, stay a few more days

553
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,930  X1:189 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:530
lt's not too convenient because
l'm living with my relatives

554
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:44,133  X1:178 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss Lili, what is Hong Kong like?

555
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:47,647  X1:223 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:530
They all say they want to
flee to Hong Kong

556
00:50:47,695 --> 00:50:49,572  X1:225 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
ls it really a good place?

557
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:53,365  X1:186 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:530
Does it really matter?.

559
00:50:55,215 --> 00:50:56,933  X1:241 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:500

00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:32,014  X1:244 X2:454 Y1:474 Y2:500

620
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:35,645  X1:229 X2:469 Y1:474 Y2:530
l've a small investment
in Song's wheat factory

621
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,648  X1:277 X2:423 Y1:474 Y2:500
His letters say

622
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:40,130  X1:151 X2:547 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's doing good business in Hong Kong

623
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,413  X1:196 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:525
lf we go there, we can
live off the interest and bonus

624
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:46,850  X1:177 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:500
Getting by shouldn't be a problem

625
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,569  X1:171 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:500
But we'll be alone in a strange land

626
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:52,010  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
You'll betterbe prepared

627
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:57,163  X1:172 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
Life won't be easy foryou anymore

628
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:59,367  X1:172 X2:525 Y1:474 Y2:500
All these years of blood and sweat

629
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,534  X1:221 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:525
l'm sure l can have a new
start overthere

630
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:04,814  X1:308 X2:390 Y1:474 Y2:495
All l ask

631

632
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,926  X1:266 X2:432 Y1:474 Y2:495
to come with me

633
00:56:13,535 --> 00:56:14,888  X1:286 X2:412 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's our child

634
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:16,163  X1:202 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're still thinking about it?

635
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:18,246  X1:222 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
Are you sure about this?

636
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,644  X1:179 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's still a long way to the hospital

637
00:56:21,695 --> 00:56:22,730  X1:253 X2:444 Y1:474 Y2:500
We'll be right there

638
00:56:23,415 --> 00:56:25,531  X1:192 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
All they need is your signature

639
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:28,414  X1:191 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:530
Afterthe operation,
no one will be held responsible

640
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:31,533  X1:184 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:530
Why don't we put our signatures
on a marriage certificate?

641
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:33,606  X1:235 X2:465 Y1:474 Y2:525
Then we can bring our
child to this world

642
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:36,608  X1:253 X2:446 Y1:474 Y2:500
Can't wait anymore

643
00:56:38,455 --> 00:56:40,252  X1:225 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:495
Give me some more time

644
00:56:40,775 --> 00:56:43,414  X1:232 X2:467 Y1:474 Y2:530
l can find someone to
abort the child secretly

645
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:45,533  X1:268 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:495
And then what?

646
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:55,204  X1:325 X2:372 Y1:474 Y2:500
Stop

647
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:01,814  X1:325 X2:374 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ming

648
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:03,368  X1:270 X2:426 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're crying?!

649
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:07,409  X1:294 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss Wang

650
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:11,252  X1:168 X2:530 Y1:474 Y2:525
We won't be here if we're not facing
difficulties of our own

651
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,684  X1:187 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let's do it neatly and beautifully

652
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,055  X1:227 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:500
lf you know what l mean

653
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:18,250  X1:210 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:500
What do you mean by that?

654
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,644  X1:223 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
Stop this ambiguous talk

655
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,406  X1:241 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500
We agreed on a price

656
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:27,205  X1:217 X2:481 Y1:474 Y2:530
l brought you here so that
you'll know who she is

657
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,729  X1:203 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:500
And she'll know who you are

658
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:32,767  X1:213 X2:485 Y1:474 Y2:500
How can you talk like that?

659
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,567  X1:208 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:500
Who's asking who forhelp?

660
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:37,371  X1:179 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:500
My elderbrotheris highly eligible

661
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,407  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:495
if it isn't forhis terminal illness

662
00:57:40,495 --> 00:57:43,248  X1:167 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:500
Awoman with such a shadowy past

663
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,690  X1:186 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:530
won't stand a chance of sharing
his name in marriage

664
00:57:45,775 --> 00:57:48,243  X1:180 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:500
We're a family of good reputation

665
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:10,445  X1:185 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:495
There's a middleman in this deal

666
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:14,133  X1:177 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:500
Miss Wang has no opinion on this

667
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:17,049  X1:234 X2:463 Y1:474 Y2:495

669
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:23,411  X1:239 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:495
Then the deal is done

670
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:28,731  X1:247 X2:450 Y1:474 Y2:500

690
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:24,330  X1:237 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:495

691
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,844  X1:196 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:530
We're not encouraged to have
wedding banquets nowadays

692
01:00:26,975 --> 01:00:30,012  X1:213 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:530

693
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:32,163  X1:315 X2:384 Y1:474 Y2:495
Then...

696
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,088  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

697
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,444  X1:300 X2:400 Y1:474 Y2:495
Let's do it

698
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,731  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

699
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:23,333  X1:220 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:495
When MrGuo is healthier

700
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,606  X1:178 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
we'll take more photos at the park

701
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,286  X1:226 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
Pull the backdrop forme

702
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:12,524  X1:293 X2:406 Y1:474 Y2:500
Here we go

703
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:18,735  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
Not a single soul in days

704
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,886  X1:197 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:525
The toilet is still leaking,
don't know what to do about it

705
01:02:22,895 --> 01:02:24,647  X1:223 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:500
Can't even wash my face

706
01:02:24,735 --> 01:02:27,374  X1:170 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
Did you notice that in the morning?

707
01:02:30,015 --> 01:02:32,973  X1:237 X2:463 Y1:474 Y2:530
No you won't because

708
01:02:33,095 --> 01:02:35,973  X1:214 X2:485 Y1:474 Y2:500
The wateris always yellow

709
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:38,091  X1:195 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:495
Don't know what to do about it

710
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,449  X1:291 X2:408 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't worry

711
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:41,373  X1:283 X2:419 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt'll get better

712
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:44,287  X1:195 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
l need to go and see my father

713
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:48,010  X1:201 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:530
The trip will take two weeks...
He's always sick

714
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:51,047  X1:140 X2:558 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll give him some money to buy medicine

715
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:59,326  X1:212 X2:486 Y1:474 Y2:525
He's my father
and l must take care of him

716
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:03,246  X1:218 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
Little Weiwei, look at Papa

717
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,608  X1:272 X2:427 Y1:474 Y2:500
Dinneris ready

718
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:29,932  X1:161 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:500
Chicken soup is good foryourhealth

719
01:03:41,015 --> 01:03:42,971  X1:238 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500

720
01:03:50,095 --> 01:03:52,211  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:495
Does she drink hermilk?

721
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:53,529  X1:255 X2:443 Y1:474 Y2:500
She's a good child

722
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:55,333  X1:169 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
Drinks hermilk with all her strength

723
01:03:55,495 --> 01:03:57,292  X1:216 X2:481 Y1:474 Y2:500
And then go right to sleep

724
01:03:58,415 --> 01:03:59,768  X1:295 X2:405 Y1:474 Y2:495
How sweet

725
01:03:59,935 --> 01:04:01,607  X1:329 X2:368 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes

726
01:04:01,855 --> 01:04:03,652  X1:191 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:500
l neverhave to worry about her

727
01:04:05,055 --> 01:04:06,613  X1:289 X2:409 Y1:474 Y2:500
That's good

728
01:04:17,655 --> 01:04:20,408  X1:219 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:525
Every man wants a family
he can call his own

729
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:24,124  X1:226 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:495
With a wife and children

730
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,331  X1:184 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:500
Living a steady and peaceful life

731
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:33,934  X1:168 X2:530 Y1:474 Y2:530
l grew up watching
my uncles' families and l envy them

732
01:04:34,175 --> 01:04:36,006  X1:293 X2:407 Y1:474 Y2:500
in my heart

733
01:04:37,335 --> 01:04:39,166  X1:183 X2:517 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt makes me want to grow up fast

734
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,848  X1:221 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:495
So that l can be like them

735
01:04:42,775 --> 01:04:44,447  X1:204 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:500
And introduce to everyone...

736
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,614  X1:311 X2:388 Y1:474 Y2:500
My wife

737
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:48,248  X1:313 X2:386 Y1:474 Y2:500
My son

738
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,930  X1:261 X2:439 Y1:474 Y2:500
And my daughter

739
01:04:53,535 --> 01:04:54,888  X1:295 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:500
l thought...

740
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:58,371  X1:155 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:530
So what if we don't go to Hong Kong?
We can stay in Shanghai

741
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:00,651  X1:191 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
But that doesn't solve anything

742
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:10,605  X1:171 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:530
No use thinking about it anymore...
lf my motherwere still here

743
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:15,132  X1:192 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:530
She could at least get a golden
bracelet from her grandma

744
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,251  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:495
Such a sweet little child

745
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:20,613  X1:199 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:495
Born into this cold loneliness

746
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:25,007  X1:150 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't worry about yourliving expenses

747
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:27,765  X1:203 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:530
Even when l'm in Hong Kong
and not by your side

748
01:05:28,135 --> 01:05:31,093  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll still send you money

749
01:05:38,055 --> 01:05:41,047  X1:209 X2:491 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm counting on you forthat

750
01:05:42,135 --> 01:05:43,284  X1:317 X2:383 Y1:474 Y2:495

751
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:49,735  X1:283 X2:417 Y1:474 Y2:499
Come on, eat

752
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:51,254  X1:228 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
The food is getting cold

753
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,972  X1:163 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ming died in San Francisco at age 59

754
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:06,122  X1:231 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:500
My wife kept asking me

755
01:06:06,565 --> 01:06:09,033  X1:180 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
why Qiyao didn't come for dinner

756
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:12,995  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
l guess she felt sorry forQiyao

757
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:17,399  X1:174 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
But l understood Qiyao all too well

758
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:21,718  X1:194 X2:505 Y1:474 Y2:525
When she was sad she did not
want to be disturbed

759
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:40,882  X1:189 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:500
l don't want to pretend anymore

760
01:06:41,245 --> 01:06:42,963  X1:239 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500
lf you can't forget her

761
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,480  X1:242 X2:459 Y1:474 Y2:495
l'll make room forher

762
01:06:50,605 --> 01:06:54,154  X1:165 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm someone who can find a way out

763
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,083  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
How was school today?

764
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:13,194  X1:321 X2:376 Y1:474 Y2:495
Good

765
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,715  X1:192 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
Want egg fried rice for dinner?.

766
01:07:15,805 --> 01:07:16,635  X1:329 X2:368 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes

767
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:17,919  X1:298 X2:401 Y1:474 Y2:495
Tell Mama

768
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:20,876  X1:125 X2:573 Y1:474 Y2:500
How much are the eggs in the black market?

769
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:22,358  X1:272 X2:426 Y1:474 Y2:495
Does it matter?.

770
01:07:22,565 --> 01:07:24,476  X1:203 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll get them if you need them

771
01:07:24,565 --> 01:07:27,716  X1:172 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:530
Ma, wheneverUncle Cheng comes,
we have egg fried rice

772
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:29,517  X1:220 X2:478 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let Uncle Cheng kiss you

773
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:33,397  X1:274 X2:426 Y1:474 Y2:500
Run along now

774
01:07:35,605 --> 01:07:38,073  X1:242 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao, the egg shells

775
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:40,161  X1:199 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll dispose them outside later

776
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:43,364  X1:151 X2:546 Y1:474 Y2:495
Can't be careless with the small details

777
01:07:44,485 --> 01:07:47,363  X1:184 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:530
That family out
front is always turning people in

778
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:49,077  X1:234 X2:463 Y1:474 Y2:500
With so many enemies

779
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,685  X1:201 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:525
One of these days,
someone will return the favor

780
01:07:51,805 --> 01:07:54,877  X1:169 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:530
Don't mind otherpeople's business
and just take care of yourself

781
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:06,642  X1:241 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:530
Going to rural areas
to help those in need

782
01:08:07,005 --> 01:08:10,156  X1:271 X2:427 Y1:474 Y2:495
l believe in that

783
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:12,760  X1:196 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:500
When l said goodbye to Qiyao

784
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:15,200  X1:166 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:500
She asked me to take care of myself

785
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,919  X1:212 X2:485 Y1:474 Y2:525
And l told herto
take care of herself as well

786
01:08:29,365 --> 01:08:35,201  X1:184 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:530
Great as are heaven and earth,
what we owe the Party is greater

787
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:41,523  X1:198 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:525
Dear as are father and mother
Chairman Mao is dearer

788
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,716  X1:202 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ma, l'll teach you how to sing

789
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:44,954  X1:323 X2:375 Y1:474 Y2:500
Okay

790
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,717  X1:217 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:500
Chairman Mao taught us...

791
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:55,033  X1:255 X2:443 Y1:474 Y2:500
The world is yours

792
01:08:55,205 --> 01:08:56,479  X1:270 X2:426 Y1:474 Y2:495
As well as ours

793
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,840  X1:225 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500
But ultimately it is yours

794
01:09:12,765 --> 01:09:14,596  X1:285 X2:413 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt works now

795
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:17,195  X1:198 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:530
Kela, where did you find this?
Don't let anyone find out

796
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:18,957  X1:205 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
Of course not...lt's very safe

797
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:31,198  X1:282 X2:416 Y1:474 Y2:500
Working yet?

798
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:35,079  X1:201 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:495
How come there's no sound?

799
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:41,718  X1:298 X2:400 Y1:474 Y2:495
No needle

800
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,359  X1:167 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cousin, see if you can find a needle

801
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:45,360  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:495
What needle?

802
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:47,356  X1:229 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:530
How can we find record
playing needles here?

803
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:51,076  X1:251 X2:449 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've been ripped off

804
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:52,917  X1:228 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:500
l gave him a watch forit

805
01:09:53,005 --> 01:09:54,154  X1:241 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500
What did he tell you?

806
01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:55,797  X1:209 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:500
He guaranteed it would turn

807
01:09:56,765 --> 01:09:57,993  X1:300 X2:398 Y1:474 Y2:495
No sound

808
01:09:58,405 --> 01:09:59,679  X1:307 X2:393 Y1:474 Y2:500
Forget it

809
01:10:17,805 --> 01:10:19,523  X1:257 X2:441 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, take a rest

810
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:26,595  X1:316 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng

811
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:31,325  X1:240 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:500
Stop working like this

812
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,682  X1:177 X2:523 Y1:474 Y2:500
Look at you, doing nothing all day

813
01:10:37,405 --> 01:10:38,201  X1:313 X2:385 Y1:474 Y2:495
Cousin

814
01:10:38,445 --> 01:10:40,401  X1:193 X2:509 Y1:474 Y2:495
Don't disturb ourmodel worker

815
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:42,994  X1:222 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:530
Kela, why are you always
protecting him?

816
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:45,480  X1:303 X2:396 Y1:474 Y2:495
Don't run

817
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:50,003  X1:270 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, help me

818
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:56,436  X1:270 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, help me

819
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:59,039  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll write to Aunt and tell on you

820
01:10:59,645 --> 01:11:01,317  X1:208 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:499
Go ahead, see if l'm worried

821
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:05,193  X1:286 X2:412 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let go of me

822
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:08,160  X1:316 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng

823
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,237  X1:246 X2:451 Y1:474 Y2:500
Watch what you say

824
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:13,435  X1:239 X2:461 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't worry about her

825
01:11:14,005 --> 01:11:15,199  X1:286 X2:411 Y1:474 Y2:500
And you too

826
01:11:25,085 --> 01:11:27,076  X1:177 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, do you think about home?

827
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,394  X1:330 X2:368 Y1:474 Y2:495
l do

828
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,243  X1:236 X2:462 Y1:474 Y2:530
l wish l could go back
to Shanghai tomorrow

829
01:11:38,325 --> 01:11:39,678  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
Must be nice having a wife

830
01:11:39,725 --> 01:11:40,840  X1:295 X2:402 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt depends

831
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:42,517  X1:233 X2:465 Y1:474 Y2:495
Not if she's not around

832
01:11:43,405 --> 01:11:44,838  X1:217 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's the same for everyone

833
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:48,158  X1:234 X2:465 Y1:474 Y2:500
My husband is in Tibet

834
01:11:48,245 --> 01:11:50,805  X1:197 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, is yourwife beautiful?

835
01:11:54,005 --> 01:11:55,040  X1:277 X2:420 Y1:474 Y2:500
Very beautiful

836
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:11,243  X1:203 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:525
Everyday in the countryside,
l wanted to write a letter

837
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:16,956  X1:201 X2:497 Y1:474 Y2:530
To know what my friend's life
was like in Shanghai

838
01:12:17,485 --> 01:12:19,555  X1:155 X2:543 Y1:474 Y2:500
l had to think about every word l wrote

839
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,117  X1:147 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:500
For one wrong word could bring trouble

840
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:27,960  X1:175 X2:525 Y1:474 Y2:500
l ended up only sending one letter

841
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:32,241  X1:241 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:530
On it, l drew a picture
of a young Qiyao

842
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:36,514  X1:187 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:500
She should know l was asking...

843
01:12:36,845 --> 01:12:38,278  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:500
How are you?

844
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:40,399  X1:268 X2:430 Y1:474 Y2:500
Are you happy?

845
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:45,755  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ayearpassed... and then another

846
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:50,794  X1:205 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:525
people gradually returned to
their own cities

847
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:54,679  X1:239 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:500
Comrade, how many?

848
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:56,683  X1:227 X2:471 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm looking for someone

849
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:19,800  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:530
l burnt the letters from you and
Ming afterreading them

850
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:21,477  X1:221 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:500
l didn't dare to keep them

851
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,476  X1:191 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
The few times you sent me rice

852
01:13:25,685 --> 01:13:26,913  X1:263 X2:434 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt tasted so good

853
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:28,918  X1:245 X2:452 Y1:474 Y2:495
And smelled so nice

854
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:33,482  X1:199 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ming didn't send money twice

855
01:13:34,485 --> 01:13:36,077  X1:231 X2:467 Y1:474 Y2:495
Turned out he was sick

856
01:13:37,765 --> 01:13:39,562  X1:168 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
Amazing how a strong man like him

857
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,922  X1:251 X2:448 Y1:474 Y2:500
can fall ill so easily

858
01:13:46,685 --> 01:13:48,994  X1:166 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:500
Weiwei tries hard to improve herself

859
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,076  X1:137 X2:562 Y1:474 Y2:500
She asks me to teach herEnglish at home

860
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:58,199  X1:162 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:500
But pretends not to know it in school

861
01:14:22,405 --> 01:14:25,442  X1:175 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:530
Need help to clean up yourplace?

862
01:14:25,525 --> 01:14:27,004  X1:253 X2:446 Y1:474 Y2:500
l cleaned it already

863
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:31,883  X1:245 X2:453 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's been a few years

864
01:14:33,165 --> 01:14:34,678  X1:274 X2:425 Y1:474 Y2:495
You look older

865
01:14:55,565 --> 01:14:56,680  X1:305 X2:393 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt's good

866
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:02,154  X1:291 X2:409 Y1:474 Y2:495
To be older

867
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,643  X1:201 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500
Neverthought it'd be like this

868
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:05,517  X1:199 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yonghong, have some coffee

869
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:06,879  X1:225 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thank you, Auntie Wang

870
01:16:09,245 --> 01:16:13,523  X1:203 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:530
Ma, the coffee is bitter...
lt needs more milk and sugar

871
01:16:13,645 --> 01:16:16,364  X1:179 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's not coffee when it's too sweet

872
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:20,920  X1:240 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:530
Was it hard to get the
telephone installed?

873
01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:24,397  X1:151 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:500
Had to go through several departments

874
01:16:24,845 --> 01:16:27,234  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
How much did you spend?

875
01:16:28,925 --> 01:16:31,439  X1:184 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:530
Can we use yourphone for
organizing parties from now on?

876
01:16:34,045 --> 01:16:36,605  X1:199 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:500
Most people share one phone

877
01:16:36,685 --> 01:16:38,721  X1:143 X2:557 Y1:474 Y2:500
among several buildings and they get by

878
01:16:38,805 --> 01:16:40,363  X1:179 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:500
Weiwei, you got married too early

879
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:42,640  X1:201 X2:497 Y1:474 Y2:500
House parties are a lot of fun

880
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:47,195  X1:156 X2:542 Y1:474 Y2:530
l need to cook when l get off work and
my husband is busy learning English

881
01:16:47,285 --> 01:16:49,003  X1:210 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:495

882
01:16:49,045 --> 01:16:50,637  X1:190 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
How can l find time forparties?

883
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:53,514  X1:210 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:530
Why do you have to stay at
that tiny place

884
01:16:53,645 --> 01:16:55,920  X1:205 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
and do everything yourself?

885
01:16:56,165 --> 01:16:57,678  X1:264 X2:434 Y1:474 Y2:495

886
01:16:57,765 --> 01:17:01,201  X1:239 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:530
l've said it before and

887
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:04,881  X1:193 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
Auntie, may l use yourphone?

How is yourlife?

889
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:20,561  X1:250 X2:448 Y1:474 Y2:499
Same old, same old

890
01:17:21,365 --> 01:17:23,560  X1:134 X2:566 Y1:474 Y2:500
Living in Shanghai is meaningless anyway

891
01:17:24,365 --> 01:17:26,754  X1:206 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:530
Do something with yourhair
when you have time

892
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,276  X1:243 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:495
l think this looks fine

893
01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:37,317  X1:207 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:525
Ma, it's not like l didn't try to
talk him out of it

894
01:17:37,725 --> 01:17:42,003  X1:152 X2:547 Y1:474 Y2:500
We don't have any relatives in America

895
01:17:42,085 --> 01:17:43,882  X1:261 X2:437 Y1:474 Y2:500
lt'll be very tough

896
01:17:44,085 --> 01:17:45,438  X1:305 X2:393 Y1:474 Y2:495
l heard...

897
01:17:45,565 --> 01:17:48,875  X1:195 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:530
A loaf of bread there is more
expensive than a chicken here

898
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:52,037  X1:202 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:530
Since it's decided,
why worry about the details?

899
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:57,845  X1:171 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've been packing the last few days

900
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:01,640  X1:220 X2:478 Y1:474 Y2:530
Didn't even dare to
leave our slippers behind

901
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,118  X1:303 X2:397 Y1:474 Y2:495
ln case...

902
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:04,684  X1:204 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:500
they're expensive overthere

903
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:07,003  X1:238 X2:460 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yourhusband is right

904
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,161  X1:178 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:500
Go early when you can still take it

905
01:18:09,245 --> 01:18:11,520  X1:231 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:525
Accomplish everything
before it's too late

906
01:18:14,365 --> 01:18:16,356  X1:281 X2:419 Y1:474 Y2:495
Let's be frank

907
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:19,274  X1:301 X2:398 Y1:474 Y2:495
Go ahead

908
01:18:21,245 --> 01:18:22,803  X1:294 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:500
They say...

909
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:26,084  X1:220 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:525
You used to be
the mistress of an officer

910
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:31,195  X1:190 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
Do you see l'm dyeing my hair?.

911
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,198  X1:171 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:525
Hiding all that money is
useless so can we discuss about it

912
01:18:37,765 --> 01:18:40,916  X1:233 X2:465 Y1:474 Y2:530
Then let me ask you,
if l give you the money

913
01:18:41,045 --> 01:18:43,354  X1:231 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:530
How am l supposed to
live when you're gone?

914
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,243  X1:235 X2:463 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll be paying you back

915
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:48,601  X1:133 X2:565 Y1:474 Y2:500
Did you ask me when you decide to leave?

916
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,603  X1:205 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:530
Why should l ask you?
l should be asking my father

917
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,403  X1:195 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:500
You tell me where my fatheris

918
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:54,884  X1:151 X2:546 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're asking me after all these years?

919
01:18:55,445 --> 01:18:58,278  X1:229 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:530
Did you feel cheated by
the way l raised you?

920
01:18:58,325 --> 01:19:00,202  X1:205 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
l don't care how it happened

921
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:02,594  X1:230 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:530
You may have suffered
but you had yourfun

922
01:19:02,725 --> 01:19:04,920  X1:195 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:530
l was innocent and
l had to listen to all the gossip

923
01:19:05,005 --> 01:19:07,280  X1:185 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:500
l suffered, l had always suffered

924
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:24,923  X1:185 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:495
Americans are tallerthan we are

925
01:19:25,045 --> 01:19:27,115  X1:132 X2:567 Y1:474 Y2:500
Put a stack of cash underneath your shoes

926
01:19:27,485 --> 01:19:28,964  X1:218 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
Then you can talk to them

927
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,161  X1:260 X2:437 Y1:474 Y2:500
with more dignity

928
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:41,400  X1:217 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll definitely pay you back

929
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,163  X1:215 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:500
You have a good husband

930
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:46,361  X1:154 X2:545 Y1:474 Y2:500
That makes you strongerthan yourMa

931
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:58,678  X1:225 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
Ma, he is not good to me

932
01:19:59,285 --> 01:20:01,594  X1:257 X2:442 Y1:474 Y2:495
Life is hard forme

933
01:20:05,445 --> 01:20:08,801  X1:194 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
The doorto China was opened

934
01:20:08,925 --> 01:20:14,875  X1:165 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:530
They all came back to visit the home
they'd missed forthirty years

935
01:20:38,365 --> 01:20:39,798  X1:164 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:500
According to the information on you

936
01:20:43,245 --> 01:20:45,281  X1:255 X2:445 Y1:474 Y2:500
Between Sept 1948

937
01:20:45,525 --> 01:20:47,880  X1:282 X2:417 Y1:474 Y2:495
And Jan 1949

938
01:20:48,005 --> 01:20:50,565  X1:270 X2:427 Y1:474 Y2:500
You were living

939
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:53,836  X1:195 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:525
with a high ranking nationalist
official named Li

940
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,718  X1:329 X2:368 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yes

941
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:00,845  X1:227 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500
Li never contacted you?

942
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:02,919  X1:319 X2:381 Y1:474 Y2:495
Never

943
01:21:08,765 --> 01:21:10,915  X1:258 X2:440 Y1:474 Y2:495
Li went to Holland

944
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:14,322  X1:170 X2:528 Y1:474 Y2:500
and then Brazil, did you know that?

945
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,320  X1:335 X2:363 Y1:474 Y2:495
No

946
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:19,197  X1:320 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why?

947
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:23,004  X1:201 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500
He never contacted me again

948
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:28,361  X1:246 X2:452 Y1:474 Y2:495
You want some tea?

949
01:21:28,725 --> 01:21:30,443  X1:296 X2:402 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thank you

950
01:21:48,365 --> 01:21:51,801  X1:163 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:500
This is the key to your old apartment

951
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:55,600  X1:277 X2:421 Y1:474 Y2:495
Go claim back

952
01:21:56,525 --> 01:21:59,835  X1:184 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:500
the things that were confiscated

953
01:22:00,605 --> 01:22:02,084  X1:301 X2:398 Y1:474 Y2:500
Sign here

954
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:10,278  X1:253 X2:446 Y1:474 Y2:495
This is his address

955
01:22:10,405 --> 01:22:11,804  X1:255 X2:444 Y1:474 Y2:495
He's still in Brazil?

956
01:22:11,965 --> 01:22:15,321  X1:232 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yes, with a huge ranch

957
01:22:49,499 --> 01:22:51,774  X1:177 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
The photo you took of my parents

958
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:53,093  X1:292 X2:404 Y1:474 Y2:495
was ruined

959
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:56,491  X1:172 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:495
when rain waterflooded ourhouse

960
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,816  X1:209 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, when you have time

961
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:01,015  X1:149 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:500
can you develop another one forthem?

962
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,491  X1:188 X2:511 Y1:474 Y2:500

963
01:23:04,299 --> 01:23:05,095  X1:316 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng

964
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:07,255  X1:200 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500
When are you taking me out?

965
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:08,937  X1:213 X2:486 Y1:474 Y2:500
Shanghai looks so colorful

966
01:23:09,099 --> 01:23:11,738  X1:189 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:525
l want to revisit the place where
l lived when l was small

967
01:23:14,459 --> 01:23:16,097  X1:180 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
You've just been here a few days

968
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:18,058  X1:258 X2:438 Y1:474 Y2:500
What's the hurry?

969
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:22,971  X1:316 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng

970
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:24,328  X1:221 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
Thanks forputting me up

971
01:23:27,059 --> 01:23:29,971  X1:181 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:495
Both of us have no relatives here

972
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:40,610  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:495
You can't lift that curtain

973
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:44,248  X1:202 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't worry, l won't go inside

974
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:48,094  X1:159 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:500
Have you written to yourparents yet?

975
01:23:54,059 --> 01:23:56,015  X1:313 X2:386 Y1:474 Y2:500
Not yet

976
01:23:57,939 --> 01:23:59,975  X1:217 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let them know you're safe

977
01:24:10,339 --> 01:24:11,738  X1:253 X2:444 Y1:474 Y2:500
Something wrong?

978
01:24:12,019 --> 01:24:13,737  X1:214 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
They wouldn't let me come

979
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:15,213  X1:320 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why?

980
01:24:16,499 --> 01:24:17,978  X1:297 X2:401 Y1:474 Y2:495
No reason

981
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:20,891  X1:188 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
Any clothes you need to wash?

982
01:24:21,059 --> 01:24:22,936  X1:199 X2:498 Y1:474 Y2:500
You left without telling them?

983
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,175  X1:209 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:500
No point explaining to them

984
01:24:25,379 --> 01:24:27,495  X1:230 X2:470 Y1:474 Y2:500
Just don't regret it later

985
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:30,890  X1:178 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:500
One should expand one's horizon

986
01:24:31,019 --> 01:24:32,338  X1:220 X2:478 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't you agree? Cheng?

987
01:25:03,379 --> 01:25:05,097  X1:242 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why are you so late?

988
01:25:05,339 --> 01:25:07,295  X1:221 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:500
Auntie Wang, this is Kela

989
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:10,771  X1:157 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:500
Auntie Wang... Cheng, you know her?.

990
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:14,573  X1:224 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:495
We all call him Old Color

991
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:16,971  X1:217 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:495
How can l be an Old Color

992
01:25:17,019 --> 01:25:19,299  X1:217 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:530
Shanghai people call
the classy ones Old Color

993
01:25:19,299 --> 01:25:20,937  X1:212 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng is the real Old Color

994
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:30,939  X1:231 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:500

995
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:33,009  X1:217 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't go out to eat tonight

996
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:40,215  X1:210 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:495
Put them in the kitchen first

997
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:45,170  X1:198 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll put them in the refrigerator

998
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:48,978  X1:210 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:500

1008
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:20,018  X1:175 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:530
There's a shortage of refrigerators
but the prices are good

1009
01:27:21,219 --> 01:27:24,450  X1:204 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:525
Don't be impatient...ls this
black market business safe?

1010
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:48,848  X1:316 X2:382 Y1:474 Y2:500

1012
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:54,413  X1:242 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're so busy lately

1013
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:56,491  X1:229 X2:469 Y1:474 Y2:500

1014
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,975  X1:203 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:500

01:28:27,379 --> 01:28:30,451  X1:174 X2:523 Y1:474 Y2:525
Auntie Wang, this is too difficult...

1025
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:54,529  X1:211 X2:486 Y1:474 Y2:495
lt's too hard forme to learn

1026
01:28:59,299 --> 01:29:00,579  X1:290 X2:407 Y1:474 Y2:495
You're here

Simon, come take a rest

1030
01:29:05,979 --> 01:29:06,616  X1:323 X2:375 Y1:474 Y2:500
Okay

1031
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:13,299  X1:284 X2:414 Y1:474 Y2:500
Auntie Wang

1032
01:29:13,299 --> 01:29:15,099  X1:157 X2:541 Y1:474 Y2:500
My daughter's schoolmate, Yonghong

1033
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,779  X1:219 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
Simon is from Hong Kong

1034
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:18,579  X1:204 X2:494 Y1:474 Y2:500
How are you? How are you?

1035
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:20,299  X1:142 X2:555 Y1:474 Y2:500
Are there parties like this in Hong Kong?

1036
01:29:20,299 --> 01:29:20,979  X1:335 X2:363 Y1:474 Y2:495
No

1037
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:23,732  X1:165 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:525
We go to discos and
we don't dance to this kind of music

1038
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:26,539  X1:278 X2:420 Y1:474 Y2:495
What's it like?

1039
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:29,859  X1:148 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:500
The music is fast and the beat is strong

1040
01:29:29,859 --> 01:29:32,419  X1:205 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:500
We dance till we're sweating

1041
01:29:32,419 --> 01:29:35,219  X1:159 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:500
Come to Hong Kong and l'll show you

1042
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:37,858  X1:189 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'll come find you in Hong Kong

1043
01:29:39,219 --> 01:29:40,811  X1:161 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:500
You know that boy from Hong Kong?

1044
01:29:43,099 --> 01:29:44,578  X1:335 X2:363 Y1:474 Y2:495
No

1045
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:53,569  X1:190 X2:507 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why force me to rememberyou

1046
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,098  X1:280 X2:419 Y1:474 Y2:495
l'll take a look

1047
01:30:04,819 --> 01:30:05,939  X1:243 X2:454 Y1:474 Y2:500
The tape is damaged

1048
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:07,213  X1:301 X2:399 Y1:474 Y2:500
Change it

1049
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,371  X1:226 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500
l want to dance with you

1050
01:30:09,499 --> 01:30:11,217  X1:218 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
What music do you want?

1051
01:30:31,099 --> 01:30:33,010  X1:261 X2:436 Y1:474 Y2:495
You came so late

1052
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,497  X1:234 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:495
You still don't trust me

1053
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:42,374  X1:215 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:495
For some unknown reason

1054
01:30:43,419 --> 01:30:48,447  X1:195 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm surrounded by melancholy

1055
01:31:02,059 --> 01:31:02,779  X1:272 X2:427 Y1:474 Y2:500
Dinneris ready

1056
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:03,973  X1:323 X2:375 Y1:474 Y2:500
Okay

1057
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:09,048  X1:290 X2:409 Y1:474 Y2:495
Have a seat

1058
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:16,657  X1:167 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:500
Simon, did yourMom learn to cook?

1059
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:20,130  X1:141 X2:557 Y1:474 Y2:500
She cooks once a year on Dad's birthday

1060
01:31:20,619 --> 01:31:21,779  X1:241 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:495
What kind of dishes?

1061
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:22,848  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:500
Western style

1062
01:31:23,299 --> 01:31:24,299  X1:311 X2:386 Y1:474 Y2:500
My Dad

1063
01:31:24,299 --> 01:31:26,017  X1:213 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
doesn't like Shanghai food

1064
01:31:26,739 --> 01:31:30,448  X1:187 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:530
That's perfect, Lili likes Western
style since she was young

1065
01:31:32,979 --> 01:31:35,299  X1:171 X2:527 Y1:474 Y2:500
l've applied for a long distance line

1066
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:37,179  X1:247 X2:451 Y1:474 Y2:495
so that l can call Lili

1067
01:31:37,179 --> 01:31:39,374  X1:213 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:500
Cheng, what do you think?

1068
01:31:47,979 --> 01:31:49,539  X1:242 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500
Does Lili go to work?

1069
01:31:49,539 --> 01:31:50,494  X1:279 X2:419 Y1:474 Y2:495
She never did

1070
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:53,374  X1:177 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:500
Dad says she's still like a little girl

1071
01:31:53,779 --> 01:31:55,929  X1:153 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:500
She neverinterfered with my life either

1072
01:32:05,059 --> 01:32:06,617  X1:269 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:500
lsn't that good?

1073
01:32:07,499 --> 01:32:11,099  X1:142 X2:556 Y1:474 Y2:500
Mom asked when you'd go to Hong Kong

1074
01:32:11,099 --> 01:32:12,539  X1:192 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:500
Among everything in Shanghai

1075
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:14,689  X1:175 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
She said she missed you the most

1076
01:32:16,819 --> 01:32:17,934  X1:275 X2:422 Y1:474 Y2:500
l definitely will

1077
01:32:18,259 --> 01:32:19,533  X1:257 X2:443 Y1:474 Y2:495
l wrote her a letter

1078
01:32:19,979 --> 01:32:21,419  X1:229 X2:469 Y1:474 Y2:500
Can you bring it to her?.

1079
01:32:21,419 --> 01:32:22,329  X1:325 X2:372 Y1:474 Y2:495
Sure

1080
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,217  X1:241 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:500
ls everything alright?

1081
01:32:33,059 --> 01:32:34,970  X1:305 X2:394 Y1:474 Y2:495
He's fine

1082
01:32:37,059 --> 01:32:39,175  X1:211 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:525
Don't behave
like that in front of children

1083
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:43,171  X1:184 X2:515 Y1:474 Y2:500
Let's go to Hong Kong to see Lili

1084
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:47,974  X1:333 X2:367 Y1:474 Y2:495
Eat

1085
01:32:49,619 --> 01:32:50,768  X1:307 X2:393 Y1:474 Y2:495
Let's eat

1086
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:52,652  X1:307 X2:393 Y1:474 Y2:495
Let's eat

1087
01:32:52,779 --> 01:32:57,728  X1:215 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:500
Lili died in Taipei at age 61

1088
01:33:19,379 --> 01:33:20,732  X1:234 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:500
Any news, Yonghong?

1089
01:33:21,299 --> 01:33:23,938  X1:168 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:530
They said they could get the money
back in a couple of days

1090
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,859  X1:189 X2:509 Y1:474 Y2:530
There are always risks involved
in black market dealings

1091
01:33:30,299 --> 01:33:31,778  X1:174 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:500
First time l took on such a big deal

1092
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:35,259  X1:226 X2:472 Y1:474 Y2:500
When the money arrives

1093
01:33:35,259 --> 01:33:37,250  X1:160 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:500
the passports can be easily arranged

1094
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,337  X1:208 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:500
The furtherwe go the better

1095
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,018  X1:248 X2:453 Y1:474 Y2:495
Talk about that later

1096
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,138  X1:229 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:500
Afterthe money arrives

1097
01:33:47,379 --> 01:33:48,494  X1:316 X2:381 Y1:474 Y2:495
What?

1098
01:33:49,179 --> 01:33:50,692  X1:131 X2:567 Y1:474 Y2:500
There's something you can't leave behind?

1099
01:34:00,099 --> 01:34:02,010  X1:269 X2:428 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're leaving?

1100
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:03,807  X1:335 X2:363 Y1:474 Y2:495
No

1101
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:05,374  X1:251 X2:449 Y1:474 Y2:500
l'm taking a shower

1102
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:22,453  X1:279 X2:420 Y1:474 Y2:500
ln a few years

1103
01:34:23,779 --> 01:34:26,612  X1:136 X2:563 Y1:474 Y2:500
You'll be able to leave wheneveryou want

1104
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:34,569  X1:165 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:530
lt's not something
that has to be decided in a few days

1105
01:34:35,019 --> 01:34:36,168  X1:266 X2:431 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why mention it?

1106
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,256  X1:251 X2:446 Y1:474 Y2:500
What do you want?

1107

1108
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:08,811  X1:164 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:500

1110
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:20,258  X1:210 X2:488 Y1:474 Y2:500

1111
01:35:25,179 --> 01:35:27,090  X1:234 X2:464 Y1:474 Y2:495

1112
01:36:21,139 --> 01:36:22,777  X1:291 X2:406 Y1:474 Y2:495
Nevermind

1120
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:31,729  X1:223 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
He moved out suddenly?

1121
01:37:36,299 --> 01:37:38,415  X1:279 X2:418 Y1:474 Y2:495

1123
01:37:57,459 --> 01:37:59,177  X1:233 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:500
Did he leave anything?

1124
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:13,888  X1:206 X2:491 Y1:474 Y2:500
Abuse yourself all you want

1125
01:38:14,339 --> 01:38:16,011  X1:232 X2:466 Y1:474 Y2:500
Don't abuse my photos

1126
01:38:17,499 --> 01:38:19,615  X1:218 X2:479 Y1:474 Y2:500

1127
01:38:20,499 --> 01:38:21,978  X1:218 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
You're yelling at me now?

1128
01:38:23,219 --> 01:38:26,575  X1:191 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:530

1129
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,371  X1:193 X2:505 Y1:474 Y2:495
He has all the time in the world

1130
01:38:36,339 --> 01:38:38,853  X1:192 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:530
Do you have
the same luxury to forget him?

1131
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,081  X1:182 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:500
Afriend took me to a grand hotel

1132
01:38:45,081 --> 01:38:47,276  X1:201 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:495
Even the doormen wear suits

1133
01:38:48,921 --> 01:38:50,479  X1:302 X2:396 Y1:474 Y2:495

1134
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,598  X1:198 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:500
You know a lot of foreigners?

1135
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,633  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:500
They brought you there?

1136
01:39:03,281 --> 01:39:04,634  X1:178 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yonghong introduced me to them

1137
01:39:05,241 --> 01:39:07,561  X1:153 X2:544 Y1:474 Y2:500
But l couldn't speak to them in English

1138
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:08,835  X1:195 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao and l both know English

1139
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:11,753  X1:220 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:500
What good does that do?

1140
01:39:14,721 --> 01:39:16,712  X1:218 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:500
You took great care of me

1141
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:25,675  X1:178 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:530

1142
01:39:26,201 --> 01:39:27,395  X1:299 X2:400 Y1:474 Y2:495

1144
01:39:32,441 --> 01:39:34,193  X1:167 X2:530 Y1:474 Y2:500
What were you thinking at the time?

1145
01:39:35,121 --> 01:39:37,161  X1:255 X2:442 Y1:474 Y2:495

1146
01:39:37,161 --> 01:39:38,196  X1:320 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Why?

1147
01:39:49,321 --> 01:39:51,198  X1:162 X2:537 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao was asking about you recently

1150
01:39:56,561 --> 01:39:58,313  X1:301 X2:397 Y1:474 Y2:495

1186
01:42:47,841 --> 01:42:49,479  X1:228 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:500
Yonghong deceived me

1187
01:42:56,641 --> 01:42:58,438  X1:243 X2:456 Y1:474 Y2:500

1190
01:43:29,721 --> 01:43:32,633  X1:207 X2:491 Y1:474 Y2:530

1191
01:43:33,201 --> 01:43:34,634  X1:275 X2:422 Y1:474 Y2:500

1192
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:38,397  X1:169 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:500
Neverthought there would be a last

1193
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,560  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

1194
01:43:43,041 --> 01:43:45,077  X1:223 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:530
You must have known
that with this young man

1195
01:43:45,561 --> 01:43:47,756  X1:185 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:500
There could be no happy ending

1196
01:43:49,201 --> 01:43:51,192  X1:228 X2:468 Y1:474 Y2:495
Yet l could not interfere

1197
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:05,120  X1:319 X2:378 Y1:474 Y2:500
Qiyao

1200
01:44:49,521 --> 01:44:51,681  X1:191 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:500
Lili, among all our schoolmates

1201
01:44:51,681 --> 01:44:53,681  X1:176 X2:522 Y1:474 Y2:500
who do you think about the most?

1202
01:44:53,681 --> 01:44:54,830  X1:259 X2:439 Y1:474 Y2:500
Definitely not you

1203
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:56,111  X1:293 X2:405 Y1:474 Y2:495
Then who?

1204
01:45:01,121 --> 01:45:02,634  X1:245 X2:452 Y1:474 Y2:500
Originally it was you

1205
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:05,801  X1:207 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:530
But time and time
again you've been insincere

1206
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:09,157  X1:185 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:525
There's a darkness in yourheart
as if there's a hole in there

1207
01:45:11,161 --> 01:45:12,561  X1:334 X2:364 Y1:474 Y2:495
Lili

1208
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:13,681  X1:203 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:500

1209
01:45:13,681 --> 01:45:15,512  X1:154 X2:544 Y1:474 Y2:500
When you're old and think of me again

1210
01:45:16,121 --> 01:45:17,190  X1:277 X2:421 Y1:474 Y2:500
You'll regret it

1211
01:45:18,681 --> 01:45:19,830  X1:243 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:495
l don't want to be old

1212
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:26,511  X1:234 X2:462 Y1:474 Y2:500
A city never grows old

1213
01:45:27,281 --> 01:45:32,036  X1:206 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:530
Because everyday someone
is embracing his youth
