1
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:38,301
Corny, who do you think
you're talking to?

2
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:41,308
lf the Semple attorneys don't know
who the heir is, who does?

3
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:46,211
Come on, Corny. I've done you a lot of
favors. Who's getting the Semple dough?

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,215
You're asking the wrong guy, Mac.
I'm only a press agent.

5
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,376
- Newspaperman?
- Wants to know who the heir is.

6
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,716
- Hang up.
- Sorry, Mac, l can't--

7
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,256
- Yeah, sure, but I ain't the attorney.
- Hang up!

8
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,259
Mr. Cedar is,
and l haven't seen him in two days.

9
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,763
- Cedar, we gotta deal with the papers.
- l'm not interested in the newspapers.

10
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,130
But it's a great story. Somewhere
a guy is walking into 20 million bucks.

11
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,567
My first concern
is to locate the Iucky man.

12
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:11,662
When l do, you keep
the newspapers away from him.

13
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,503
Okay, as long as that weekly stipend
keeps coming in.

14
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,509
We located him, Mr. Cedar.

15
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,511
- Yes, John, we got him.
- Here's the report.

16
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,774
Longfellow Deeds, single, 28,
lives in Mandrake FalIs, Vermont.

17
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,782
- Thank heaven.
- Better wire him.

18
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,910
l'll do no such thing. l'm going
there myself. You too, Anderson.

19
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,249
You too, Cobb.

20
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,051
Make three train reservations
to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

21
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:31,785
- <i>Wh</i>e<i>r</i>e<i>?</i>
- Mandrake Falls.

22
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,061
""WeIcome to Mandrake FalIs...

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,963
where the scenery enthraIls...

24
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,696
where no hardship e'er befaIls.

25
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,705
Welcome to Mandrake FaIls.''

26
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,206
That's pretty.

27
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,540
- You're sure he lives in this town?
- This is the town, all right.

28
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:53,307
Well, I hope it's not
a wild goose chase.

29
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,817
No, sir, we checked it thoroughly.
He lives here, all right.

30
00:02:56,884 --> 00:03:00,376
l spy a native.
Let's ask him.

31
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,656
- Good morning.
- Morning, neighbors, morning.

32
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:12,530
That's an excellent start.
At least we've broken the ice.

33
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,365
Do you know a fellow
by the name of LongfelIow Deeds?

34
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,837
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy.

35
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,965
Everyone knows Deeds.

36
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,976
Must be a game he's playing.

37
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,746
We'd like to get in touch with him.

38
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:29,248
- Who's that?
- Deeds. Who do you think?

39
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,616
Oh, yes, Deeds.
Fine fellow. Very democratic.

40
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:35,622
You won't have no troubIe at all.
TaIks to anybody.

41
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,059
- We'd better try somebody else.
- No.

42
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:43,223
Next time he comes out, I'Il straddle
him while you ask him your questions.

43
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:44,730
Morning, neighbors.

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,035
Remember us, the fellows
who were here a minute ago?

45
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,266
Oh, yes, indeedy.
l never forget a face.

46
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,968
Listen, pop.

47
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,307
We've come all the way from New York
to look up a fellow named Deeds.

48
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,847
lt's important.
lt's very important.

49
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:03,349
Don't get rough, neighbor.
Just ask.

50
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,353
Then please pretend, for just one
fleeting moment, that l'm asking.

51
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,322
- Where does he reside?
- Who?

52
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,495
Longfellow Deeds.
Where does he live?

53
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:19,056
Oh, that's what you want. Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

54
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,331
Those felIows don't know what they're
talking about. l'll take you there.

55
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:26,498
If they'd only explained to me
what they want, there'd be no trouble.

56
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,373
Oh. Will you come in,
please, gentIemen?

57
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,006
- ls Mr. Deeds in?
- No.

58
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:40,179
He's over to the park arranging a bazaar
to raise money for the fire engine.

59
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,381
Mal, you should've knowed
he was in the park.

60
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,856
Knowed it all the time,
but they wanted to see the house.

61
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:48,054
Can't read their minds
if they don't say what they want.

62
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,619
Come in, pIease.

63
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,131
- Can l get you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,636
Sit down. Sure l couldn't get you
a glass of lemonade or something?

65
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,637
No.
That's very kind of you.

66
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,572
- Are you related to him?
- No, l'm his housekeeper.

67
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,576
We'd like to find out something
about him. What does he do for a living?

68
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:07,910
He and Jim Mason own the tailor works,
but that's not how he makes his money.

69
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:11,474
- He makes most of it from his poetry.
- He writes poetry?

70
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:14,316
Oh, my goodness, yes.
LongfelIow's famous.

71
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,481
He writes alI those things
on postcards.

72
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:20,254
You know, for Christmas
and Easter and birthdays.

73
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:21,761
Sit down, please.

74
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:25,492
Here's one.
He got 25 doIlars for this one.

75
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:28,899
""When you've nowhere to turn
and you're filled with doubt...

76
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,666
don't stand in midstream hesitating...

77
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,230
for you know that your mother's heart
cries out--

78
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,277
'l'm waiting, my boy, l'm waiting.'''

79
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,247
lsn't that beautifuI?
lsn't it a loveIy sentiment?

80
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,112
Yeah.

81
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,449
Here he is now.

82
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,749
l suggest you break it to him gently.
He's liable to keel over from the shock.

83
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,092
They've been waiting a long while.

84
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,597
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

85
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,404
- Mr. LongfeIlow Deeds?
- Yes.

86
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,031
How do you do?

87
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,044
l'm John Cedar, of the New York firm
of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

88
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,218
Budington must feel
like an awful stranger.

89
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:24,018
- Mr. Cornelius Cobb. Mr. Anderson.
- How do you do?

90
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,685
You gentIemen
make yourselves comfortable.

91
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,194
Thank you.

92
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,490
Thanks.

93
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,996
New mouthpiece.
Been waitin' two weeks for this.

94
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,206
Kids keep swiping them all the time.
They use 'em for bean shooters.

95
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:44,305
- What can l do for you gentlemen?
- You gentlemen going to stay to lunch?

96
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:47,108
- l'd Iike to ask you a few questions.
- AIl right.

97
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,082
- Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds' son?
- Yes.

98
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,085
- Your parents living?
- Why, no.

99
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:56,089
Well, Mr. Deeds, does the name of
Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?

100
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:58,421
Not much.
He's an uncIe of mine, l think.

101
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:01,256
l never saw him.
My mother's name was Semple.

102
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,594
Well, he passed on. He was kilIed
in a motor accident in Italy.

103
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:07,600
He was? Gee, that's too bad.

104
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,762
- lf there's anything l can do--
- l have good news for you, sir.

105
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,070
Mr. Semple left a large fortune
when he died.

106
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,769
He Ieft it all to you.

107
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,878
Deducting the taxes...

108
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,382
it amounts to something in
the neighborhood of 20 million dollars.

109
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,152
How about Iunch?
Are the gentlemen staying?

110
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,915
Of course.

111
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,686
She's got some fresh orange layer cake
with that thick stuff on the top.

112
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,694
Sure. They don't want
to go to the hotel.

113
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:40,733
Perhaps you didn't hear
what l said, Mr. Deeds.

114
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,362
The whole Semple fortune goes to you--
20 million dollars.

115
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:48,238
Oh, yes, l heard you, all right.
Twenty miIlion is quite a lot, isn't it?

116
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,210
- lt'll do in a pinch.
- Yes, indeed.

117
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:54,714
l wonder why he left me alI that money.
l don't need it.

118
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,164
Mr. Cobb here
is an ex-newspaperman.

119
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:14,360
Associated with your uncle
for many years, as a sort of buffer.

120
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,164
Buffer?

121
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:19,400
Yeah.
A gIorified doormat.

122
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:22,931
Rich people need someone to keep the
crowds away. The world's fulI of pests.

123
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,443
Then there's the newspapers.

124
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:28,539
One must know when to seek publicity
and when to avoid it.

125
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:31,642
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

126
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,744
l can't think
of a rhyme for ""Budington.''

127
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,482
Why should you?

128
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,957
Whenever l run across a funny name,
l like to poke around for a rhyme.

129
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,960
- Don't you?
- No.

130
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,392
- I've got one for Cobb.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:49,596
There once was a man named Cobb
who kept Semple away from the mob.

132
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,104
Came the turn of the tide
and SempIe, he died.

133
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,607
Now poor Cobb's out of a job.

134
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,404
- Sounds like two weeks' notice to me.
- Huh?

135
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,211
l've gotten the sackeroo in many ways,
but never in rhyme.

136
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:05,479
I don't mean that.
l'll need your heIp.

137
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:07,578
That's different,
if it's just poetry.

138
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,088
Are you married?

139
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:10,783
Who, me? No.

140
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:13,418
He's too fussy for that.
That's what's the matter with him.

141
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:16,827
There's Iots of nice girls
right here in Mandrake FalIs--

142
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:18,831
Don't pay any attention to her.

143
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,359
He's got a lot of foolish notions
about saving a lady in distress.

144
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,735
Now, you keep out of this.

145
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:30,641
Saving a Iady in distress, eh? We aIl
have dreams like that when we're young.

146
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:34,306
lncidentally, we'd better get started.
You'll have to pack.

147
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,815
- What for?
- You're going to New York with us.

148
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,977
- When?
- This afternoon, 4:00.

149
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,987
l don't think
we've got any suitcases.

150
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:44,320
WelI, we could borrow a couple
from Mrs. Simpson.

151
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,986
She went to Niagara Falls
last year.

152
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:51,554
l'm kinda nervous. l've never been
away from Mandrake FalIs in my life.

153
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,567
- Like to see Grant's tomb, though.
- I can understand that.

154
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,069
We'll meet you at the train
at 4:00.

155
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,232
Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one
of the richest men in the country.

156
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:02,241
See you later.
Good-bye. Thank you.

157
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,743
- See you later, kid.
- Good day, sir.

158
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,789
Did you hear what he said?
Do you know how much 20 milIion is?

159
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:20,589
I don't care. You sit there and eat
your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

160
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:28,229
<i>For h</i>e<i>'s a jolly good f</i>e<i>llow</i>
<i>For h</i>e<i>'s a jolly good f</i>e<i>llow</i>

161
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,429
<i>For h</i>e<i>'s a jolly good f</i>e<i>llow</i>

162
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,233
<i>Whi</i>c<i>h nobody</i> c<i>an d</i>e<i>ny</i>

163
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,177
l can't find him. l looked everywhere.
His house is Iocked up.

164
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:43,182
- Probably had a change of heart.
- He wasn't anxious to come.

165
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,445
Here comes the train.

166
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:50,914
- Look.
- What?

167
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,856
That tuba player.

168
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,529
Well...

169
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,166
now I've seen everything.

170
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,350
Good-bye, Mrs. Meredith!

171
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,388
Good-bye, Jim!

172
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,293
Bye, Buddy!

173
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:07,566
Gosh, l got a lot of friends.

174
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,404
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

175
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:23,749
Cigar?

176
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,307
No, thank you.

177
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,320
l wouldn't worry if l were you.

178
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:32,257
A large portion like this entails great
responsibility, but you'll have help.

179
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,726
So don't worry.
Leave everything to me.

180
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,286
- l wasn't worried about that.
- No?

181
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:40,993
l was wondering where they're gonna
get another tuba player for the band.

182
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:03,880
- Hello, John. Where you been?
- I've been fishing.

183
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:05,891
Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

184
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:10,086
Good morning.
Where are they?

185
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,190
- Waiting for you.
- Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

186
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:14,757
Good morning.

187
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,097
- Hello, boys.
- WeIl, what's he like?

188
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,700
We've nothing to worry about.
He's as naive as a child.

189
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,209
CIose that door.

190
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,042
- Get Mrs. Cedar on the phone.
- John, what happened?

191
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:29,708
The smartest thing l ever did
was to make that trip.

192
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,307
- John, did you get--
- No, Budington.

193
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,819
l didn't get the power of attorney,
but I will.

194
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,653
l asked him what he was going to do with
the money. What do you suppose he said?

195
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,022
Give it away.

196
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,790
- The boy must be a nitwit.
- John, you had the right hunch.

197
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,297
- John, we can't afford--
- l know, Budington.

198
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,096
We can<i>'</i>t afford to have the books
investigated right now.

199
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,102
You've said that a thousand times.

200
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,104
What if they faIl
into somebody else's hands?

201
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,605
lt hasn't happened yet.

202
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:55,767
But haIf-a-million dollars,
my goodness--

203
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,708
Will you stop worrying!

204
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,680
l got SempIe to turn it aIl over to us.
And who got power of attorney from him?

205
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:04,376
All right, then l'll get it again.

206
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,544
Now, take it easy. Those books
will never leave this office.

207
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,012
Yokel.
Nothing but a yokel.

208
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,025
Your uncle must've been mad
to leave all that money to him.

209
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,529
You're as closely related to him
as he is, and what did you get?

210
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,063
- I say, what did you get?
- Stop yelling.

211
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:25,071
- Can l heIp it if Uncle didn't like me?
- l told you to be nice to him.

212
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,074
Ten years we've waited
for that old man to kick off.

213
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:31,543
Then we were gonna be on Easy Street.
Yeah, on Easy Street.

214
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:35,173
- It<i>'</i>s too late now. You're a nuisance.
- That's just what I'm gonna be.

215
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,548
I'm gonna be a nuisance
until I get ahold of some of that money.

216
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,813
He's news!

217
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,155
Every time he blows his nose,
it's news.

218
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:46,556
A corn-fed bohunk like that falIing
into the Semple fortune is hot copy.

219
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:49,061
lt's gotta be personal.
lt's gotta have an angle.

220
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,292
What does he think about?
How does it feel to be a millionaire?

221
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:55,130
What does he think of New York?
ls he smart? Dumb? A milIion angles.

222
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,103
He's been here three days,
and what have you numbskulls brought in?

223
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:00,697
-A half-wit novice could've done better.
-We tried--

224
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,299
Am I talking too loud
or annoying anybody?

225
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:06,642
You know Corny Cobb.
He's keeping him under lock and key.

226
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,079
Never mind.
Use what little brains you've got.

227
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,483
Find out something for yourselves,
you imbecilic stupes.

228
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:16,990
Now get out of here before
l really tell you what l think of you.

229
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:26,090
- What was that?
- l said you had dirty plaster.

230
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:30,828
You too.

231
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:34,431
Thought l could depend on you,
but you're as bad as the rest.

232
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:36,904
Look. l can do it.

233
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,808
What's gotten into you, Babe?

234
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,815
NormaIly you'd blast this town wide open
before letting Cobb get away with this.

235
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,817
He's not getting away with anything.

236
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:47,547
Babe, get me some stuff on this guy
and you can have--

237
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:50,112
- Can I have a month's vacation?
- With pay.

238
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,856
With pay? Leave four columns open
on the front page tomorrow.

239
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:59,592
l'll keep the whole front page open.
What are you gonna do?

240
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,258
Have lunch.

241
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,614
The first time l ever
had a suit made on purpose.

242
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,384
lt's merely a suggestion, Mr. Deeds...

243
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:24,390
but if you'll give me power of attorney,
we'll take care of everything.

244
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,224
It'll save you a lot of annoyances.
Everyone will try to seIl you something.

245
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:31,389
There have been a lot of them aIready.
Strangest kind of people.

246
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,695
Salesmen, politicians, moochers.
AlI want something.

247
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,497
Haven<i>'</i>t had a minute to myseIf.
Haven't seen Grant's tomb yet.

248
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,596
Your uncle didn't bother with that sort
of thing. He left everything to us.

249
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,607
He traveled, enjoyed himself.

250
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,973
You should do the same thing.

251
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,808
Besides wanting to be my lawyer...

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,814
you want to handle
my investments too?

253
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:53,319
- Yes. That is to say--
- How much extra would it cost?

254
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,322
- No extra charge.
- That's a lot of extra work.

255
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,054
But that's a service Cedar, Cedar,
Cedar and Budington usualIy donates.

256
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,426
Budington.

257
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:05,931
l can't think of a rhyme
for Budington yet.

258
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:09,628
The gentlemen from the opera are
stilI waiting in the board room, sir.

259
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,637
They're getting a trifle impatient.

260
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,730
l forgot about them.
What do you think they want?

261
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:16,799
Your uncle was chairman of the board.
They probably expect you to carry on.

262
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,472
l'lI tell those mugs to keep their
shirts on and that you<i>'</i>ll be right down.

263
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,539
Oh, did you send that telegram
to Jim Mason yet?

264
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:25,551
Jim Mason?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

265
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,316
No, l didn't send it. l've got it
written out, though. Here it is.

266
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:32,051
""Arthur's been with the tailor works
too long. Stop.

267
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,060
Don't think we should fire him.
LongfelIow.''

268
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,596
Send it right away.
l don't want him to fire Arthur.

269
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,689
Sure, we don't want to fire Arthur.

270
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,701
He was the Iast baby
my father delivered, Arthur was.

271
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,203
You ought to give this matter
some thought.

272
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,536
l mean about
the power of attorney.

273
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,577
Oh, yes, l will.
I'Il give it a lot of thought.

274
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:53,579
There was a felIow named Winslow
here a while ago...

275
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,275
wanted to handle my business
for nothing too.

276
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,877
Puzzles me why these people want
to work for nothing. lt isn't natural.

277
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,251
l guess l'd better
think about it some more.

278
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,916
That's that.

279
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,927
You go to an awful lot of work
to keep a fella warm.

280
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:08,984
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,155
A Mr. HaIlor to see you, sir.

282
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,825
HaIlor?
Don't Iet him in.

283
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,231
Why not? Who's he?

284
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,703
A lawyer representing a woman.
Some claim against the estate.

285
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:22,538
If he has a claim, we'd better see him.
Send him in.

286
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:25,009
He'lI cause you a lot of trouble.

287
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,343
How can he make trouble for me?
I haven't done anything.

288
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:31,907
- l told you to take this up with me.
- I'm tired of being pushed around.

289
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,919
I don't care
how important you are.

290
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,751
- Mr. Deeds, l represent Mrs. Semple.
- Mrs. Semple?

291
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,758
Your uncIe's common-law wife.
She has a legal claim on the estate.

292
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:43,853
- Suppose we let the courts decide--
- You wouldn't dare take this to court.

293
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,522
I'll leave it to you.

294
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,091
Would any court not be in sympathy with
a woman who gave up her best years...

295
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,103
for an oId man like your uncle?

296
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,106
- What kind of wife did you say?
- Common-law wife.

297
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,439
- On top of that, there's a child.
- Child? My uncle?

298
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,570
- Yes, sir.
- That's awfuI.

299
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,580
The poor woman should be
taken care of immediately.

300
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,082
l'm glad to see you're
willing to be reasonable.

301
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:07,484
If she was his wife, she should have
the money. l don't want a penny.

302
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,146
Don't make any rash promises.

303
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:12,214
Better go. That opera mob is about to
break into the mad song from <i>Lu</i>c<i>ia</i>.

304
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:15,284
l don't wanna keep them waiting.
They're important peopIe.

305
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,695
- Very good, sir.
- l can't go down Iike this.

306
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,700
l wish you'd go along with me, Cobb.
They're all strangers to me.

307
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,168
- What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- Huh?

308
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,695
Oh. You'll excuse me, won't you?
I'Il be right back.

309
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,950
Gee, I'm busy. Do the opera people
always come here for their meetings?

310
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,952
- Uh-huh.
- That's funny. Why's that?

311
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,386
Why do mice go
where there's cheese?

312
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,148
l'm led to believe
the young man's quite chiIdish.

313
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,161
We won't have any difficulty
getting him to put up the entire amount.

314
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,926
- After alI, it's only $180,000.
- Excellent idea.

315
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,730
We're very fortunate the young man
is so sympathetic toward music.

316
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,738
He plays the tuba
in the town band.

317
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:02,466
- Here he comes.
- Good.

318
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:10,015
The first order of business will be
eIecting a new chairman of the board.

319
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,814
As a sentimental gesture toward
the best friend that opera ever had--

320
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,320
the late Mr. Semple--

321
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,357
l think it only fitting that his nephew,
Mr. Longfellow Deeds...

322
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,052
should be made our next chairman.

323
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,755
- l therefore nominate him.
- Seconded.

324
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,161
- All those in favor?
- Aye!

325
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,665
Carried.

326
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,599
Our congratulations, Mr. Deeds.

327
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,604
- l'm chairman?
- Yes. You've just been elected.

328
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,607
- I'm chairman!
- Happy voyage.

329
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,609
Right here, Mr. Deeds.

330
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:43,710
Now, the next order of business--
the reading of the secretary's minutes.

331
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,718
- Move we dispense with it.
- Seconded.

332
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,219
- AlI in favor?
- Aye!

333
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,221
l think they can be
dispensed with.

334
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,224
-We<i>'</i>re ready for the treasurer<i>'</i>s report.
-Move we dispense with it.

335
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,725
- Seconded.
- All in favor.

336
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,730
Quite right. Now, gentlemen,
the next order of business--

337
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,234
Just a minute.
What does the chairman do?

338
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,735
WeIl, the chairman
presides the meeting.

339
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,294
That's what l thought.

340
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:09,502
But, if you don't mind, l'm rather
interested in the treasurer's report.

341
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:19,782
The treasurer reports a deficit
of $180,000 for the current year.

342
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,617
A deficit?
You mean we lost that much?

343
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:26,125
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera
is not conducted for profit.

344
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:28,354
lt isn't?
What is it conducted for?

345
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:29,952
lt's an artistic institution.

346
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,928
- We own an opera house, don't we?
- We do.

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,094
- And we give shows?
- We provide opera.

348
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,468
But you charge--
l mean, you seIl tickets?

349
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,473
- Of course.
- And it doesn't pay?

350
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,338
Impossible.
The opera has never paid.

351
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,470
Well, then, we must give
the wrong kind of shows.

352
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:50,004
There isn't any wrong or right kind.
Opera is opera.

353
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:55,282
l guess, but I wouldn't care to be head
of a business that kept losing money.

354
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,947
That wouldn't be common sense.

355
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:00,720
lncidentalIy, where is
the $180,000 coming from?

356
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:03,786
Well, we were rather expecting it
to come from you.

357
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,290
- Me?
- Naturally.

358
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,833
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There's nothing natural about that.

359
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:17,839
Fire engine!

360
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,441
Gee, that was a pip!

361
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,977
We're gonna have one like that in
Mandrake Falls soon, with a siren too.

362
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,422
Uh, where were we?

363
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:35,723
You see, the opera is not conducted
like any ordinary business.

364
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:38,855
- Why not?
- Because it just isn't a business.

365
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,696
Maybe it isn't to you,
but it certainIy is to me...

366
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:45,033
if l have to make up a Ioss
of $180,000.

367
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,869
lf it's losing that much money,
there must be something wrong.

368
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:51,069
Maybe you charge too much.
Maybe you're selling bad merchandise.

369
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,078
A Iot of things.
l don't know.

370
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:56,081
You see, I expect to do
a lot of good with that money...

371
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,676
and I can't afford to put it into
anything that l don't Iook into.

372
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,211
That's my decision
for the time being, gentlemen.

373
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,384
Good-bye, and thank you
for making me chairman.

374
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:10,486
Gentlemen, you'lI find the
smelling salts in the medicine chest.

375
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,279
Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:31,340
Those opera people are funny.
They wanted me to put up $180,000.

377
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:34,353
- What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- l turned them down, naturally.

378
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,015
- No, l mean about my client.
- Oh.

379
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,524
We'll have to do something
about the common wife.

380
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:42,186
- Tails tonight, sir?
- Tails?

381
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:43,854
Why, that's a monkey suit.

382
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,093
You want peopIe to laugh at me?
l've never worn one of those in my life.

383
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,101
Good-bye, and thank you, sir.

384
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,603
Good-bye.
Wants me to wear a monkey suit.

385
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,606
- We don't want to appear greedy.
- Huh?

386
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:58,303
- l say, we don't want to appear greedy.
- Oh, that.

387
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:00,846
- What are you doing?
- Assisting you, sir.

388
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:04,850
l don't want anybody holding
the ends of my pants. Get up from there.

389
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,982
Imagine that.
Holding the ends of my pants.

390
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,718
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law
to one-third of the estate.

391
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:16,023
- Don<i>'</i>t ever get on your knees again.
- No, sir.

392
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,256
What'd you say?

393
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,026
Mrs. Semple is entitled
to one-third of the estate.

394
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,159
One-third.
That's about seven million dollars.

395
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:25,170
Well, we didn't expect that much.

396
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:27,934
l'm sure I can get her
to settle quietIy for one million.

397
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,476
Take up any settlement talk
with me in the office.

398
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:32,170
l'll do no such thing.

399
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:35,339
That's right. There's only one pIace
you're going, and that's out the door.

400
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,782
- You're making a mistake.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

401
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,149
l don't like your face.

402
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,986
Besides, there's something fishy about
a person who'd settIe for a million...

403
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,048
when they can get seven miIlion.

404
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:49,186
l'm surprised that Mr. Cedar,
who's supposed to be a smart man...

405
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,695
couldn<i>'</i>t see through that.

406
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:52,527
Now, wait a minute, buddy--

407
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:56,160
One nice thing about being rich--
you ring a belI and things happen.

408
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:58,966
When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor,
l'll ask him to show you to the door.

409
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,631
Many people
don't know where it is.

410
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,438
No use in getting tough. That'll
get you nowhere. We've got letters.

411
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:07,378
- Show Mr. Hallor to the front door.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:11,645
There isn't any wife, there aren't any
Ietters, and I think you're a crook...

413
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,811
so you'd better watch your step.

414
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:19,789
I can't hold out any Ionger.

415
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,259
Lamb bites wolf.
BeautifuI.

416
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,159
lt's only common sense.

417
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,494
I can't hold out any Ionger either,
Mr. Deeds.

418
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,898
Being an attorney for you
will be a very simple affair.

419
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:32,802
You're not my attorney yet, not
until l find out what's on your mind.

420
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:36,501
Suppose you get the books straightened
out so I can have a look at 'em.

421
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,168
Yes, of course, if you wish.

422
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:41,645
But you must be prepared. This sort
of thing will be daily routine.

423
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,649
lf it becomes annoying,
you let me know.

424
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,480
Good-bye, Mr. Deeds.

425
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:47,986
Good-bye, sir.

426
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,225
Even his hands are oily.

427
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,633
WeIl, how about tonight? What would you
like in the way of entertainment?

428
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:04,965
Entertainment?

429
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,530
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones.
Tall and stately.

430
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,099
How wouId you like yours?
Dark or fair?

431
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:13,975
Tall or short? Fat or thin?
Tough or tender?

432
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:16,709
- What are you talking about?
- Women.

433
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,216
Ever heard of 'em?

434
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,842
Oh!

435
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,980
- Name your poison, and l'll supply it.
- Some other time, Cobb.

436
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:25,991
Okay. You're the boss.

437
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,186
When your blood begins to boil,
yell out.

438
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:29,785
I'll be seeing you.

439
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,434
He talks about women
as if they were cattle.

440
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:38,062
Every man to his taste, sir.

441
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,301
Tell me, Walter, are all these stories
l hear about my uncle true?

442
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:45,401
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many
as 20 in the house at the same time.

443
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,812
- Twenty? What'd he do with 'em?
- That is something l never found out.

444
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,973
Hey! You going out?

445
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:24,039
- Yes. lsn't that all right?
- No.

446
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:26,483
- You never go out without telling us.
- Who are you?

447
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,384
We're your bodyguards.

448
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:29,887
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,322
Mr. Cobb said
stick to your tail.

450
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:35,987
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb, but l
don't want anybody sticking to my taiI.

451
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:38,053
Sorry, mister.
Orders is orders.

452
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:41,066
We gotta get you up in the morning,
put you to bed at night.

453
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:44,069
Only it's alI right. No matter
what we see, we don't see nothin', see?

454
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,128
- That's gonna be fun.
- Some people like it.

455
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,232
- WiIl you do something for me first?
- Sure.

456
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,777
Put that away, slug.
At your service.

457
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,574
- Would you get my trunk out for me?
- Certainly.

458
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:56,080
With pleasure.

459
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:06,149
We're your bodyguards!
You can't do this!

460
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,264
There he is.

461
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,038
- That's him.
- That's who?

462
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:25,043
- Get your cameras ready and follow me.
- What are you gonna do?

463
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:28,046
Never mind. Follow me
and grab whatever you can get.

464
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:30,241
It's gonna be
the same oId thing.

465
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,250
- That dame is nuts.
- Right.

466
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,174
You fainted.

467
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:02,180
Oh, did l? l<i>'</i>m sorry.

468
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:05,911
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I'Il be all right.

469
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,018
This is my house.

470
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:11,682
- l'd like to--
- Oh, no, really, l'll be all right.

471
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:14,553
What happened?

472
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,495
Well, l-- I guess
l walked too much.

473
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,896
l've been Iooking
for a job all day.

474
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,994
l found one too.
l start tomorrow.

475
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:28,438
You've been awfuIly kind.
Thank you very much.

476
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:43,111
Hey! Taxi!

477
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,658
Hey, Stu, folIow that cab
they just got into, will ya!

478
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:51,822
- Hurry up! Step on it!
- Come on, let's go!

479
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,019
Feel better now?

480
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,928
This tastes so good.

481
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,930
Mr. Deeds, l don't know
how l can ever thank you.

482
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,694
Tell me more about yourself.

483
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:33,296
Well, l guess l've told you
almost everything there is to teIl.

484
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,137
My foIks live in a small town
near Hartford.

485
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,906
I'm down here aIone
trying to make a living.

486
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:42,243
l'm reaIly just a nobody.

487
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:47,642
Oh, that was so lovely.
Thank you.

488
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,854
You were a Iady in distress,
weren't you?

489
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:58,348
What?

490
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:01,092
Nothing.

491
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,025
Waiter.

492
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:06,587
- Has anybody come in yet?
- Uh, no. Nobody important.

493
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,100
Be sure and point them out to me.

494
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:12,797
l<i>'</i>m a writer myself, you know.
l write poetry.

495
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:19,644
Well...

496
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,647
you've been having quite
an exciting time, haven<i>'</i>t you?

497
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:26,207
With all these meetings,
business deaIs, society peopIe...

498
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,752
haven't you been having fun?

499
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,617
No.

500
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:33,489
That is, I didn't until I met you.
l like talking to you though.

501
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,494
lmagine my finding you
right on my doorstep.

502
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:39,998
- Brookfield's just come in.
- Who? The poet? Where?

503
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:43,263
Over at that big round table.
The one that Iooks like a poodle.

504
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,131
Look, there's Brookfield,
the poet.

505
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:49,902
ReaIly?

506
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,004
Pardon.

507
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,106
LongfelIow Deeds, who just inherited
the Semple fortune, wants to meet you.

508
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,209
Oh, yes. l read about him.
He writes poetry on postcards.

509
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:03,221
Let's invite him over.
Might get a couple of laughs.

510
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,984
Getting rather duIl around here.

511
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:06,649
lt's aIways dull here.

512
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,318
- l'll get him.
- Good.

513
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,762
Mr. Henneberry.
Mr. Morrow. BilI.

514
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:18,167
This is Mr. Deeds and his fiancee
from Mandrake FalIs.

515
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,262
How do you do, Mr. Deeds?

516
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,643
Nice of you to ask us
to come and sit with you.

517
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:28,509
Back home we never get a chance
to meet famous people.

518
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:32,608
- Waiter, a little service here.
- Yes, a drink for Mr. Deeds.

519
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:35,176
- l don't want it, thank you.
- You must. All poets drink.

520
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:38,223
Tell me, Mr. Deeds,
how do you go about writing your poems?

521
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:41,385
We craftsmen are very interested
in one another's methods.

522
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,191
Do you have to wait for an inspiration,
or do you just dash it off?

523
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:48,324
- WelI, I--
- Morrow just dashes them off.

524
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,633
Yeah. That's what my publishers
have been compIaining about.

525
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:57,037
Well, your readers don't complain,
Mr. Morrow.

526
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,371
Oh. Thanks.

527
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:00,537
How about you, Mr. Deeds?

528
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,877
Well, I write mine on order.

529
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:06,715
The people l work for telI me
what they want, and then l write it.

530
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:08,413
Amazing!

531
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,148
Why, that's true genius.

532
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:15,091
Have you any pecuIiar characteristics
when you're creating?

533
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,891
WelI, I-- l play the tuba.

534
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,864
How original.

535
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,867
Well, l've been pIaying the harmonica
for 40 years.

536
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,766
Didn't do me a bit of good.

537
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,535
You wouldn't have one
in your pocket, would you?

538
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,134
What, a tuba?

539
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:35,146
No, a postcard
with one of your poems on it.

540
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:38,581
- Oh, no.
- You don<i>'</i>t carry a pocketful with you?

541
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:41,643
Oh, too bad. l was hoping
you'd autograph one for me.

542
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,121
- l was too.
- Now wait a minute, boys.

543
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,023
Perhaps Mr. Deeds
would recite one for us.

544
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,027
That's a very good idea.

545
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,495
Nothing like a poet
reciting his own stuff.

546
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,589
How about a Mother's Day poem?

547
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:57,932
ExactIy. Give us one that rings
the great American heart.

548
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,938
Yes. Go ahead.

549
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:04,943
l get the idea. l know why
l was invited here-- to make fun of me.

550
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:07,377
- Oh, not at all.
- Don't be ridicuIous.

551
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:08,879
Look, he's temperamental.

552
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:11,610
Yeah? What if I am?
What about it?

553
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,721
lt's easy to make fun of somebody
if you don't care how much you hurt 'em.

554
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:19,053
I think your poems are swell,
Mr. Brookfield...

555
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,059
but l'm disappointed in you.

556
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,186
l must look funny to you...

557
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:26,322
but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls
you'd Iook just as funny to us...

558
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:29,334
only nobody would Iaugh at you
and make you feel ridiculous...

559
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:32,166
because that wouldn't be
good manners.

560
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:36,197
Maybe writing postcard poems is comical,
but a lot of peopIe think they're good.

561
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,209
Anyway, it's the best l can do.

562
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,212
So if you'll excuse me,
we'lI be Ieaving.

563
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,977
l guess l found out that
all famous peopIe aren't big people.

564
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,911
Just one thing more.

565
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,924
lf it weren't for Miss Dawson being
here, l'd bump your heads together.

566
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:54,653
Oh, l don't mind.

567
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:56,854
Then l guess maybe l will.

568
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:04,168
Waiter!

569
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,429
Eureka!

570
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:10,475
Stop it.
Go away, go away.

571
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,033
Step aside.

572
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:15,376
Say, felIa, you neglected me
and I feel very put out.

573
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:18,576
Look, sock it right there, will ya?
Sock it hard.

574
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:21,279
- l've got it off my chest.
- Oh, listen.

575
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:24,914
The difference between them and me is,
I know when l've been a skunk.

576
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,586
You take me to the nearest newsstand and
l'll eat a pack of your postcards raw.

577
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:31,061
Raw!

578
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,964
Oh, what a magnificent deflation
of smugness!

579
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,026
Pal, you've added ten years
to my life.

580
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:42,598
A poet with a straight left
and a right hook? Delicious. Delicious.

581
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:47,169
You're my guest from now on,
forever and a day, even unto eternity.

582
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,909
- Thanks, but we're going sightseeing.
- Fine. Fine. Swell.

583
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:55,044
You've just shown me a sight lovely
to behoId, and I'd like to reciprocate.

584
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:58,056
Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet--
Thanks--

585
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:00,922
and l'll show you sights
that you've never seen before.

586
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,553
l'd like to see Grant's tomb
and the Statue of Liberty.

587
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:07,030
You'll not only see those,
but before the evening's half through...

588
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,465
you'lI be leaning against
the Leaning Tower of Pisa...

589
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:10,968
you'll mount Mount Everest.

590
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:13,470
l'lI show you the pyramids
and alI the little pyramidees...

591
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,473
leaping from sphinx to sphinx.

592
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:19,477
Pal, how would you like to go on
a real old-fashioned binge?

593
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,843
- Binge?
- Yeah, l mean the reaI McCoy.

594
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:23,848
You pIay saloon with me...

595
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:27,647
and l'll introduce you to every wit,
nitwit and half-wit in New York.

596
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,713
We'll go on a twister that'll make
Omar the soused phiIosopher of Persia...

597
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,726
Iook like an anemic
on a goat's miIk diet.

598
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,888
- That oughta be fun, huh?
- Fun? Say--

599
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:40,761
Listen, I'll take you
on a bender...

600
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:45,133
that will live in your memory
as a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

601
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,638
Boy? Boy, my headpiece!

602
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:51,005
O Tempora! O Mores! O Bacchus!

603
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:53,203
- Oh, you're drunk.
- Oh, you're right!

604
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:58,308
- lf we go with him, we'll see things.
- I guess we will.

605
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,790
""'I play the tuba to help me think.'

606
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:08,793
This is one of the many startling
statements made by Longfellow Deeds...

607
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:10,385
New York's new Cinderella Man...

608
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,454
who went out Iast night to prove
that his uncle, the Iate M.W. Semple...

609
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,500
from whom he inherited
20 miIlion dollars...

610
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:19,299
was an amateur in the art of standing
the town on its cauIiflower ear.''

611
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:24,134
""Cinderella Man.''
That's sensational, Babe, sensational.

612
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,235
Took some high-powered acting,
beIieve me.

613
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:28,803
- Did it?
- I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

614
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:31,008
Is he really that big a sap?

615
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,348
He's the original.
There are no carbon copies of that one.

616
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,481
""CindereIla Man.'' That'll stick to him
for the rest of his life.

617
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:42,084
Can you imagine Cobb's face
when he reads this?

618
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,322
lf we could seIl tickets,
we'd make a fortune.

619
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:47,331
- How'd you get the picture?
- Had the boys folIow us.

620
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,525
Marvelous.

621
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,831
""At 2:00 a.m.
Mr. Deeds tied up traffic...

622
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:53,997
while he fed a bagful of donuts
to a horse.

623
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:57,275
When asked why he was doing it
he replied...

624
00:38:57,343 --> 00:39:01,473
'To see how many donuts the horse would
eat before he asked for some coffee.'''

625
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,617
BeautifuI!
What happened after that?

626
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:12,350
l don't know. l had to write the story.
He was so drunk he never even missed me.

627
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:14,688
When are you gonna see him again?

628
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:16,851
Tonight, maybe.

629
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,693
l'll phone him at noon--
my lunch hour.

630
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:21,699
l'm a stenographer, you know.
Mary Dawson.

631
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,201
You're a genius, Babe, a genius.

632
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,204
I even moved into
MabeI Dawson's apartment...

633
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:28,763
in case oId snoopy Cobb
might start Iooking around.

634
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,776
Good. Stay there.
Don't show your face down here.

635
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:35,405
l<i>'</i>ll say you're on vacation. No one will
know where the stories are coming from.

636
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:39,508
Stick close to him. You can get
an exclusive out of him every day.

637
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,610
We'll have the other papers crazy.

638
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:44,155
- Babe, l could kiss ya!
- Oh, no. No.

639
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:47,590
- Our deal was for a month's vacation.
- Sure.

640
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,390
- With pay.
- You'll get it, Babe.

641
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:54,492
Mr. Deeds, sir.

642
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,399
You really must get up.
lt's late.

643
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,960
- You're Walter, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,666
Just wanted to make sure.

645
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,837
lf you'Il permit me to say so, sir, you
were out on quite a bender last night.

646
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,847
Bender?
You're wrong, Walter.

647
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:13,908
We started out to a binge,
but we never got to it.

648
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:15,419
Yes, sir.

649
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:19,750
- What's that?
- A prairie oyster, sir.

650
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:21,417
Prairie oyster?

651
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:24,929
Yes, sir.
lt makes the head feel smaller.

652
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:35,706
Oh.

653
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:42,313
- Has Miss Dawson caIled yet?
- No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

654
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,383
She was the lady in distress.

655
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:48,215
She wouldn't let me help her.
Had a lot of pride. I like that.

656
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,551
Oh, l do too, sir.

657
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:54,854
l'd better call her up and apologize.
l don't remember taking her home.

658
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:58,886
l'd venture to say you don't remember
much of what happened last night, sir.

659
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:01,330
What do you mean?
l remember everything.

660
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,836
Hand me my pants. l wrote
her phone number on a piece of paper.

661
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:07,098
You have no pants, sir.

662
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:10,164
You came home last night
without them.

663
00:41:10,242 --> 00:41:13,643
- I did what?
- You came home without any clothes.

664
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,203
You were in your shorts.

665
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:17,714
Yes, sir.

666
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:25,017
l couldn't walk around on the streets
without any clothes. l'd be arrested.

667
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,354
That's what
the two poIicemen said, sir.

668
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:29,951
- What two policemen?
- The ones who brought you home, sir.

669
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,658
They said you and another gentleman kept
going up and down the street shouting...

670
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:38,328
""Back to nature! Clothes are a blight
on civilization! Back to nature!''

671
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:43,635
Listen, WaIter, if a man named Morrow
calls up, tell him l'm not in.

672
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,678
He may be a great author, but...

673
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:49,373
l think he's crazy, Walter.

674
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:52,015
Yes, sir.

675
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:56,220
Oh, by the way, did you--

676
00:41:57,623 --> 00:42:01,354
-The knee.
-But how will l put on the slipper, sir?

677
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:02,860
Yes, sir.

678
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,935
l beg pardon, sir, but did you ever
find what you were looking for, sir?

679
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:14,438
Looking for?

680
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:17,475
You kept searching me last night, sir,
going through all my pockets.

681
00:42:17,543 --> 00:42:20,478
You said you were looking
for a rhyme for ""Budington.''

682
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,406
- Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
- Very good, sir.

683
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:28,419
Oh, I beg pardon.
A telegram came for you, sir.

684
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:32,419
l'll get you some black coffee, sir.

685
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,092
Did you see aIl this stuff
in the paper?

686
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,571
- Arthur wants to quit.
- Arthur? Who's Arthur?

687
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,131
He's the shipping clerk
at the tailor works.

688
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,405
Wants a two-dolIar raise,
or he'lI quit.

689
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:56,414
What do I care about Arthur?
Did you see this stuff in the paper?

690
00:42:56,482 --> 00:43:00,043
How did it get in there? What did you
do last night? Who were you talking to?

691
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,053
And what did you do
to those bodyguards?

692
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,248
They quit this morning.
Said you Iocked them up.

693
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:06,257
They insisted on following me.

694
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:09,419
- What do you think bodyguards are for?
- What do they mean by this?

695
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:12,828
- ""Cinderella Man.''
- Are those stories true?

696
00:43:12,898 --> 00:43:14,661
""CinderelIa Man''?

697
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:19,102
They'd caIl you anything if you gave 'em
a chance. They got you down as a sap.

698
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:22,800
- l'll punch this editor in the nose.
- No, you don't! Get this clear.

699
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,140
Socking people in the nose
is no solution for anything.

700
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:30,079
- Sometimes it's the only solution.
- Not editors. Take my word for it.

701
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,346
- If they're gonna poke fun at me, l'm--
- Listen, Longfellow.

702
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:34,885
You got brains, kid.

703
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,945
You'll get along swell if you'll only
curb your homicidal instincts.

704
00:43:38,023 --> 00:43:42,153
And keep your trap shut.
These newshounds are gunning for you.

705
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:45,162
- What about this ""Cinderella Man''?
- I'll take care of that.

706
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,165
l'll keep that stuff out of the papers,
if you'll help me.

707
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:51,532
But l can't do anything
if you go around talking to people.

708
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:55,630
WiIl you promise me
to be careful from now on?

709
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:57,641
Yes, l guess l'll have to.

710
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,301
Thank you.

711
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:03,474
lf you feel the buiIding rock,
it'll be me, blasting into this editor.

712
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:12,756
Cobb's right.
l mustn't talk to anybody.

713
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,759
- Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
- Who? Miss Dawson?

714
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,761
- Yes, sir.
- Fine. I'll talk to her.

715
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,626
Give me the phone, quick.

716
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,132
She's the only one
l'm gonna taIk to.

717
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:36,177
- Awfully nice of you to show me around.
- l enjoy it.

718
00:44:36,248 --> 00:44:39,274
The aquarium was swell. lf l lived
in New York, l'd go every day.

719
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:40,943
l bet you do.

720
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,681
l'd Iike to,
but l have a job to think of.

721
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:46,855
You'd better
keep following that bus!

722
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,358
Keep your shirt on!

723
00:44:49,528 --> 00:44:53,259
- Looks like no pictures tonight.
- Maybe l oughta get him drunk again.

724
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:57,598
Got any news? l mean, has anything
exciting been happening Iately?

725
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:59,603
Sure. l met you.

726
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:03,671
What's happening about the opera?

727
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:07,576
Oh, that. We had another meeting.
l told 'em l'd go on being chairman if--

728
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:09,580
- l'm chairman, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

729
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:12,583
l told 'em l'd play along
if they lowered prices...

730
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:14,585
cut down expenses
and broadcast.

731
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:17,588
Oh. What'd they say?

732
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:19,590
Gee, you look pretty tonight.

733
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:21,888
- What'd they say?
- Huh? Oh.

734
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,124
They said l was crazy. They said
l wanted to run it like a grocery store.

735
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:28,132
What are they going to do?

736
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:31,464
Do you always wear your hair
like that?

737
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:34,767
Isn't it a scream?
""CindereIla Man.'' The dope.

738
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,831
Like to get my hooks
into that guy.

739
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,843
Don't worry. Someone's
probably taking him for plenty.

740
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,717
lf they were men
l'd knock their heads together.

741
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:50,652
- Have you seen the papers?
- Uh-huh.

742
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:54,089
That's what I like about you.
You think about a man's feelings.

743
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,721
l'd Iike to punch the fella in the nose
that's writing that stuff.

744
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:01,795
""Cinderella Man.''

745
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:04,802
Pretty soon everybody'lI
be calIing me CindereIla Man.

746
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:14,209
Would you like to walk the rest
of the way? lt's so nice out.

747
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:16,213
- Yes.
- Yeah, let's.

748
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:26,122
Hey, wise guys, he's getting off.

749
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:28,682
Come on, pull up to the curb!

750
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,396
Oh, come on.
Don't you want to see it?

751
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:38,634
Well, feast your eyes.
Grant's tomb.

752
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:42,863
ls that it?

753
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,409
Hey, beetle puss.

754
00:46:45,477 --> 00:46:46,705
The tomb.

755
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,717
WelI, there you are. Grant's tomb.
l hope you're not disappointed.

756
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:57,551
- lt's wonderful.
- To most people it's an awful letdown.

757
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:59,351
Huh?

758
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:02,359
I say, to most people it's a washout.

759
00:47:02,427 --> 00:47:04,987
That depends on what they see.

760
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:07,497
- And what do you see?
- Me?

761
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:12,436
Oh, l see a small Ohio farm boy...

762
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:14,802
becoming a great soldier.

763
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,807
I see thousands of marching men.

764
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:22,245
I see GeneraI Lee,
with a broken heart, surrendering.

765
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:26,045
I can see the beginning of a new nation,
Iike Abraham LincoIn said.

766
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:31,183
And l can see that Ohio boy
being inaugurated as president.

767
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:36,894
Things like that can only happen
in a country like America.

768
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,431
Excuse me.

769
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:47,538
Sorry, Mr. Hopper.
Mr. Cedar won't answer his phone.

770
00:47:47,606 --> 00:47:49,938
- What's going on in the boss's office?
- Search me.

771
00:47:50,008 --> 00:47:52,943
The three C's and little ""B''
have been in there over an hour.

772
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:54,945
l don't want to be critical, but--

773
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:57,948
Yes, l know. A week's gone by and
we haven't got power of attorney yet.

774
00:47:58,016 --> 00:48:00,484
- Yes, but you said--
- l can't strangle him, can I?

775
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:03,248
It's ridiculous for us
to have to worry about a boy like that.

776
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:05,551
Look at these articles.
""Cinderella Man.''

777
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:08,889
- He's carrying on like a idiot.
- Exactly what l was saying--

778
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,121
Who cares?

779
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:14,756
- Yeah?
- <i>Mr. and Mrs. S</i>e<i>mpl</i>e <i>ar</i>e <i>still waiting</i>.

780
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,095
Let 'em wait.

781
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,193
They've been in
every day this week.

782
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,204
- Who are they?
- ReIatives of oId man Semple.

783
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,730
They keep insisting
they should have some nuisance vaIue.

784
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,744
- Nuisance value?
- lf not for Deeds, they'd be rich.

785
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,944
Nuisance value.

786
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:31,448
Maybe they have.

787
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,754
Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please.

788
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:40,553
How do you do?
l'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

789
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:44,561
What was my secretary thinking,
keeping you waiting this long?

790
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:48,632
WilI you have a cigar,
Mr. Semple?

791
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,133
Thanks.

792
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:53,369
- There's Times Square.
- You can almost spit on it, can't you?

793
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:54,871
Why don't you try?

794
00:48:56,842 --> 00:48:58,776
lt's breezy up here.

795
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,383
You're worried about those articles
they're writing about you, aren't you?

796
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,385
Oh, l'm not worrying anymore.

797
00:49:08,453 --> 00:49:11,388
They'lI go on writing 'em
until they get tired.

798
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:13,890
You don<i>'</i>t believe aIl that stuff,
do you?

799
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:16,894
Oh, they just do it
to sell the newspapers, you know.

800
00:49:16,962 --> 00:49:18,395
Yeah, l guess so.

801
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,955
What puzzles me is why people
seem to get so much pIeasure...

802
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:24,365
out of hurting each other.

803
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:27,371
Why don't they try liking each other
once in a while?

804
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:33,235
ShalI we go?

805
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:39,143
Here's a nice place.

806
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:43,313
Yeah. Anyway,
there aren't any photographers around.

807
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:52,391
You said something to me when you first
met me l've thought about a great deal.

808
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:56,025
- What's that?
- You said l was a lady in distress.

809
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:57,534
Oh. That.

810
00:49:57,602 --> 00:50:00,400
- What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.

811
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,973
Have you got a--

812
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,045
Are you engaged or anything?

813
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:10,172
- No. Are you?
- No.

814
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:15,512
You don't go out
with girls very much, do you?

815
00:50:15,587 --> 00:50:17,418
- l haven't.
- Why not?

816
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,286
Oh, I don't know.

817
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:23,623
You must've met a lot of society girls.
Don<i>'</i>t you like them?

818
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:26,721
I haven't met anybody here
that l like particularly.

819
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:30,962
They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance.
Except you, of course.

820
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:32,765
People here are funny.

821
00:50:32,837 --> 00:50:36,432
They work so hard at living,
they forget how to live.

822
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:40,069
Last night, after I left you,
l was walking along...

823
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:42,306
and looking at the tall buiIdings...

824
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,577
and I got to thinkin<i>'</i>
about what Thoreau said--

825
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,084
""They created a lot
of grand palaces here...

826
00:50:48,153 --> 00:50:51,953
but they forgot to create
the noblemen to put in them.''

827
00:50:52,023 --> 00:50:54,617
l'd rather have Mandrake FaIls.

828
00:50:55,994 --> 00:50:59,327
- l'm from a small town too, you know.
- Really?

829
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:03,094
- Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
- What do you know about that!

830
00:51:03,168 --> 00:51:05,659
lt's a beautiful Iittle town too.

831
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:08,137
Grove poplar trees
right along main street.

832
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:11,141
Always smells
as if it just had a bath.

833
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:13,404
- l've often thought about going back.
- You have?

834
00:51:13,478 --> 00:51:15,105
Oh, yes.

835
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:20,982
I used to have a lot of fun there.
l loved going fishing with my father.

836
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:24,544
You know, that's funny.
He was a lot like you, my father was.

837
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,557
He talked like you too.

838
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:31,192
Sometimes he let me hold the line
while he smoked.

839
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,196
We'd just sit there for hours.

840
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:38,292
After a while, for no reason,
l'd go over, kiss him, sit in his lap.

841
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:42,636
He never said very much,
but once l remember him saying...

842
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:46,143
""No matter what happens, honey,
don't complain.''

843
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:49,271
He sounds Iike a person
welI worth knowing.

844
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:52,009
- He played in the town band too.
- He did?

845
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,017
- I play the tuba.
- Yeah, l know.

846
00:51:54,085 --> 00:51:57,020
- What did he play?
- Drums. He taught me to pIay some.

847
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:59,386
- He did?
- Mm-hmm. l can do ""Swanee River.''

848
00:51:59,457 --> 00:52:01,891
- Would you like to hear me?
- Sure.

849
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,563
Let's see, now.

850
00:52:11,436 --> 00:52:12,903
<i>Way down</i>

851
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:15,872

855
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:33,514
Oh, l suppose you could do better.

856
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:35,889
Sure.
l can sing ""Humoresque.''

857
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,360
l bet you don't even know
how it goes.

858
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,957
Sure. You sing it over again,
and l'lI do ""Humoresque'' with it.

859
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,125
You better be good.

860
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,261
l wonder if they want
to make it a quartet.

861
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:48,498
- Ready?
- Yeah.

862

869
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:21,062
Fire engine! l wanna see how they do it.
Wait for me, wilI you?

870
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:23,334
Looks like the evening's
not gonna be wasted.

871
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,003
Hello. What do you want?

872
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,105
Captain Deeds, fire volunteer,
Mandrake Falls.

873
00:53:31,182 --> 00:53:33,844
Hi, Cap.
Boys, meet the captain.

874
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:02,708
- What's the matter, hon?
- Nothing.

875
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,306
What's up, Babe?
Something's eatin' you.

876
00:54:05,383 --> 00:54:07,874
No, it's nothing.

877
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:10,921
My unfailing instinct tells me
something's gone wrong with the stew.

878
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:13,822
Don't be ridiculous.

879
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:17,953
You haven't gotten very far, have you?
That's where you were an hour ago.

880
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:20,589
Let's knock off and go down to Joe's.
The gang's waitin' for us.

881
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:23,930
I can't write it, Mabel.
l don't know what's the matter with me.

882
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:25,435
Uh-uh.

883
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:33,408
Yeah, she's here.
Who wants her?

884
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,877
Who?

885
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,642
Oh, yes.
Yes, just a moment.

886
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:42,208
lt's him. Whatchamacallit.
The Cinderella Man.

887
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:45,489
The Cinderella Man.

888
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,264
Couldn't sleep. Kind of wanted
to talk to you. Do you mind?

889
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,267
No, not at all.
I couldn't sleep either.

890
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:01,237
l wanted to thank you again
for going out with me.

891
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:03,001
Huh?

892
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:05,508
l don't know
what l'd do without you.

893
00:55:05,577 --> 00:55:07,511
You've made up
for all the fakes l've met.

894
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,619
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

895
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,679
You know what l've been doin'
since l got home?

896
00:55:18,756 --> 00:55:21,782
I've been workin' on a poem.

897
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,021
lt's about you.

898
00:55:24,095 --> 00:55:27,326
Sometimes it's kind of hard for me
to say things, so I write <i>'</i>em.

899
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,192
l'd like to read it sometime.

900
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,759
Maybe l'lI have it finished
next time I see you.

901
00:55:32,837 --> 00:55:35,067
WiIl I see you soon?

902
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:38,233
Gosh, that's swell, Mary.
Good night.

903
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:39,742
Good night.

904
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:49,485
MabeI, that guy's either the dumbest,
most imbecilic idiot in the world...

905
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,146
or the grandest thing alive.

906
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,747
- l can't make him out.
- Uh-huh.

907
00:55:53,825 --> 00:55:56,760
- l'm crucifying him.
- People have been crucified before.

908
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:58,762
Why do we have to do it?

909
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,764
You started out to be
a successful newspaperwoman.

910
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,699
- And then what?
- Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

911
00:56:03,768 --> 00:56:06,168
Here's a guy
that's wholesome and fresh.

912
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,172
To us he Iooks like a freak.

913
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,765
Do you know
what he told me tonight?

914
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:15,904
When he gets married he wants to
carry his bride over the threshoId.

915
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,346
The guy's balmy.

916
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,350
ls he?
Yeah, l thought so too.

917
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,353
I tried to laugh,
but it stuck in my throat.

918
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,857
Cut it out, will ya? You'lI get me
thinking about Charlie again.

919
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,987
He's got goodness, Mabel.

920
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:34,122
Do you know what that is?

921
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:38,396
Of course you don't. We've forgotten.
We're too busy being smart alecks.

922
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:41,063
Too busy in a crazy
competition for nothing.

923
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,504
l beg pardon, sir.

924
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:53,717
- Madame Pomponi is on the telephone.
- Who?

925
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,720
Madame Pomponi. She says that everything
is all set for the reception.

926
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,723
- Don't come in here when I'm playing.
- But she's on the telephone, sir.

927
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,316
Get out.
The evil finger's on you.

928
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:04,827
- The finger, sir?
- Get out!

929
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,069
Stop!

930
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:20,076
- Did you hear that?
- What, sir?

931
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:27,116
Why, that's an echo, sir.

932
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,619
- You try it.
- Me, sir?

933
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:33,451
Louder.

934
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,430
- You try it.
- Me, sir?

935
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,534
Louder.

936
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:49,498
You try it.

937
00:57:53,144 --> 00:57:54,338
All together.

938
00:57:57,982 --> 00:57:59,415
Again.

939
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,123
Let that be a lesson to you.

940
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:11,761
Go back to your rooms,
both of you.

941
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,901
Hello, darIing.

942
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,243
- So good of you to come.
- Oh, Madame Pomponi.

943
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:08,752
- I'm so happy to have you here.
- l'm dying to see the Cinderella Man.

944
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,449
-Shh. He may hear you.
-Even if he did, he wouldn't understand.

945
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:13,888
Bad as that, eh?

946
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,892
I hear he still believes
in Santa Claus.

947
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,360
Will he be Santa CIaus?
That's what l wonder.

948
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,363
Are your slippers ready
for the Cinderella Man?

949
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,899
- Think he'lI go for that?
- Don't be bashful.

950
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:25,731
With 20 million dollars,
he doesn't have to have looks.

951
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:29,603
He won't have it long with
that Pomponi woman hanging around him.

952
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:33,508
My dears, l hear that he can't think
unIess he plays his tuba.

953
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:35,307
You're a fool, Babe.

954
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:37,313
I just couldn't stand
seeing him again.

955
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:40,714
Running away is no solution.
What'll l tell him if he caIls up?

956
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,721
Tell him I had to leave suddenly.
Got a job in China, someplace.

957
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,849
- You're acting like a schoolgirl.
- What eIse can l do?

958
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:50,951
Keeping this up's no good.
He's bound to find out sometime.

959
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,394
At least I can save him that.

960
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:58,000
- Where is everybody?
- Come on, Babe. The artillery's ready.

961
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:00,367
It's those two sore spots again.

962
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:08,344
- Should've been down to the office.
- Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.

963
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:11,006
- Boy, was he burning.
- Just a minute. No, you don't.

964
01:00:11,082 --> 01:00:13,607
Just one little drink,
and then we're ready to shoo.

965
01:00:13,684 --> 01:00:16,346
- We're not going out tonight.
- l thought you had a date with him.

966
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,945
lt's off. He's having
a party at his house.

967
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:23,016
- Say, what's the matter with her now?
- You wouldn't know if l drew a diagram.

968
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:25,824
-Run along. Peddle your littIe tintypes.
-Say, what is this?

969
01:00:25,897 --> 01:00:28,923
Throwing us out of here
is getting to be a regular habit.

970
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,903
ls Mary Dawson here?
l'm LongfelIow Deeds.

971
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,999
Yes. Of course.
Longfellow Deeds.

972
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:44,038
Come in.
Step in, please.

973
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:48,346
You're Mabel, her sister,
aren't you?

974
01:00:48,419 --> 01:00:50,546
Yes. Yes. Of course.
Her sister.

975
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:53,317
Yes, l've been her sister
a long time.

976
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,985
- Is she home?
- Yeah. What?

977
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,554
- ls Mary home?
- Oh, Mary. Yes, of course.

978
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't know whether she's home or not.
l'll see. There she is.

979
01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:06,832
- Hello.
- Hello, Mary.

980
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:14,401
I waited in the park over an hour.
l thought maybe you'd forgotten.

981
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:17,072
l didn't think you could come,
with the party and everything.

982
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:20,242
I wouldn't let them stop me
from seeing you, so l threw them out.

983
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:23,713
- You threw them out?
- You mean, by the neck or something?

984
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:26,882
Sure. They got on my nerves,
so l threw them out.

985
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:31,827
That'Il be in the papers tomorrow,
give them something eIse to laugh at.

986
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,660
l don<i>'</i>t mind, though.
l had a lot of fun doing it.

987
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:38,190
- Would you Iike to go for a walk?
- Yeah, if it isn't too late.

988
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:40,203
l'lI get my hat.

989
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:49,309
Nice day out--
Nice night, wasn't it-- isn't it?

990
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,544
Yes. Lovely.
Had a lot of nice weather lateIy.

991
01:01:53,618 --> 01:01:57,281
Yeah. lt'd be a nice night
to go for a walk, don't you think?

992
01:01:57,355 --> 01:02:02,019
Yeah, l think it'd be a swell night
to go for a walk. A nice long one.

993
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,461
- Ready?
- Gosh.

994
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:12,032
- She looks better every time I see her.
- Thank you.

995
01:02:13,638 --> 01:02:16,163
Good night. Don't worry.
l won't keep her out late.

996
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,868
Thank you so much.
Good night.

997
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:24,672
- My foot's asIeep.
- No, you don't.

998
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,115
- Listen, she told us--
- No more photographs.

999
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:38,352
Glad you wanted to take a walk, Mary,
'cause l wanted to taIk to you.

1000
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:40,590
Let's just walk, hmm?

1001
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,894
AIl right.

1002
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:52,375
Mary, l'm going home.

1003
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:53,910
Are you? When?

1004
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,344
A day or so, l think.

1005
01:02:57,415 --> 01:03:00,179
- l don't bIame you.
- A man ought to know where he fits in.

1006
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:02,185
l just don't fit in around here.

1007
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:05,188
l once had an idea
l couId do something with the money...

1008
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,521
but they kept me so busy
I haven't had time to figure it out.

1009
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:11,288
l guess I'll wait
tiIl I get back home.

1010
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,139
Do you mind if I taIk to you, Mary?
You don't have to pay any attention.

1011
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,508
No, l don't mind.

1012
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:31,548
AlI my life
l've wanted somebody to talk to.

1013
01:03:31,615 --> 01:03:36,109
Back in Mandrake Falls,
l used to always talk to a girl.

1014
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,917
- A girI?
- OnIy an imaginary one.

1015
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:42,481
l used to hike a lot through the woods,
and l'd always take this girl with me...

1016
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,494
so l could talk to her.

1017
01:03:44,562 --> 01:03:47,622
l'd show her my pet trees and things.

1018
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:51,134
It sounds kind of silly,
but we had a lot of fun doing it.

1019
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,762
She was beautiful.

1020
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,569
l haven't married,
'cause l've been kind of waiting.

1021
01:03:57,641 --> 01:04:01,236
You know, my mother and father
were a great couple.

1022
01:04:01,312 --> 01:04:04,304
I thought I might have
the same kind of luck.

1023
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:08,785
I've always hoped that someday
that imaginary girl...

1024
01:04:08,853 --> 01:04:11,583
would turn out to be reaI.

1025
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,695
Well, here we are again.

1026
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:22,255
Yes, here we are again.
Good night.

1027
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,391
Good night.

1028
01:04:33,477 --> 01:04:34,967
Excuse me.

1029
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:36,672
Good-bye, darling.

1030
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:41,582
Don't Iet anybody hurt you again, ever.
They can't anyway. You're much too real.

1031
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:45,088
You go back to Mandrake Falls.
It's where you beIong.

1032
01:04:45,156 --> 01:04:46,851
Good-bye.

1033
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:56,062
You know the poem l told you about?
lt's finished.

1034
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,601
Would you like to read it?
It's to you.

1035
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:00,296
Yes. Of course.

1036
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:15,611
You don't have to say anything, Mary.
You can tell me tomorrow what you think.

1037
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:23,187
""l tramped the Earth
with hopeless feet...

1038
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,821
searching in vain
for a glimpse of you.

1039
01:05:26,897 --> 01:05:30,526
Then heaven thrust you
at my very feet...

1040
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:34,594
a Iovely angel,
too lovely to woo.

1041
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:43,469
My dream has been answered,
but my life's just as bleak.

1042
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:47,347
l'm handcuffed and speechless
in your presence divine.

1043
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:54,889
For my heart longs to cry out.
lf it only could speak.

1044
01:05:54,959 --> 01:05:59,157
I Iove you, my angeI.
Be mine. Be mine.''

1045
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,960
Oh, darling.

1046
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:12,573
You don't have to say anything now. l'll
wait till tomorrow to hear from you.

1047
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,656
What's the big idea?

1048
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,661
Stop it, Babe. Stop it.

1049
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:39,191
What do you mean, you're quitting?
You might as welI teIl me l'm quitting.

1050
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,103
What's bothering you?

1051
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:44,538
Last night
he proposed to me.

1052
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:47,543
Proposed to you?
You mean, he asked you to marry him?

1053
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:50,478
- Yes.
- Why, Babe! That's terrific!

1054
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,982
""Cinderella Man woos mystery girI.
Who is the myster--''

1055
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,280
Print one line of that
and l'll blow your pIace up.

1056
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:58,515
Sorry, Babe. Sorry.
l just got carried away.

1057
01:06:58,589 --> 01:07:02,150
That's too bad.
That would've made a sweIl story.

1058
01:07:03,327 --> 01:07:05,818
So, he proposed to you?

1059
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,456
What a twist.
You set out to nail him, and he--

1060
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:11,092
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?

1061
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:18,802
You haven't gone
and faIlen for that mug, have you?

1062
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:25,214
WeIl, l'll be.
That's tough.

1063
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,311
- What are you going to do?
- l'm going to tell him the truth.

1064
01:07:30,387 --> 01:07:33,914
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him
you've been making a stooge out of him?

1065
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:38,455
l'm having lunch with him today.
He expects an answer.

1066
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,489
- lt's going to be pretty.
- You're crazy. You can't do that.

1067
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:48,163
He'll probably kick me
right down the stairs. l hope he does.

1068
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:51,469
I'll put you on another job.
You need never see him again.

1069
01:07:54,044 --> 01:07:55,978
That's the rub.

1070
01:07:57,381 --> 01:07:59,440
lt's as bad as that?

1071
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:03,486
TelIing him's the Iong shot.
l'm going to take it.

1072
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:12,387
Well, it was fun
whiIe it lasted, Mac.

1073
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:15,723
I'Il cIean out my desk.

1074
01:08:26,276 --> 01:08:28,471
- How's it going?
- Yes. Quite aIl right. Thank you, sir.

1075
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:30,604
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,384
- Fourteen karat.
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:08:35,452 --> 01:08:37,920
- Is that the best you got?
- Yes, sir.

1078
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,088
Those flowers are too high.
l won't be able to see her.

1079
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,287
- Get a smaller bowl, will you?
- A smaller bowl of fIowers, yes.

1080
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:48,195
- Yes, sir. A smaller bowl of flowers.
- Did you get that stuff?

1081
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:51,029
- Stuff, sir?
- Yeah, that goo that tastes like soap.

1082
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:56,038
Yes, sir. Here it is.
The pate de foie gras, sir.

1083
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:57,573
That's fine.
Have a lot of it, 'cause she likes it.

1084
01:08:57,641 --> 01:09:00,132
- Yes.
- Now you got the idea.

1085
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,974
That's fine.
Sit over there, wilI you?

1086
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:04,708
- Me, sir?
- Yeah.

1087
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:13,056
You're too tall.
Slink lower, wilI you?

1088
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:15,057
Yes.

1089
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,116
More.

1090
01:09:19,063 --> 01:09:20,997
Now forward.

1091
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,461
How is this, sir?

1092
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:27,262
Perfect.

1093
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:29,066
l wish you Iuck, sir.

1094
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:34,775
Thank you. Now, don't touch a thing.
Leave everything as it is.

1095
01:09:36,246 --> 01:09:37,838
Yes.

1096
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:53,427
- Where are you?
- What is it, sir? Anything happened?

1097
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:55,761
""Anything happened?'' l got to get
dressed. l can't meet her like this.

1098
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:59,360
- But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
- What's an hour? Time flies.

1099
01:09:59,436 --> 01:10:01,700
- My tie?
- Yes, very good, sir.

1100
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,106
Yes, sir.

1101
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:08,804
<i>Way down upon</i> f<i>h</i>e <i>S</i>w<i>an</i>ee <i>Riv</i>e<i>r</i>

1102
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:11,177
Just as I suspected,
wise guy.

1103
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:14,809
l don't mind you making a sap out of
yourself, but you made one of me too.

1104
01:10:14,885 --> 01:10:17,251
WiIl you telI the gentleman
l'm not in?

1105
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:20,779
Mary Dawson, hmm?
Mary Dawson, my eye.

1106
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:24,316
That dame took you for a sleigh ride
New York wilI laugh about for years.

1107
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:27,693
She's the slickest two-timing,
doubIe-crossing--

1108
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,256
- What are you talking about?
- Go ahead. Sock away.

1109
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:32,825
And then try
to laugh this off.

1110
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:42,241
She's the star reporter
on the <i>Mail</i>.

1111
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:45,645
Every time you opened your kisser,
you gave her another story.

1112
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:48,344
She's the dame who slapped that moniker
on you : Cinderella Man.

1113
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:50,511
You've been making love
to a double dose of cyanide.

1114
01:10:50,587 --> 01:10:52,179
Shut up!

1115
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:09,269
Listen, Babe. l can't let you quit now.
Are you going through with this?

1116
01:11:09,339 --> 01:11:11,933
This is for you, Mac.
Names of all the head waiters in town.

1117
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:15,501
You can always buy a better choice of
scandaI from them at reasonable prices.

1118
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:18,878
l've seen them get in a rut like you
before, but they aIways come back.

1119
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:23,477
HeIlo? Yes?
Just a minute. lt's for you.

1120
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:25,988
A couple of weeks, you'll get the itch
so bad you'll be working for nothing.

1121
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:30,220
- Hello?
- Babe Bennett? Just a minute.

1122
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:37,227
- Hello, Mary?
- Hello, darling.

1123
01:11:37,301 --> 01:11:39,895
Is it you who's been
writing those articles about me?

1124
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:44,634
Why, l was just leaving.
I'll be up there in a minute.

1125
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:52,615
Look-- Yes, I did,
but l was just coming up to expIain.

1126
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,481
<i>Lis</i>fe<i>n, darling</i>.
<i>Wait a minu</i>fe. <i>Pl</i>e<i>as</i>e.

1127
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:00,352
Listen.

1128
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:28,875
I beg pardon, sir. Should
l serve the wine with the squab, sir?

1129
01:12:28,952 --> 01:12:31,216
I beg pardon, sir?

1130
01:12:41,298 --> 01:12:45,928
lf l knew you were going to take it
so hard, I would've kept my mouth shut.

1131
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:47,595
Sorry.

1132
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:54,341
Pack my things, Walter.
I'm going home.

1133
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,141
Yes, sir.

1134
01:12:58,782 --> 01:13:02,047
You shouIdn't be running away like this.
What<i>'</i>s going to happen to the estate?

1135
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:04,053
They can have the estate.

1136
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,654
Nobody's going to kick me out.
Let me go!

1137
01:13:09,726 --> 01:13:12,820
l want to see that guy!
Let me go!

1138
01:13:14,865 --> 01:13:16,890
I want to see him!
There he is.

1139
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:19,765
l just want to get a look at him.
There you are.

1140
01:13:19,836 --> 01:13:21,895
l just wanted to see
what kind of a man you were.

1141
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:24,770
l wanted to see what a man looked like
that could spend thousands on a party...

1142
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:26,775
while people around him were hungry.

1143
01:13:26,843 --> 01:13:30,711
The Cinderella Man? Did you think
how many families could have been fed...

1144
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,715
on the money you pay out
to get on the front pages?

1145
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,842
- Let me aIone!
- Let him alone.

1146
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:38,376
lf you know what's good for you,
you'll let me get this off my chest.

1147
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:41,288
How did you feel
feeding donuts to a horse?

1148
01:13:41,358 --> 01:13:43,952
Got a kick out of it?
Got a big laugh?

1149
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:47,224
Did you ever think of feeding donuts
to human beings? No!

1150
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,390
- ShaIl I call the police, sir?
- No!

1151
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,899
What do you want?

1152
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,562
Yeah, that's aIl that's worrying you:
What do l want?

1153
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:57,266
A chance to feed a wife and kids.
l'm a farmer. A job.

1154
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:00,606
- That's what l want.
- A farmer? You're a moocher.

1155
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:03,544
l wouldn't believe you or anybody else
on a stack of Bibles.

1156
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:06,605
You<i>'</i>re a moocher Iike all the rest
of them around here, so get out.

1157
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:08,617
Sure, everybody's a moocher to you.

1158
01:14:08,685 --> 01:14:12,416
A mongrel dog eating out of
a garbage pail is a moocher to you.

1159
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,322
- This won't do you any good.
- Stay where you are! Get over there!

1160
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:19,191
You're about to get
some more publicity, Mr. Deeds.

1161
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:21,890
You're about
to get on the front page again.

1162
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:24,559
See how you're going
to like it this time.

1163
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:28,570
What good's your money when you're six
feet under? You never thought of that.

1164
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:32,301
All you ever thought of was pinching
pennies, you money-grabbing hick.

1165
01:14:32,376 --> 01:14:36,472
You never gave a thought to all of those
starving people in the bread lines...

1166
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:38,639
not knowing where
their next meal was coming from...

1167
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:41,013
not abIe
to feed their wife and kids.

1168
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:43,018
Not able to--

1169
01:14:52,295 --> 01:14:57,358
I'm gIad l didn't hurt nobody.
Excuse me.

1170
01:14:57,434 --> 01:14:59,595
Crazy.

1171
01:14:59,669 --> 01:15:02,866
You get all kinds
of crazy ideas.

1172
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,369
Sorry.

1173
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:10,038
l didn't know
what I was doing.

1174
01:15:10,113 --> 01:15:13,549
Losing your farm
after 20 years' work.

1175
01:15:13,617 --> 01:15:16,381
Seeing your kids go hungry.

1176
01:15:16,453 --> 01:15:21,390
Game little wife saying
everything's going to be aIl right.

1177
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:24,921
Standing there in the bread lines.

1178
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:27,691
It killed me
to take a handout. l--

1179
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:29,698
l ain't used to it.

1180
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:35,301
Go ahead and do
what you want with me, mister.

1181
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:39,866
l guess l'm
at the end of my rope.

1182
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:19,412
Could l take some of this
home with me?

1183
01:17:57,314 --> 01:17:59,043
- Are you married?
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:17:59,115 --> 01:18:01,208
- Any children?
- No chiIdren.

1185
01:18:01,284 --> 01:18:03,912
All right, Mr. Dodsworth.
l think you'll quaIify.

1186
01:18:03,987 --> 01:18:06,182
Take this to that desk over there
for further instructions.

1187
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:08,747
- Thank you very much.
- Next, please.

1188
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:15,525
- How many does that make?
- You've okayed 819.

1189
01:18:15,599 --> 01:18:17,294
- ls that all? It's going awfully slow.
- That's all.

1190
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:19,494
We need 1,100 more.

1191
01:18:20,837 --> 01:18:23,465
Hello? Yes. Yeah.

1192
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:27,340
The water development seems okay.
l don't Iike the road layout.

1193
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:32,006
Come up tonight about 10:00
and bring the maps. Right.

1194
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,347
Here's the order for the pIows.
We got a good price on them.

1195
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:37,682
That<i>'</i>s fine. Thanks.
l'll Iook them over Iater.

1196
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:43,420
Mr. Deeds, my wife wanted me to teIl you
she prays for you every night.

1197
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:46,587
l-- WelI, thanks.

1198
01:18:47,497 --> 01:18:50,432
- How do you do? What is your name?
- George Rankin, sir.

1199
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,833
No, no, we're not buying any bulls.
What's that?

1200
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:57,703
Listen, fellow. Bull's
what I've been selling all my life.

1201
01:18:58,408 --> 01:19:01,502
We've little time. He's ordered me to
turn everything over to him immediately.

1202
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:03,705
We have to work fast,
before he disposes of every penny.

1203
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,147
See, I told you something could be done.
l knew it all the time. Sign it, dear.

1204
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:10,085
- We may get into trouble.
- Don't be so squeamish.

1205
01:19:10,153 --> 01:19:12,280
There's millions involved.
After all, you have your legaI rights.

1206
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:14,915
- You're his onIy living relative.
- What's it say?

1207
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:17,221
That<i>'</i>s your agreement with Mr. Cedar
in case we win.

1208
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:21,196
My end is going to be rather expensive.
l have important people to take care of.

1209
01:19:21,264 --> 01:19:24,859
l have the Iegal machinery ready to go.
l've been working on nothing eIse.

1210
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:27,732
You say the word, and we'll
stop this yokeI dead in his tracks.

1211
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:30,364
- Sign it!
- AIl right.

1212
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,908
- CharIie, we're off. Papers aIl set?
- <i>All s</i>ef.

1213
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,637
- Go to it. Charlie?
- <i>Y</i>e<i>ah?</i>

1214
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:38,010
Find out who wrote those articles
and subpoena him right away.

1215
01:19:38,081 --> 01:19:41,539
- So what is your name?
- Christian Swenson.

1216
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,349
- Farmer?
- Yes, ma'am.

1217
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:48,983
- Where is your farm?
- South Dakota, north.

1218
01:19:49,059 --> 01:19:53,120
- South Dakota North?
- South Dakota, but on the top.

1219
01:19:55,098 --> 01:19:57,794
- What about knocking off for lunch?
- Not hungry.

1220
01:19:57,867 --> 01:20:00,392
l want to get through this work
in a hurry, and then l want to go home.

1221
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,836
Come on. What are you
trying to do, keel over?

1222
01:20:02,906 --> 01:20:06,239
You haven't been out of this house
in two weeks.

1223
01:20:06,309 --> 01:20:09,176
Maybe I'll have a sandwich.
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?

1224
01:20:09,245 --> 01:20:13,272
Sure. lf you like
to have a sandwich...

1225
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,581
l can give you one, please.

1226
01:20:17,554 --> 01:20:19,545
Thanks. Thank you.

1227
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:22,147
Never mind, Cobb.

1228
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,456
Good.

1229
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:47,908
- Get lunches for the rest of them.
- What?

1230
01:20:47,984 --> 01:20:50,885
There must be 2,000 of them
out there.

1231
01:20:50,954 --> 01:20:55,914
- That doesn't make them Iess hungry.
- Okay, Santa Claus. 2,000 lunches.

1232
01:21:06,603 --> 01:21:08,730
Say something.

1233
01:21:08,805 --> 01:21:10,670
Go ahead. Tell him.

1234
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:15,302
Mr. Deeds, the boys here
wanted me to say a little something.

1235
01:21:15,378 --> 01:21:17,471
They just wanted me to say that--

1236
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:21,642
They wanted me to say
that we think you're swell.

1237
01:21:21,718 --> 01:21:23,845
And that's no baloney.

1238
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,684
- Say something more.
- Give me a chance, felIows.

1239
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:31,090
We're all down and out. A fellow
like you comes along, it gives us hope.

1240
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:34,619
- Break it up. Get back.
- They just wanted me to say that I've--

1241
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:39,393
That's him.

1242
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:41,528
- Are you LongfeIlow Deeds?
- Yes.

1243
01:21:41,604 --> 01:21:45,005
Sheriff's office. We got a warrant
to take you into custody.

1244
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:47,736
- A what?
- A warrant for your arrest.

1245
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:50,041
- What's up? What do you wonks want?
- l don't know nothing.

1246
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:52,673
All l know is the sheriff
gives me an insanity warrant to execute.

1247
01:21:52,749 --> 01:21:55,013
Insanity?
Who says he's insane?

1248
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:57,484
The complainant is a reIative
of the late Martin Semple.

1249
01:21:57,554 --> 01:22:01,854
The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane
and incapabIe of handIing the estate.

1250
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:05,884
Somebody got panic-stricken? Where
do you think you're going to take him?

1251
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:08,055
- County HospitaI.
- Of course, that's only temporary.

1252
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,429
The hearing
wilI foIlow immediateIy.

1253
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,094
That's fine.

1254
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:15,364
Just because I want to give this money
to peopIe who need it...

1255
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:17,906
they think l'm crazy.

1256
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,908
That's marvelous.

1257
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:23,673
- Let's get it going.
- Wait. We're going to get a lawyer.

1258
01:22:23,746 --> 01:22:25,304
- l'lI calI Cedar.
- Don't bother.

1259
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:28,782
I'm from Mr. Cedar's office.
He represents the compIainant.

1260
01:22:30,186 --> 01:22:32,711
- Let's go. We're wasting time.
- All right. l'll go.

1261
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:35,223
But get your hands off me.

1262
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:49,037
Come on. Get back.

1263
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,374
Step back.

1264
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:57,012
Come on. Get back.

1265
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:05,244
Boss, everybody in town
has been here to see him.

1266
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:09,985
Yes, sir. l will. Good-bye.
Sorry, lady. It's you again.

1267
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:11,822
- Please. l've got to see him.
- Listen, sister.

1268
01:23:11,895 --> 01:23:14,193
For the 14th and last time,
he don't want to see nobody.

1269
01:23:14,264 --> 01:23:16,494
- Will you just give him my name?
- Listen, toots.

1270
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:18,693
Just between us, there isn't a thing
in the world the matter with that guy...

1271
01:23:18,768 --> 01:23:20,929
till l mention your name;
then he goes haywire.

1272
01:23:25,608 --> 01:23:30,045
What are you going to do?
Sit back and Iet them railroad you?

1273
01:23:30,113 --> 01:23:34,573
It's as pretty a frame-up
as ever hit this rotten town.

1274
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:37,142
lf you'd just
let me get you a lawyer.

1275
01:23:45,028 --> 01:23:48,828
You can't walk into that courtroom
without being ready to protect yourself.

1276
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:54,803
Cedar's too smart. With the talent he's
got lined up against you, you'll cook.

1277
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:56,930
Listen, pal.
l know just how you feeI.

1278
01:23:57,006 --> 01:23:59,839
A blonde in Syracuse
put me through the same paces.

1279
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:02,844
l came out with a sour puss,
but fuIl of fight.

1280
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:05,779
Come on.
You don't want to lay down now.

1281
01:24:14,457 --> 01:24:18,894
They're trying to prove you're nuts.
They'll shove you in the bug house.

1282
01:24:18,962 --> 01:24:21,453
The moment they accused you of it,
they had you haIf Iicked.

1283
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:23,465
You've got to fight.

1284
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:37,803
Go on.
Sit down, won't you? Yes.

1285
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:42,808
So long, Mr. Cobb.

1286
01:24:42,885 --> 01:24:45,979
Corny, listen, l've got to see him.
I've got to talk to him.

1287
01:24:46,055 --> 01:24:48,717
Haven't you done
enough damage already?

1288
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,783
Somebody's got to help him.
He hasn't a chance against Cedar.

1289
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:56,025
l've been talking to everybody. l've got
Mac lined up and the paper's behind him.

1290
01:24:56,099 --> 01:24:59,557
l can get Livingston too. With a lawyer
like Livingston, he's got a chance.

1291
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:02,469
You're wasting your time.
He doesn't want any lawyers.

1292
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:06,235
He's so low, he doesn't want anybody's
help. You can take a bow for that.

1293
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:11,076
As swell a guy as ever hit this town and
you crucified him for some headlines.

1294
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:14,446
You've done your bit.
Now stay out of his way.

1295
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:06,958
There he is now.

1296
01:26:10,907 --> 01:26:12,875
Here he is.

1297
01:26:32,328 --> 01:26:34,762
Cedar just sent for me.
He wants to make a settlement.

1298
01:26:34,831 --> 01:26:38,562
Here's your chance to get out
of the whole mess. What do you say?

1299
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:45,166
Rise, please.

1300
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,867
Supreme Court, State of New York,
County of New York now in session...

1301
01:26:48,945 --> 01:26:50,674
the Honorable Judge May presiding.

1302
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:52,681
Be seated.

1303
01:26:57,053 --> 01:27:01,387
The court wishes to warn those present
it will tolerate no disturbances.

1304
01:27:02,892 --> 01:27:06,020
Regarding the sanity hearing
of Longfellow Deeds...

1305
01:27:07,296 --> 01:27:09,696
You represented by counsel,
Mr. Deeds?

1306
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:21,810
l understand
you have no counsel.

1307
01:27:22,545 --> 01:27:25,912
ln fact, that you have no intention
of defending any of these charges.

1308
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:29,816
Now, if you wish to change your mind,
the hearing can be postponed.

1309
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:37,818
Crazy.

1310
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:50,870
Proceed.

1311
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:54,034
ln the interest of my client,
the onIy other living reIative...

1312
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,577
of the late Martin W. SempIe...

1313
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,876
we cannot permit a fortune so huge
to be dissipated by a person...

1314
01:27:58,948 --> 01:28:02,611
whose incompetency and abnormality we
shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt.

1315
01:28:02,685 --> 01:28:06,143
I have before me a series of articles
written by a newspaperwoman...

1316
01:28:06,222 --> 01:28:09,214
who was an eyewitness to this conduct
ever since he came to New York.

1317
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:11,726
She tells how in the midst
of a normal conversation...

1318
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,092
he wouId suddenly
begin playing his tuba.

1319
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,597
She tells of his attack upon severaI
of our eminent writers for no reason.

1320
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:22,764
l, myself, unable to keep pace with his
mental quirks and fearful of assault...

1321
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,467
turned down an opportunity
to represent him as his attorney.

1322
01:28:26,642 --> 01:28:29,805
This newspaperwoman,
whom we have subpoenaed to testify...

1323
01:28:29,879 --> 01:28:34,475
tells how he heId up traffic for an hour
feeding donuts to a poor horse.

1324
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,144
We have photographs
to substantiate this little episode.

1325
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,246
Another photograph showing Mr. Deeds
jumping about a fire engine.

1326
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:42,587
This scarcely sounds
like the action of a man...

1327
01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:46,025
in whom the disposition of $20 million
may safely be entrusted.

1328
01:28:46,095 --> 01:28:48,529
The writer of these articIes,
a woman...

1329
01:28:48,598 --> 01:28:51,999
whose inteIligence and integrity in
the newspaper world is unquestioned...

1330
01:28:52,068 --> 01:28:56,937
held him in such contempt that she quite
aptly named him the CindereIla Man.

1331
01:29:02,411 --> 01:29:04,504
We have witnesses here
from Mandrake Falls...

1332
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:08,107
his own hometown, who will tell of
his conduct throughout his Iifetime...

1333
01:29:08,184 --> 01:29:12,143
proving that his derangement is
neither a recent nor a temporary one.

1334
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:15,657
We have others who will tell
of his unusual behavior...

1335
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:18,922
when he invited the great leaders
of the musical world to his home...

1336
01:29:18,995 --> 01:29:21,828
and then proceeded
to forcibly eject them.

1337
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:24,025
- l hope he can explain that.
- Yes.

1338
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,797
Only recently, when he was in
the County Hospital for observation...

1339
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:31,966
he not only refused to be examined by
these gentlemen-- state psychiatrists--

1340
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:34,737
but he actually made
a vioIent attack upon them.

1341
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:40,314
ln these times, with the country
incapacitated by economic ailments...

1342
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:42,977
and in danger with an undercurrent
of social unrest...

1343
01:29:43,052 --> 01:29:47,819
the promulgation of such a weird,
fantastic and impractical plan--

1344
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:51,849
as contempIated by the defendant--
is capable of fomenting a disturbance...

1345
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,896
from which the country
may not soon recover.

1346
01:29:53,963 --> 01:29:57,023
lt is our duty to stop it.

1347
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,136
Our government
is fuIly aware of its difficulties.

1348
01:30:03,205 --> 01:30:05,230
It can pull itseIf out
of its economic rut...

1349
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:08,471
without the assistance of Mr. Deeds
or any other crackpot.

1350
01:30:08,544 --> 01:30:11,138
His attempted action
must therefore be attributed...

1351
01:30:11,213 --> 01:30:15,047
to a diseased mind, afflicted
with hallucinations of grandeur...

1352
01:30:15,117 --> 01:30:18,678
and obsessed with an insane desire
to become a public benefactor.

1353
01:30:22,558 --> 01:30:26,426
Your Honor, we would like to call our
first witness, Louise ""Babe'' Bennett.

1354
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:28,993
Miss Bennett, pIease.

1355
01:30:43,879 --> 01:30:45,676
Raise your right hand, please.

1356
01:30:45,748 --> 01:30:49,377
Do you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth, so heIp you God?

1357
01:30:49,452 --> 01:30:50,851
- l do.
- State your right name.

1358
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,252
- Louise Bennett.
- Take the stand.

1359
01:30:55,524 --> 01:30:59,016
Miss Bennett,
are you employed by the <i>Morning Mail?</i>

1360
01:30:59,095 --> 01:31:02,929
- l ask you direct your attention to me.
- Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

1361
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:05,524
- Please answer the question.
- The whoIe hearing's ridiculous.

1362
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:08,434
- That man<i>'</i>s no more insane than you.
- Outrageous!

1363
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:12,235
lt's obviously a frame-up. They're
trying to railroad this man for money.

1364
01:31:12,308 --> 01:31:16,074
Young lady, another outburst Iike that,
and I shall hold you in contempt.

1365
01:31:16,145 --> 01:31:19,876
We are not interested in your opinion of
this case. You are to here to testify.

1366
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:22,076
Sit down and answer questions.
Proceed.

1367
01:31:22,151 --> 01:31:24,745
Thank you, Your Honor.
Are you employed by the <i>Morning Mail?</i>

1368
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:29,281
You're under oath, Miss Bennett. Again,
are you employed by the <i>Morning Mail?</i>

1369
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,087
l resigned last week.

1370
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,186
Prior to that time,
were you employed by the <i>Morning Mail?</i>

1371
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:35,753
- Yes.
- Were you given an assignment...

1372
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:37,628
to foIlow the activities
of Longfellow Deeds?

1373
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,191
- Yes.
- Did you subsequentIy write about him?

1374
01:31:40,269 --> 01:31:42,533
- Yes.
- Are these the articles?

1375
01:31:42,605 --> 01:31:44,630
- Yes.
- Were you present?

1376
01:31:44,707 --> 01:31:47,005
- Yes.
- Are they true? They did take place?

1377
01:31:47,076 --> 01:31:49,340
-They're colored to make him look silly.
-You saw them happen?

1378
01:31:49,412 --> 01:31:50,504
- Yes, but--
- That's all.

1379
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:52,513
lt isn't all.
I'd like to explain.

1380
01:31:52,581 --> 01:31:56,950
- I submit these articles as evidence.
- Let go! What kind of hearing is this?

1381
01:31:57,019 --> 01:31:59,146
What are you trying to do?
Persecute the man?

1382
01:31:59,221 --> 01:32:01,451
He's not defending himself.
Somebody's got to do it.

1383
01:32:01,524 --> 01:32:03,583
- Please.
- l've got a right to be heard.

1384
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:07,857
l've attended dozens of cases like this.
They're conducted without any formality.

1385
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:11,730
Anybody can be heard. My opinion's
as good as these quack psychiatrists'.

1386
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:14,167
I know him better than they do.

1387
01:32:14,236 --> 01:32:16,704
lf you have quite finished,
l should Iike to inform you...

1388
01:32:16,772 --> 01:32:19,605
that one more utterance from you,
and l shall place you under arrest.

1389
01:32:20,843 --> 01:32:22,777
I'm wiIling to hear
anything anyone has to say...

1390
01:32:22,845 --> 01:32:25,075
but I insist on it being done
in an orderly fashion.

1391
01:32:25,147 --> 01:32:27,775
When you have learned to show some
respect for this court, you may return.

1392
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,944
UntiI then, you'd better
go back to your seat and calm down.

1393
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,954
This way, miss.

1394
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:53,040
Order in the court.

1395
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:57,512
Mr. Deeds, have you anything to say
in defense of these articles?

1396
01:33:09,425 --> 01:33:11,359
Mark these Exhibit ""A''
for the plaintiff.

1397
01:33:11,427 --> 01:33:13,361
Yes, Your Honor.

1398
01:33:15,898 --> 01:33:17,365
Proceed.

1399
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,031
They're rather timid, Your Honor,
and wish to be together.

1400
01:33:21,103 --> 01:33:23,503
If the court pleases,
I'll onIy have one testify.

1401
01:33:23,572 --> 01:33:26,666
- Yes. Get on with it.
- What is your name, please?

1402
01:33:26,742 --> 01:33:30,769
- Jane Faulkner. This is my sister Amy.
- Yes. Amy.

1403
01:33:30,846 --> 01:33:33,246
l'll direct my questions
to you, Miss Jane.

1404
01:33:33,315 --> 01:33:37,615
You may answer for both.
Do you know the defendant?

1405
01:33:42,324 --> 01:33:44,451
Yes. Of course we know him.

1406
01:33:44,527 --> 01:33:46,961
How long have you known him?

1407
01:33:53,102 --> 01:33:56,902
- Since he was born.
- Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.

1408
01:33:56,972 --> 01:34:00,601
- He was a seven-months baby.
- Thank you. That's fine.

1409
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:03,042
Do you see him very often?

1410
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,743
- Most every day.
- Sometimes twice.

1411
01:34:09,818 --> 01:34:13,549
- Must we have the echo?
- Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane.

1412
01:34:13,622 --> 01:34:16,750
WiIl you telI the court what everybody
at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?

1413
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:28,496
- They think he's pixiIated.
- Yes. PixiIated.

1414
01:34:29,772 --> 01:34:32,707
- He's what?
- What was that you said he was?

1415
01:34:32,775 --> 01:34:36,802
- Pixilated.
- That's rather a strange word to us.

1416
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:40,337
- Can you tell the court what it means?
- Perhaps l can explain, Your Honor.

1417
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,680
The word ""pixilated''
is an early-American expression...

1418
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:45,242
derived from the word ""pixies,''
meaning ""elves.''

1419
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:50,258
They'd say, ""The pixies had got him,''
as we'd nowadays say a man is ""balmy.''

1420
01:34:50,326 --> 01:34:52,760
ls that correct?

1421
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:59,792
Why does everyone think he's pixilated?
Does he do peculiar things?

1422
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:03,531
He walks in the rain without his hat
and talks to himself.

1423
01:35:03,606 --> 01:35:06,336
- Sometimes he whistles.
- And sings.

1424
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:08,603
Anything else?

1425
01:35:08,677 --> 01:35:11,737
- He gave Chuck Dillon a thumping.
- Blacked his eye.

1426
01:35:11,814 --> 01:35:14,942
- Why?
- For no reason, l guess.

1427
01:35:15,017 --> 01:35:19,249
He always does it. We run into the house
when we see him coming.

1428
01:35:19,321 --> 01:35:21,516
Never can tell
what he's going to do.

1429
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:27,187
- He sure is pixilated.
- Yes. He's pixilated, all right.

1430
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,731
Thank you, ladies.
That's all.

1431
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:34,394
They kept hollering,
""Back to nature!''

1432
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:37,803
I thought they looked harmless enough,
so l took them home.

1433
01:35:37,873 --> 01:35:40,398
l never thought
he was cracked.

1434
01:35:41,143 --> 01:35:44,374
I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me
to point out the celebrities.

1435
01:35:44,446 --> 01:35:47,108
I said, ""Help me.'' l'm coming out of
the kitchen a couple of minutes later...

1436
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:49,173
and there he is
mopping up the floors with them.

1437
01:35:49,251 --> 01:35:52,186
l never figured he was a guy
that was looking for trouble.

1438
01:35:52,254 --> 01:35:56,918
He threw us out bodiIy,
but bodily!

1439
01:35:56,992 --> 01:36:00,257
We was hired as his bodyguard, see?
The first crack out of the box...

1440
01:36:00,329 --> 01:36:02,263
he throws us in a room
and locks the door, see?

1441
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:05,198
lf a thing like that gets around
in our profession, we get the bird, see?

1442
01:36:05,267 --> 01:36:08,361
So l says to my partner,
""Let's quit this guy. He's nuts!''

1443
01:36:08,437 --> 01:36:12,134
l'm very fond of Clarissa.
She's a nice horse.

1444
01:36:12,207 --> 01:36:14,607
And when this bloke here
started feeding her donuts...

1445
01:36:14,677 --> 01:36:18,943
l yelled down to him,
""Mind what you're doing down there.''

1446
01:36:19,014 --> 01:36:22,745
l wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara
won't eat nothin' but donuts now.

1447
01:36:23,786 --> 01:36:26,949
And now, if the court pIeases,
l shall call upon Dr. Emil Von HaIlor...

1448
01:36:27,022 --> 01:36:29,388
if he'll be good enough
to give us his opinion.

1449
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:31,323
Dr. Von HaIlor
is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist...

1450
01:36:31,393 --> 01:36:33,759
probably the greatest authority
on the subject in the worId.

1451
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:35,820
At present, he's in this country
on a lecture tour...

1452
01:36:35,898 --> 01:36:37,525
and has graciously
volunteered his services.

1453
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:46,334
Do you swear the testimony you give
in the cause now before this court...

1454
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:48,933
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1455
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:51,639
- State your right name, please.
- Emil Von Hallor.

1456
01:36:51,714 --> 01:36:52,942
Take the stand.

1457
01:36:56,852 --> 01:37:01,380
Dr. Von Hallor, would you tell the court
what your opinion is of this case?

1458
01:37:01,457 --> 01:37:04,449
This is purely a case
of manic depression.

1459
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:08,485
A case of this kind,
patients sometimes go on for years...

1460
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:10,691
before being detected.

1461
01:37:10,766 --> 01:37:12,734
You remember, Dr. Fosdick,
in my last book...

1462
01:37:12,801 --> 01:37:16,965
there were some very fine examples,
especially the young nobleman.

1463
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,907
- You remember?
- Yes, Dr. Von HaIlor. Very interesting.

1464
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,968
lt reminds me very much of this one.

1465
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:26,037
lt takes so long to detect them...

1466
01:37:26,115 --> 01:37:30,211
because their mood
changes so often and so quickly.

1467
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:34,051
Now, Your Honor, may l show you?
May I use the chart?

1468
01:37:34,123 --> 01:37:36,057
By aIl means.

1469
01:37:41,864 --> 01:37:45,231
BeIow here,
they are extremely depressed...

1470
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:50,101
melancholy, impossibIe to live with
and often become violent.

1471
01:37:51,173 --> 01:37:53,300
From this mood...

1472
01:37:53,375 --> 01:37:57,471
the manic depressive
might gradually change...

1473
01:37:57,546 --> 01:38:01,175
until they reach this state.

1474
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:06,449
Here is lucidity. Here they are
normal, as normal as you or I.

1475
01:38:06,522 --> 01:38:09,616
Assuming, of course,
that we are normal.

1476
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:13,226
Then the mood changes again...

1477
01:38:13,295 --> 01:38:16,458
untiI they reach this state...

1478
01:38:16,532 --> 01:38:18,932
a state of highest exultation.

1479
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:22,664
Here, everything is fine.
Here, the world is beautiful.

1480
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:25,901
Here, they are so elated--
How to express it?

1481
01:38:25,974 --> 01:38:28,204
They wouId give you
the shirts off their backs.

1482
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:32,576
How would you say
that applied to Mr. Deeds' case?

1483
01:38:32,648 --> 01:38:35,208
The symptoms are obvious.

1484
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:38,185
When he was here,
on top of the wave...

1485
01:38:38,253 --> 01:38:42,383
he felt nothing but kindIiness
and warmth for his felIow man.

1486
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:47,157
He wanted to have them around him,
so he decided to give a big reception.

1487
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:50,221
But in the meantime,
his mood has changed.

1488
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:54,759
He's now at the bottom of the wave:
depressed, meIanchoIy.

1489
01:38:54,837 --> 01:38:57,931
So when his guests arrive,
he throws them out.

1490
01:38:58,006 --> 01:39:00,338
They are now
his imaginary enemies.

1491
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:03,537
Other instances
of high elations are...

1492
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:08,811
when he plays his tuba,
when he writes his poetry...

1493
01:39:08,884 --> 01:39:12,513
when he chases fire engines
in a desire to heIp humanity.

1494
01:39:13,422 --> 01:39:16,585
This is contrasted
with his present mood...

1495
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:22,119
which is so low that even the instinct
for self-preservation is lacking.

1496
01:39:24,099 --> 01:39:28,763
Your Honor, this is decidedly
a case of manic depression.

1497
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,771
Thank you very much, Doctor.

1498
01:39:34,243 --> 01:39:36,711
Your Honor, we rest.

1499
01:39:42,117 --> 01:39:44,517
What are you going to do,
let them get away with it?

1500
01:39:44,586 --> 01:39:46,486
They've got you cooked.

1501
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,964
He's sunk.

1502
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:09,773
Before the court arrives at a decision,
isn't there anything you wish to say?

1503
01:40:22,257 --> 01:40:24,782
Come on. Don't be a sap.

1504
01:40:38,273 --> 01:40:40,207
- You both concur?
- AbsoIutely.

1505
01:40:40,275 --> 01:40:41,469
All right.

1506
01:40:46,915 --> 01:40:51,943
ln view of the extensive testimony,
your continued silence...

1507
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,784
and on the recommendation
of the doctors...

1508
01:40:54,856 --> 01:40:58,622
the court considers it advisabIe,
for your own safety...

1509
01:40:58,694 --> 01:41:00,821
that you be committed
to an institution...

1510
01:41:00,896 --> 01:41:03,262
as prescribed by law.

1511
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:09,336
You need medical attention,
Mr. Deeds.

1512
01:41:09,404 --> 01:41:12,669
Perhaps in a little whiIe--

1513
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:17,406
Wait a minute. You can't do it.
You've got to make him taIk.

1514
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:21,745
- Your Honor, l object.
- Please. l know how horrible l've been.

1515
01:41:21,817 --> 01:41:24,650
No matter what happens-- if you
never see me again-- do this for me.

1516
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,449
- Please.
- You said l could speak.

1517
01:41:26,521 --> 01:41:29,081
You said I could have my say
if l were rational. l<i>'</i>m rationaI.

1518
01:41:29,157 --> 01:41:30,852
Please let me
take the witness chair.

1519
01:41:30,926 --> 01:41:33,759
He must be made to defend himself
before you arrive at a decision.

1520
01:41:33,829 --> 01:41:35,694
- Take the stand.
- Thank you.

1521
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:37,732
Your Honor, what she is saying
has no bearing on the case. l object.

1522
01:41:37,799 --> 01:41:40,131
- Let her speak.
- l know why he won't defend himseIf.

1523
01:41:40,202 --> 01:41:43,137
That has a bearing on the case,
hasn't it? He's been hurt.

1524
01:41:43,205 --> 01:41:46,470
He's been hurt by everybody he's met
since he came here, principalIy by me.

1525
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:49,101
He's been the victim
of every conniving crook in town.

1526
01:41:49,177 --> 01:41:52,544
The newspapers pounced on him, made him
a target for their feeble humor.

1527
01:41:52,614 --> 01:41:56,812
l was smarter than the rest of them.
I got closer so l couId laugh Iouder.

1528
01:41:56,885 --> 01:41:59,479
Why shouldn't he keep quiet?
Every time he said anything...

1529
01:41:59,554 --> 01:42:01,715
it was twisted around
to sound imbecilic.

1530
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:04,782
He can thank me for it.
l handed the gang a grand laugh.

1531
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,919
lt's a fitting climax
to my sense of humor.

1532
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:09,725
- Your Honor, this is preposterous.
- CertainIy l wrote those articles.

1533
01:42:09,798 --> 01:42:12,460
l was going to get a raise,
a month's vacation.

1534
01:42:12,534 --> 01:42:15,526
But l stopped writing them when
I found out what he was all about...

1535
01:42:15,604 --> 01:42:17,435
when l realized how real he was.

1536
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:20,634
He couId never fit in
with our distorted viewpoint...

1537
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:23,701
because he's honest
and sincere and good.

1538
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:26,043
If that man's crazy...

1539
01:42:26,114 --> 01:42:28,548
the rest of us
belong in straitjackets!

1540
01:42:28,617 --> 01:42:30,551
This is absurd.
The woman's obviously in love with him.

1541
01:42:30,619 --> 01:42:32,814
- What's that got to do with it?
- You are in Iove with him, aren't you?

1542
01:42:32,888 --> 01:42:34,515
- What's that got to do with it?
- You are, aren't you?

1543
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:37,683
- Yes!
- Her testimony's of no vaIue.

1544
01:42:37,759 --> 01:42:40,091
Why shouldn't she defend him?
It's typical of American womanhood.

1545
01:42:40,162 --> 01:42:41,720
Protect the weak.

1546
01:42:41,797 --> 01:42:44,960
l'm not saying nobody Iikes the boy.
I have a fond affection for him myself.

1547
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:49,060
- But that doesn't mean to say--
- I can verify what Miss Bennett said.

1548
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:53,096
l'm her editor. When she quit, she told
me what a swell fellow this man was...

1549
01:42:53,175 --> 01:42:55,405
and anything Babe Bennett says
is okay with me.

1550
01:42:55,477 --> 01:42:57,638
lf you have anything to say,
you will take the stand.

1551
01:42:57,713 --> 01:43:01,740
l've already said it, Your Honor. I just
thought I'd like to get my two cents in.

1552
01:43:01,817 --> 01:43:04,115
Don't be a sucker, pal.
Stand up and speak your piece.

1553
01:43:04,186 --> 01:43:07,178
-Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents.
-Sit down.

1554
01:43:07,255 --> 01:43:09,314
l've been with this man
ever since he came to New York.

1555
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:11,859
Sit down ! There will be
no further interruptions.

1556
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:14,919
- How about us, Mr. Deeds?
- Yes, what about us, Mr. Deeds?

1557
01:43:14,996 --> 01:43:17,590
- Order in the court!
- You're going to leave us in the cold?

1558
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:19,463
They're trying to frame you.

1559
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:27,932
- Stop this.
- Order!

1560
01:43:34,049 --> 01:43:35,641
Order.

1561
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:42,045
ln the interest of Mr. Deeds, l have
tolerated a great deal of informality.

1562
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,885
But if there is one more outburst,
l shalI have the courtroom cleared.

1563
01:43:47,796 --> 01:43:50,162
- Your Honor?
- Yes?

1564
01:43:50,232 --> 01:43:52,666
I'd like to get in
my two cents' worth.

1565
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:57,001
Take the stand.

1566
01:44:26,134 --> 01:44:28,625
Proceed.

1567
01:44:28,703 --> 01:44:33,265
I don't know where to begin. There have
been so many things said about me that--

1568
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:41,138
About my playing the tuba. lt seems like
a lot of fuss has been made about that.

1569
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,652
lf a man's crazy
just because he plays the tuba...

1570
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,482
then somebody'd
better look into it...

1571
01:44:46,555 --> 01:44:49,683
because there are a lot of tuba players
running around loose.

1572
01:44:49,758 --> 01:44:53,888
I don't see any harm in it. l play mine
whenever l want to concentrate.

1573
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:56,123
That may sound funny
to some people...

1574
01:44:56,198 --> 01:44:58,666
but everybody does something silIy
when they're thinking.

1575
01:44:58,733 --> 01:45:01,634
For instance,
the judge here...

1576
01:45:01,703 --> 01:45:03,364
is an ""O'' fiIler.

1577
01:45:03,438 --> 01:45:04,928
- A what?
- An ""O'' filler.

1578
01:45:05,006 --> 01:45:07,770
You fill in all the spaces in the O's
with your pencil. l was watching.

1579
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,944
That may make you
look a Iittle crazy, Your Honor...

1580
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,010
just sitting around,
filling in O's...

1581
01:45:20,088 --> 01:45:23,455
but l don't see anything wrong,
'cause that helps you think.

1582
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:26,085
- Other people are doodlers.
- Doodlers?

1583
01:45:26,161 --> 01:45:28,129
Yeah, that's a name
we made up back home...

1584
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:31,529
for peopIe who make foolish designs
on paper when they're thinking.

1585
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,728
lt's called doodling.
Almost everybody's a doodler.

1586
01:45:34,803 --> 01:45:37,636
Did you ever see a scratch pad
in a telephone booth?

1587
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:41,665
People draw the most idiotic pictures
when they're thinking.

1588
01:45:41,743 --> 01:45:45,611
Dr. Von HaIlor here could probably
think up a long name for it...

1589
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,910
because he doodles all the time.

1590
01:45:53,989 --> 01:45:55,616
Thank you.

1591
01:45:56,691 --> 01:46:00,491
This is a piece of paper
he was scribbling on.

1592
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:03,497
I can't figure it out.
One minute it looks like a chimpanzee.

1593
01:46:03,565 --> 01:46:08,298
The next minute it looks like a picture
of Mr. Cedar. You look at it.

1594
01:46:14,976 --> 01:46:17,035
Exhibit ""A'' for the defense.

1595
01:46:20,448 --> 01:46:23,042
Looks kind of stupid, doesn<i>'</i>t it?
But l guess that<i>'</i>s alI right.

1596
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:25,951
lf Dr. Von Hallor has to doodle
to heIp him think...

1597
01:46:26,021 --> 01:46:28,046
that's his business.

1598
01:46:28,123 --> 01:46:32,253
Everybody does something different.
Some people are ear pullers.

1599
01:46:32,327 --> 01:46:34,761
Some are nail biters.

1600
01:46:34,829 --> 01:46:37,297
That Mr. Semple over there...

1601
01:46:37,365 --> 01:46:40,163
is a nose twitcher.

1602
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:49,468
The lady next to him
is a knuckle cracker.

1603
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:08,289
So you see, everybody does silly things
to heIp them think.

1604
01:47:08,363 --> 01:47:10,593
WeIl, l play the tuba.

1605
01:47:10,665 --> 01:47:13,498
- Nice work, toots!
- Order in this court!

1606
01:47:13,568 --> 01:47:16,332
This is becoming farcicaI.
l demand Mr. Deeds...

1607
01:47:16,404 --> 01:47:19,100
dispense with side remarks
and confine himself to facts.

1608
01:47:19,174 --> 01:47:21,938
Let him explain his wanderings
around the street in his underclothes...

1609
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:23,705
his feeding donuts to horses.

1610
01:47:23,778 --> 01:47:26,110
Please. Proceed.

1611
01:47:29,217 --> 01:47:33,551
Mr. Cedar's right. Those things
do look kind of bad, don't they?

1612
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:38,149
But to tell you the truth,
Your Honor, l don't remember them.

1613
01:47:38,226 --> 01:47:40,558
l guess they happened,
because I don't think a policeman...

1614
01:47:40,628 --> 01:47:44,496
would Iie about a thing like that,
but l was drunk.

1615
01:47:44,566 --> 01:47:48,525
lt was the first time l was ever drunk.
lt's probably happened to you some time.

1616
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:52,030
l mean,
when you were younger, of course.

1617
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:55,604
It's Iikely
to happen to anybody.

1618
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:58,771
Just the other morning, I read in
the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son...

1619
01:47:58,847 --> 01:48:03,307
how he got drunk and insisted on driving
a taxicab while the driver sat inside.

1620
01:48:09,157 --> 01:48:10,715
lsn't that so?

1621
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:15,559
- Your Honor, l object.
- Proceed.

1622
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:20,164
Now, about the Faulkner sisters.

1623
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:26,140
That's funny, Mr. Cedar going to
Mandrake FalIs to bring them here.

1624
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:28,675
- Do you mind if l taIk to them?
- Not at all.

1625
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:33,139
Who owns the house
you live in?

1626
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,781
- Why, you own it, LongfelIow.
- Yes, you own it.

1627
01:48:41,756 --> 01:48:44,725
- Do you pay any rent?
- No, we don't pay any rent.

1628
01:48:44,793 --> 01:48:46,590
Good heavens, no.

1629
01:48:46,661 --> 01:48:49,425
- We never pay rent.
- Are you happy there?

1630
01:48:49,497 --> 01:48:51,931
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, indeed.

1631
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:57,331
Now, Jane, a little while ago
you said l was pixilated.

1632
01:48:57,405 --> 01:48:59,839
Do you still think so?

1633
01:49:03,711 --> 01:49:06,612
Why, you've always been pixilated,
Longfellow.

1634
01:49:06,681 --> 01:49:08,945
- Always.
- That's fine.

1635
01:49:09,984 --> 01:49:11,849
I guess maybe l am.

1636
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,381
Now, tell me something, Jane.
Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?

1637
01:49:17,459 --> 01:49:21,862
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls
is pixilated, except us.

1638
01:49:35,009 --> 01:49:37,443
Now, just one more question.

1639
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,378
You see the judge here.
He's a nice man, isn't he?

1640
01:49:44,052 --> 01:49:46,520
- Do you think he's pixilated?
- Yes.

1641
01:49:46,588 --> 01:49:48,783
Yes, indeed.

1642
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:06,070
You haven't yet touched
upon the most important point:

1643
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:10,441
this rather fantastic idea of yours
to give away your entire fortune.

1644
01:50:10,512 --> 01:50:12,912
lt is, to say the least,
most uncommon.

1645
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:15,950
Yes. Yes, I was getting to that,
Your Honor.

1646
01:50:16,017 --> 01:50:18,952
Suppose you were living in a small town
and getting aIong fine...

1647
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,854
and suddenly somebody
dropped $20 million in your lap.

1648
01:50:22,924 --> 01:50:25,757
Supposing you discover all that money
was messing up your Iife...

1649
01:50:25,827 --> 01:50:29,593
was bringing vultures around your neck
and making you lose faith in everybody.

1650
01:50:29,664 --> 01:50:31,291
You'd be worried, wouldn't you?

1651
01:50:31,366 --> 01:50:36,360
You'd feel that you had a hot potato
in your hand, and you'd want to drop it.

1652
01:50:36,437 --> 01:50:40,874
l guess Dr. Von Hallor here would say
you were riding on those bottom waves...

1653
01:50:40,942 --> 01:50:44,343
because you wanted to drop something
that was burning your fingers.

1654
01:50:44,412 --> 01:50:47,176
If this man is permitted to carry out
his plan, repercussions will be felt...

1655
01:50:47,248 --> 01:50:50,183
that will rock the foundation
of our entire governmental systems.

1656
01:50:50,251 --> 01:50:54,654
Please, Mr. Cedar.
Proceed.

1657
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,825
Personally, l don<i>'</i>t know
what Mr. Cedar is raving about.

1658
01:51:01,896 --> 01:51:04,296
From what l can see, no matter
what system of government we have...

1659
01:51:04,365 --> 01:51:07,300
there'll always be leaders
and aIways be foIlowers.

1660
01:51:07,368 --> 01:51:10,132
It's like the road out in front
of my house. lt's on a steep hill.

1661
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:12,537
Every day,
I watch the cars climbing up.

1662
01:51:12,607 --> 01:51:16,509
Some go lickety-split up that hilI
on high; some have to shift into second.

1663
01:51:16,578 --> 01:51:19,945
Some sputter and shake
and slip back to the bottom again.

1664
01:51:20,014 --> 01:51:23,575
Same cars, same gasoline,
yet some make it and some don<i>'</i>t.

1665
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:28,054
l say the fellows who can make the hill
should stop and help those who can't.

1666
01:51:28,122 --> 01:51:31,990
That's all I'm trying to do: help
fellows who can't make the hilI on high.

1667
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,994
What does Mr. Cedar
expect me to do with it?

1668
01:51:34,062 --> 01:51:36,792
Give it to him and a lot of other people
who don't need it?

1669
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:40,300
If you don't mind, Your Honor, l'll
ride on those top waves for a minute.

1670
01:51:40,368 --> 01:51:43,701
AIl you felIows up there, all those
who applied for a farm, stand up.

1671
01:51:47,475 --> 01:51:49,534
See aIl those feIlows?
They're the ones l'm trying to help.

1672
01:51:49,611 --> 01:51:54,139
They need it. Mr. Cedar and Mr. SempIe
don't need anything. They've got pIenty.

1673
01:51:54,215 --> 01:51:56,683
It's like I'm out in a big boat,
and I see one felIow in a rowboat...

1674
01:51:56,751 --> 01:52:00,448
who<i>'</i>s tired of rowing and wants
a free ride and another who's drowning.

1675
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:05,220
Who would you expect me to rescue?
Mr. Cedar, who wants a free ride?

1676
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:07,386
Or those men out there
who are drowning?

1677
01:52:07,462 --> 01:52:11,796
Any ten-year-old child will give you
the answer to that. Thank you. Sit down.

1678
01:52:14,335 --> 01:52:16,394
Now, my plan was very simple.

1679
01:52:16,471 --> 01:52:19,634
l was gonna give each family 10 acres,
a horse, a cow and some seed...

1680
01:52:19,707 --> 01:52:22,073
and if they worked the farm
for three years, it's theirs.

1681
01:52:22,143 --> 01:52:26,170
Now, if that's crazy, maybe
l ought to be sent to an institution...

1682
01:52:26,247 --> 01:52:29,648
but I don't think it is,
and Mr. Cedar doesn't either.

1683
01:52:29,717 --> 01:52:33,983
Before the hearing, he offered to call
everything off if l made a settlement.

1684
01:52:34,055 --> 01:52:37,047
So you see, he wouldn't think
I was crazy if he got paid off.

1685
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:39,787
lt's a lie growing
in his warped imagination.

1686
01:52:39,861 --> 01:52:42,329
I never heard anything
so colossally stupid in my life.

1687
01:52:42,397 --> 01:52:45,594
lt's an insult to our intelligence to
sit and listen to such chiIdish ravings.

1688
01:52:45,667 --> 01:52:48,067
- You will permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
- But, Your Honor--

1689
01:52:52,807 --> 01:52:55,799
- Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
- No.

1690
01:52:55,877 --> 01:52:59,779
Yes. There is one more thing I'd like
to get off my chest before l finish.

1691
01:52:59,847 --> 01:53:02,315
- Proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1692
01:53:06,587 --> 01:53:08,748
Order! Order this man
back to his chair!

1693
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,522
Order!

1694
01:53:27,608 --> 01:53:30,839
Remain seated and come to order.
The court is again in session.

1695
01:53:36,451 --> 01:53:38,442
Before the court
announces its decision...

1696
01:53:38,519 --> 01:53:41,044
l want to warn alI who are here
that the police have orders...

1697
01:53:41,122 --> 01:53:43,818
to arrest
anyone creating a disturbance.

1698
01:53:45,893 --> 01:53:50,523
Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal
of damaging testimony against you.

1699
01:53:51,299 --> 01:53:53,358
Your behavior,
to say the Ieast, has been...

1700
01:53:53,434 --> 01:53:55,664
most strange.

1701
01:53:55,737 --> 01:53:58,501
But in the opinion of the court,
you are not only sane...

1702
01:53:58,573 --> 01:54:01,201
but you are the sanest man
that ever walked into this courtroom.

1703
01:54:02,076 --> 01:54:04,544
Case dismissed.

1704
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:15,514
You nose twitcher.

1705
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:18,650
I knew it. You--

1706
01:55:04,972 --> 01:55:08,874
- He's stiIl pixilated.
- He sure is.
