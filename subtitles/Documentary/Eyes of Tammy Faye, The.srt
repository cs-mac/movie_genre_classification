1
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,287
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,841
ALlCE:
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,521
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,721
ALlCE:
I know.

5
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:37,731
How do I look?

6
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,331
Perfect.

7
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,164
Is my hair okay?

8
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:42,727
It's great.

9
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,928
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,491
It's beautiful.

11
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,524
You always look beautiful.

12
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,968
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,527
BlLL: Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:55,687
Coming.

15
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,051
All right.

16
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,441
I'm ready.

17
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:17,410
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:18,522
Roz.

19
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,685
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,607
ROZ:
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,042
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,766
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,809
ALlCE: What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,520
-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:39,690
-No, darling.
BlLL: It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:42,048
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:44,812
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:46,690
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,492
-I'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:51,603
ALlCE: You be good, baby.
HELENA: Good night, Daddy.

31
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:54,491
BlLL: Good night, sweetheart.
ALlCE: See you in the morning.

(BAND PLAYS)

33
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,527
-Victor, lllona.
VlCTOR: Bill, Alice.

34
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,166
VlCTOR: Merry Christmas.
lLLONA: Thank you for coming.

35
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,810
-Thanks so much for coming.
-We wouldn't miss it for the world.

36
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,970
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

37
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:19,003
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

38
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:20,884
-Yes, he does.
-He does?

39
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,970
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

40
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:27,403
-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

41
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:30,001
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

42
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:32,521
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

43
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,326
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

44
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,728
Do you know anyone here?

45
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,401
BlLL:
Not a soul.

46
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:05,210
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

47
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:10,650
This is what you get
for making house calls.

48
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:23,402
You see that guy at the piano?

49
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:27,006
I went to medical school with him.

50
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,487
Really?

51
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:34,041
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

52
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:38,248
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

53
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,561
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

54
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:47,082
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

55
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:48,727
Thank you.

56
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,449
Let's go over and say hello.

57
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:59,961
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

58
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:04,006
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

59
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:05,527
Good.

60
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,931
BlLL:
Nightingale.

61
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,847
Nick Nightingale!

62
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:21,242
Oh, my God! Bill.

63
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:24,530
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

64
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:28,008
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. Ten years?

65
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,486
And a couple.

66
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,804
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

67
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,808
You haven't changed a bit.

68
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,765
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

69
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,572
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

70
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,967
I see you've become a pianist.

71
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,606
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

72
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,926
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

73
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:56,011
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor. "

74
00:06:56,212 --> 00:07:00,330
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor. "

75
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,441
I never did understand
why you walked away.

76
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,402
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

77
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:07,761
Cheers.

78
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:11,608
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

79
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,370
Be right with you.

80
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:16,132
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

81
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:19,961
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Cafe.

82
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,732
-Stop by if you get a chance.
-I'll be there.

83
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:26,365
-It's great seeing you.
-Good seeing you too, man.

84
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:09,448
I think that's my glass.

85
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,644
I'm absolutely certain of it.

86
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:29,926
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

87
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,441
My name is Alice Harford.

88
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,728
I'm American.

89
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,203
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

90
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:53,283
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

91
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:58,802
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

92
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,642
...crying his eyes out...

93
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:05,447
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

94
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,410
But he also had a good time first.

95
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,082
A very good time.

96
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,125
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

97
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,088
With my husband.

98
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,289
Oh, how sad.

99
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:29,682
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

100
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,448
What do you do, Alice?

101
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:40,203
Well, at the moment...

102
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:43,247
...I'm looking for a job.

103
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:47,967
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

104
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,648
But it went broke.

105
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:54,131
What a shame.

106
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:58,206
I have some friends in the art game.

107
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,968
Perhaps I can be of some help.

108
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,164
Thank you.

109
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:26,130
Someone you know?

110
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,444
My...

111
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:33,451
...husband.

112
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,761
Oh.

113
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:40,844
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

114
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:45,529
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

115
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,760
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

116
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,767
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

117
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:00,523
Why wouldn't she?

118
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,243
Is it as bad as that?

119
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,767
As good as that.

120
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,164
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

121
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:14,809
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

122
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,688
How do you spell Nuala?

123
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:24,002
N-U-A-L-A.

124
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,331
You don't remember me, do you?

125
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,920
You were very kind to me once.

126
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,727
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

127
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:41,091
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

128
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,805
...on a very windy day...?

129
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:47,051
-And you got something in your eye.
-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

130
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,808
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

131
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:53,407
...which was also clean.

132
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:58,561
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

133
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,484
You know why women used to
get married, don't you?

134
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,088
Why don't you tell me?

135
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:10,605
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

136
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:14,448
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

137
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,568
The ones they really wanted.

138
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:23,963
Fascinating.

139
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,367
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

140
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:36,288
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

141
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,446
They always seem so...

142
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:42,811
...knowledgeable.

143
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:47,447
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

144
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:50,405
...about all sorts of things.

145
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,328
But I bet they work too hard.

146
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:58,441
Just think of all they miss.

147
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,562
You're probably right.

148
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,128
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

149
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,251
Exactly?

150
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:14,046
Where the rainbow ends.

151
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:16,409
Where the rainbow ends?

152
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,922
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

153
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,090
Now that depends where that is.

154
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,884
Well, let's find out.

155
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:27,811
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

156
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:32,125
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

157
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,487
Fine.

158
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,525
To be continued?

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

160
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,001
Yeah.

161
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,403
Bill, thanks for coming.

162
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:07,085
We had a little accident here.

163
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:08,771
BlLL:
What happened?

164
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,123
VlCTOR:
Well, she was....

165
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:15,605
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

166
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,487
BlLL:
What did she take?

167
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,803
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

168
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:24,764
It's heroin and coke.

169
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:29,523
BlLL:
Heroin and coke?

170
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,206
Anything else?

171
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:37,929
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

172
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,010
How long has she been like this?

173
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:43,524
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

174
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:44,801
What's her name?

175
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,087
Mandy.

176
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,731
Mandy?

177
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:54,406
Mandy?

178
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:58,049
Can you hear me, Mandy?

179
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,808
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

180
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,210
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

181
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:08,925
You can hear me.

182
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:13,171
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

183
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,049
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

184
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:20,130
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

185
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,041
Look at me. Look at me.

186
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:26,810
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

187
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:29,362
Good.

188
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,131
Good.

189
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:37,169
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

190
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:40,607
Yes.

191
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,729
It's wonderful.

192
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:47,045
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

193
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,080
No.

194
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,810
I haven't.

195
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:58,168
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

196
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,328
Do you like the period?

197
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,004
I do.

198
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:09,682
I adore it.

199
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,047
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

200
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,363
Would you like to see it?

201
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,050
I can show it to you.

202
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,323
We won't be gone long.

203
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,170
Maybe...

204
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,724
...not just...

205
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,205
...now.

206
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:05,605
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

207
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,406
Sorry.

208
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:19,083
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

209
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,121
Better.

210
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:35,650
You are a very, very lucky girl.

211
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,051
You know that?

212
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,725
I know.

213
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,962
You're gonna be okay this time.

214
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:49,289
But you can't keep doing this.

215
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:51,445
You understand?

216
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:54,801
Yeah.

217
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,401
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

218
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:02,645
I know.

219
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

220
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,841
Okay.

221
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,521
Well, Victor...

222
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:18,125
...I'll leave the rest to you.

223
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,971
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

224
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:24,721
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

225
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:26,365
Another hour?

226
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:31,009
Then I'd have someone take her home.

227
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay. Okay.

228
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,245
Good night, Mandy.

229
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,885
Listen....

230
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:43,208
I can't thank you enough for this.

231
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,048
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

232
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,607
Bill, I probably....

233
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:52,808
I know I don't have to mention this...

234
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,805
...but this is just between us.

235
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:57,486
Of course.

236
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,206
Thanks.

237
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:23,763
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

238
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:30,208
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

239
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:34,849
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,611
Yes...

241
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,530
...but will I?

242
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,810
Of course you will.

243
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:47,960
No.

244
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:52,407
I really have to go.
I have to go.

245
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,330
You don't, you know.

246
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:58,486
Yes, I do.

247
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:00,807
Alice?

248
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,364
I must see you again.

249
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,600
-That's impossible.
-Why?

250
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,724
Because...

251
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,362
...I'm married.

252
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,011
BlLL:
Good morning, Lisa.

253
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,248
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

254
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:26,250
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

255
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,010
-Sure.
-Thank you.

256
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,405
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

257
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:34,524
"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

258
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:37,485
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. "

259
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,960
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

260
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,130
Hold this for Mommy.

261
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,370
-Looking forward to Christmas?
-Yeah.

262
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,050
-Does this hurt?
-Yeah.

263
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,000
-Right there?
-Yeah.

264
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,363
Daddy's gonna like that.

265
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,690
Very good choice.

266
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:28,682
"--before me...

267
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:33,927
...when I jump into my bed. "

268
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:39,845
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

269
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:42,524
BlLL:
I've taken care of that.

270
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,411
ALlCE:
Good.

271
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:49,568
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

272
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,288
Let's do that tomorrow.

273
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:39,488
Tell me something.

274
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:47,408
Those two girls...

275
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,686
...at the party last night....

276
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:59,203
Did you...

277
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,447
...by any chance...

278
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:05,042
...happen to...

279
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:09,325
...fuck them?

280
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,126
What?

281
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:18,486
What are you talking about?

282
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:25,847
I'm talking about the two girls...

283
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,841
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

284
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:34,404
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

285
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,243
Who were they?

286
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:45,927
They were just a couple of models.

287
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:54,169
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

288
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:56,249
Wait a minute.

289
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,725
Wait a minute.

290
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:04,280
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,486
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

292
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,045
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

293
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:19,525
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

294
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:28,210
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,131
What did he want?

296
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,323
What did he want?

297
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,203
What did he want?

298
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:42,325
Sex...

299
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,163
...upstairs.

300
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,009
Then and there.

301
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,811
Is that all?

302
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,601
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:58,485
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,091
That's right.

305
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:06,607
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:11,562
Understandable?

307
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:14,482
Because you are a very...

308
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,562
...very beautiful woman.

309
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:18,927
Whoa.

310
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:20,287
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:21,851
Wait.

312
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:27,284
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

313
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:31,610
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

314
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:37,564
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

315
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:44,722
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

316
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:51,448
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

317
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:55,284
So on that basis...

318
00:26:55,492 --> 00:27:00,282
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

319
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:05,044
There are exceptions.

320
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:10,361
And what makes you an exception?

321
00:27:13,012 --> 00:27:16,527
What makes me an exception is that...

322
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:20,047
...I happen to be in love with you.

323
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:22,605
And because we're married...

324
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:26,930
...and because I would never
lie to you...

325
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:29,085
...or hurt you.

326
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:40,327
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

327
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,769
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

328
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:46,440
...is out of consideration for me?

329
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:49,564
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

330
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:52,566
Let's just relax, Alice.

331
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,240
This pot is making you aggressive.

332
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:58,723
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

333
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:01,440
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

334
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:04,120
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

335
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,404
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

336
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,728
I'm not arguing.

337
00:28:10,412 --> 00:28:14,769
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

338
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:16,645
Where I'm coming from?

339
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:25,449
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

340
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:29,606
...standing in your office naked...

341
00:28:29,812 --> 00:28:32,372
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

342
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:34,290
Now, what I want to know....

343
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:39,282
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

344
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:43,446
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

345
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,128
It's all very impersonal...

346
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:49,768
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

347
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:54,968
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

348
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,161
Exactly.

349
00:28:56,372 --> 00:29:00,729
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

350
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:05,971
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

351
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:08,322
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

352
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:12,650
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

353
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,770
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

354
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:23,051
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

355
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,089
And what makes you so sure?

356
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,843
If for no better reason...

357
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:35,205
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

358
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:40,647
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:43,010
What then?

360
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:46,488
I don't know, Alice....

361
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,200
What then?

362
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:54,801
Women don't....

363
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:59,322
They basically just don't
think like that.

364
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,922
Millions of years of evolution, right?

365
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:09,041
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

366
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:12,324
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

367
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:14,688
...and whatever the fuck else!

368
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:18,487
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

369
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:22,482
If you men only knew.

370
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:27,765
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

371
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:30,964
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

372
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,208
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

373
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:34,527
No, I'm not.

374
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,723
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

375
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:37,882
No, I haven't.

376
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:40,481
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

377
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:44,486
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

378
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,967
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

379
00:30:47,172 --> 00:30:49,845
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

380
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:54,170
You are very, very sure of yourself...

381
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:55,600
...aren't you?

382
00:30:56,132 --> 00:30:57,201
No.

383
00:30:58,012 --> 00:30:59,604
I'm sure of you.

384
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,164
Do you think that's funny?

385
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,450
All right. Fuck it.

386
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:27,847
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

387
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,251
Do you....

388
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,847
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

389
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:50,767
Yes.

390
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:55,450
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

391
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,722
...there was this young naval officer...

392
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:02,323
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

393
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:04,761
BlLL:
No.

394
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:11,325
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

395
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:14,092
Nothing rings a bell?

396
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,041
No.

397
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:21,726
Well...

398
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:27,491
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

399
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:30,812
He was checking into the hotel...

400
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:34,408
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

401
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,963
...to the elevator.

402
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:45,530
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

403
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,404
Nothing more.

404
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:58,444
But I could hardly...

405
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:01,531
...move.

406
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:12,286
That afternoon...

407
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,371
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

408
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,007
...and you and I made love.

409
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:31,282
And we made plans about our future...

410
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:36,246
...and we talked about Helena.

411
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,490
And yet...

412
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:43,166
...at no time...

413
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,972
...was he ever...

414
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,721
...out of my mind.

415
00:33:56,972 --> 00:34:01,682
And I thought if he wanted me...

416
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:05,845
...even if it was only...

417
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,124
...for one night...

418
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,801
...I was ready to give up everything.

419
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:19,766
You.

420
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:23,731
Helena.

421
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:29,801
My whole fucking future.

422
00:34:31,972 --> 00:34:33,530
Everything.

423
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:44,004
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

424
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:47,771
...you were dearer to me than ever.

425
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,050
And at that moment, my love for you...

426
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:58,768
...was both...

427
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:05,963
...tender and sad.

428
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:19,006
I barely slept that night...

429
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,967
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

430
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:30,807
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

431
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:35,488
...or that he might still be there.

432
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:42,729
But by dinner...

433
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:48,966
...I realized he was gone...

434
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:57,240
...and I was...

435
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,123
...relieved.

436
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:06,645
(PHONE RlNGS)

437
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:25,720
Hello?

438
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:29,690
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

439
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,411
When did it happen?

440
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:43,121
No. No.

441
00:36:44,012 --> 00:36:45,525
I have the address.

442
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:47,560
Thank you.

443
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,088
Lou Nathanson just died.

444
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:08,130
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

(DOORBELL RlNGS)

446
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:02,485
-Hello, Rosa.
-Good evening, Dr. Harford.

447
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:07,447
-How is Miss Nathanson?
-Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

448
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,721
Thank you.

Come in.

450
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:31,641
Marion....

451
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:35,249
MARION:
Oh, Dr. Harford....

452
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,572
How good of you to come.

453
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:41,127
I came as soon as I got the message.

454
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:42,526
Thank you.

455
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:46,568
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

456
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,490
Your father was....

457
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:52,285
He was a very brave man.

458
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:54,491
Oh, thank you.

459
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:56,810
How are you holding up?

460
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:00,644
I'm a bit numb.

461
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:03,850
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

462
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:07,128
Would you like to sit down?

463
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:37,802
It's so unreal.

464
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:41,008
Daddy had such a good day.

465
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:47,328
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

466
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,328
Then he had a little dinner...

467
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:55,809
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

468
00:39:57,092 --> 00:40:01,768
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

469
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:06,044
...and when I went to see how he was...

470
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:08,447
...I just thought he was asleep.

471
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:17,131
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

472
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:21,767
Marion....

473
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,210
From what you've said...

474
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:28,291
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

475
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,128
Oh, God, I hope so.

476
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:38,967
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

477
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:41,648
...than his death itself.

478
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:46,005
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

479
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:52,364
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

480
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:55,651
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

481
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:58,571
...and he'll be coming over soon.

482
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,930
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

483
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:10,130
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

484
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:12,288
A math professor.

485
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:18,727
We're going to get married in May.

486
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:24,406
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

487
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:29,411
Thank you.

488
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:35,400
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

489
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,682

-No, it's a pick-up band.

-Who do you normally play with?
-Anybody, anywhere.

I got another gig later tonight.

653
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:59,163
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

654
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:01,010
They only get started around 2.

655
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:02,921
In the Village?

656
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:08,328
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

You don't?

658
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:14,923
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

659
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,805
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

660
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:20,572
-A different place every time?
-So far.

661
00:57:21,652 --> 00:57:22,801
What's the big mystery?

Hey, man, I just play the piano.

Is there something I'm missing here?

-Yeah.

No, it's the truth.

669
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:58,769
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

673
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:12,601
...never anything like this...

674
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:16,244

-Nick, I'll tell you what.

Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

Why not?

702

Because everyone is always

like something more colorful?

974
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,716
Then there were all these
other people around us...

975
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,639
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

976
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,274
Everyone was fucking.

977
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,359
And then I....

978
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,709
I was fucking other men.

979
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,038
So many...

980
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,279
...I don't know how many I was with.

981
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,956
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

982
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,473
...just fucking all these men.

983
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,354
I wanted to make fun of you...

984
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,349
...to laugh in your face.

985
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,275
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

986
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,837
That must have been
when you woke me up.

987
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,679
Shit!

988
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,230
Hi.

989
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,476
Hi.

990
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,231
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

991
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,594
Anything else?

992
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,512
No, thank you.

993
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,393
Excuse me.

994
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,397
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Cafe?

995
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,876
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

996
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,552
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

997
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,593
He's playing piano
over there right now.

998
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,313
Nick Nightingale?

999
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,188
Sure, he comes in here.

1000
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,553
Look, maybe you can help me...

1001
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:50,230
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

1002
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,072
Do you know where he's staying?

1003
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,835
Well....

1004
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,558
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

1005
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,035
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1006
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,675
I'm actually an old friend of his.

1007
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,633
Well, doctor...

1008
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:13,510
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

1009
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,155
Listen....

1010
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,231
To be perfectly honest...

1011
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,112
...it's a medical matter.

1012
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,638
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

1013
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,676
Excuse me.

1014
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,436
Hi! How can I help you?

1015
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,235
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

1016
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,230
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

1017
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,710
-He checked out?
-Yes.

1018
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,594
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

1019
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,632
When did he check out?

1020
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,957
About 5:00 this morning.

1021
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,474
5:00?

1022
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,951
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1023
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,833
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1024
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,035
Look....

1025
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,558
Did you notice anything...

1026
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,279
...I don't know...

1027
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,832
...unusual about him when he left?

1028
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,113
Unusual?

1029
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,551
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

1030
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,359
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1031
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,629
Really?

1032
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,513
I'm a doctor.

1033
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,832
-Well, Bill...?
-Sure.

1034
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,918
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

1035
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,357
...because there was something
a little strange...

1036
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,949
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1037
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,555
Really? What was that?

1038
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,829
Well....

1039
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,757
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

1040
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,151
...with two men.

1041
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,758
Big guys.

1042
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,113
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

1043
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:38,835
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1044
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,752
...if you know what I mean.

1045
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,839
Anyways...

1046
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,671
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1047
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:56,110
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1048
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,195
Scared?

1049
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,993
Yes. Yes.

1050
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,398
He said he wanted to check out.

1051
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,354
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1052
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:10,349
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1053
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,073
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1054
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,918
But they saw it and took it...

1055
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,913
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1056
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:24,517
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1057
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,709
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1058
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,190
Do you have any idea where they went?

1059
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,397
No, not a clue.

1060
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,349
Well....

1061
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,708
Anyway....

1062
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,110
I certainly appreciate your help.

1063
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,878
Anytime, Bill.

1064
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,075
CLERK:
Bye.

1065
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,948
MlLlCH:
Oh, the good doctor!

1066
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,434
Mr. Milich.

1067
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,515
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

1068
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,268
Good, good.

1069
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:39,270
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1070
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,355
I think you forgot the mask.

1071
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,033
It's not there?

1072
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,394
Maybe you left it at the party?

1073
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,753
I don't think so.

1074
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,030
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1075
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,195
Sure.

1076
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,117
Here we are.

1077
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,513
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1078
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:19,030
...25 for the mask. Sorry....

1079
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,272
Three hundred seventy-five.

1080
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,028
Yes, dear?

1081
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,759
Come, come.

1082
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,793
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1083
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,389
-Hello.
-Hello.

1084
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,439
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

1085
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,151
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,557
-Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
MAN: And you too.

1087
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,630
MlLlCH:
Well, Dr. Harford...

1088
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,353
...here is your receipt.

1089
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,790
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1090
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,150
...and thanks for the business.

1091
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,711
Mr. Milich, last night...

1092
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,709
...you were going to call the police.

1093
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:16,950
Well....

1094
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,113
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1095
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:26,075
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1096
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,352
...anything at all...

1097
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,754
...it needn't be a costume.

1098
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,234
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1099
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,314
Come in.

1100
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,599
-Tuna salad and black coffee.
BlLL: Thanks.

1101
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,512
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1102
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:12,475
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1103
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,879
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1104
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:20,635
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1105
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,671
-...and make new appointments.
-Sure.

1106
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:27,033
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1107
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,514
SECRETARY:
No problem.

1108
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,475
ALlCE:
Hi.

1109
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,312
HELENA:
Hi, Daddy.

1110
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,508
BlLL:
Hi.

1111
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,440
Any calls for me?

1112
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:15,428
ALlCE:
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1113
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,035
-Hey, gang.
-Hi, Daddy.

1114
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,757
Look, I got all these right.

1115
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,871
You got all of those right?

1116
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,072
Every single one of them?

1117
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,668
That's good.

1118
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,393
You hungry?

1119
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,714
Sort of.

1120
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,638
Want to eat at 7?

1121
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,070
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1122
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:40,068
I have some appointments
at the office.

1123
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,236
You have to go out again tonight?

1124
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,395
I'm afraid so.

1125
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:46,956
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1126
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,915
We'll see about that, okay?

1127
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,391
HELENA:
He could be a watchdog....

1128
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,033
We'll see.

1129
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,879
ALlCE:
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1130
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:02,556
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1131
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:07,197

it would be a subtraction.

...let alone got yourself
through the door.

...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1280
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:47,232
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1281
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,439
It was mine.

1282
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,791
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1283
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:56,516
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:02,353
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

Victor?

1287
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:11,551
What can I say?

1288
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:18,914
I had...

1289
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,873
...absolutely...

1290
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:27,231
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1291

1293
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,828
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1294
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:39,752
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1295
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:42,838
How do you know that?

1296
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,716
Because I had you followed.

1297
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,038
You had me followed?

1298
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,550
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1299
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,751
All right? I owe you an apology.

1300
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,554
This was for your own good, believe me.

1301
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:07,794
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1302
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:11,112
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1303
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:15,109
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1304
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:17,471
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1305
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,877
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1306
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,917
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1307
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,793
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1308
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:35,559
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1309
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:38,956
Who do you think those people were?

1310
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:41,636
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1311
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,037
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1312
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:48,835
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1313
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,356
Was it the second password?

1314
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,352
Is that what gave me away?

1315
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,550
Yes, finally.

1316
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:05,790
But not because you didn't know it.

1317
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,438
It's because there was
no second password.

1318
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:15,912
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1319
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:18,509
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1320
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:22,309
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1321
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,512
...made out to you-know-who.

1322
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,078
There was a....

1323
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,598
There was a....

1324
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:45,830
There was a woman there...

1325
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,118
...who tried to warn me.

1326
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,754
I know.

1327
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,952
Do you know who she was?

1328
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:13,149
Yes.

1329
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,038
She was a hooker.

1330
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:32,792
Sorry, but...

1331
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,831
...that's what she was.

1332
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:41,195
A hooker.

1333
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,589
Bill....

1334
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,795
Suppose I told you...

1335
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:02,198
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1336
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:07,599
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1337
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:10,439
...her last-minute intervention...

1338
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:14,269
...suppose I said that all of that...

1339
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,160
...was staged.

1340
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:23,909
That it was a kind of charade.

1341
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,317
That it was fake.

1342
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,039
Fake?

1343
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:37,188
Yes. Fake.

1344
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:50,071
Why would they do that?

1345
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,074
VlCTOR:
Why?

1346
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:54,912
In plain words...

1347
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:58,234
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1348
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,636
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1349
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:04,758
...and what you'd seen.

1350
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:25,553
Have you seen this?

1351
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,111
Yes, I have.

1352
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:52,352
I saw her body in the morgue.

1353
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:58,079
Was she....

1354
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,872
Was she the woman at the party?

1355
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,594
VlCTOR:
Yes.

1356
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:17,079
She was.

1357
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,754
Victor....

1358
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:33,228
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1359
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,957
...was the woman at the party.

1360
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:40,395
Yes.

1361
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:49,956
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1362
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:54,156
You called it a fake, a charade.

1363
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:58,951
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1364
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:02,875
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1365
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:12,997
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1366
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,873
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1367
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:19,430
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1368
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:24,155
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1369
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:28,751
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1370
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:32,430
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1371
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:35,552
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1372
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:41,152
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1373
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:43,398
...and the rest is in the paper.

1374
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:47,149
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1375
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:51,399
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1376
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:57,475
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1377
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:59,392
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1378
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:03,309
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1379
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:23,479
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1380
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,440
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1381
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:30,070
But life goes on.

1382
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:31,833
It always does...

1383
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:33,479
...until it doesn't.

1384
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,837
But you know that, don't you?

1385
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,509
I'll tell you everything.

1386
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:02,915
I'll tell you everything.

1387
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:54,756
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1388
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:15,078
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1389
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:39,875
That's nice.

1390
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:42,588
I could put Sabrina in here.

1391
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:45,629
It's really pretty.

1392
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:47,751
It's old-fashioned.

1393
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:57,714
He's big.

1394
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:01,196
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1395
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:02,594
You do?

1396
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,910
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1397
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:13,789
Alice?

1398
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,476
What do you think we should do?

1399
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,839
What do I think we should do?

1400
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:30,308
HELENA:
Look, Mommy!

1401
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,840
What do I think?
I don't know.

1402
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,638
I mean, maybe....

1403
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:00,516
Maybe I think...

1404
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,430
...we should be grateful.

1405
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,713
Grateful...

1406
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:16,030
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1407
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:18,518
...adventures...

1408
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:23,115
...whether they were real...

1409
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,750
...or only a dream.

1410
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:38,315
Are you sure of that?

1411
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:43,638
Am I sure?

1412
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:00,472
Only as sure as I am...

1413
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:04,389
...that the reality of one night...

1414
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:08,359
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1415
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:13,115
...can ever be the whole truth.

1416
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,511
And no dream is ever...

1417
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:25,038
...just a dream.

1418
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:35,151
The important thing is...

1419
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:38,598
...we're awake now...

1420
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,110
...and hopefully...

1421
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:47,156
...for a long time to come.

1422
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:52,113
Forever.

1423
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:55,599
Forever?

1424
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,273
Forever.

1425
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:05,030
Let's not use that word. You know?

1426
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:08,197
It frightens me.

1427
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:21,032
But I do love you...

1428
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:25,632
...and you know...

1429
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:28,830
...there is something very important...

1430
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,634
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1431
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:34,148
What's that?

1432
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:38,599
Fuck.
