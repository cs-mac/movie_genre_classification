1
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,589
Tina!

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,559
Tina...

3
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,792
You OK, Tina?

4
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,798
Just a dream, Ma.

5
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,195
Some dream, judging from that.

6
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,235
You coming back
to the sack or what?

7
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,873
Hold your horses.

8
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,434
Tina, honey, you got
to cut your fingernails...

9
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,755
Or you got to stop
that kind of dreaming.

10
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,790
One or the other.

11
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,191
One...two...

12
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,312
Freddy's coming for you.

13
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,096
Three...four...

14
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,018
Better lock your door.

15
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,937
Five...six...

16
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,733
Grab your crucifix.

17
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,452
Seven...eight...

18
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,299
Gonna stay up late.

19
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,217
Nine...ten...

20
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,853
Never sleep again...

21
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,969
It was so scary.

22
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,772
When I woke up...

23
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,618
It seemed like he was still
in the room with me.

24
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,775
Sounds like a real bogeyman.

25
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,130
"One...two...
Freddy's coming for you."

26
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,172
That's what it reminded me of...
that old jump rope song.

27
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,619
It was
the worst nightmare I ever had.

28
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,968
You wouldn't believe it.

29
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,455
As a matter of fact, I had
a bad dream last night myself.

30
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,174
I had a hard-On this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

31
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,779
Had your name
written all over it.

32
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,538
There's four letters
in my name, Rod.

33
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,936
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

34
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,620
Hey! Up yours
with a twirling lawnmower.

35
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,537
Rod says the sweetest things.

36
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,809
He's nuts about you.

37
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,692
Yeah, nuts. Anyway...

38
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,175
I couldn't go back
to sleep last night.

39
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,052
So, what did you dream?

40
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,499
Forget it, Tina.

41
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,576
The point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while.

42
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,815
It's no biggie.

43
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,498
Next time you're having one,
just tell yourself...

44
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,212
That's all it is
right while you're having it.

45
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,819
Once you do that,
you wake right up.

46
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,056
At least, it works for me.

47
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,774
Did you have a nightmare, too?

48
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,537
Maybe we're going
to have a big earthquake.

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,810
They say things get
really weird just before.

50
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,010
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

51
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,608
When my mom said she was taking
off for two days, I almost died.

52
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,732
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

53
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,091
I can't believe his mother' s
letting him spend the night.

54
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,337
Right, well...she's not exactly.

55
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,095
See, I got this cousin
who lives near the airport.

56
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,414
It's OK for me
to stay with him.

57
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,770
And I got this
sound effects tape from Rod...

58
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,653
Hello, Mom?

59
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,532
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

60
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,572
Yeah, noisy as usual.

61
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,418
Glad we don't live here, huh?

62
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,337
Aunt Eunice says hello.

63
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,251
I'll call you in the morning.

64
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,779
Yeah, sure...

65
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,650
Just some kids drag racing
outside, I think, Mom.

66
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,338
Listen, Mom. I gotta go.

67
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,132
I think there's been
an accident out front.

68
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,698
All right, I'll call the police.

69
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,209
I'll call the police!

70
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,615
Just some neighbours having
a fight, I guess.

71
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,729
I'm fine.

72
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,088
I'll call you in the morning.

73
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,089
It worked like a charm.

74
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,448
Smooth.

75
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,569
Jesus.

76
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,937
See? I told you
you'd be feeling better.

77
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,649
All day long I've been seeing
that guy's weird face...

78
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,896
And hearing those fingernails.

79
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,614
Fingernails?

80
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,378
That's amazing you saying that.

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,458
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

82
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,979
What did you dream?

83
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,775
I dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater.

84
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,849
What about the fingernails?

85
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,256
He scraped his fingernails
along things.

86
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,610
Actually, they were more like
finger-Knives...

87
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,890
Something he made himself.

88
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,295
But they made a horrible sound.

89
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,569
It was like...

90
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,769
You dreamed
about the same creep I did.

91
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,973
That's impossible.

92
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,936
What?

93
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,778
Nothing.

94
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,050
There's something out there,
isn't there?

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,693
I didn't hear anything.

96
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,856
I heard something.

97
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,210
I'm going to punch out
your lights, whoever you are.

98
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,208
Kitty, kitty.

99
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,539
Chow, chow, chow?

100
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,333
It's Rod Lane
bringing Lantz down...

101
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,655
Just three yards
from the goal line!

102
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,248
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild!

103
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,574
What the hell
are you doing here?

104
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,533
Came to make up. No big deal.

105
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,536
Your mom home?

106
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,697
Of course. What's that?

107
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,855
Intense, huh?

108
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,210
What's going on here,
an orgy or something?

109
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,058
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

110
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,614
It's just
a sleep-Over date, Rod.

111
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,493
Tina and me.
Glen was just leaving.

112
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,729
Did you see his face?

113
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,616
Your mom ain't home, is she?

114
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,810
Me and Tina
got stuff to discuss.

115
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,097
We got her mother' s bed.

116
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,653
You guys got the rest.

117
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,293
I think we should
get out of here.

118
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,014
You guys are going
to hang around, right?

119
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,973
Don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

120
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,091
Please, Nancy?

121
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,331
Glen, not now.

122
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,654
We're here for Tina now,
not ourselves.

123
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,608
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare anyway?

124
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,618
Because he was scary,
that's why!

125
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,254
Morality sucks.

126
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,095
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

127
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,972
You feel better now?

128
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,011
Jungle man fix Jane.

129
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,935
No more fights?

130
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,175
No more fights.

131
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,730
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

132
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,609
When did you have a nightmare?

133
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,810
Guys can have nightmares, too,
you know.

134
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,408
You ain't got a corner
on the market.

135
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,210
Who do you think you are?

136
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,093
Whoever you are.

137
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,859
Somebody there?

138
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,573
Who the hell is that?

139
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,135
Shit.

140
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,535
Please, God...

141
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,730
This...

142
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,736
Is God.

143
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,615
Watch this.

144
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,772
Nancy! Open the door!

145
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,848
Rod, help me!

146
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,218
Help me, Rod!

147
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,529
Who did this? I'll kill you!

148
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,218
Who did this?

149
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,570
You scared me!

150
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,019
What have you got?

151
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,295
Her name was Tina Gray.
It was her home.

152
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,933
F ather abandoned, 10 years ago.

153
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,970
Mother' s in Vegas
with a boyfriend.

154
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,055
We're trying to reach her now.

155
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,659
What's the coroner got?

156
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,055
Something like a razor
was the weapon...

157
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,216
But nothing was found
at the scene.

158
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,456
It looks like
the victim's boyfriend.

159
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,490
Lieutenant, where is she?

160
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,655
I put her in your office.

161
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,099
His name's Rod Lane.

162
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,573
He's a musician type.

163
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,339
He's been arrested for drugs,
brawling.

164
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,178
Terrific. What the hell was she
doing there?

165
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,130
She lived there.

166
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,014
I don't mean her.

167
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,131
I mean you.

168
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,377
What was she doing there?

169
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,570
Hello to you, too, Donald.

170
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,736
Marge. OK.

171
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,654
How you doing, baby?

172
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,614
I'm OK, Dad.

173
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,537
Look, I don't want to get
into this now.

174
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,979
God knows you need time.

175
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,419
But I sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing...

176
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,294
Shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night...

177
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,536
Especially a lunatic
delinquent like Lane.

178
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,220
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

179
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,012
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

180
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,770
Apparently,
he was crazy jealous.

181
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,016
Nancy said they'd had a fight.

182
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,732
It wasn't that serious.

183
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,374
Maybe you don't think
murder is serious.

184
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,060
How can you say I don't
take her death seriously?

185
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,491
Look, all I meant...

186
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,855
Was that their fights
weren't that serious.

187
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,096
You know Tina dreamed
this was going to happen.

188
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,539
What?

189
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:29,338
She'd had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her.

190
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,248
That's why we were there, Mom.

191
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,779
She just didn't want
to sleep alone.

192
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,692
Police say the victim,
1 5-Year-Old Christina Gray...

193
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,256
Had quarrelled earlier
with her boyfriend Rod Lane.

194
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,894
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

195
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,339
The murder weapon...

196
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,530
A straight razor or similar
sharp object, has not yet...

197
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,735
Where do you think you're going?

198
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,213
To school.

199
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,410
Honey, you were tossing and
turning all night last night.

200
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,576
You have no business
going to school today.

201
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,258
I've got to go to school,
Mother.

202
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,893
Otherwise, I'll sit up there
and go crazy.

203
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,658
Did you sleep?

204
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,693
I'll sleep in study hall.

205
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,653
I'd rather keep busy.

206
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,532
Right home after?

207
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,218
Right home after.

208
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,849
See you.

209
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,892
I'm not going to hurt you!

210
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,578
They're going
to kill me for sure.

211
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,531
Nobody's going to kill you.

212
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,010
Did you do it?

213
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,609
I never touched her.

214
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,856
You were screaming like crazy.

215
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,732
There was somebody else there.

216
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,010
The door was locked
from your side!

217
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,256
Don't look at me
like I'm some fucking fruitcake!

218
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,859
I'm warning you!

219
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,972
Just move away from her, son.

220
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,012
Real easy, like your ass
depended on it.

221
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,368
Hold it!

222
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,139
Jesus Christ!

223
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,689
Hold it right there!

224
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,378
Watch it!

225
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,330
I'm cool!

226
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,290
I got him.

227
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,250
On the ground! Now!

228
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,608
Come on! Get down!

229
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,378
Lieutenant, look at this!
A switchblade!

230
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,014
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her, Nancy!

231
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,414
Daddy?

232
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,417
You used me.

233
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,178
What the hell were you doing...

234
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,653
Going to school today for
anyway?

235
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,448
Let go of my arm!

236
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,289
What is seen
is not always what is real.

237
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,658
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating...

238
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,737
In nature, perhaps inside human
nature itself, that was rotten.

239
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,136
" A canker," as he put it.

240
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,615
Of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

241
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,815
And to his mother' s lies was to
continually probe and dig.

242
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,579
Just like the gravediggers...

243
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,817
Always trying to get
beneath the surface.

244
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,259
The same is true
in a different way...

245
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,256
In Julius Caesar.

246
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,574
John, will you go ahead, please?

247
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,255
"In the most high
and palmy state of Rome...

248
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,017
A little ere
the mightiest Julius fell.

249
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,459
The grave stood tenantless...

250
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,571
And the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber...

251
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,418
In the Roman streets.

252
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,259
As stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood...

253
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,575
Disaster' s in the sun
and the moist air...

254
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,612
Upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands..."

255
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,697
"Oh, God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell...

256
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,497
And count myself
a king of infinite space...

257
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,330
Were it not
that I have bad dreams."

258
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,373
Where's your pass?

259
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,650
Screw your pass.

260
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,939
Hey, Nancy!

261
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,177
No running in the hallway.

262
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,253
Who are you?

263
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,734
Gonna get you.

264
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,728
It's only a dream!

265
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,249
Come to Freddy.

266
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,813
God damn you!

267
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,378
OK! OK! Thompson!

268
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,139
I'll call your mother.

269
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,296
Everything is all right now.

270
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,614
Come on. Sit down.

271
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,213
I'm OK.

272
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,170
I'm fine.

273
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,449
You sure?

274
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,333
I'll go straight home.

275
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,052
You'll need a hall pass.

276
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,650
Back to work.

277
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,248
And then what happened?

278
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,497
I told you.

279
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,180
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

280
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,574
Under the covers with her.

281
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,214
How could somebody be under
the covers with you guys...

282
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,614
Without you knowing about it?

283
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,049
How the fuck do I know?

284
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,899
I don't expect you
to believe me anyway.

285
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,099
What did he look like?

286
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,772
Did you get a look at him?

287
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,689
Then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

288
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,371
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

289
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,536
And you didn't get a look
at him?

290
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,493
I couldn't even see the fucker.

291
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,373
You could just see...

292
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,297
Cuts happening...

293
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,455
All at once.

294
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,892
What do you mean all at once?

295
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,856
It was as if
there were four razors...

296
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,938
Cutting her at the same time...

297
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,573
But invisible ones.

298
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,013
You know, I probably
could have saved her...

299
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,619
If I'd have moved sooner.

300
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,897
But I thought it was
just another nightmare...

301
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,375
Like the one I had
the night before.

302
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,615
There was this guy.

303
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,497
He had knives for fingers.

304
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,972
You think I did it?

305
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,938
One...two...

306
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,052
Freddy's coming for you.

307
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,772
Three...four...

308
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,290
Better lock your door.

309
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,297
Five...six...

310
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,969
Grab your crucifix.

311
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,818
Seven...eight...

312
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,219
Gonna stay up late.

313
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,217
Nine...ten...

314
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,652
Never sleep...again.

315
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,696
What, Mother?

316
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,731
Don't fall asleep in there.

317
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,009
You could drown, you know.

318
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,778
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

319
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,219
It happens all the time.

320
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,092
I've heated up
some warm milk for you, honey.

321
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,495
Warm milk?

322
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,450
Gross.

323
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,176
Help!

324
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,289
Hold on, baby!

325
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,773
Mom!

326
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,690
I'm OK.

327
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,618
-You're OK?
-I'm OK.

328
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,174
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

329
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,610
I just slipped getting out
of the tub, Mom.

330
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,934
But I told you...

331
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,176
Hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

332
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,131
I know, but I'm OK, Mother.

333
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,818
I'm sorry for scaring you.

334
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,257
I'll turn down your bed.

335
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,098
I'll get my pyjamas on.

336
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,611
...the act of
bodily dismemberment.

337
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,217
I'm sorry.
I saw your light was on.

338
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,773
I thought I'd see how you were.

339
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,334
Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street.

340
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,575
Will you shut up and let me in?

341
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,214
Did you ever stand on a trellis
in your bare feet?

342
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,900
Get inside before
somebody sees you.

343
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,339
I hit my head.

344
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,291
Gotta be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

345
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,930
If you don't mind.

346
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,696
So, I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

347
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,538
Yeah, I guess I did.

348
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,696
You haven't slept yet, have you?

349
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,651
Not really.

350
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,577
What did you do to your arm?

351
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,975
I burned it in English class.

352
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,695
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

353
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,896
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

354
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,373
Slept like a rock.

355
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,092
Do you believe that people...

356
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,131
Can dream about
what's going to happen?

357
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,490
No.

358
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,099
Do you believe in the bogeyman?

359
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,699
No.

360
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,378
Rod killed Tina,
and you know that.

361
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,492
I've got a crazy favour
to ask you.

362
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,172
It's nothing hard or anything.

363
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,169
I'm gonna go and look
for somebody...

364
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,373
And I want you to stand...
like a sort of a guard, OK?

365
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,495
Now, you can't mess up.

366
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,019
A lot might depend on this.

367
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,812
I won't screw up.

368
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,453
Turn off the light.

369
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,491
Here's what we're going to do.

370
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,939
It's dark in here.

371
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,449
And it's not
what you're thinking.

372
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,653
Are you still watching?

373
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,533
Yeah. So?

374
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,615
I'm just checking.

375
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,253
Watch out!

376
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,610
Watch out!

377
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,890
Wake up!

378
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,293
Are you there?

379
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,853
I'm here.

380
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,816
Nancy, help me, please.

381
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,089
Save me from...

382
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,369
Freddy!

383
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,573
This is just a dream.

384
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,815
This isn't real.

385
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,293
This is just a dream.

386
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,012
He isn't real.

387
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,771
Glen, you bastard.

388
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,174
What did I do?

389
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,450
I just
asked you to do one thing...

390
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,571
Just stay awake and watch me...

391
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,375
Just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

392
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,728
And what did you do?

393
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,532
You shit.

394
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,809
You fell asleep.

395
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,296
Oh, shit.

396
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,978
Hurry.

397
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,615
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

398
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,810
Are you OK?

399
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,738
Yeah. It was just
a little dream, that's all.

400
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,976
I'm going right back to sleep.

401
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,091
Call me if you need anything.

402
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,655
You mind telling me
what's going on?

403
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,253
Just come on.

404
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,889
Garcia, I've got to see
Rod Lane again.

405
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,459
You know,
I took the night shift...

406
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,332
So I could get
some peace and quiet.

407
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,495
It's urgent!

408
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,378
We have reason to believe
that there might be...

409
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,138
Something very strange
going on here.

410
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,693
Got no argument with that.

411
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,378
What are you doing here?

412
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,819
There's an unsolved murder...

413
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,453
And I don't like
unsolved murders...

414
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,616
Especially ones that
my daughter' s mix ed up in.

415
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,934
What are you doing here?

416
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,652
At this hour,
you should be home in bed.

417
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,293
I just want to see if he's OK.

418
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,331
Nancy, take my word for it.

419
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,813
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

420
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,009
He's not going anywhere.

421
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,698
Just go down and look at him.

422
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,329
Please, Daddy.

423
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,494
All right.

424
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,736
Garcia, give me the keys.

425
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,179
Right.

426
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,490
Where the hell
did I put the keys?

427
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,019
Help! Help!

428
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,256
Jesus!

429
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,608
Cut him down.

430
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,494
Grab his legs.

431
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,258
I got him.

432
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,337
Grab his back, would you?

433
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,449
Lower him.

434
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,214
Ashes to ashes...

435
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,614
Dust to dust.

436
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,049
May God be
with this young man's soul.

437
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,855
His life and his death...

438
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,938
Attest to
the scriptures' warning...

439
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,336
That he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

440
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,657
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

441
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:23,571
That we judge not,
lest we be judged.

442
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,373
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

443
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,338
Time to go, honey.

444
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,056
Hop in.

445
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,171
The killer' s still loose,
you know?

446
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,531
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina?

447
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,570
Who?

448
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,931
I don't know who he is...

449
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,973
But he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

450
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,457
And a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

451
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,175
And he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

452
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,050
You better keep her home
for a few days...

453
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,533
Until she really gets
over the shock of this.

454
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,979
I've got something better.

455
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,330
I'm going to get her some help.

456
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,495
I don't see why you couldn't
just give me a pill...

457
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,735
To keep me from dreaming.

458
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,771
Everyone's got to dream,
young lady.

459
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,256
If you don't dream, you go.

460
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,369
All set.

461
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,537
Please, Nancy, trust us.

462
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,572
It's not you I don't trust.
It's just...

463
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,135
Let's do it.

464
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,413
Thank you, nurse.

465
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,938
How long has this been going on?

466
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,176
Since the murders.

467
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,177
She was fine before that.

468
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,609
Now she thinks
her dreams are real.

469
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,176
There's no sign
of pathology in her EEG.

470
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,734
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

471
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,930
Who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

472
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,175
She's asleep now.

473
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,211
Thank God.

474
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,168
What the hell are dreams anyway?

475
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,335
Mysteries.

476
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,610
Incredible body hocus-Pocus.

477
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,334
The truth is we still
don't know what they are...

478
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,655
Or where they come from.

479
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,053
She's going into deep sleep now.

480
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,698
Heart rate is a little high.

481
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,697
It's just due to anxiety.

482
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,856
Otherwise, she's nicely relax ed.

483
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,777
All signs are normal.

484
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,175
She could dream at any time now.

485
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,611
Beta waves are slowing.

486
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,973
She's into REMs now.

487
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,818
She's definitely dreaming now.

488
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,738
It's a good one, too.

489
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,691
Typical dream parameter.

490
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,769
A nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six.

491
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,892
She's about three.

492
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,979
Doctor, what's she doing now?

493
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,250
Is she asleep or awake?

494
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,655
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

495
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,775
What's she doing?

496
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,128
I don't know.

497
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,454
Is she dreaming?

498
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,649
Nancy, it's Mom!

499
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,570
What?

500
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,928
Her hair.

501
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,936
Ex cuse me.

502
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,175
This'll help you sleep.

503
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,369
Oh, my God, her arm!

504
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,455
Get something.

505
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,411
What happened, baby?

506
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,973
What happened?

507
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,813
It's OK.

508
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,497
I brought something out
from my dream.

509
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,417
Where did you get that?

510
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,295
I grabbed it off his head.

511
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,410
She said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream.

512
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,973
No, I'm not crazy.

513
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,568
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

514
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,850
I don't know where
she really found it.

515
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,299
I gotta go.

516
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,652
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?

517
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,772
You know the doctor says
you have to sleep, or...

518
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,856
I'll go even crazier?

519
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,538
I don't think you're crazy.

520
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,935
And stop drinking
that damn coffee.

521
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,495
So, did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

522
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,056
I threw that filthy thing away.

523
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,533
I don't know
where you really found it...

524
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,615
Or what you're trying to prove.

525
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,890
What I learned
in the dream clinic...

526
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,295
That's what I'm trying
to prove, Mother.

527
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,096
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

528
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,814
It's this guy.

529
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,738
He's after us in our dreams.

530
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,093
That's just not reality, Nancy.

531
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,539
It's real, Mama.

532
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,059
Feel it.

533
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,738
Give me that damn thing.

534
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,691
It even has his name
written in it.

535
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,731
Fred Krueger, Mom.

536
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,728
Do you know who that is, Mother?

537
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,293
Because if you do,
you better tell me...

538
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,773
Because he's after me now.

539
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,336
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

540
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,610
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

541
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,298
Feel better?

542
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,536
You call this feeling better?

543
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,694
Or maybe I should grab that
bottle and veg out with you.

544
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,017
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

545
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,211
Fred Krueger
can't come after you, Nancy.

546
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,295
He's dead.

547
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,933
Believe me.

548
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,049
I know.

549
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,570
You knew about him
all this time...

550
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,409
And you've been acting like
it was something I made up?

551
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,735
Nancy, you're sick.

552
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,088
There's something wrong
with you.

553
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,609
You're imagining things.

554
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,139
You'll feel better
when you sleep.

555
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,649
It's just as simple as that.

556
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,815
Screw sleep!

557
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,095
It's just a nightmare.

558
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,494
That's enough.

559
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,174
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

560
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,053
And if you can't do that,
you sleep.

561
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,136
I used to.

562
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,409
Not any more.

563
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,178
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

564
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,488
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

565
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,090
So if you have a nightmare,
for instance, like falling.

566
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,175
Right.

567
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,293
Well, instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

568
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,459
You say, "I'm going
to make up my mind...

569
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,013
That I fall
into a magic world."

570
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,497
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

571
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,214
They get all their art
and literature from dreams.

572
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,216
Just wake up and write it down.

573
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,819
Dream skills.

574
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,694
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

575
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,219
They turn their back on it.

576
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,012
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.

577
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,212
But what happens
if they don't do that?

578
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,219
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

579
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,329
Great.

580
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,218
" Booby Traps & Improvised
Anti-Personnel Devices"?

581
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,538
What are you reading that for?

582
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,094
I'm into survival.

583
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,213
See ya.

584
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,490
You're starting to scare me.

585
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,418
Oh, gross.

586
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,576
Mother!

587
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,015
What's with the bars?

588
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,809
Security.

589
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,456
Security from what?

590
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,138
Not from what, from whom.

591
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,172
Come down to the cellar with me,
and I'll tell you.

592
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,732
You want to know
who Fred Krueger was?

593
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,374
He was
a filthy child murderer...

594
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,378
Who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighbourhood.

595
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,774
Kids we all knew.

596
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,576
Oh, Mom.

597
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,976
It drove us crazy when we
didn't know who it was...

598
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,536
But it was even worse
after they caught him.

599
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,899
Did they put him away?

600
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,932
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

601
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,176
But somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant...

602
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,255
In the right place...

603
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,893
And Krueger was free
just like that.

604
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,739
What did you do, Mother?

605
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,296
A bunch of us parents
tracked him down...

606
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,297
After they let him out.

607
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,139
We found him in
an old abandoned boiler room...

608
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,297
Where he used to take his kids.

609
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,217
Go on.

610
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,218
We took gasoline...

611
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,169
We poured it
all around the place...

612
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,497
And made a trail of it
out the door...

613
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,498
Then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

614
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,172
But he can't get you now.

615
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,451
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

616
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,577
I even took his knives.

617
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,855
So it's OK now.

618
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,574
You can sleep.

619
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,536
Oh, hi, how you doing?

620
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,490
Fine.

621
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,212
Stand by your window
so I can see you.

622
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,853
You sound a million miles away.

623
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,176
That's much better.

624
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,417
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

625
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,496
You look like the Prisoner
of Zenda or something.

626
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,019
How long's it been
since you slept?

627
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,971
It's coming up
on the seventh day.

628
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,897
It's OK. I checked Guinness.

629
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,055
The record's 1 1 .

630
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,695
Listen, Glen, I know who he is.

631
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,855
Who?

632
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,810
The killer.

633
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,373
-You do?
-Yes.

634
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,651
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

635
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,611
Why would anybody
want to kill me?

636
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,616
Don't ask.

637
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,129
Just give me some help
nailing the guy...

638
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,454
When I bring him out.

639
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,808
Bring him out of what?

640
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,373
My dream.

641
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,934
How do you plan to do that?

642
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,413
Just like I did the hat.

643
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,815
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

644
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,170
Wait a minute.

645
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,779
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

646
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,970
If I can't,
then you can all relax...

647
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,091
Because it's just a case
of me being nuts.

648
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,972
I can save you the trouble.

649
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,613
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

650
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,729
I love you anyway.

651
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,498
Good.

652
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,611
Then you won't mind
cold-Cocking this guy...

653
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,889
When I bring him out.

654
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,896
What?

655
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,089
You heard me.

656
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,699
I grab the guy in my dream.

657
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,697
You see me struggling,
so you wake me up.

658
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,812
We both come out, you whack
the fucker, and we got him.

659
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,532
Are you crazy?
Hit him with what?

660
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,775
You're the jock.

661
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,811
You have a baseball bat
or something.

662
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,899
Just meet me at my porch
at midnight.

663
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,373
Oh, and meanwhile...

664
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,819
Meanwhile?

665
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:15,014
Whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.

666
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,009
Midnight?

667
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,738
Oh, man.

668
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,452
Midnight.

669
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,093
Baseball bats and bogeymen.

670
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,975
Beautiful.

671
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,335
Honey?

672
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,372
How can you listen
to television...

673
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,377
And hear your records
at the same time?

674
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,411
Oh, I wasn't listening
to the tube, Ma.

675
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,178
Just watching.

676
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,575
Miss Nude America
is going to be on tonight.

677
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,134
How can you hear
what she's going to say?

678
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,852
Who cares what she says?

679
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,448
Don't be such a smart guy.

680
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,218
I want you to go to bed.

681
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,535
It's almost midnight.

682
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,537
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with...

683
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,809
These last few days.

684
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,770
I will, Mom.

685
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,855
You guys turning in?

686
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,459
Pretty soon.

687
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,933
Now get to bed.

688
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,972
It's over now, baby.

689
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,136
The nightmare's over.

690
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,215
Please.

691
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,852
You shouldn't stare.

692
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,211
You know what I think?

693
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,616
I think that kid
is some kind of lunatic.

694
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,858
You shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

695
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,572
You mean those bars?

696
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,569
Marge is just being cautious
with her being all alone...

697
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:43,579
And Nancy
acting so nervous lately.

698
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,577
I don't care what you say.

699
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,658
I don't want that kid hanging
around with our son any more.

700
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,890
Glen, answer the phone.

701
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,052
Just a minute.

702
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,092
It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

703
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,051
About what?

704
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,296
What's this about, Nancy?

705
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,857
Just a minute.

706
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,811
She says it's private.

707
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,693
Very private and very important.

708
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,889
Give me that.

709
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,329
Glen's asleep. You'll have
to talk to him tomorrow.

710
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,291
You've just got to be firm
with these kids.

711
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,330
Let's go.

712
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,939
As a matter of fact...

713
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,334
Damn.

714
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,893
Don't fall asleep.

715
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,938
Oh, brilliant.

716
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,090
What if Glen tries to call?

717
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,056
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

718
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,618
My boyfriend.

719
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,736
Mom!

720
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,250
Locked, locked, locked, locked.

721
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,018
I locked it all up.

722
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,937
I had to.

723
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,335
Nancy, you are going
to get some sleep tonight...

724
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,734
If it kills me.

725
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,693
Give me the key, Mother.

726
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,574
I can't. I don't
even have it on me. See?

727
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,769
Damn it!

728
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,015
It is now 1 2 midnight...

729
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:29,337
And this is station KRGR
leaving the air.

730
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,735
Help, Mom!

731
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,773
Come on, Frank.
I'll give you a hand.

732
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,770
You won't need
a stretcher up there.

733
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,219
You'll need a mop.

734
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,698
Don't tell me it's another one.

735
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,811
Lieutenant Thompson,
I'm sorry to wake you...

736
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,613
But I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

737
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,695
And I knew
this is your neighbourhood...

738
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,253
So I thought I'd better
call you right away.

739
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,292
The coroner' s upstairs now,
but I don't think that he's...

740
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,258
Oh, my God.

741
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,131
I'll get him right away.

742
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,978
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

743
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,811
Hi, Daddy.

744
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,135
I know what happened.

745
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,411
I haven't been upstairs yet.

746
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,735
But you know he's dead, right?

747
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,657
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

748
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,698
Listen, Daddy,
I've got a proposition for you.

749
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,697
Listen very carefully, please.

750
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,976
I'm going to go and get
the guy who did it...

751
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,898
And I want you to be there
to arrest him...

752
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,169
When I bring him out, OK?

753
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,416
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

754
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,338
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy...

755
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,371
And only I can get him.

756
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,775
It's my nightmare he comes to.

757
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,858
Just come here
and break the door down...

758
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,335
In exactly 20 minutes.

759
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,495
Can you do that?

760
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,099
Yeah, sure.

761
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,451
That'll be exactly
half past midnight.

762
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:20,255
Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

763
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,893
Honey, you just do that.

764
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:22,930
Get yourself some sleep.

765
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,334
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

766
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,813
But you'll be here to catch him?

767
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,896
Lieutenant, they're waiting
for you upstairs.

768
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,658
Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

769
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,611
You just get yourself
some rest...please?

770
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,809
Deal?

771
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,249
I love you, sweetheart.

772
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,929
Go outside
and watch my daughter' s house.

773
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,016
If you see anything funny,
call me.

774
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,414
Anything funny, like what?

775
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,655
I don't know.

776
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,692
One thing for sure, I don't
want her coming over here.

777
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,539
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

778
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,253
What the hell did that,
Lieutenant?

779
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,608
I don't know.

780
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,651
What has the coroner got to say?

781
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,658
He's in the john puking
since he saw it.

782
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:25,453
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

783
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,377
Just get some sleep, Mom.

784
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,138
It's going to be OK.

785
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,979
I was just trying
to protect you.

786
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,568
I didn't see how much
you needed to know.

787
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,016
You face things.

788
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,813
That's your nature.

789
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,373
That's your gift...

790
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,857
But sometime you have to
turn away, too.

791
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,578
I love you.

792
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,537
I love you, too, baby.

793
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,219
Night.

794
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,494
OK, Krueger.

795
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,216
We play on your court.

796
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,290
And now I lay me down to sleep.

797
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,536
I pray
the Lord my soul to keep...

798
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,493
And if I die before I wake...

799
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,817
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

800
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,098
Countdown mode.

801
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,256
Ten minutes and counting.

802
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:20,052
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

803
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,818
They turn their back on it.

804
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,771
Take away it's energy,
and it disappears.

805
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,538
What happens if they
don't do that?

806
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,810
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

807
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,614
You dreamed about
the same creep I did.

808
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,049
Gonna get you.

809
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:02,974
I'm here!

810
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,529
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

811
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,019
Shit.

812
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,049
Come on, Krueger!

813
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,011
Follow me!

814
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,458
Damn it!

815
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,969
Where are you?

816
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,091
Where are you, Krueger?

817
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,412
I know you're here.

818
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,498
Final 10 seconds.

819
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,576
Nine, eight, seven, six...

820
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,530
Bitch.

821
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,774
I got you now!

822
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,849
I'm crazy after all.

823
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,016
Come on, Krueger!

824
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,334
Take it down!

825
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,939
Come and get me!

826
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,456
Help!

827
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,059
I've got him! Hey, Daddy!

828
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,091
I've got him trapped!

829
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,778
Help! Where are you?

830
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,936
Everything's gonna be all right!

831
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,652
Everything's under control!

832
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:34,135
Get my dad, you asshole!

833
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,888
Come on!

834
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,453
He's in here!

835
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,298
Don't let him kill me, too!

836
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,773
Come on, Freddy.

837
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,219
Can't you catch me?

838
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,260
I'm going to split you in two.

839
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,496
Daddy, help me, please!

840
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,611
Maybe I better go
tell the Lieutenant.

841
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,016
I'll kill you slow.

842
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,739
Where are you?

843
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,936
Daddy, I did it!

844
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,049
Please hurry!

845
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,417
Where are you?

846
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,412
Parker, I need some help here!

847
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,814
OK, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

848
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,658
Let's go.
Al, Tim, get over here.

849
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,697
Get you out.

850
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,299
Open this door!

851
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,297
Watch yourself. I got it.

852
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,694
It's Krueger!

853
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,139
Get out of the way.

854
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,337
This way, guys. Come down here.

855
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,292
Oh, my God.

856
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,614
Nancy, what the hell
is going on?

857
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,776
Parker, get up here!

858
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,049
We got a fire up here, too.

859
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,978
We're on our way up.

860
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,096
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

861
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,938
He's after Mother!

862
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,257
Watch out! He's under there!

863
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,257
Now do you believe me?

864
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,611
They've got the fires out
downstairs.

865
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,492
Everything OK up here?

866
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:08,338
I'm OK.

867
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,376
You go downstairs.

868
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,775
I'll be there in a minute.

869
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,177
Lieutenant,
is everything all right?

870
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,653
I don't know.

871
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,850
I know you're there, Freddy.

872
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:03,256
You think you was
gonna get away from me?

873
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,655
I know you too well now,
Freddy.

874
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,293
Now you die.

875
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,378
It's too late, Krueger.

876
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,856
I know the secret now.

877
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,971
This is just a dream.

878
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,216
You're not alive.

879
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:25,652
This whole thing
is just a dream.

880
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,696
I want
my mother and friends again.

881
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,572
You what?

882
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:36,820
I take back
every bit of energy I gave you.

883
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,532
You're nothing.

884
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,529
You're shit.

885
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:00,089
It's bright.

886
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:04,532
It's going to burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

887
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,139
Feeling better?

888
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,490
Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

889
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,655
They say you've bottomed out...

890
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:12,294
When you can't remember
the night before.

891
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,217
You know, baby,
I'm going to stop drinking.

892
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,332
I just don't feel like it
any more.

893
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:19,576
Did I keep you awake last night?

894
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,214
You look a little bit peaked.

895
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,648
I guess I just slept heavy.

896
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,576
I'll see you.

897
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,689
See you.

898
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,179
Hi, everybody.

899
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,449
You believe this fog?

900
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,538
I believe anything is possible.

901
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,214
Looking good, girl.

902
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,209
What happened?

903
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,413
What's going on?

904
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,929
Hey, I'm not doing this.

905
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,890
Let us out!

906
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,850
I'm not doing this.

907
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,493
What's going on with the window?

908
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,292
No! Mother!

909
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,175
What's going on?

910
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,692
One, two...

911
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:13,495
Freddy's coming for you.

912
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,929
Three, four...

913
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:23,530
Better lock your door.

914
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,776
Five, six...

915
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,579
Grab your crucifix.

916
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,531
Seven, eight...

917
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:33,493
Gonna stay up late.

918
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,736
Nine, ten...

919
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,012
Never sleep again.
