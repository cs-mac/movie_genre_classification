00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,951
<i>Previously on Dark Matter...</i>

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:04,281
I've got all your memories in my head,
I know it.

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,187
I'm Jace Corso.

4
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:07,495
No, I'm Jace Corso.

5
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:08,745
I promise I will not rest

6
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:10,570
until I've done
everything I can to save you.

7
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:12,871
I'm programmed with various
recreational subroutines,

8
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:14,080
do you like fun?

9
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:15,345
Wait!

10
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,513
This runs counter to your programming.
Fun remember?

11
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:20,694
<i>The search continues
for Emperor Ishida's murderer</i>

12
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>purported to be his own son,
Crown Prince Ishida Ryo.</i>

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,619
We just murdered 10 thousand
innocent civilians.

14
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,372
You Draves?

15
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,297
Maybe.

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,924
I'm looking for someone.

17
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,641
Yeah?

18
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,077
Who?

19
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:05,109
He's the leader of
the Procyon Insurrection.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,098
They call him The General.

21
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,184
What's so funny?

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,436
He's the most wanted man in the galaxy.

23
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,772
What makes you think I know where he is?

24
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,441
Well he's been using
Arrakis Sadr as his base,

25
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,828
and since this is
the closest station to that planet,

26
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,599
it's a good bet his supply line
runs through here.

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,118
And to keep below the radar,
he has to be doing business

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,120
with the local criminal element.

29
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,407
And you're it, no offense.

30
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,811
And I hope your not offended
if I tell you you're insane.

31
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,603
Do you know how many people he's killed?

32
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,369
I've got an interesting
business proposition for him.

33
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:41,672
You put me in touch with him
and I'll make it worth your while;

34
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,458
Ten thousand bars transferred
directly into your account.

35
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,611
I can do better.

36
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,780
Twelve thousand.

37
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,331
You misunderstood me.

38
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,745
I said I can do better.

39
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,169
What's going on here?

40
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,492
Griffin Jones.

41
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:59,340
Wanted for smuggling, piracy, murder.

42
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:00,975
It's quite the rap sheet.

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,029
And a hell of a bounty to go with it.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,000
1x08 - <i>Episode 8</i>

45
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,859
What part of "We need him alive"
didn't you understand?

46
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,873
Sorry, boss.

47
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,693
What are you doing?

48
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:31,123
I was surprising you with a hug.

49
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,667
Why?

50
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,672
I don't know, I thought you'd enjoy it.

51
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,006
Do I look like someone
who enjoys surprise hugs?

52
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,343
In retrospect no, not at all.

53
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,145
Let's keep it professional, ok?

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,380
Okay.

55
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:50,321
How's she doing?

56
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:53,631
The corrector nanites in her body
are damn impressive.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,123
I'd say she's about 85% healed.

58
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:57,425
So, close enough.

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,709
We gonna bring her online?

60
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,044
Not yet.

61
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,046
She'll be good to go by day's end.

62
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,715
But we're twenty minutes
out from the space station.

63
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:05,800
We gonna shuttle in?

64
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,468
No, we'll dock.

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,937
Well how're we gonna dock
without the android?

66
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,389
I'll take us in.

67
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,907
Just giving everyone a heads up.

68
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,159
We're about to dock.

69
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:40,835
If you're looking for a seat belt,

70
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,326
you're out of luck.

71
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:43,587
Of course not.

72
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,924
I was just - adjusting my seat.

73
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,432
Here we go...

74
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:40,738
And we're docked.

75
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,088
Never doubted you.

76
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:51,906
Okay, supply run.

77
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,407
One, you're on infirmary restock.

78
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,742
You got your list?

79
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:55,659
Got it.

80
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,628
Four, seeds to keep hydroponics going.

81
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,213
Five, you've got gak...

82
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:02,466
Connectors, adapters,
and three-twelve sprockets.

83
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,535
That's what I said.

84
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:05,837
Three, you've got juice.

85
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,534
Make sure that...

86
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:08,889
Where the hell's Three?

87
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,174
In his room.

88
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:11,891
He says he's not coming.

89
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,512
I'll get him.

90
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,180
Give him some time.

91
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,609
He's had enough time.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Get lost.

93
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:33,247
What's the point of knocking

94
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:35,194
if you're just going to come in anyway?

95
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,951
It's polite.

96
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,203
Are you coming?

97
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,046
Naw, I got stuff to do.

98
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:40,923
Such as?

99
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,540
Cleaning my guns.

100
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,265
Working out.

101
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,910
Cleaning my guns.

102
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:48,462
Alright, well we haven't been
off this ship in a few days.

103
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,214
Who knows when we'll get another chance.

104
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,466
Well, you have a good time.

105
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,553
You need to move on.

106
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,921
I'm thinking "moving on"
is what I've been doing all my life.

107
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:07,122
Maybe it's time I stopped,
and considered the consequences.

108
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,734
Consequences imply
that you were responsible.

109
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,742
She was relying on me.

110
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,867
I failed her.

111
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:19,212
She believed in you, with good reason.

112
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,826
You did everything you could.

113
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,131
We all owe you our lives.

114
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,312
Okay, same drill as last time.

115
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,431
We've docked under a false registration.

116
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,483
Just remember,

117
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:43,504
don't draw any unnecessary
attention to yourselves.

118
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,924
And, yes, I speak from experience.

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Think he'll come?

120
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,574
In the interest of us actually
getting some actual R&R,

121
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,810
I hope not.

122
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,277
Oh, come on.

123
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,612
You're all thinking the same thing

124
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,675
I'm just the only one
with the guts to say it.

125
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,080
Alright!

126
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,738
There he is!

127
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,660
Bring it on.

128
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:05,530
Let's do this boys!

129
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,341
Huh?

130
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,519
Okay, what's up first?

131
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,854
Shops, spa, food...

132
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,605
Food!

133
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:22,441
Spa!

134
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:25,203
Seriously, kidding, food.

135
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,155
Alright lets get some grub.

136
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:29,313
You guys go ahead.

137
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,515
I'll catch up with you.

138
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:31,365
Are you sure?

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,149
Yeah.

140
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,621
Alright knock yourself out.

141
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,982
What?

142
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,074
Aren't you going to get something to eat?

143
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,825
No, I'd rather hang with you.

144
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,077
No.

145
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:48,681
What I mean is,
I just need some time to myself okay.

146
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,702
But we'll hang out later.

147
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:52,954
Okay.

148
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:29,277
Garlic?

149
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:30,591
It's not garlic.

150
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:31,375
Parsley?

151
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:31,986
Yes.

152
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,236
Onions, mushrooms...

153
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,904
No, no, no mushrooms.

154
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,544
It's nuts?

155
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:37,657
What is that flavor?

156
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,978
Nuts.

157
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,118
Mealworms.

158
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,174
When you say mealworms,
is that one of those words

159
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,753
that sounds like something,
but means something completely different,

160
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,889
like "firearms" or "anal-geesic"?

161
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,924
It's pronounced "annal-jezik"

162
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,838
and, mealworms are worms, well larvae.

163
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,183
They're protein-rich
and a hell of a lot less expensive

164
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,613
and easier to source than beef.

165
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,429
Meh.

166
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,767
Excuse me, could I see a menu please?

167
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,752
So you're not gonna eat that?

168
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:15,805
Cheers.

169
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,143
Griffin Jones.

00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,895
Wanted for smuggling, piracy, murder.

171
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:25,698
I had one of my boys run a face recog

172
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
when you started asking around about me.

173
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,272
Curious that way.

174
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,262
Hands behind your back.

175
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,595
How do you feel?

176
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,733
Fine.

177
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,157
Why don't I remember what happened?

178
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,772
If your clone returned to its transfer pod,

179
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,556
all new memories should've been sent back

180
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:22,801
and uploaded into your temporal lobe.

181
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:24,662
Well, they weren't.

182
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,697
It seems your trip was terminated early.

183
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:30,345
No bio-mass recycling was recorded.

184
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,540
Your clone died.

185
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:34,738
Does it say how?

186
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,990
Just that we lost vital signs
at 21:34 hours

187
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,029
which triggered your early wake up.

188
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,215
Could've been an accident...

189
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,489
or natural causes.

190
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,492
What do you mean, natural causes?

191
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,418
Genetic conditions can be
transferred to the clone...

192
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:50,671
No, it wasn't that.

193
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:52,847
Put me back in.

194
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:55,641
Our policy states that
Transfer Travelers have to wait

195
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,477
thirty minutes between travels.

196
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:59,228
I don't have that kind of time.

197
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,682
It's a precautionary measure to guard
against stress-induced complications.

198
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:03,599
Come on.

199
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:04,517
Sorry.

200
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:05,601
Regulations.

201
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:09,564
Just, look, I get it.

202
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,325
You're a cog in a big machine.

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,925
Keep your head down, put in your time,

204
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:18,664
retire and hopefully you die
before the savings run out.

205
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,034
It's a solid plan, but I've gotta ask.

206
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,530
Doesn't it ever get to you?

207
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,955
I mean haven't you ever wanted to just,

208
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:28,245
once, stand up for yourself

209
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,556
and stick it to the big
faceless Corporation?

210
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:33,513
Break one of their stupid rules?

211
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,747
By letting you transfer
thirty minutes early?

212
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:41,394
For example.

213
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,336
It's your cerebral cortex.

214
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:48,845
Thank you.

215
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:02,876
Wait, wait, wait.

216
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,297
Do you know when I decided I liked you?

217
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,379
When I didn't shoot shoot you
when you tried to steal the ship?

218
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:12,896
No.

219
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,734
When you abandoned us
on that mining planet.

220
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,035
Yeah?

221
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,339
Yeah, at first,
I thought you'd screwed us over

222
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,463
and I thought, "Damn. I like this girl".

223
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,564
But then, when you came back
and you saved our asses,

224
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,960
I was like:
"Damn. I really like this girl."

225
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah, you guys, I mean.

226
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,778
You guys are great man.

227
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,729
I may not say it enough but...

228
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,646
Or at all.

229
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:39,898
Ever.

230
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,349
But you guys...

231
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,285
Hey, you!

232
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,487
What's wrong with you guys?

233
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,062
You're leaving me hanging fiver.

234
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,290
What do you mean?

235
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,018
We'll you're all... getting along.

236
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:54,420
It's weird.

237
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,330
Are you drunk?

238
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:57,382
Of course we're drunk.

239
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,342
Have a seat.

240
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,509
Here, have some, eat.

241
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:01,930
No.

242
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,659
And drink something.

243
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,303
What's the matter?

244
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,255
It's Six.

245
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,871
He's gone off the Station.

246
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:11,781
What?

247
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:12,376
What!

248
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,909
What do you mean, he's not on the Station?

249
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:14,911
Where did he go?

250
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:16,161
That bastard stole our ship!

251
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,413
No, the ship's still here.

252
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,416
And so is he, kind of.

253
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,684
Hang on a second.

254
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,969
What are you drunk?

255
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,188
Is he here, or is he not here?

256
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:29,186
He's using Transfer Transit.

257
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,059
What's Transfer Transit?

258
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,612
It's state-of-the-art travel tech.

259
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,782
<i>You get into a "transfer pod"
and input a destination.</i>

260
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:40,402
<i>The pod sequences your DNA
and maps your brain.</i>

261
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:43,155
<i>Then, that information
gets sent via subspace,</i>

262
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,426
<i>anywhere across the galaxy
where there's a receiver pod,</i>

263
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:52,330
<i>where they create a clone of you,</i>

264
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:55,584
<i>complete with your memories
and personality.</i>

265
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:59,004
<i>It's like flesh and blood 3D-printing.</i>

266
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,074
<i>But the clone has a short life span,</i>

267
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,192
<i>a few days, maybe.</i>

268
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:22,944
It has to return
to its transfer pod before that time

269
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,113
so all the new memories and experiences

270
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:28,033
can be sent back to you
before you wake up.

271
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:31,165
How the hell do you know all this?

272
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,205
I read the brochure.

273
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,687
Hang on.

274
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,458
Just go back.

275
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,627
What the hell's Transfer Transit?

276
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,526
No stop, Six would never
submit to a DNA scan.

277
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,110
Not after what happened last time.

278
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:47,246
It says all DNA profiles
are kept strictly confidential.

279
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,781
Yeah they would have to be,

280
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,783
otherwise they'd lose
a lot of business fast.

281
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,744
Still, it's risky.

282
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,447
He must've wanted to go
somewhere pretty badly.

283
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:59,267
Wherever he's going, whatever he's doing,

284
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,571
it can't be good for us.

285
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,931
You're back.

286
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,025
I am.

287
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,660
What'll it be this time?

288
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:37,029
Merchandise or more information?

289
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,333
Information.

290
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:41,696
I came in here earlier.

291
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:42,779
Yeah.

292
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,948
And I needed help finding someone.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,169
And I gave you a name
and sent you on your way.

294
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,704
That name again?

295
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,372
What?

296
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:55,175
What was the name you gave me earlier?

297
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,344
Draves.

298
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,129
Wanna write it down this time?

299
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,615
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

300
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,740
Sure.

301
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,572
See you around.

302
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,482
Not if I get it right this time.

303
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:14,456
<i>Yeah?</i>

304
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,363
Yeah, it's me.

305
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:18,581
He's on his way down.

306
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,789
Are you sure we should be
going through his stuff?

307
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,456
Pretty sure.

308
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,658
Yeah.

309
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,048
It's not right,
it's an invasion of his privacy.

310
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,034
You didn't have a problem invading
my privacy, when you stole my bullets.

311
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:33,845
That was different.

312
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,702
I thought you were dangerous.

313
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,686
Look, I didn't want to get him in trouble,

314
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,199
I just thought it was weird

315
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,676
that he was keeping something from us.

316
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:43,677
That maybe he needed our help.

317
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,261
I knew it!

318
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,932
He's been hoarding the green
not-as-crap-tastic protein bars!

319
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,394
He said we were out!

320
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,220
I got stuck eating the blue ones.

321
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,044
It tastes fishy!

322
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,865
What've you got?

323
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:05,626
Great.

324
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,385
Try "Six".

325
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:12,664
Try "lying hoarder"?

326
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,281
We can waste all day guessing.

327
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,472
We have to find a way
to bypass the password.

328
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:22,073
No way.

329
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,157
Look at it this way:
You'll be proving his innocence.

330
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:54,962
He was researching
a terrorist attack on some space station.

331
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,885
A lot of people were killed.

00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:12,889
<i>Over ten thousand lives
were lost in the attack</i>

337
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:16,860
<i>and today,
investigators released the following video.</i>

338
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:20,696
<i>Security footage uploaded to the G.A. hub
before the station's destruction</i>

339
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:25,246
<i>clearly shows one of the suspects
believed to be responsible for the bombing.</i>

340
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:29,122
<i>If you see this man,
do not attempt to apprehend him,</i>

341
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:32,578
<i>but call your nearest
G.A. detachment immediately.</i>

342
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,482
And you thought I was dangerous?

343
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:46,490
It was instinct. I'm sorry.

344
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,893
Well your instincts are terrible.
And nearly cost us a huge pay day.

345
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,345
I'll be careful this time.
I promise.

346
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:53,597
Nice and simple, right?

347
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,848
We tell him we're taking him
to The General,

348
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,768
then we capture him, alive, torture him,

349
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,587
and then we get him
to give up his real location.

350
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:02,855
What if he gets suspicious?

351
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:04,607
There's no reason for him to be.

352
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:06,609
His first clone took its memories with it.

353
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,775
As far as he knows,
we're meeting for the first time.

354
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:20,590
- You Draves?
- Maybe.

355
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,360
So what can I do for you?

356
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,542
No wait!

357
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,833
Take it easy.

358
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,027
I had nothing to do with this,
I'm just the girlfriend.

359
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,344
Like hell you are.

360
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,304
You're way out of his league.

361
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:42,973
Besides your nails
don't quite match your outfit.

362
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:46,394
They're nice and short,
ideal for handling a gun.

363
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,565
Last time I was here I missed something.

364
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,898
Not sure what it was,

365
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:54,186
but this time I'm not
gonna take any chances.

366
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,539
And that means shooting you
before you can draw.

367
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:13,902
Now, I need some information,
and a shuttle.

368
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,675
I don't believe it.

369
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,426
He couldn't have killed all those people.

370
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,927
Why, because he's nice to you?

371
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,429
You think that means anything?

372
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,097
It does seem a little hardcore.

373
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,515
Even for one of us.

374
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,517
It's a mistake.

375
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,946
It has to be.

376
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
What about Calchek?

377
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,253
He knows our histories,
maybe we should call him.

378
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,108
No it's too risky.

379
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,911
If we start asking for information

380
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,363
we should already know,
he could get suspicious.

381
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,699
And if he finds out about our memory loss,

382
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,919
he could consider us damaged goods
and end our arrangement.

383
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,423
Or worse, make a move against us.

384
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,033
Other ideas?

385
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,322
We follow Six and find out for ourselves.

386
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,463
That's a damn good idea.

387
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:59,016
We just go hang out by his pod,
wait for him to wake up,

388
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,018
make him cough up some answers.

389
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,053
I mean we use the transfer technology,

390
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,889
and see what he's up to.

391
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,724
There's no way I'm getting sealed up

392
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,726
in one of those things, all gift-wrapped

393
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:11,362
and helpless for the G.A, no fricken way.

394
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,597
I'll do it.

395
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,065
He did it for me.

396
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:15,483
With the Android out of commission,

397
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:18,044
we need you here,
you're our resident tech expert.

398
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,905
I'll go.

399
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,039
You go with him.

400
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:24,874
Hang on.

401
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,283
He, uncharacteristically,
makes a good point.

402
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,331
You're pretty damn
vulnerable lying trapped,

403
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,665
in one of those things.

404
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,750
Six respects you.

405
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:33,751
If there's any confrontation,

406
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,303
you'll be able to reason with him.

407
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,555
You have to go.

408
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,425
For the duration of your travel,

409
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:44,011
your body will remain here in cryo-sleep.

410
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,690
When your clone returns for
bio-mass recycling at the end of the trip,

411
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:50,150
its experiences
and memories will be uploaded,

412
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,074
transferred back,
and reintegrated with your own.

413
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,272
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely.

414
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,907
It's the safest way to travel.

415
00:22:56,943 --> 00:23:00,277
With your true body here,
you're never in any real danger.

416
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,830
Your clone could travel
into the center of a star,

417
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:04,949
and you'd be perfectly fine.

418
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:09,003
The possibility of any critical
complications is extremely remote.

419
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,255
What do you mean by critical complications?

420
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,123
It's barely worth mentioning.

421
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,676
There have been a handful of incidents,

422
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,962
strokes, heart attacks,
the occasional aneurysm,

423
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,130
but a causal link back to the technology

424
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,715
has never been established.

425
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,384
Well, that doesn't sound so...

426
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,636
Sold.

427
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:28,225
Excellent, let's see
when we've got a slot available...

428
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,891
How about next...

429
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,143
How about right now.

430
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:34,612
Right now?

431
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:37,607
Okay, let's get you signed up.

432
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,847
- Are you a couple?
- No.

433
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:42,968
- Is there a discount?
- Ten percent.

434
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,923
Well then yes, we are a couple.

435
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,611
Also, a good friend of ours
was in earlier today.

436
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,382
Griffin Jones.

437
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,614
We'd like to meet up with him.

438
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,221
Did he tell you where he was going?

439
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,805
No.

440
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,974
He doesn't know we're meeting up with him.

441
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,142
It's a surprise.

442
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,377
Yeah, it's his birthday.

443
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,316
Well I can't divulge information
about other customers.

444
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,219
It's against company policy.

445
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:19,517
Also, it's definitely not his birthday.

446
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,191
That's one of the things

447
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,978
you have to provide when you sign up.

448
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,905
Let me ask you something.

449
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,032
Haven't you ever been tempted

450
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,701
to just break the rules, and finally...

451
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:33,621
Get back at my big
faceless corporate bosses

452
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,579
for making me feel
so small and insignificant?

453
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,658
Send red team to pick up the shipment.

454
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,243
Sir, I've detected an incoming shuttle.

455
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,445
Headed our way.

456
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,834
First squad, with me.

457
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,302
Update us if you hear anything.

458
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,537
Yes, sir.

459
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:28,470
Okay, I've entered
your destination coordinates

460
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:30,427
and you're all set.

461
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,354
Just lie back and relax.

462
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:41,155
Hang on, what if there's
some kind of medical issue?

463
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,990
The system automatically monitors

464
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,825
for signs of physical distress.

465
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,112
At the first indication,
you'll be pulled right out.

466
00:25:48,164 --> 00:25:49,430
Okay.

467
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,065
Good.

468
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,483
Good.

469
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:54,240
Wait!

470
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,499
What if there's a fire?

471
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,671
In all station-related emergencies,

472
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:04,274
my first priority is to awaken all travelers
and get them to safety.

473
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:06,831
Ready.

474
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:08,967
Hang on, what if...

475
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:11,885
Wait, wait, hang on, wait

476
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:17,447
wait, excuse me, excuse me, hello?

477
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,940
That's far enough.

478
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,937
You've got some balls coming here.

479
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,530
I'm unarmed.

480
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,761
I'm here to see The General.

481
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,384
Just so happens he's waiting for you.

482
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:42,445
You ready?

483
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,777
Yeah.

484
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,448
Let's go find Six.

485
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,150
What the hell man?!

486
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,668
Who are you and where is he?!

487
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,993
What are you talking about?!

488
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,258
Oh, crap.

489
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,571
Who are you?

490
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,844
It's me, it's One.

491
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,203
You're Four.

492
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,356
The rest of the crew is back on the Raza.

493
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,215
We just used the transfer tech
to follow Six to this space station

494
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:18,234
to find out what he's up to.

495
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,574
Three is an asshole.

496
00:28:24,654 --> 00:28:26,593
- It is you.
- Yeah.

497
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,184
A glitch in the transfer process?

498
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,981
Can't be, this body was constructed

499
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,766
on your DNA template, so...

500
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,637
This is my real body.

501
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,729
This is what I look like.

502
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,496
Really look like.

503
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,377
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,631
You're awake!

505
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,184
My system is 93% restored,

506
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,650
but my corrector nanites are more
efficient while I'm in sleep mode.

507
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,023
Well, welcome back.

508
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:21,809
Thank you.

509
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,062
Why are you sorry?

510
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,687
You got hurt because of me.

511
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,999
I possess no pain receptors.

512
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,287
I mean you were damaged
by that other android

513
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,702
because I suggested
that you apologize to her.

514
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,343
I apologized because you presented

515
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,002
a reasoned argument to do so.

516
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,955
I had no choice but to respond accordingly.

517
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,266
Of course you had a choice.

518
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:47,684
In fact, no.

519
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,137
I'm a logic-based entity, therefore,

520
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,940
I act and react in a purely logical manner.

521
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:55,225
No, no you don't.

522
00:29:55,227 --> 00:30:02,116
I've seen you angry, sad, lonely, happy.

523
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:04,618
You might not have pain receptors,

524
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:07,237
but your feelings can get hurt.

525
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,670
I've seen it happen.

526
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,838
You were jealous of Wendy.

527
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,809
I was not jealous.

528
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,834
Think of the impression
that she made on you,

529
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,818
when you saw her with us.

530
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,391
Now that I think of it,
I did experience a sensation

531
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,593
that could be misconstrued
as human resentment.

532
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,795
No.

533
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:33,194
That was jealousy.

534
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,205
And you know what that means.

535
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:38,831
My programming is flawed.

536
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:43,330
No, you have feelings.

537
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,768
Congratulations.

538
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,810
Hopefully this Draves fellow shows up.

539
00:31:08,017 --> 00:31:09,224
Look, I'm sorry.

540
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,857
I should've just come clean sooner.

541
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:14,422
True.

542
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,826
I don't know why
I was posing as Jace Corso.

543
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,093
I don't remember.

544
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,528
So whatever hidden agenda I might have had,

545
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,113
it's gone now, right?

546
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I know you can't speak for anyone else,

547
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,234
so I just want to know
where I stand with you.

548
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,522
We cool?

549
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,996
At the moment,
I think I'm the least of your worries.

550
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,719
You wanted to talk to me?

551
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:40,831
We're looking for someone.

552
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:43,166
Seems a lot of people are doing that today.

553
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,473
Big guy, came through about an hour ago.

554
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:48,222
Last we heard,
he was headed in your direction.

555
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:50,007
Yeah, I know where your friend is.

556
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,308
He's no friend of ours.

557
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,636
Then what business do you have with him?

558
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,179
Payback.

559
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:58,372
Well, why didn't you just say so?

560
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:04,772
Hey, Griff.

561
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,357
Good to see you again.

562
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:09,805
So what brings you back
after all this time?

563
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,620
Unfinished business.

564
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,969
Thought you were just tired of running.

565
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,017
It must get really exhausting,

566
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,582
always having to look over your shoulder,

567
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:22,844
never to be sure who you can trust.

568
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,042
I imagine it's hard making new friends

569
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,678
when you have a reputation
for killing the old ones.

570
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,379
They weren't my friends.

571
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,883
They were your brothers in arms
and they trusted you.

572
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:35,218
And I trusted you when I flew that shuttle

573
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:37,971
onto the station to take that G.A. cruiser.

574
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,692
You manipulated me,
made me complicit in mass murder.

575
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:42,943
You were a soldier.

576
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:44,607
My soldier.

577
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,597
And we were at war and that station,

578
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,616
that was a legitimate target.

579
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:53,687
Over ten thousand lives were lost,
including children.

580
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:56,406
Hundreds die every day
under corporate rule,

581
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,241
and the Galactic Authority,

582
00:32:58,294 --> 00:33:02,379
our protectors,
they stand by and let it happen.

583
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:06,365
There's no such thing
as a bloodless revolution.

584
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,588
You know you were a good soldier, Griff.

585
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,173
Determined.

586
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,425
Relentless.

587
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,860
The very qualities
that now make you a threat.

588
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:19,875
You'll be dead before your friends arrive.

589
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:23,786
Apparently they're on their way.

590
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,778
And my men, they are
more than ready to welcome them.

591
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,580
You keep checking the time.

592
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,865
You waiting for something?

593
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,784
Sonovabitch.

594
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:44,888
Well, Griff. Timing:
not really your strong suit.

595
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,604
What the hell was that?

596
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,773
I figured this was a one-way trip,

597
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,975
so I set my shuttle to go critical.

598
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,527
Though it did take
a little longer than I thought.

599
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:10,019
Timing not being my strong suit, right?

600
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,768
Are you kidding me?

601
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,917
What have you done?

602
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,645
He was a clone.

603
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,554
I know.

604
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,841
So am I.

605
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,663
So shoot, don't shoot.

606
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,318
It's not gonna make
much of a difference in the long run.

607
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,483
How'd you find me?

608
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:55,290
We asked around.

609
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,837
Who's your friend?

610
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,274
Long story.

611
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,495
You lied to us.

612
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,698
I didn't so much lie as...

613
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,167
slightly delay telling the truth.

614
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,970
Oh, really?

615
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,067
And when exactly were you
planning to tell us that truth?

616
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,843
Honestly?

617
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,625
I don't know.

618
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,816
I was looking for
the right opportunity but,

619
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,851
when's a good time to tell your friends

620
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:30,687
you're not who they thought you were?

621
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,640
Hell, you're not who you thought you were.

622
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,364
All I know is I assumed an identity

623
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,699
to get on board this ship.

624
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,829
As to why,..

625
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,553
I have no idea.

626
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,757
Right after that incident
with the real Jace Corso,

627
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,043
you should have told us everything.

628
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,178
Hiding the truth makes us vulnerable.

629
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,929
If Corso had come back at us,

630
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,341
we never would have seen him coming.

631
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,934
I know.

632
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,686
I didn't think it through.

633
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,781
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell us?

634
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,809
Now's the time.

635
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,061
And you!

636
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,062
You knew, and you kept it a secret.

637
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,564
That's just as bad.

638
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,051
It's not as bad.

639
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,485
It was strictly for blackmail purposes.

640
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,737
We don't keep secrets,

641
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,122
and we don't blackmail each other either.

642
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,674
Fine.

643
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,186
And you.

644
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,285
What reason do you have
for putting us all at risk?

645
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,764
It was something I had to do alone.

646
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,338
I didn't want any of you
talking me out of it,

647
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,933
or screwing it up.

648
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,458
That's an apology?

649
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,694
No.

650
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,251
It's me being honest.

651
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,904
That's what you want, isn't it?

652
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:53,112
What I want is for us
to be able to trust each other.

653
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,501
Moving forward,
no more lies, no more secrets.

654
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:02,078
We have to have faith in each other
if we're going to survive.

655
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,748
But despite everything that we've
been through, we just can't seem to do it.

656
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,200
Whoever wiped our memories,

657
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:10,248
probably did it to make it
harder for us to work together.

658
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,023
Guess what?

659
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,896
It worked.

660
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,649
It all looks good.

661
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,150
Are you sure?

662
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,461
No discernible abnormalities?

663
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,992
None that I can see.

664
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,323
Why?

665
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,875
Are you worried about something?

666
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,460
You're implying that I experience anxiety.

667
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,995
What are you suggesting?

668
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:54,247
Nothing.

669
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,299
Touchy.

670
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,050
Suggestive of hypersensitivity.

671
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,002
All the diagnostics show normal.

672
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,554
You're fine.

673
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,057
Which is more than I can say
for the rest of the crew.

674
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,727
What's wrong with the rest of the crew?

675
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,473
The atmosphere on this ship is bad.

676
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,266
The atmosphere is optimal.

677
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:19,155
It's 78.084% Nitrogen,
20.9476% Oxygen, 0...

678
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,545
Morale.

679
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,409
I mean morale is bad.

680
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,579
Yes, that is suboptimal.

681
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,081
We have to find a way to trust each other.

682
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,802
I mean, if we can't even do that,

683
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,729
how can we possibly hope to survive?

684
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,525
How indeed.

685
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,478
You look like you want to say something.

686
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,792
If you honestly feel this way,
why don't you tell them?

687
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,966
Tell them what?

688
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,400
The truth.

689
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,652
About yourself.

690
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,093
How was your workout?

691
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:20,311
It was good.

692
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:27,564
We've got another three hours or so
before they finish repairs on the ship.

693
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:31,572
And some of us were thinking of
heading into the station to catch a movie.

694
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:32,624
Do you wanna come?

695
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,707
No thanks.

696
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,877
But it's Star Wars 36.

697
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:40,801
Remastered in full VR,
they say it's a classic.

698
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,549
Naw, I'm good.

699
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:44,678
Have fun though.

700
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:48,338
But you said we would hang out later...

701
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:03,937
<i>This is the Ishida Directorate.</i>

702
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,856
<i>How may I help you?</i>

703
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:07,574
You know who I am.

704
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,289
I wish to speak with Hiro.

705
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:13,632
<i>One moment.</i>

706
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,204
<i>Ryo?</i>

707
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,795
Hello, brother.

708
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:16,331
<i>There was a dramatic development today</i>

709
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:19,139
<i>in the investigation into the death
of Catherine Moss,</i>

710
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,501
<i>the wife of CoreLactic Industries'
new CEO, Derrick Moss.</i>

711
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,202
<i>The Galactic authority identified this man,</i>

712
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:29,406
<i>Marcus Boone, as a suspect in the case.</i>

713
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,325
<i>Boone is a career criminal</i>

714
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,077
<i>already wanted on dozens
of unrelated charges.</i>

715
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:37,781
<i>He is considered armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>
