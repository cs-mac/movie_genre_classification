1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,236
I guess we better get
out and fix it.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,940
What are you getting so
worked up about?

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,747
You got to be kidding me.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,216
Dude, is this a sign,
or what?

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,885
I've heard nothing but bad
things about this place.

6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:23,155
Chow is awful.
Racks are uncomfortable.

7
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:26,157
Just help me get the jack, and
the spare out of the trunk.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,992
Why don't you just call it in?

9
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,161
It'd be a hell of a lot
easier, you know.

10
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm not going to call it in. My
first day assigned to a new base.

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,435
Alright.
Whatever you say.

12
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:39,070
Come on.

13
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,912
You know, it is
beautiful out here.

14
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:51,082
I heard there's some
hiking out here that's great.

15
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:54,753
Well there you go, sergeant.
It's not that bad after all.

16
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,491
Are they supposed to be running
test today?

17
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,459
Not that I'm aware of.

18
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:16,307
What was that?

19
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,078
Let's go check it out.

20
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,549
Let's go, Sargent!

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,487
Slow down, small fry!
I haven't run in months.

22
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:49,928
<b>INDEPENDENTS DAY</b>

23
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,929
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

24
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:54,478
As parents,

25
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,382
the well being of our children
is one of our greatest concerns.

26
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:03,054
We strive to give them every
opportunity in life.

27
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:12,597
I am honored to represent the
President,

28
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,934
at a dedication of what will be
cornerstone in that foundation of our

29
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,536
children's health for many
generations to come.

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,572
The first of many I hope.

31
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,276
Stagecoach, I need extract. I say
it again, immediate extract.

32
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:27,179
We need to get you to safety
right now, Madam Vice President.

33
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:39,591
Mr. Taylor?
What is the situation?

34
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,671
We need to get you and your
family to Virginia Bunker right now.

35
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,472
Get in.

36
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,349
What do we know?

37
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:07,318
Western Air Defense Sector
reported an unidentified aircraft,

38
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,987
estimated at one kilometer in
length,

39
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,492
entered our airspace at 07:00
hours, Mr. President.

40
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:15,894
Air assets are already en route.

41
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,530
Early reports report the
aircraft as a "beehive", Sir.

42
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:24,435
Reports. We don't have a visual,
in here?

43
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:26,191
Negative. Something
seems to be interfering

44
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:27,339
with some of our
satellite relays.

45
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,508
Civilian channels are up.
Ours are down.

46
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:34,012
NORAD is trying to get us in the air.
As of right now, all we have are eyes

47
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:38,049
on the ground doing their best
or whatever intel they can get.

48
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,631
Take us to DEFCON 3.

49
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm not messing around.

50
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:56,400
How's NORAD doing?

51
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,669
They switched the back up
channels to deploying now, sir.

52
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:01,038
Great. We need all the assets at
the ready.

53
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:04,076
At slight provocation. I'm going
to blow this thing from the sky.

54
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,344
Is the Vice President at the
Virginia Bunker?

55
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,480
Yes, sir. The Vice President has
just arrived.

56
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,680
Great.

57
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,450
Vice President Raney.

58
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,986
With 200 feet below the surface
and a fully sustainable habitat

59
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,589
that could withstand a direct
hit from nuclear warhead.

60
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:20,258
This is Captain Goddard, Bio
Weapons Division.

61
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,192
Vice President Raney.

62
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,728
Captain Goddard.

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,195
Why is Bio Weapons
Division here?

64
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,697
He's here at the request of the
President.

65
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,232
Have they exhibited any
threatening actions as of yet?

66
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:30,000
No, Ma'am. Not as of yet.

67
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,301
Tactical Air Command
has relayed that two jets

68
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:34,472
are on approach to
intercept the space ship.

69
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:38,443
Alpha Bravo, Raptor 311,
we're on approach to target now.

70
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:45,083
Getting a fair amount
of turbulence in its wake.

71
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,587
Rabbit why don't you
hang back, just in case.

72
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Roger that.

73
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,027
One mile to target.

74
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,468
I'm beginning to see
surface detailing now, protrusions,

75
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,206
plating material unknown. No
visible windows or hatches.

76
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:14,278
Jesus.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,483
I'm gonna descend to
17,000 and have a look underneath.

78
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,210
I am now seeing
what appears to be a

79
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,737
blue light emanating
from the core of the...

80
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:47,178
311 hit! He's hit!
I'm getting out of here!

81
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,584
Our jets are down.

82
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,786
All assets are clear to engage!

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,721
And get that damn
satellite up there!

84
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,757
I need to see this thing!

85
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,406
Approaching target.

86
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,545
Alpha Bravo, we now
have multiple targets, inbound.

87
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,786
Report.

88
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,136
He's on me, I'm going
to try flying closer to the ship.

89
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,270
Maybe he won't
be so quick to fire.

90
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,332
Coming from behind.

91
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:19,838
Here we go.

92
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,945
Yahoo! You got him!

93
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:30,349
Take that
space trash.

94
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:39,524
Come back.
You alright? Hello?

95
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,663
No.

96
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:52,804
Eyes on, reports.

97
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,807
All of our conventional assets
are failing, Mr. President.

98
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,743
All of our efforts are failing.

99
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,422
I'm declaring DEFCON 1.

100
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,725
Clear to go nuclear.

101
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:51,528
Nevada Launch Facility MX2 has
just been attached, Mr. President.

102
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,498
There's been no detonation but
the systems are showing offline.

103
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,300
The launch has failed, sir.

104
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:58,936
It's right on to
of us, sir.

105
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,972
Everybody, everybody
get out now! Let's go!

106
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,476
Evacuate the PEOC.
Everyone out!

107
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,123
- I'm not leaving you, sir.
- Out! Just leave!

108
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:09,281
- I'm not leaving you...
- Just leave! Go!

109
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,979
Without a specimen, sir, it's
difficult to proceed.

110
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:42,946
My god!

111
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,882
What is it, Ari?

112
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,051
The White House.
It's been attacked.

113
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,020
No survivors.

114
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:51,489
Including President Oliver.

115
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,397
Ari?

116
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,534
Do you have confirmation?

117
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,567
Yes, Vice...

118
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,873
Under the
Federal Continuity Directive.

119
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,042
Ensuring the continuos
performance of the essential

120
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:15,079
functions of our Government
during a time of war.

121
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:19,017
I will need to swear you in,
Vice President Raney.

122
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,355
I do solemnly swear that I will
faithfully execute the office of

123
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,457
the President of the
United States,

124
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,594
and will to the best of my
ability, preserve, protect,

125
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,997
and defend the constitution
of the United States.

126
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,632
The country is now on
your hands.

127
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,536
What are your orders, Madam
President?

128
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,980
Lexi.

129
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,515
Relax.

130
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:52,817
Put your finger up there.

131
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,087
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Stop shooting.

132
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,688
What is it, Red?

133
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,925
You gotta come listen to this.

134
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,565
<i>This morning, not more than 20 minutes
ago, the White House was attacked.</i>

135
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:09,934
<i>We are standing at DEFCON 1.</i>

136
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,772
<i>All though no nuclear launches
have been confirmed at this time.</i>

137
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:17,296
<i>Over 2,000 people work
in the White House,</i>

138
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,712
<i>and evacuation was in
process, I... Hold on.</i>

139
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:25,315
<i>President Oliver is dead.</i>

140
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:28,520
<i>We now have confirmation that President
Oliver was in the Bunker located...</i>

141
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:32,055
Wasn't your brother assigned
to the President's detail?

142
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,126
<i>It was a nuclear Bunker capable
of with standing nuclear attacks.</i>

143
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,627
Yeah.

144
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,830
Yeah he was.

145
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,535
<i>Vice President Raney was not
with him at the time.</i>

146
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,804
Well, I don't know.
Maybe...

147
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,139
Maybe he was off the
President's detail.

148
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,175
I kept up with him
through the ex.

149
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:56,680
She just said last week, he was
still assigned to Oliver.

150
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,118
I'm sorry, Kelly.

151
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,120
He was a good kid.

152
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,526
Break silence.

153
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,494
Contact all the
militia chapters.

154
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:13,799
We're going to war.

155
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:24,442
These aliens picked the wrong
planet to mess with.

156
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:28,713
<i>Today, we not only as Americans,</i>

157
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:33,050
<i>but as creatures of the Earth,
are under attack.</i>

158
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,787
Are nuclear assets
having any success?

159
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,888
Negative, President Raney.

160
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,356
They've all failed.

161
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,463
Same with other nuclear nations.
All ordinance has been... frozen.

162
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,163
Okay.

163
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,566
Stand down from DEFCON 1.
Go to 2.

164
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:52,671
Meredith? What are you doing?

165
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,205
Our nuclear assets aren't
working, Randall.

166
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,740
But we can't stop trying.

167
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:58,909
It's not working, Randall.

168
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,666
And the more we try,

169
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,580
the greater the potential we
destroy ourselves in the process.

170
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,584
The fact that the only disabled
them, gives me hope.

171
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:10,822
Yeah, Dad. Maybe they felt threatened
that our jet fighters approached.

172
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,190
They may have, son.

173
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,693
But the fact remains, they
attacked first...

174
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,561
We're receiving a transmission!

175
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,197
It's...

176
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,832
It's coming from the Hive.

177
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,137
Put it on.

178
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,041
<i>People of the third planet.</i>

179
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:34,145
<i>We shall refer to ourselves as,
"Orions",</i>

180
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:39,017
<i>as our planet resides in solar
system much like your own within</i>

181
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,121
<i>the constellation of the
stars you call, "Orion."</i>

182
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:49,026
<i>It is not our intent to destroy you.
Our mission is one of peace.</i>

183
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,195
<i>But your race is a violent one.</i>

184
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:56,667
<i>And for this reason, we must
guarantee our safety.</i>

185
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,772
<i>Therefore, we have eliminated the
threat of your nuclear weapons.</i>

186
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:07,311
<i>In the next two hours, all other
remaining military installations,</i>

187
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:10,614
<i>and government capitals, will
be destroyed.</i>

188
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:14,252
<i>In time, you will receive
further instruction.</i>

189
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,854
How the hell is that
a mission of peace?

190
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,123
Ari, was that communication
on an open channel?

191
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:21,709
No, Ma'am. I tried
to place a lock on it.

192
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,893
But I was only able to grab it.

193
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,095
I want to open a dialogue
with them.

194
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,229
Make this happen.

195
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:27,798
Yes, Madam President.

196
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,733
I need to address the nation.

197
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,301
Let the people know
what's happening.

198
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,937
I need a few minutes to
compose my thoughts.

199
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,173
Dark Echo is still two hours
out, Madam President.

200
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,841
Thank you.

201
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,783
And may we remain
ever vigilant, and strong.

202
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,652
Just as our country has done
countless times before,

203
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,655
we will get through this.

204
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,056
God Bless you,

205
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,993
and God Bless the Unites States
of America.

206
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:07,839
Madam President, the Kremlin has
been destroyed.

207
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:09,774
As well as the Kantei,

208
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:12,109
both French and British
Parliaments.

209
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,778
Thank you.

210
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,113
We're receiving another
transmission.

211
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,749
Can you identify the
frequency signature?

212
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,985
I'm still trying Madam
President.

213
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,204
<i>All government and
military installations</i>

214
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:27,058
<i>world wide have
now been destroyed.</i>

215
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,060
<i>You have ravaged your
world too long.</i>

216
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:35,233
<i>We will provide you a chance to
restart on a new a new world.</i>

217
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:41,372
<i>Momentarily, transport ships will begin
arriving in all capitals and cities</i>

218
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:45,877
<i>with populations in excess of
1 million people.</i>

219
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:47,243
<i>Go to them.</i>

220
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:50,981
<i>Everything else will be
provided for you.</i>

221
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:55,119
<i>You have 120 to evaluate
your planet.</i>

222
00:15:55,151 --> 00:16:00,090
<i>At the end of this period, all
remaining humans will be exterminated.</i>

223
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:02,259
<i>You will not survive this.</i>

224
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,097
<i>Go. Now.</i>

225
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:17,141
They expect us to evacuate a planet
of 7 billion people, in just 5 day?

226
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,144
They're out of their minds.

227
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,746
People are already lining up to
board the ships.

228
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,414
See, it's on my phone.

229
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,984
Why would they destroy all
our weapons,

230
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:29,421
but keep civilian
communications open?

231
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,390
They're taking prisoners.

232
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,026
That's what they're doing.

233
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,381
That's 25 confirmed
ships so far.

234
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:40,865
Members are on alert
across Pennsylvania.

235
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,501
Let's head into Philly.

236
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:47,204
When we find the location of the
ship, we attack.

237
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,541
I've got it! I've got it!

238
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,344
I've isolated the Orion's
frequency signature.

239
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,449
Okay, Madam President.

240
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:01,080
Try to speak at a slightly
slower than normal pace.

241
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:03,138
Avoid any overt emotions,
just because the matrix

242
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,009
may scramble your
intentions on their end,

243
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,356
and spit out the wrong words
or symbols.

244
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,960
Unfortunately, there is no way to
translate our language from our end.

245
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:20,872
I bring you greeting from the
United States of America.

246
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:25,410
I am President Meredith Raney.

247
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:32,016
We wish to open a peaceful
dialogue with your leaders.

248
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:44,295
We regret if our initial
actions were taken as offensive,

249
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,065
and caused you to defend
yourselves.

250
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:52,069
I was not our intent to
display aggression.

251
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:57,888
I request we open a
channel of dialogue

252
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:02,546
so that we may convey our
desire for peaceful,

253
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,819
and harmonious relation between
our two races.

254
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,899
They're responding!

255
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,934
<i>You attacked us.</i>

256
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:33,610
Again, It is common procedure to
send jets in the air...

257
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,378
<i>We are open to dialogue.</i>

258
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:39,249
<i>However, our intent will remain
unchanged.</i>

259
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:44,988
<i>You have 119 hours in which to
evacuate your planet.</i>

260
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:50,527
We are grateful for your help.

261
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:57,635
However, we are a race that is
inherently suspicious.

262
00:18:57,668 --> 00:19:01,171
Therefore, to alley our fears,

263
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:08,346
we need some form of proof, to
substantiate your claims to aid us.

264
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,383
<i>We will prove our
intentions by demonstrating our</i>

265
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:18,055
<i>technological and medical
superiority with your race.</i>

266
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:24,295
<i>There are places in your world, where
people suffer from starvation.</i>

267
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,363
<i>We will feed them.</i>

268
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:30,434
<i>Your race is plagued
by diseases.</i>

269
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,470
<i>We will offer cures.</i>

270
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:38,643
<i>There are but only a few gifts
awaiting your peaceful surrender.</i>

271
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,453
I don't like it, Meredith.

272
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,456
What for? For us to give up
everything?

273
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:54,024
Get on a ship and go to a
foreign world?

274
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,225
This proves nothing.

275
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,997
<i>President Raney.</i>

276
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,365
<i>You have a son.</i>

277
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,435
Yes.

278
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,236
That is correct.

279
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,307
<i>In further effort
to prove our intentions,</i>

280
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:15,246
<i>you will go to the transport
ship in Washington D.C.</i>

281
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:18,349
<i>There, we will heal him.</i>

282
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,190
Heal me?

283
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:28,625
Sweetheart.

284
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,728
You don't know what these things
might do to you, Bobby.

285
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,430
To me?

286
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,399
What are they gonna do
to all of us?

287
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,238
Sweetheart, we can't risk having
you part of some experiment.

288
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,207
Mom.

289
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:49,513
If they're not trust worthy,
then we're already dead.

290
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:32,723
Where are they?

291
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:37,761
There's no body here to greet us
because the less we know about them,

292
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:40,765
the more strategic advantage
they have over us.

293
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,137
Let's go, buddy.

294
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,414
Perhaps you can accompany them.

295
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:58,649
Obtain a little intel.

296
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,951
Yes, sir.
You got it.

297
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:05,723
Okay.

298
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:09,594
You don't need to
through with this, Bobby.

299
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:17,167
Yeah. I do.

300
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,545
I think it's best you remain
here, Madam President.

301
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:31,648
I can accompany them,
Madam President.

302
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,316
Thank you, Captain.

303
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,805
I suggest I enter first, sir.

304
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:59,376
Check things out.

305
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,531
<i>Halt.</i>

306
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,734
<i>Weapons detected.</i>

307
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:27,904
<i>These items are not allowed
aboard this vessel.</i>

308
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:30,675
<i>You must remove them
immediately.</i>

309
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:34,312
<i>You have 5 seconds to comply.</i>

310
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:50,861
<i>Scanning.</i>

311
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,701
<i>You may proceed.</i>

312
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:07,277
<i>Bring us the
child of President Raney.</i>

313
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:10,448
<i>We will heal him.</i>

314
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:14,784
<i>Bring the child to us.</i>

315
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,863
The ship must be equipped with
some sort of surveillance.

316
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:28,498
It knew that Goddard was armed.

317
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,599
Well, they either
didn't catch the camera

318
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,470
or they didn't mind
us taking a peak.

319
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:37,807
My god.

320
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:15,513
<i>Bring us the
child of President Raney.</i>

321
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:18,415
<i>We will heal him.</i>

322
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,819
<i>Bring the child to us.</i>

323
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,803
<i>Bring the child to us.</i>

324
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,940
<i>Bring the child to us.</i>

325
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:51,616
They're asking for him, sir.

326
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,750
It appears safe, as far
as I can tell.

327
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,959
Remember when I use to pitch in
little league?

328
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,296
Of course I do.

329
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,666
I was really good.

330
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:13,870
Lets go.

331
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:15,439
Come on.

332
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,408
My God.

333
00:26:57,113 --> 00:27:00,851
<i>We welcome
the child of Raney.</i>

334
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,621
What's that smell?

335
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,626
Could be bio-sensory
of some kind.

336
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:11,429
Come on.

337
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:19,769
<i>You will proceed
to the regeneration chamber.</i>

338
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:25,508
<i>There, we will prepare your
body. Continue.</i>

339
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:29,012
<i>Continue.</i>

340
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,059
It's right there.
Lets go.

341
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,794
Come on.

342
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,399
Come on.

343
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,412
<i>Assist the child
enter the regeneration chamber.</i>

344
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,094
Let's go.

345
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:21,030
Come on.

346
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,007
I love you, buddy.

347
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,942
I love you too, Dad.

348
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:38,849
<i>You will secure
the chamber.</i>

349
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:48,659
<i>We will no initiate the
regeneration sequence.</i>

350
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:51,828
<i>And prepare his damaged body.</i>

351
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:53,964
<i>Please stand back.</i>

352
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,452
No!
You're hurting him!

353
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,053
Madam President!

354
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,988
Taylor, disarm!

355
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,530
Madam President!

356
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:27,931
Let him go!

357
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,835
Stop it!

358
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,173
Stop it!

359
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,008
Stop this thing!

360
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,081
Bobby!

361
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:47,884
Stop it!

362
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,025
<i>The procedure
is nearly complete.</i>

363
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:57,627
<i>Step back.</i>

364
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:24,121
<i>Process Complete.</i>

365
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,295
Are you alright?

366
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:33,697
Come on.

367
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:38,066
Hey. Slow. Slow.

368
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,170
Take your time.
Hey.

369
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,074
You're alright.

370
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,312
Come here.

371
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,755
Hey!

372
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,624
Hey man! How you doing?

373
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:18,742
Slowly.

374
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,844
Let's get you out of this thing.

375
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,111
Come on.

376
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:26,316
That a boy.

377
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,651
You got it.

378
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,294
Take your time.

379
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:10,960
Mom, stop staring at me.

380
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,496
Sorry.

381
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,798
I'll feel a lot better once we get the
doctor to completely check you out.

382
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:17,167
Mom, I feel great.

383
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,401
Honestly.

384
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:20,336
I'm glad.

385
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:31,047
Guys, I think it's a good idea we
don't stick around here too long.

386
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,416
It's dangerous.

387
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,020
Perhaps you're right.

388
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:37,888
Madam President?

389
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,256
Yes, General?

390
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:42,058
I've got some important developments
I'd like to discuss with you.

391
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:43,325
Go on.

392
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,928
Can we step over there?

393
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:47,131
Very well.
Alright.

394
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,908
Ari discovered an
encrypted signal,

395
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,812
hidden within the natural occurring
CMB radiation in deep space.

396
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,479
Before the arrival of the
Orions,

397
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:06,016
this signal was not being
detected.

398
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,020
Furthermore, its source of origin is
nowhere near the Orion Constellation.

399
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:12,221
They're lying.

400
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:15,459
Can we listen in on this deep
space channel?

401
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:17,928
We could, Madam President, but
not from here.

402
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,296
If we can go back to the bunker, I can
access it through the main frame.

403
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,065
I can try to upgrade the logic
gate matrix,

404
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:24,401
and then run the signal through
the virtual machine.

405
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:28,004
There's a slight chance we might be
able to decipher their language.

406
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,473
Slight chance is better
than no chance.

407
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:32,375
Lets go.

408
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,062
Red.

409
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:27,430
On me.

410
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,466
Rocco, Flanking, David and Michael.
Keep the perimeter secured.

411
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,335
I don't want any civilians
getting passed.

412
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,288
Halt.
What the hell is that smell?

413
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:53,089
<i>Holy shit
Robotic Voice: Weapons detected.</i>

414
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,390
Hold steady Lexi.

415
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:55,192
It's gonna shoot us!

416
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,914
Get down! Get down!
Take cover!

417
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:30,560
The Philadelphia transport ship
is under attack.

418
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,230
And I have the same reports
thing in Huston and Atlanta.

419
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:34,230
By who?

420
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:36,165
A militia group calling
themselves First Earth.

421
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:38,067
And I have reports of riots in
other cities. People are pushing

422
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,935
past barricades, and
boarding the ships.

423
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,037
What do we know about
First Earth?

424
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,607
It's a united militia front,
led by a Kelly Reed.

425
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,009
I know who that is. It's Agent
Norman Reed's brother.

426
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,077
Former Army Ranger.

427
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,113
Left the service, became a
freelance contractor.

428
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,517
Now he head up to the Pennsylvania
militia, and we're in.

429
00:36:06,495 --> 00:36:08,865
This thing looks crazy.

430
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:11,634
You sure you can work
on this Ari?

431
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,069
I think so.

432
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:19,442
Mobilize the National Guard. I
want this faction down now.

433
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,045
And I want all hands on deck to
keep civilians off those ships.

434
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:23,413
But why?

435
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,515
After all, they did heal me,
didn't they?

436
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,020
Let's not forget that their first
move was to destroy the White House.

437
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:34,556
The fact remains that they yet to tell
us where they're taking our people.

438
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:37,660
And until they do, I'm not
letting anyone on the ships. No.

439
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:38,929
What is it Ari?

440
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:41,196
We have a message coming
through the Orions.

441
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,331
What's the problem with that?

442
00:36:42,364 --> 00:36:45,102
I don't want to add any stress
to the Virtual Machine.

443
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:47,570
I think we need to hear
what they have to say.

444
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:49,271
What's the worst it can do?

445
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,377
The most simple way is
to think of when a wire

446
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,009
takes too much current,
it explodes.

447
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,712
The heat has to go somewhere. The
whole main frame can shut down.

448
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:59,683
They could be launching another
attack at the First Earth's antics.

449
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,685
Put it through, Ari.

450
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:11,995
<i>Several of our transport ships have
come under attack in the United States,</i>

451
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:13,629
<i>and suffered damages.</i>

452
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:20,170
<i>It appears people are not being
allowed to board our ships.</i>

453
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:24,074
<i>We are prepared to withdraw all
extraction efforts,</i>

454
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:27,090
<i>and commence with
immediate extermination</i>

455
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,079
<i>procedures of the United States.</i>

456
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:36,486
We were unaware of the attacks
on your vessels,

457
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:41,991
They were committed by a faction
outside our government.

458
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:46,530
We will put a stop to them
immediately.

459
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:52,002
<i>This is acceptable. You will
allow your people to board our ships.</i>

460
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:55,638
No, no I will not.

461
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:59,375
Not until you tell us where they
are being taken.

462
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,377
Their gone, Madam President.

463
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,746
Reports are coming from all over
the country.

464
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,781
People are boarding the ships.

465
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:08,350
After the world saw
what happened to Bobby?

466
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:09,618
It's the matter of trust.

467
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:12,522
We won't be able to keep these
of those ships.

468
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,026
The Mainframe is overloading!

469
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,196
Well whatever it is you're
doing, just shut it down.

470
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,598
The whole system is failing.

471
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,232
That's life support!

472
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:27,236
The issue is not environmental control.
The system is no longer venting oxygen.

473
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,639
How long do we have?
I don't know what's happening.

474
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:32,308
We only have a few minutes
before we run out of air.

475
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:35,377
I'm trying to restart the system
but the override is jammed.

476
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,645
What do we do?

477
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:39,048
Somebody's got to go all the way
down to EC and fix it manually.

478
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,750
Then I can reboot it
from here.

479
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:42,018
I know where it is.

480
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,087
I'll need all hands just incase.
Let's go.

481
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,154
Go!

482
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:47,256
You stay. Stay with the President.
Yes, sir.

483
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,259
I love you. I'll be back.

484
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:50,727
Bobby!

485
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,308
You okay?
Yeah, go, go.

486
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:08,277
This is it.

487
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:29,833
Madam President?

488
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,835
Is there anything you can do,
Ari?

489
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:34,604
No, President Raney.

490
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,706
We just have to hope they radio
back to us before its too late.

491
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,747
Over here! This way!

492
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,183
Right here.

493
00:39:48,216 --> 00:39:49,685
Under the...
Let's do it!

494
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,621
Ready? Go!

495
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,594
Here it is.

496
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:02,131
Here.

497
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,433
It's stuck.

498
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:07,770
Look, there's a pipe.

499
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,674
General, use this for leverage.

500
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:19,148
I can't.

501
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,387
Let me try, sir.

502
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,593
I can't breathe.

503
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:24,446
We did it. I
think we did it. Reset.

504
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:25,649
Reset.

505
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:26,916
Reset.

506
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:26,442
You guys alright?

507
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:27,777
Okay.

508
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:34,817
This is over.

509
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:47,830
Seems like life support is are
returning to normal.

510
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,033
General, get Bobby up to the
main level.

511
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,001
Dad, I'm fine.

512
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,535
Go!

513
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:11,421
Yeah.

514
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:12,055
Is this Kelly Reed?

515
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,656
Who's asking?

516
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,826
This is Senator Randall Raney.

517
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:19,995
You know you're making quite a
mess out there.

518
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:23,599
I wanna know why you're
attacking the transport ships?

519
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:27,671
It's an attack on American soil,
Senator.

520
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,425
Well look, I was thinking
if we could work together

521
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:32,042
maybe we can
solve this problem.

522
00:43:33,408 --> 00:43:35,010
This conversation is over.

523
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:37,796
Mr. Reed. The President
is ordering the

524
00:43:37,797 --> 00:43:40,616
National Guard and
local Law Enforcement

525
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:44,554
around the country to shut you
down by whatever means necessary.

526
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:47,657
Now I can call those hounds of,
if you help me.

527
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,828
Mr. Reed, I think we both have
the same goal in mind here.

528
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:55,030
What do you want?

529
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:58,801
Look, there's a great deal of suspicion
what the Orions true intentions are.

530
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:01,738
We don't know where they're
taking our people.

531
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,805
We don't want anymore people
getting on the ships.

532
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,975
<i>So you need some kind of
deterrent?</i>

533
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:08,710
Something that will make the
people stay away.

534
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:10,879
That's where you guys
would come in.

535
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:12,549
Can we do this?

536
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:15,852
We can probably help with that.

537
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:30,999
How do you feel?

538
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,002
I'm fine. How about you?

539
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:35,071
Did we make
any progress?

540
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:38,022
Ari's transferring
everything he was able

541
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:39,709
to download before
the system crashed.

542
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,448
General Roundtree, you were able to
relay my orders to the National Guard?

543
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,584
Yes, Madam President.

544
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:07,870
Lose your weapons.

545
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:09,605
We're going in unarmed this
time.

546
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:13,709
We'll see if the security scan
can pick up on these.

547
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:23,118
Cops aren't gonna be able to keep
those crowds at bay for long.

548
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:25,565
Ever since they healed
the President's kid,

549
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:27,090
they all want to
get on those ships.

550
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:29,191
Can't let that happen.

551
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,630
When we first step in, the laser
is going to scan us.

552
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:35,931
Assuming we make it past the
first laser,

553
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:40,035
we'll split up, plant the C4, meet
back here in 10 minutes to detonate.

554
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:41,437
Understood?

555
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,506
Roger that.
Copy that.

556
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:44,841
Move out.

557
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:47,776
<i>Halt.</i>

558
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:54,451
<i>Scanning.
Everyone's unarmed, right?</i>

559
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:00,790
<i>You may proceed.</i>

560
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:04,760
Look for an instrument panel or
imperfections in the haul.

561
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:12,000
<i>Doesn't pick up that plastique,</i>

562
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:13,569
Not so far.

563
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,939
What's that smell, man?

564
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:17,940
I don't know.

565
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:21,710
What I'm worried about is getting
the plastic caps on here.

566
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,056
Get back, please.

567
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:45,234
These oughta do some
damage.

568
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:48,004
Wait, do you hear that?

569
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,614
Weapons detected.

570
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:12,929
Go!

571
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:26,843
Take cover.

572
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:34,816
There has been another attack in
the Philadelphia transport ship!

573
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:38,321
It's First Earth again.

574
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:41,658
Mass casualties this time.

575
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,626
Madam President, the Orions are
contacting us.

576
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,862
Crap.

577
00:47:47,562 --> 00:47:49,336
Make sure the National
Guard and local law

578
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:51,233
enforcement understand
their duties, General.

579
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,935
Yes, Ma'am.

580
00:47:53,768 --> 00:47:55,138
Put them on.

581
00:47:55,937 --> 00:47:59,207
<i>President Raney.
You have failed us.</i>

582
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,680
<i>There have been further attacks.</i>

583
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,918
An isolated incident,
I assure you.

584
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:10,386
It is being dealt with.

585
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:13,922
<i>We are prepared to
withdrawal extraction efforts,</i>

586
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:17,692
<i>and proceed with extermination
procedures.</i>

587
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:20,963
Please, do not do that.

588
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:24,100
They terminated the
connection, President Raney.

589
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:26,234
Of course they did.
God!

590
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,323
Put down
your weapons.

591
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:52,027
I'm receiving reports of Orions
attacking and firing on crowds.

592
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,096
Raise the Orions, Ari!
Yes, Ma'am.

593
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:00,435
They're not responding.
Keep trying.

594
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:03,138
Madam President,
ministry of defense.

595
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,743
Hell Minister Brighton.

596
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,377
Yes.

597
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:10,645
Yes, I understand your position.

598
00:49:10,678 --> 00:49:13,915
We are doing everything that we can to
suppress the action of First Earth.

599
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,151
Yes, sir.

600
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,852
Hold on one second, please.

601
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:17,953
What?

602
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:23,192
Minister Brighton, an urgent matter has
take place. I need to call you back.

603
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:30,132
Hello?

604
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:33,069
What the hell happened out
there, Reed?

605
00:49:33,102 --> 00:49:34,337
It's FUBAR, sir.

606
00:49:35,904 --> 00:49:37,205
People pushing their way
in with the cops in tow,

607
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:37,873
and the friggin' lasers dropped.

608
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:39,908
Well, this is no what I
had in mind.

609
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:43,344
They still don't appear to be
shooting civilians. I apologize, sir.

610
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:45,080
What do you want us to do?

611
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:48,750
Just stand down for the moment.

612
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:08,770
Who you talking with out here,
Randall?

613
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,637
General Roundtree just
spoke to the Captain

614
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,242
in charge of the
National Guard detail.

615
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,113
They received orders to assist
First Earth?

616
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:19,915
From you?

617
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:26,055
I made a bad move, Meredith.

618
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:31,294
I asked them to do what they could
to keep people off the ships.

619
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:34,763
Dark Echo has arrived.

620
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:47,943
Easier to follow orders when you
agree with them, Senator.

621
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:53,515
Go, go, go!

622
00:51:06,093 --> 00:51:08,029
Put down your weapons.
We're fucked.

623
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:12,067
Put down your
weapons.

624
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,972
What are you doing?

625
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:19,542
Toss your weapon.

626
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:53,274
President Raney.

627
00:51:53,308 --> 00:51:56,145
I'm Major Fry. This is Lieutenant
Zuber from the 45th space wing,

628
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:58,247
Extraterrestrial Avionics
Intelligence unit.

629
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:00,448
We believe this is what
we are up against.

630
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:20,335
On August 14th, 2003, the sun released
a larger than normal plasma tendril,

631
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:23,638
resulting in a massive
electromagnetic explosion.

632
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:27,610
It downed all satellite, radio,
and cellular communications.

633
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:30,179
That's the same dates as the
east coast black outs.

634
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,447
That's correct, Captain.

635
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,384
It turns out, our friend here,
was paying us a visit as well.

636
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:43,124
What make you think this is the
race that's attacking us?

637
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,098
A unique signature in the Cosmic
Microwave Background radiation.

638
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:53,069
Our team detected a similar signal
when the hive arrived this morning.

639
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:57,172
Our technician, Mr. Ari, has
identified a CMB encryption signal.

640
00:52:57,538 --> 00:52:58,906
We'll be happy to share that
with you.

641
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,312
We smelled an odor when Bobby was
healed on the transport ship.

642
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:05,570
And the guys on the
field are smelling

643
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:08,082
something on other
transport ships as well.

644
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:10,706
We learned from the
Cheyenne ship that the odor

645
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:13,055
is a short of
chemical pheromone.

646
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,424
It enables access to vital
components of the ship.

647
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:19,594
Our chemist were able to replicate
that formula in the laboratory.

648
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:22,064
We call it, CH5N.

649
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:28,937
We should be able to use it to access
restricted areas of the alien vessels.

650
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:33,342
But is impossible to say for certain
without a more recent specimen.

651
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:38,580
Now, I think it would be fitting
to use your militia, Randall.

652
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:46,522
I'm sorry, say that
again.

653
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:49,624
I want you to capture
an Orion.

654
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,962
And how are we supposed to do
that, senator?

655
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:56,031
There was a firefight over
the Virginia mountains this morning.

656
00:53:56,064 --> 00:53:58,366
If you go digging in the wreckage,
you might find a pilot.

657
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,669
I can be dead or alive.
It makes no difference.

658
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:04,540
Well, I might know a
couple of mountain boys.

659
00:54:04,772 --> 00:54:06,475
Leave it to us, sir.

660
00:54:06,507 --> 00:54:08,109
We'll do our best.

661
00:54:11,279 --> 00:54:12,514
They're going to do it.

662
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:13,716
Good.

663
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,481
Major Fry, let's get
you over to the D.C.

664
00:54:16,482 --> 00:54:17,585
transport ship. See
what you make of it.

665
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:19,254
Certainly, Madam President.

666
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:22,123
I have been analyzing the Orion signal
from the CMB and comparing it against

667
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:25,526
another signal that I found embedded
from the broadcast in the mothership.

668
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,064
So far I have isolated about 30
unique patterns that keep showing up.

669
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:30,765
It seems that this is
their alphabet.

670
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:32,101
Impressive work.

671
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:36,038
On the Cheyenne ship when we tried
to broadcast the CMB signal,

672
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:39,976
the controls would flutter like
an energy pulse.

673
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,044
Didn't get us anywhere.

674
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:44,745
We've had several English broadcast
aline these patterns up against.

675
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:48,082
It's not gonna be perfect but I
do have a translator algorithm

676
00:54:48,116 --> 00:54:50,386
for us to try and access
this data base.

677
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,020
Pheromones should get us access.

678
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:54,089
Hopefully your alphabet will get
us some answers.

679
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,065
General, what do we know about
their boarding procedures?

680
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,701
The ship is equipped with some sort
of a weapons detection system.

681
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:09,637
The laser deterrent enforces a
no tolerance policy.

682
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:13,341
We're not quite sure how they're
surveilling their ship. Understood.

683
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:15,077
Let's see what they
make of this.

684
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:18,668
Whatever their
surveillance, I'm willing to

685
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:20,482
bet with CH5N, they'll
look the other way.

686
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:22,217
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

687
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,518
Sir.

688
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:36,297
<i>Halt.</i>

689
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:39,501
<i>Scanning.</i>

690
00:55:44,473 --> 00:55:46,308
<i>You may proceed.</i>

691
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:48,611
Same as the Cheyenne ship.

692
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:17,456
Unlike the vessel
recovered in '03, this ship

693
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,176
doesn't appear to be
designed for man flight.

694
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,698
Looks like it's trying to
establish a link.

695
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:53,609
Let's see what it's
trying to say.

696
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:11,527
I don't even know if any of these
alien bastards is out here.

697
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,395
We don't.

698
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,589
Hello?

699
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,326
That's great news, Mr. Reed.

700
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:47,296
Text me your coordinates, I'm
sending a chopper to you.

701
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:48,397
Bye.

702
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:51,432
We have our selves an Orion.

703
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:55,770
Dr. Goddard, Have you
ever do an autopsy?

704
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,207
Yes, I have.

705
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:08,816
Carbon base life form. Oxygen
and Nitrogen present in their

706
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,721
blood suggest they breathe a
similar atmosphere to ours.

707
00:58:12,754 --> 00:58:14,924
Same alkaline based cell
structure...

708
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:17,526
But with slightly different
attributes.

709
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,830
The First Earth captured Orion
has a more mesomorphic build.

710
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:23,498
Bigger and stronger.

711
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:27,902
Cheyenne specimen, slightly
thinner, more ectomorphic.

712
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:31,239
But I'm willing to bet their both
symbioses of the same colony.

713
00:58:31,272 --> 00:58:33,875
Much like workers to a
queen bee.

714
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:39,781
Now.

715
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:42,951
We just need to find a match.

716
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:16,484
Major Fry,
what happened?

717
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:20,955
Lasers dropped, I lost
Lieutenant.

718
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:23,524
Are you hurt?

719
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,893
No, Madam President. I'm fine.

720
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:30,031
Just need to wait for the AI
reset. And I'll try again.

721
00:59:30,464 --> 00:59:32,367
Please be
careful, Major.

722
00:59:34,102 --> 00:59:36,038
Yes, Madam President.

723
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,313
Okay, we try again.

724
01:00:02,897 --> 01:00:05,034
I'll be ready to move.

725
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:23,384
We're in.

726
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:29,358
It looks remarkably
similar to earth.

727
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:36,664
Flight mission.

728
01:00:44,605 --> 01:00:46,107
Navigation.

729
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:52,781
Colonization.

730
01:01:02,623 --> 01:01:04,459
What's
happening, Major?

731
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,364
It appears they're trying to
colonize earth like planets.

732
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:12,533
They are using the hive to
terraform them.

733
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:17,071
Can you find out where
they are taking our people, Major?

734
01:01:18,105 --> 01:01:19,540
Yes.

735
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,480
Trajectory.

736
01:01:44,565 --> 01:01:46,701
This doesn't make any sense.

737
01:01:54,808 --> 01:01:58,013
Four ships are going to the
hive, briefly.

738
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:03,584
Then they hoover over the atmosphere
for 10 minutes, and reenter.

739
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:44,526
They just Jettisoning the
people into space.

740
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:47,028
I'm sorry, Major. Please repeat that.
I didn't get it.

741
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:51,165
I said they are just Jettisoning
the people into space.

742
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:53,201
Like throwing out the trash,
Mrs. President.

743
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,839
That can't be right. He said that
the ship first goes to the hive.

744
01:02:58,872 --> 01:03:01,208
Major, are you sure? Are you
absolutely certain?

745
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:03,578
No one appears to be getting off
at the hive?

746
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:06,547
Yes, Madam President.

747
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,182
This has all been
downloaded to my PAMD.

748
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:10,085
I'll show you when
I return.

749
01:03:16,757 --> 01:03:19,169
President Raney. What about
the people across the country

750
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,529
wait to board? Across the globe.

751
01:03:27,835 --> 01:03:29,738
Let them board.

752
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:31,607
Mom.

753
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:34,311
They're going to die.
We have to tell them.

754
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:35,210
We can't let them
board those ships.

755
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:37,145
We can't let them
know we're on to them.

756
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:42,017
We would be giving up
all our intel.

757
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,658
Finally, we know something about
them they don't want us to know.

758
01:03:52,926 --> 01:03:55,329
Have we gotten an
update from Captain Goddard, yet?

759
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:57,899
I spoke to him a little earlier.
He said he's making progress.

760
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:00,134
But preferred to explain it
when he returns.

761
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,969
We better get back to
the bunker.

762
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:04,672
I wanna know what I can
about that alien.

763
01:04:04,705 --> 01:04:05,707
Why are they doing this?

764
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:06,975
This is what I don't understand.

765
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:10,145
Why don't they just destroy us?
Why bother with the deception?

766
01:04:10,877 --> 01:04:12,247
Less man power.

767
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:16,151
Less chance of engagement on
their behalf.

768
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:18,886
Less loss of men.

769
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:21,989
They're terraforming
planets.

770
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:26,661
The more destruction they cause, the
more work they give themselves.

771
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:30,332
Their plan is actual quite
efficient, but...

772
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:35,002
What I don't understand si why they're
returning to the bee hive first.

773
01:04:38,939 --> 01:04:40,642
We better get back to
the bunker.

774
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:41,977
Less we need to prepare.

775
01:04:42,009 --> 01:04:44,145
But we will not give up.

776
01:05:08,368 --> 01:05:09,870
Madam President, I have
an idea.

777
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:13,074
It's incredibly simple, but every
test I've run seems to confirm it.

778
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:14,875
Have you made an
analysis of the aliens?

779
01:05:14,908 --> 01:05:15,742
Yes, Madam President.

780
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:17,779
I've mapped most of its
anatomy, and NS.

781
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:19,913
And I believe I can highly
contagious airborne pathogen.

782
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:22,750
And we can infect them, like
passing on a cold.

783
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,819
Do it.
Yes, ma'am.

784
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,928
Sir, the ships are feeling up.

785
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,766
People are passing the barricades
and forcing their way in.

786
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:40,168
Thank you, soldier.

787
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:42,070
Thank you, sir.

788
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,110
What if it's a nice place?

789
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:52,947
The new world they promised.

790
01:05:56,951 --> 01:06:02,324
What if it's a great new alien
place with thing we've never seen?

791
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:09,997
What if we're actually
killing people,

792
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:12,933
by not letting them board
their ships?

793
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:18,040
Do you really think there's a chance
in hell of any of that being true?

794
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,679
No.

795
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:29,418
This is my home.

796
01:06:32,386 --> 01:06:33,855
My country.

797
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:40,062
It's our world.

798
01:06:46,968 --> 01:06:50,504
It maybe over, but I'm
gonna fight till my last breath.

799
01:06:50,538 --> 01:06:51,840
Damn right!

800
01:06:52,873 --> 01:06:54,408
Damn right!

801
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:59,014
You're god damn right.

802
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:02,750
Rally every militia group.

803
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,285
In every city.

804
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:09,223
It's time to blow up
some more alien shit.

805
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:13,194
Everything we got, as
long as we got it.

806
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:26,507
Good work out there, Major Fry.

807
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:28,209
I'm sorry for the loss of
your men.

808
01:07:29,243 --> 01:07:32,046
I will see to it, he receives
the highest posthumous merit.

809
01:07:32,078 --> 01:07:33,848
Thank you, Madam President.

810
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:37,284
Captain, Goddard? Please
explain your pathogen.

811
01:07:37,484 --> 01:07:38,319
Yes.

812
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:41,375
Well, I have successfully
developed an

813
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:45,125
airborne replicating
agent called GS57B.

814
01:07:45,158 --> 01:07:46,693
It's "cooking" right now.

815
01:07:46,727 --> 01:07:50,964
It's highly contagious, and I believe
if we can introduce it aboard the Hive,

816
01:07:50,997 --> 01:07:52,867
it'll be a successful weapon.

817
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:56,270
Could GS57B have
repercussions in humans?

818
01:07:56,303 --> 01:07:58,138
Are we at risk for catching it?

819
01:07:58,172 --> 01:08:00,141
There is a risk.

820
01:08:00,174 --> 01:08:03,044
Now the contagion can't
replicate in our bodies.

821
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:04,513
So it shouldn't be a problem.

822
01:08:05,946 --> 01:08:07,948
But there is no way of
knowing for sure.

823
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:11,352
I believe we have
no other choice.

824
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,089
Our only problem is how we get
it to them?

825
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:16,589
And how do we infect them?

826
01:08:16,623 --> 01:08:20,495
We can outfit the D.C. Transport Ship
with Captain Goddard's viral agent.

827
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:21,930
Send it back to the Hive.

828
01:08:21,962 --> 01:08:24,832
Release it via time
controlled device.

829
01:08:25,065 --> 01:08:27,132
Sounds like a great
idea but why would the

830
01:08:27,133 --> 01:08:29,103
Hive bring a transport
ship back aboard.

831
01:08:29,135 --> 01:08:31,406
We infect the navigation
system with the bug.

832
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,974
Make it appear the ship
isn't functioning properly.

833
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:35,475
It'll have to go back for
maintenance.

834
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:40,281
First Earth has success just lobbing
grenades and C4 timers in the ships,

835
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:41,582
to make them return.

836
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:42,817
We can't do that, General.

837
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:46,054
The heat wave from the blast
will kill off the viral agent.

838
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:49,357
I'll make a virus to infect the
ships computer.

839
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:49,990
I'll get on it.

840
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:51,024
Thank you, Ari.

841
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:52,861
Yes, Ma'am.

842
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:55,997
Captain. Notify me at once
when it's ready.

843
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:57,565
Yes, President Raney.

844
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,007
Clear.

845
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,308
3.

846
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,475
2.

847
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:15,250
Give me the shot.

848
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,484
Mark it.
You're good.

849
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:18,219
3.

850
01:09:18,251 --> 01:09:19,486
2.

851
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:26,508
First Earth has
launched attacks on

852
01:09:26,509 --> 01:09:28,196
transport ships in
several major cities.

853
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:30,966
Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago.

854
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,402
Chancellor Kafka is demanding you
to put a halt to the violence,

855
01:09:34,434 --> 01:09:37,404
as is Prime Minister Avenir,
President Casillas...

856
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:40,074
Let them, Ari. Let them
say what they will.

857
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:41,408
Not my concern at this point.

858
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:42,510
Yes, madam President.

859
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:43,978
Madam President?

860
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,513
The Captain and I are ready.

861
01:09:45,545 --> 01:09:46,580
Is that the contagion?

862
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:48,116
Yes, Ma'am.

863
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:50,251
Very well.

864
01:09:50,283 --> 01:09:51,486
Let's go.

865
01:09:57,325 --> 01:09:59,661
President Raney! The Orions
are contacting us.

866
01:10:00,227 --> 01:10:01,263
Put it on.

867
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:03,364
<i>President Raney.</i>

868
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,101
<i>Other world leaders have
cooperated peacefully.</i>

869
01:10:08,135 --> 01:10:11,072
<i>Still the United States
remains defiant.</i>

870
01:10:12,172 --> 01:10:15,376
<i>There are continued attacks on
our ships.</i>

871
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,080
<i>We had hope to avoid...
Turn it off, Ari.</i>

872
01:10:19,112 --> 01:10:20,581
Yes, President Raney.

873
01:10:25,318 --> 01:10:26,687
We're in.

874
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,125
So far the pheromone is still
allowing us access to the ship.

875
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,332
I'm going to upload the bug into
the navigation system.

876
01:10:37,364 --> 01:10:38,565
Stand by.

877
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:42,036
The virus is set.

878
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:43,103
Got it.

879
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,411
We are go of the GS57B
transponder.

880
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:56,084
And we're going on
maintenance issue.

881
01:10:56,282 --> 01:10:58,018
Time to leave, Captain.
Yes, sir.

882
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:17,405
No.

883
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:20,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

884
01:11:26,313 --> 01:11:28,049
What the matter, Major?

885
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:30,718
They're trying to hack into the
Navigation system.

886
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,220
Who is?

887
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:33,621
The Orions.

888
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:49,403
Madam President?

889
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:51,171
Madam President?

890
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:54,142
They're contacting us again.

891
01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:01,149
<i>President Raney.</i>

892
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:03,718
<i>You will meet with us,
immediately.</i>

893
01:12:04,684 --> 01:12:07,654
<i>You will meet with us,
immediately.</i>

894
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:09,123
Yes.

895
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:11,658
I heard you the first time.

896
01:12:12,358 --> 01:12:14,528
What is the purpose of
this meeting?

897
01:12:15,328 --> 01:12:19,567
<i>Despite our warning,
you continue to resist us.</i>

898
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:23,096
<i>Still we are prepared
to discuss the</i>

899
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:26,173
<i>details of the
relocation of your people.</i>

900
01:12:29,643 --> 01:12:30,508
Alright.

901
01:12:31,378 --> 01:12:32,779
I will come to you.

902
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:34,416
What are you doing,
Meredith?

903
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,381
It's out of the question.
I'll go.

904
01:12:37,382 --> 01:12:39,351
<i>We accept your terms.</i>

905
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:42,390
<i>A transcription will be
sent to your location.</i>

906
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:44,059
Thank you.

907
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,327
I'll take Captain Goddard's
contagion with me.

908
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:49,363
It would be too dangerous,
Madam President.

909
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:52,500
No, they asked for me.

910
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:54,568
I'm the only one that can
get us on that ship.

911
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,639
It's the perfect plan.

912
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:11,119
If we can get at least one of
these aboard the hive,

913
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:13,154
that would be sufficient.

914
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:15,256
Meredith.

915
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:16,823
I'll do it.

916
01:13:16,857 --> 01:13:18,292
The country needs you.

917
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:27,201
Don't mom.

918
01:13:37,944 --> 01:13:39,647
Come on.
Come on.

919
01:13:40,514 --> 01:13:42,884
Major Fry, I'd like for you to
come with me.

920
01:13:43,283 --> 01:13:45,620
Your expertise maybe applicable
in some way.

921
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:49,190
Captain Goddard, I request your
accompany as well.

922
01:13:49,223 --> 01:13:50,524
Yes, Ma'am.

923
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:53,694
The captain and I will wear the
CH5N to conceal our presence.

924
01:13:58,532 --> 01:13:59,800
Very well, gentlemen.

925
01:13:59,832 --> 01:14:00,902
Shall we go?

926
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,706
Madam President.

927
01:14:35,702 --> 01:14:38,505
You wouldn't be second guessing
yourself, would you Captain Goddard?

928
01:14:39,473 --> 01:14:40,675
No, President Raney.

929
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:42,911
It will work.

930
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:46,547
Good.

931
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,418
It better.

932
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:04,631
Here you go, Madam President.

933
01:15:06,966 --> 01:15:08,768
One of these is enough?

934
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:10,437
The pathogen is highly
contagious.

935
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,590
Now Major Fry and I
will go aboard the ship,

936
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,474
and try to put a few
of these on there.

937
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:16,611
Give a few to Agent Taylor,
as well.

938
01:15:17,544 --> 01:15:19,581
Aerosols is distributed
throughout the ship.

939
01:15:20,413 --> 01:15:23,283
But you have to make direct
contact with the Queen.

940
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:26,287
And how long until it
takes effect?

941
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,822
It should be within minutes.

942
01:15:27,854 --> 01:15:28,955
And I'll know?

943
01:15:28,988 --> 01:15:30,892
Yes, Madam President.

944
01:15:31,524 --> 01:15:34,295
The effects are agonizing.

945
01:15:35,962 --> 01:15:36,930
Very well.

946
01:15:36,964 --> 01:15:38,832
I guess I'll just try to keep
them talking.

947
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:17,005
<i>Welcome President Raney.</i>

948
01:16:18,438 --> 01:16:21,375
<i>Follow the corridor to your
left.</i>

949
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:37,859
Let's go.

950
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:45,727
That's the last of
the GS57B bombs.

951
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:54,368
I'm going to see if I can jam the
Orions CMB encrypted signal.

952
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,907
On some ship to ship interference.
In case things go south.

953
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:08,783
<i>Welcome President Raney.</i>

954
01:18:08,815 --> 01:18:10,550
<i>Welcome to my Hive.</i>

955
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:12,053
Who is speaking?

956
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:15,156
Is there one leader among you?

957
01:18:21,795 --> 01:18:25,466
I am speaking,
President Raney.

958
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:35,942
Who are you?

959
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:42,082
<i>I am the leader of this colony.</i>

960
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:46,888
<i>What do you think of my ship?</i>

961
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:51,058
What is all this?

962
01:18:52,091 --> 01:18:55,662
<i>This is the fate of you people.</i>

963
01:18:56,563 --> 01:18:59,200
<i>Our voyage to Earth as well.</i>

964
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:02,202
<i>Human blood is viable,</i>

965
01:19:02,603 --> 01:19:04,872
<i>to replenish our energy source.</i>

966
01:19:05,205 --> 01:19:07,140
You're killing all of them?

967
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:10,144
<i>It is the natural way.</i>

968
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:16,117
<i>One life ends and it contributes
to another cycle.</i>

969
01:19:16,817 --> 01:19:18,653
Then why have you
brought me here?

970
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:26,260
<i>You will allow your people
to aboard our transport ships.</i>

971
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:31,531
<i>And they will replenish our
energy source, here.</i>

972
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:35,002
Why would I help you?

973
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:38,939
Why should I lead my people to
their slaughter?

974
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:45,612
<i>In 4 days, your people are going
to be exterminated.</i>

975
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:49,884
<i>Your race has always
defined nature.</i>

976
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:53,920
<i>You selfishly ravage your
planet.</i>

977
01:19:54,121 --> 01:19:59,960
<i>Imagine you were a species with
no predator.</i>

978
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:04,631
<i>You refuse to accept your place
in the universe.</i>

979
01:20:05,732 --> 01:20:07,702
<i>Accept it now.</i>

980
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:10,170
<i>We are your predator.</i>

981
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:14,242
<i>Surrender.
Absolutely not.</i>

982
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:18,613
<i>We are prepared to offer you a
barter.</i>

983
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:23,116
<i>In exchange for your
cooperation.</i>

984
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:27,854
<i>You and your family will be
spared.</i>

985
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:36,264
<i>You will allow your people
to board our transport ships.</i>

986
01:20:36,697 --> 01:20:41,002
<i>And you and your family will not
be harmed.</i>

987
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:48,009
And where will we be safe?

988
01:20:49,675 --> 01:20:50,810
<i>Here.</i>

989
01:20:50,844 --> 01:20:52,279
<i>Aboard our ship.</i>

990
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:59,153
<i>Until the extermination and
terraforming is complete.</i>

991
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:01,788
<i>This is acceptable.</i>

992
01:21:05,058 --> 01:21:06,794
You leave me no choice.

993
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:10,765
You have a deal.

994
01:21:12,698 --> 01:21:14,301
<i>Most acceptable.</i>

995
01:21:15,736 --> 01:21:19,105
<i>You will allow your people to
board our ships?</i>

996
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:20,274
No.

997
01:21:20,907 --> 01:21:23,978
Not until I know my
family is safe.

998
01:21:26,813 --> 01:21:28,049
Then,

999
01:21:31,151 --> 01:21:32,886
we'll have a deal.

1000
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:42,929
On Earth,

1001
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:47,233
this is the universal gesture of
friendship and agreement.

1002
01:22:02,181 --> 01:22:04,986
<i>You will stop the attacks on our
ships.</i>

1003
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:20,935
We need to get you out of here
right now, Madam President.

1004
01:22:31,044 --> 01:22:32,013
Come on.

1005
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:34,181
Okay.

1006
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:39,053
Madam President?
It's working!

1007
01:22:39,086 --> 01:22:40,187
It's working!

1008
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:50,464
Let's move! Let's move!

1009
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,664
Go!

1010
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,075
Let's go!

1011
01:23:42,948 --> 01:23:44,417
Come on.
Come on.

1012
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:52,358
Now what?

1013
01:23:52,392 --> 01:23:54,461
- There's gotta be a way to override.
- I'll check the hatch.

1014
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:57,732
Just get us out of here, Major.

1015
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:01,835
System override.

1016
01:24:02,368 --> 01:24:04,104
Navigation override.

1017
01:24:05,438 --> 01:24:06,974
Helm override.

1018
01:24:08,073 --> 01:24:09,210
Let's go.

1019
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,511
Captain Goddard?

1020
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:42,510
The Dragonflies are on us.

1021
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:44,010
Stand by.

1022
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:49,816
President Raney's transport
ship is on the way.

1023
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:52,051
And Hive motherships are
collapsing in every city.

1024
01:24:53,153 --> 01:24:54,521
Their defenses are
down.

1025
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:56,556
General, can we scramble
some jets?

1026
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,225
Definitely.

1027
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:39,432
There's only one more dragonfly
in pursuit of the transport ship.

1028
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:42,269
Hang in there.

1029
01:26:02,554 --> 01:26:05,258
Delta 82. Approaching.
Ready to intercept.

1030
01:26:29,482 --> 01:26:31,952
In coming! Look out!
Get down! My god.

1031
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,227
Okay.

1032
01:27:35,415 --> 01:27:37,350
Hey, you did it.

1033
01:27:40,053 --> 01:27:41,689
We all did it.
