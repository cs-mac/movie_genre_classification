1
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:15,201
What are you doing here? Go away.
- What about the child?

2
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,869
Dead.

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,207
Is it still in her womb?
- No, over there.

4
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:20,187
Who are you?
It was dead. That is an undead.

5
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,358
No, I breathed some of my soul
into him. He's not an undead.

6
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:33,120
Take the child and look after him.
I'll come for him in due time.

7
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,626
And woman, if I don't find him here,
I'll cut your head off.

8
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,080
I always keep my word.

9
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,430
God is my witness, lord. It was dead.

10
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,846
And then this man
gave it some of his soul.

11
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,978
Is that what he said?
- Yes.

12
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,648
That he gave it some of his soul?

13
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,325
Yes.

14
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,305
Give it to me.

15
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:27,564
He said he'll cut my head off if I lose it.
- I'll cut your head off if you don't give it.

16
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,522
Give it to me.

17
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,990
Now go away and close the door.

18
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,167
Forgive me.

19
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,151
Now let our souls
compete against one another.

20
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:25,178
Did Sydal at least get wounded?
- No.

21
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,688
He can't be far yet. I came too late.

22
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,357
Will you take the child?
- It can grow up at the blacksmith's.

23
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,617
And'?
- He's frail.

24
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,279
To survive the winter,
he'll have to show iron mettle.

25
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:49,998
Let him stay without a name. If he's still
alive in spring, let his name be 'lsenhart'.

26
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,432
15 years later

27
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,116
What are you looking at, lsenhart?
Come.

28
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,955
Here.

29
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:38,171
Now listen to me. Those are daughters
from the House of Laurin.

30
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:43,635
Someone like you mustn't even
think about them. Keep working.

31
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,367
What are you staring at my sister for?

32
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,549
You know each other. My son Konrad.

33
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:24,384
Chlodio, lsenhart will as of now only
be at your disposal in the afternoon.

34
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,846
Walther von Ascisberg
will educate the two.

35
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:32,809
You will receive something
usually reserved for clergy and nobles...

36
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,647
namely education.
That's a great privilege.

37
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,187
What is a 'privilege'?

38
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,238
That word comes from a language
you will soon learn: Latin.

39
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,298
The preponderances of one of these
humours determines one's inclination.

40
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,631
If someone has too much blood,
he's the sanguine type.

41
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,797
The phlegmatic suffers
from too much slime.

42
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:12,140
If yellow bile is dominant, he's choleric.
Excessive black bile spells melancholy.

43
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,728
'Give me a fixed point in space,
and I'll move the earth.'

44
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,484
Archimedes said that.
- Was he a soldier?

45
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,067
No, a scholar.

46
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:28,235
Lever action allows us to exert
great force with only little effort.

47
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,658
Enough for today.

48
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:39,664
Et habeo clades.

49
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,456
Claves.

50
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,460
Et habeo claves.

51
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,386
One, two.
Stop striking like a girl, dammit.

52
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,894
Now listen, I want to hear you scream.

53
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,692
Is there anything forbidden in there?
- Yes...no.

54
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,078
Tell me, what does it say?

55
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,283
That's Lancelot, by Chrétien de Troyes.

56
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,553
Anna, stay here.
My father will beat me black and blue.

57
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:46,026
No, we're not going this way.
- Yes, we are. I get to decide.

58
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,124
Come.

59
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,634
For me?

60
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,724
It's beautiful, lsenhart.
- It's a wedding gift.

61
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,987
You know about it?
- Konrad told me.

62
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:32,026
You'll do well with Oliver von Schundeler.
- You think so?

63
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,786
Konrad says he has connections
and owns land.

64
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,074
And he has 42 years behind him.
Von Schﬂndeler is an old man.

65
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,001
I don't want to be his wife.

66
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,756
Oliver von Schundeler expects a virgin.

67
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:15,035
I don't just want to be the one who...
- Sometimes you can be a real idiot.

68
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,685
I'm a serf, Anna.
- I'd rather flee than marry anyone else.

69
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,907
You'll be pleased. Look here,
goods from all over the world.

70
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:58,946
I have salt from Salzburg,
cloth from Bruges.

71
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,959
This might interest the fair ladies.

72
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,246
One pinch a day
helps against skinniness.

73
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,213
You'll gain weight faster
and easily get the shape you desire.

74
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:17,427
Lies, all lies. All that stuff did for me
was give me constipation.

75
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:23,391
Honoured Lady of Laurin, here, a sample.
Would you like to try it?

76
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,978
You owe me money,
Alexander von Westheim.

77
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,569
At six o'clock?
- Look at him.

78
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,699
Yes.
- The Jews is at a loss for words.

79
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:41,409
But I told you, it only works
if you don't sin for three days.

80
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,164
What extraordinary beauty
graces the daughter of Laurin.

81
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,301
She has no need of this potion.

82
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,631
The Lord is the beginning and end.
His will is also inherent in the seasons.

83
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,550
In spring the plants sprout,
in summer they bloom.

84
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:07,644
In fall they lose colour and in winter they
wither, so that it may all start over again.

85
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,807
Alpha and Omega.

86
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,353
I think the trees shed their leaves
so as not to dry out in winter.

87
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,322
Of all your ideas in recent years, this is
the most absurd. How can you say that?

88
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,660
If you squeeze a leaf in summer,
sap comes out.

89
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:28,042
But in fall the leaves dry out.
The question is: Where does the sap go?

90
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,623
Well?

91
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:36,635
In spring the tree sucks up water
and distributes it to the leaves.

92
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,843
In winter it absorbs the water again,
so it doesn't dry out.

93
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,475
The only explanation is God's will,
nothing else.

94
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,356
Are trees creatures? Do they have
muscles? Can they draw humours?

95
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,815
Why not? They also distribute
water to the leaves. That's why...

96
00:14:53,976 --> 00:15:00,325
That's why until seven o'clock
you will recite the penitential psalm.

97
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,784
Today? Today I can't.
- And now until eight o'clock.

98
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,460
Anna?

99
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,724
Anna?

100
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:29,368
He inserted it here, one phalanx deep.

101
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,161
And then he pressed in further,
from right to left.

102
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:39,629
Do you have to touch her?
- What I'm touching is not Anna, lsenhart.

103
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,263
What constitutes her is her soul,
which has gone up to meet its Maker.

104
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,801
I'm only examining her shell,
her mortal form.

105
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:55,018
He inserted it here, till he realized
the blade couldn't go deep enough.

106
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,230
Is that really important?
- I don't know.

107
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,987
This wouldn't have happened
to an experienced killer.

108
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,946
Maybe it was his first murder.

109
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,708
Here he slit the skin open.
But at the ribs he didn't use a knife.

110
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,838
No, these aren't knife wounds.
He smashed them. But why?

111
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,801
You can't do that.
- Oh yes, in fact I have to.

112
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,024
No semen.

113
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,406
He didn't rape her.

114
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:57,495
It wasn't Anna he desired, but her heart.

115
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,789
Isenhart...

116
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,049
the murderer took Anna's heart.

117
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,806
My sister's murderer, we got him.

118
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,680
We got him.

119
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,602
Call the guards.

120
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,346
Quiet.

121
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,141
Did you lay hands on my daughter?

122
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,650
Speak.
- Please, I...

123
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:10,530
I have nothing to do with it. I'd never lay
hands on your daughter, I swear to God.

124
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,460
What's wrong with you?

125
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,179
I gave that stone
as a present to your daughter.

126
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,384
I forged the bezel myself.

127
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,183
A present.

128
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,359
Where did you get it?

129
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,740
You won't believe me.

130
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,534
Isenhart, heat up an iron.
- No, wait.

131
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:07,590
Wilbrand von Maulbronn.
He gave me the stone. The archbishop.

132
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,048
Let him burn for his impudence.
- I swear.

133
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,180
You're lying.
- Wilbrand von Maulbronn gave it to me.

134
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,219
Archbishop Wilbrand
is after your vineyards.

135
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:24,141
He will use the merest trifle,
and he has the protection of the emperor.

136
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,773
Maulbronn Abbey

137
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:50,254
Hand the traveling salesman over to me,
Sigimund of Laurin...

138
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,671
and I will draw the truth out of him.

139
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:59,593
He accuses you of giving him this stone.

140
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,437
It belonged to my daughter.
- And you give credence to that man?

141
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,397
I don't give him anything.

142
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,780
I think he wants to take revenge on me.

143
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:24,826
He threatened my treasurer
and I had him chased off my land.

144
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:32,217
I can assure you
I didn't conduct business with that Jew.

145
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:39,849
That's for the impudence of accusing me
of the murder of your daughter.

146
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,265
Konrad.

147
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,435
Isn't it?

148
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,315
Now leave.

149
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,451
He won't forget about it. It's just the thing
Wilbrand von Maulbronn was waiting for.

150
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,752
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have taken you along.

151
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,341
On your knees.

152
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,687
Pray.

153
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,851
May God give strength
to the righteous one.

154
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,897
Whoever drops his arms first
is accused of injustice by God.

155
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:10,849
Please, Lord, don't abandon me.
Don't punish the wrong man.

156
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,915
God has passed judgment.

157
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:38,426
I'm the wrong man.
You're killing the wrong man.

158
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:46,226
Please, Lord, have mercy.

159
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,902
Quiet at last.

160
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,659
Why is he allowed to breathe?
Doesn't it prolong his suffering?

161
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:16,081
He'll freeze to death soon, lsenhart.
The pipe isn't meant for breathing.

162
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:21,468
The soul must be able to leave the heart
and rise up to heaven through the mouth.

163
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,721
Why?

164
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:29,056
Otherwise he'll climb out of his grave
and come after us for revenge.

165
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,020
What news does he bring?

166
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,690
Wilbrand von Maulbronn
demands your surrender.

167
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:51,366
What did you answer?
- That he'll have to deal with me first.

168
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,375
Konrad, come here.

169
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:08,766
You look after your mother and sister.
lsenhart, stay on his side.

170
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,177
When the gate falls, flee together.

171
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,393
If you surrender the castle,
Maulbronn will be forced to be lenient.

172
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,355
I only serve God and the Emperor.

173
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,916
Draw your bows, fire.

174
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,094
Father, we need every man.

175
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:54,103
I'm not your father, Isenhart.
I raised you, but I'm not your father.

176
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,808
What's that?

177
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,649
So who is my father?
- You don't want to know.

178
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,859
Wait.

179
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,710
Fire, now.

180
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,147
The gate is down. They're here.

181
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,541
Mother.

182
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
Help

183
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,427
Keep still.

184
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,825
Sophia.

185
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,034
Did he hurt you?

186
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:05,124
Get out. Flee through the escape tunnel
and wait there.

187
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,248
Get out.
- Come.

188
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,046
Konrad.

189
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,997
I'll give your son a fair trial...

190
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:47,662
and sell your wife and daughter
for a good price...

191
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,832
so that they'll serve decent people.

192
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,802
Come, we can make it.

193
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,523
There they are.

194
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,948
Come.
- Konrad.

195
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,623
Konrad?

196
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,576
What happened?

197
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:38,092
What happened? He needs treatment.
We can't ride like this.

198
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,506
We don't have time.

199
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,596
Where are mother and father?
- Let's go.

200
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,434
Are they coming? Where are they?
Where are mother and father?

201
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,315
No, I have to get them.
- We have to go.

202
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,105
Let's go.
- Mother, no.

203
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,490
Go on, keep going.

204
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:06,248
Go on. Keep going.

205
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,092
Keep going, I'll detain them.

206
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,812
Isenhart, come.
- Go away.

207
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,348
Don't do that. Come with us.
- Go away.

208
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,273
Is the escape tunnel still free?
- Laurin Castle has fallen.

209
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,355
What?

210
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,278
And Sigimund?

211
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:29,574
Go away. Leave and go to Spira.
Wilbrand won't find you there.

212
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,914
Five years later

213
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,255
Heiligster near Spira

214
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,244
Look who's coming.

215
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,462
Here. My dear brother.

216
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,051
Are you well?
- Yes. You?

217
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:28,216
I am now you're here.
- Good to see you again, lsenhart.

218
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,141
The horses need water.
- Put me down.

219
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,931
Konrad, keep your hands off of her.

220
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,944
For you.

221
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,544
How long are you staying?
- We have to go back to Spira tomorrow.

222
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,642
I think I have one.

223
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:22,403
Can you help me?
- Gently.

224
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,367
One, two... Now.

225
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,754
Maybe we caught it in its sleep.
-'From sleep to death is but a small step.'

226
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,960
Aristotle said that.

227
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:55,477
'Love is one soul in two bodies.'

228
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,767
I think that's his most beautiful statement.

229
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,574
I read it somewhere.

230
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,769
Watchmen of Spira, what has happened?
- My daughter.

231
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,190
What has happened?
- One of the cows is gravid.

232
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:54,737
Johanna, my daughter,
spent the night with her.

233
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,668
I'm going to have a closer look.

234
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:07,083
Who had she been with?
- With no one. Johanna was a virgin.

235
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,671
Her heart's been cutout.

236
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,472
No.
- My friend has to do that.

237
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:21,264
How else can we find out if he raped her?

238
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,026
She hasn't been violated. Everyone
not related to the deceased, get out.

239
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,857
Go on, get out.

240
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,030
Go on, beat it.

241
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,826
Two stab wounds.

242
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,798
What are you doing?
- I want to see if she defended herself.

243
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,681
There's no blood or skin under her nails.

244
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:03,394
What's the difference? She's dead.
- It suggests she knew the murderer.

245
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,808
He could come so close...
- Stop.

246
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,647
Because she trusted him.
- Who are you?

247
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:12,235
My lord and I were called for. Gunther
von Martensen is the doctor of Spira.

248
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,025
I'm his aide, Henning von der Braake.
Who are you?

249
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:19,697
Konrad, watchman of Spira.
- I'm lsenhart.

250
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,161
We serve as watchmen
and happened to walk by.

251
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,373
You're no longer needed.
I'm going to examine the victim.

252
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,504
Are you the mother?
- Yes.

253
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,963
Did you find her?
- The watchman's already examined her.

254
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,263
Is that so? What did you conclude?
That she's dead?

255
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:43,145
Johanna defended herself. I found red
hair in her hand. The killer had red hair.

256
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:49,314
He killed her with two <i>stabs</i> in her neck.
But he didn't murder her out of lust.

257
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,730
The girl is still intact.
He wanted her heart.

258
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,658
He cut her torso open
and amputated her left breast.

259
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,826
The costal arches were separated
with a coarse-toothed tool, like a saw.

260
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,462
And he took her heart.

261
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,218
Why are you leaving?
What am I supposed to do?

262
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,602
You can bury your daughter.

263
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,688
Does anyone with red hair work here,
or has a stranger been here?

264
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,356
A man was here.
A man with red hair and one arm.

265
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:39,402
Do you know him?
- No, he didn't mention his name.

266
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,288
He only said he wanted to cross
the Rhine and go to Wurttemberg.

267
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,244
We can still catch up with him.

268
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,833
He has a headstart of a few hours.
And he's heading south.

269
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,340
No, I think he's heading north.

270
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,053
He hopes to send the search parties
the wrong way.

271
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,432
If he's heading north,
Spira will be his next stop.

272
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,343
So, off to Spira.

273
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,059
Off to Spira.

274
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,455
Did anyone with red hair enter the city?
- Yes, two hours ago.

275
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,618
And he didn't leave the city again?
- No.

276
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:34,631
Close the gate.
Go on, close the gate.

277
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,550
Nothing.
Did you see a man with red hair?

278
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,137
If you see a one-armed redhead,
tell the watchmen.

279
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:48,645
All gates are shut and under guard.
- Alright, spread out and find this man.

280
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,852
Search every tavern,
every inn, every barn.

281
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,783
Hey, get out of here.
- I'm going.

282
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,094
Alexander von Westheim didn't kill Anna.
- He did have the stone.

283
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,507
Maybe Wilbrand von Maulbronn had it.
- Westheim just wanted to save his skin.

284
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,767
We have a clear pattern here.

285
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,806
The murderer didn't rape the girls
and he took their hearts.

286
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:37,065
He actually tore their hearts out.
- But why?

287
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:44,034
Two identical proceedings,
establishing a pattern to the murders.

288
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:48,117
And if it's the same murderer,
Alexander von Westheim was innocent.

289
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,580
That would mean that we buried
an innocent man alive.

290
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,710
It was a judgment of God.

291
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,089
He's nowhere to be found.
- We went to every tavern, every inn.

292
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:02,127
He entered Spira and didn't leave again,
yet he's untraceable.

293
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,387
As if the earth had swallowed him up.

294
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,719
He must be here somewhere.
We have to find him.

295
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,390
Konrad, weren't you at the lepers' lately?
- I was indeed.

296
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:22,610
If nothing has fallen off, you can come in.
- No, I can't.

297
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,457
Leeks and chervil.
I learned that from the Arabs.

298
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,172
But they're our enemies.
- Sure.

299
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,588
I learned it from them
before they became our enemies.

300
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,058
Isenhart, back on your feet again?

301
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,188
Did your aide find out anything?
- No.

302
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,441
Henning is at the city archives.

303
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,532
Isenhart.

304
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,911
Good that you're here.

305
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:19,796
Follow me. Come, look what I've found.

306
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:27,714
Here: Spira, the year of our Lord 1193.
- On September 24 a murder took place.

307
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:33,136
You surprise me, not for the first time.
A watchman who knows how to read.

308
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,521
Latin, even.
- Favourable circumstances.

309
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,647
I'm sure.

310
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,060
A year ago, during a fight by the river, a
certain Michael von Bremen killed a man.

311
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,446
Von Bremen has only one arm
and flaming red hair.

312
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,659
He lost his arm
in the Battle of Dorylaeum.

313
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,496
I'm sure he's our man.
He's lord of a castle at Tarup.

314
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:02,459
Does it say from when till when
Michael von Bremen was here?

315
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,422
Yes, why?
- If what I think is true...

316
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,088
an unsolved murder of a virgin
took place during that time.

317
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,633
Of course.

318
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,977
Here. Here: 'Heart removed.'

319
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:23,894
Just two days after the fight by the river.
-'Murderer unknown.'

320
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:29,524
If he's not insane...
What if he's possessed by the devil?

321
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,948
Dig her up?
- No.

322
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,414
Konrad.
- No, you can't dig up the dead.

323
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:44,172
It disturbs their eternal rest
and they'll come to haunt you.

324
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,301
We'll take the risk.
- Come.

325
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:53,886
If you get caught,
you'll be burned at the stake. Not me.

326
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,806
What is it?

327
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,152
How was she killed? Check.

328
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,324
Great, Isenhart.
Desecration of a corpse as well.

329
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,331
Four <i>stabs</i> to the back of her head.

330
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,135
Let's ride on to Tarup.

331
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:55,202
He slit Anna's throat.
After that, he refined his method.

332
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,205
You mean that he hones his skills?
- Yes.

333
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:05,245
He stabbed the girl at the cemetery
four times, the girl in the hay just twice

334
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,004
You think he eats them?
Their hearts, I mean.

335
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:18,183
In the Orient they say that you take
over all your enemy's good qualities...

336
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:22,266
when you eat his heart.
- Only a godless people can think so.

337
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,228
So what does he expect
from three young women?

338
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,815
Not strength, for sure.
- Virginity, perhaps.

339
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,106
You're right. All three were virgins.

340
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,569
At least he could assume they were.

341
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,996
The question remains: Why does he kill
virgins? Why does he want their hearts?

342
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:48,254
I said there's a pattern to his murders.
That also goes for his victims.

343
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,258
They're young, inviolate and...
- Female.

344
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:06,436
A malicious weapon, the cross bow.
One shouldn't use it against Christians.

345
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,775
The man we're after is no Christian.

346
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:18,785
People say that since '91 the dead
have been walking around at Tarup.

347
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,196
People say many things.

348
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,337
Many serfs of the Lord of Tarup
starved to death at the time.

349
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:33,716
The ones who survived ate the dead.

350
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,134
The Lord himself devoured three hearts.

351
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,971
One of those hearts belonged to a Hun.

352
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:50,142
A man so big and strong,
the like of him had never been seen.

353
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,061
Then something strange happened.

354
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,532
The Lord was suddenly able
to run as fast as a horse.

355
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,446
And he was able to bend iron.
- Nonsense.

356
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,290
He was much stronger than before.

357
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:12,673
This Lord was Michael von Bremen.
The one-armed man.

358
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,138
Tarup Castle

359
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,819
Tarup.

360
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,060
We'll split up.
- Alright.

361
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,824
During the famine,
they ate their fellow men here.

362
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:33,833
Can you imagine?
I mean, if you hadn't eaten for a week...

363
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:38,295
and we were alone?
- I don't think you taste well, Konrad.

364
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,255
Good to know.

365
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,046
Over here.

366
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,135
What have you got?

367
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,265
Here's an entrance.
- Let's go inside.

368
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,169
Gijlnther?
- Yes?

369
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,435
That's incredible.

370
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,951
What knowledge.

371
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,999
Is that why he sinned against creation?
- What is that?

372
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,128
Maybe the course of blood
through our body.

373
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:05,345
He's investigating the human body.
- Is that why he kills? Out of curiosity?

374
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:11,260
No, we have no disemboweled victims.
- That's sick. The man is a monster.

375
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,803
Monstrous only
because the Church forbids it.

376
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,394
They're creatures of God, also in death.
He had no right.

377
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,480
Their souls had already gone up, Konrad.

378
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,281
The dead have no use
for their mortal shell.

379
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,363
That's true, Konrad.

380
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,072
Do you somehow admire this butcher?
- Of course not.

381
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:42,132
But I have understanding,
understanding for scientific curiosity.

382
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:48,092
This here, this is progress.
This is a mark of the future.

383
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:51,383
This man has inestimably
valuable knowledge.

384
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:57,352
He can probably treat the ill better than
the clergy with their four-humour theory.

385
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:01,939
But he sinned. It's against God's will
to lay one's hands on His creatures.

386
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,695
Who says so?
- The Church.

387
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:09,529
These drawings provide answers
to important questions.

388
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,492
But we live in a time
in which we have to swallow everything.

389
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:18,581
In which you can't ask questions and
everything that happens is God's will.

390
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,665
But it is, isn't it?
- No.

391
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,544
God's will doesn't explain everything.

392
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:33,508
God's will doesn't explain
why the trees shed their leaves in fall.

393
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:39,097
If we'd only study birds
and their flight movement carefully...

394
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:45,361
we might just learn how to fly ourselves.
But just thinking that is already forbidden.

395
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:51,026
Because otherwise they'd dry out.
- What?

396
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,245
Yes.

397
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,783
The trees.

398
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,419
They shed their leaves
because otherwise they'd dry out.

399
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,586
I know it sounds absurd...
- Not at all.

400
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:11,300
It's the most sensible explanation.
We're not chasing a lunatic.

401
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,716
We're chasing a man of learning,
maybe a genius.

402
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,943
What are you doing in my home?

403
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:46,419
You only have one arm to contend with,
but three hearts.

404
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,642
He's downstairs.

405
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,028
Blood.
- There's more over there.

406
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,408
If there is no other exit,
he'll come this way again.

407
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,665
I'll stay here.

408
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,424
Excuse me.

409
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:39,569
Gunther, careful. He can be anywhere.
- Let's keep searching upstairs.

410
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,835
He took his own life.

411
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:01,567
Come, lsenhart.
There's nothing for us to do here.

412
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,210
Why did he hang himself?
I don't understand.

413
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:25,634
In Spira they'd have quartered him for
his crimes. So he'd have died anyway.

414
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,643
In any case, your sister's death
has been avenged.

415
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,936
I'll miss your company.

416
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:40,481
I feel the same way.
- I can accompany you part of the way.

417
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,513
What are we doing here?
- Just a little rest stop.

418
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,628
Hieronymus, Maria, they're here.

419
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,138
Sophia of Laurin,
Henning van der Braake.

420
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,224
What did you bring'?
- I'm glad to see you.

421
00:57:54,805 --> 00:58:00,062
Grain, flints, salt, dried fish,
flour and dried fruit.

422
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,400
Come.
- Excellent.

423
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,530
Take care of the horses.

424
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,909
Come, take off your shirt.

425
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,467
You're very fond of him.

426
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:31,434
We grew up together.
The blacksmith raised him.

427
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,851
Is he an orphan?

428
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,821
His origins are obscure.
- He's an undead.

429
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,947
Undead?
- Yes.

430
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:53,740
What do you mean?
- Why don't you go and feed the hens?

431
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,213
Chitchat, nothing more.
- Who is his father?

432
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,877
Why does that interest you?
-lsenhart can't just read and write.

433
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:10,844
Most people aren't able to see past
their own life, into the world at large.

434
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,134
But he is.

435
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,763
I know.

436
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,104
And you?

437
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,441
We have to go.

438
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,728
His name was Michael von Bremen.

439
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,606
Him.

440
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,781
He also fought at Dorylaeum.

441
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,573
He lost his arm at Dorylaeum.

442
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:28,251
How do you know the killer had red hair?
- One of the victims defended herself.

443
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,225
We found these drawings...

444
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,726
on Michael von Bremen.

445
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,949
You're suspecting someone else.

446
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,452
Yes.

447
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:10,217
But he doesn't have red hair.

448
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:24,224
Have you ever met a living dead?
- No.

449
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,982
Then you may just be about to.

450
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:34,571
What's that in front of your eyes?
- A lens.

451
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:39,990
That's not a lance. It has no point.
- It's beryl, a rock crystal.

452
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:45,753
You can use it to magnify things.
My eyes are growing weak, you see.

453
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,039
Here, look for yourself.

454
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:54,761
Perhaps people will suspend glasses
like this in front of their eyes one day.

455
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,429
It wasn't Michael von Bremen.

456
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,312
Our man disguises himself.

457
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,900
He colours his hair before murdering.

458
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:53,065
Here.
-'The Non-Existence of God'?

459
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:02,030
Yes.
It was written by an extraordinary man.

460
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:08,669
'The real world can only be understood
by rejecting God as an explanation.

461
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:14,175
Anyone who answers a question
by invoking God's will just doesn't know.

462
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,887
The way to knowledge
is paved by curiosity and inquiry...

463
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:23,892
not by faith and dogma.
Inquiry means movement...

464
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:28,021
faith means stagnation,
for faith is content with ignorance.'

465
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,484
Sydal von Friedberg wrote that.

466
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,444
The non-existence of God.

467
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:49,118
He wrote it right here. Ever heard of him?
- No.

468
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,667
We were acquainted.

469
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:58,798
We both took part
in the crusade to Jerusalem.

470
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:06,685
After the Battle of Dorylaeum,
Michael von Bremen was badly injured...

471
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,473
and Sydal moved to Toledo, in Iberia.

472
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:14,518
He came back a changed man.
- Changed in what way?

473
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:21,613
He'd lost his faith. Sydal had become
an atheist, without hope of life eternal.

474
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:27,698
Then he started killing.
Virgins, whose heart he'd take.

475
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:34,963
He did just what Anna's murderer did.
- Yes.

476
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,340
Let go of me.
- Konrad.

477
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,472
Why? Walther, speak up.
- He didn't tell me.

478
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:51,355
You also encountered him once.
You owe your life to him.

479
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:55,484
I think I'd have known.
- No, you can't. You were stillborn.

480
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,940
You already saw the hereafter once.

481
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,115
What?

482
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:10,624
Shortly after your birth, a man breathed
life into you, and your heart beat again.

483
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:15,458
That's sorcery.
- Oh no, not necessarily.

484
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:29,260
Your mother had died. I brought you to
Laurin Castle. The blacksmith raised you.

485
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,143
But you owe your life to that man.

486
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,478
To Sydal von Friedberg?
- Yes.

487
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:40,020
Why did he do that?
- He was your father.

488
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,317
Isenhart.

489
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,962
And who was my mother?

490
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,508
Who was my mother?

491
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:14,684
Her...her name was Loretta.

492
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,357
I personally...

493
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,066
She was a virgin.

494
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:29,741
Sydal von Friedberg raped her,
and she died after giving birth to you.

495
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,997
Isenhart, it...

496
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,876
The son of a beast.

497
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,476
What is that?

498
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:00,145
I don't know. I...

499
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,234
I don't know what he wanted
to tell us with that.

500
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,825
I don't know.

501
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:17,831
To Toledo? Do you realize
it'll take months to get there?

502
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:23,590
It's where my father became a murderer.
- What do you hope to find there?

503
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:30,844
I have to know
if we're chasing my father's ghost.

504
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:35,886
What's the motive? Why the murders?
We couldn't ask Michael von Bremen.

505
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:41,559
And you think Toledo has the answers?
- He left Toledo as a changed man.

506
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:46,901
The answer lies there.
My father and Anna's death are related.

507
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,610
Isenhart.

508
01:07:54,946 --> 01:08:01,579
What happened at Dorylaeum? You didn't
just come home, did you? I have to know.

509
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:12,302
Michael von Bremen had lost an arm in
the battle. He was more dead than alive.

510
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:18,934
He'd saved your father's life, so your
father felt responsible for von Bremen.

511
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,019
They'd captured a Turkish doctor.

512
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:26,607
He offered to help von Bremen,
in exchange for his freedom.

513
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,693
He also demanded...

514
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:36,284
the heart of one of the dead,
of a strong man.

515
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,871
You got into a quarrel with my father.
- Yes.

516
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:46,382
The next day Sydal and the doctor had
disappeared with one dead man's heart.

517
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:53,009
Did my father and this doctor
go to Toledo?

518
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,683
Yes.
- What was his name?

519
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,013
Ibn Al-Hariq.

520
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,818
Are there any more truths?

521
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:13,154
Anything you haven't told me?
- No.

522
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,694
Isenhart.

523
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,378
I got it from...

524
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,633
My father gave it to me.

525
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,971
It protects its bearer.

526
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:47,059
Since I have no biological son...

527
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:11,542
May it protect you on your way to Toledo.

528
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:39,619
Sophia, lsenhart and Konrad are here.
Come with me.

529
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,429
One day Anna brought me
a seashell from the market.

530
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,845
When you put it to your ear,
you heard the sea.

531
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:10,392
I don't really know, of course.
I've never been at the sea.

532
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,113
I hear rushing.

533
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,074
That's what the sea
is supposed to sound like.

534
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:27,910
Isenhart, if you had the choice,
where would you like to live?

535
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:33,206
Here or by the sea?
- In the future.

536
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,881
In the future.

537
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:46,683
Do you still think of Anna often?

538
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,274
Always when I see you.

539
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,738
But you're not Anna.

540
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,574
Don't forget me.

541
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:16,837
How could I forget so much grace?
- What grace? The grace of her behind?

542
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,883
How can you be so coarse?

543
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:26,635
Isenhart, you lost a father twice.

544
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:33,025
I'd ride to the end of the world to spend
an hour with mine, while yours still lives.

545
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,481
Go to Toledo.

546
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:40,865
Don't wait.
Go at once and don't give up.

547
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:45,369
Don't give up.
At least you find your peace.

548
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,873
We should go.

549
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:53,081
Take care of that foolish brother of mine.
- I promise I will.

550
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,671
And of yourself.

551
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:57,308
How did they wind up here?
- Children's Crusade.

552
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,319
They followed faith
rather than knowledge.

553
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,849
Do you see that?
- I'm so hungry I can't see.

554
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:20,358
Moors, Jews and Christians.
And they're not at each other's throats.

555
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:26,731
You're right. I don't like this city either.

556
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,087
I need some bread. I'm so hungry.

557
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:48,595
Bread, my friend. Please, have some.
Thank you. You're very generous.

558
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:53,725
Here, olives. Please try.
Try before you buy. Very good, really.

559
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:59,060
I'm thirsty.
- Thirsty? Orange, very good for thirst.

560
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,770
Thank you, friend.

561
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:12,569
My friend, you have to peel it first.
You don't eat the skin.

562
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,581
Ibn Al-Hariq, does he still live in Toledo?

563
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,333
Who?
- Not so fast.

564
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,287
Friends...

565
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:32,297
He often stayed at the fortress.
You can see it from that crossing.

566
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,290
Draw your bows.

567
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,756
Muslims.

568
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,923
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

569
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,765
We are Konrad of Laurin
and lsenhart...of Laurin.

570
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,727
We're here to talk to lbn AI-Hariq.
- Hand over your weapons.

571
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:30,321
We need our weapons,
to decapitate a couple of infidels.

572
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:43,000
Who told you where to find lbn Al-Hariq?
- Some merchant.

573
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,958
His name?
- We don't know.

574
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,881
Kill them.
- No.

575
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,713
I'm lsenhart, Sydal von Friedberg's son.

576
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,341
Let them go.

577
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,138
The undead child.

578
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:11,696
Gentlemen,
lbn Al-Hariq left us two years ago.

579
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:17,577
He was a great philosopher,
and an even greater doctor.

580
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:25,334
But I'm sure you didn't undertake
your long journey without a reason.

581
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:30,373
I'm here on account of my father,
Sydal von Friedberg.

582
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,169
After the crusade he came here,
together with your master.

583
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:40,968
When he returned to the Holy Empire,
he started murdering women.

584
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:49,109
What happened is terrible.
- What took place before my father left?

585
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:53,066
Their conversations
revolved around the human soul.

586
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,529
Around the question
whether it is immortal.

587
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:02,531
And where it's located.
- In the heart?

588
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:09,545
That was the conviction of both of them.
But there was no certainty, of course.

589
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:14,630
I remember very well
that it almost made them ill.

590
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:18,592
They believed that what constitutes us...

591
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:26,434
the I, that this I is located in the soul,
or even is the soul...

592
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:38,150
chained to a mortal shell.
That's how your father called it.

593
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:42,536
Did Al-Hariq and my father think
you could see the soul?

594
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:46,916
No, they thought...

595
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:53,669
it was invisible,
at least to the human eye.

596
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:59,383
Did they also talk about purity?
- Yes.

597
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,550
The purer the soul, the more valuable.
That's what they said.

598
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,535
Why did my father leave?

599
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:39,427
They got into an argument, unfortunately.

600
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:46,509
Your father had crossed a limit.

601
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,595
You understand?

602
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:56,023
He was possessed.
- My father wanted to investigate the soul.

603
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,698
He wanted to watch a soul escape.

604
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,236
Yes.

605
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:24,426
What is this here?
- An exchange.

606
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:28,434
Between the East and the West.
A bazar of knowledge.

607
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,321
Scholars no longer believe
the soul is located in the heart.

608
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,734
But instead?
- In the brain, behind the eyes.

609
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,914
Are there doctors here as well?
- Those without hope come here.

610
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,542
Doctors try out new methods
and ointments on them.

611
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,088
This room is yours
for as long as you wish to stay.

612
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:14,896
How do you call that knot?

613
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:19,526
That's a cross knot.
It comes from seafaring.

614
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,109
Your name is lsenhart, right?

615
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,654
That's correct.

616
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,872
And you?
- I overheard your talk with Khamud.

617
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,209
Did you know my father?
- Oh yes.

618
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,587
Your father is alive.

619
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,218
My father is alive?

620
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:51,509
I was told my father was dead.
- By Walther von Ascisberg, right?

621
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:56,932
Why would Walther von Ascisberg...
- Lie?

622
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:03,980
Walther didn't kill Sydal that day,
but he captured him.

623
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:09,027
He let him live under three conditions.
- What conditions?

624
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:14,498
That he'd never set foot
on German soil again...

625
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,750
that he'd stop murdering...

626
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:22,708
and that he'd never reveal himself
to his son <i>as</i> his father.

627
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:34,184
Isenhart, you won't believe it...
- I've just...

628
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,156
Wilbrand von Maulbronn.
What is he doing here?

629
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:55,156
Inside these walls
no one but me carries a weapon.

630
01:23:56,657 --> 01:24:01,208
So if you need to settle anything,
settle it outside the gates.

631
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:19,097
Wilbrand von Maulbronn...
- Don't let him provoke you.

632
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:30,442
I'm surprised to see you back alive,
young Laurin.

633
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:43,037
You can remedy that tomorrow at dawn
outside the gate.

634
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,753
You and me, if you're man enough.

635
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,841
What do you want, bastard?

636
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:03,479
I've never seen a dead man on two feet.
Interesting place. A lot of soul searching.

637
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:13,030
Finally, lsenhart. Now Wilbrand von
Maulbronn can't hide behind his lord.

638
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:18,163
What's he doing here anyway?
Here in Toledo, at the Puente?

639
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:21,542
I have no idea.
- It can't be a coincidence.

640
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:26,877
First my father was here, now Wilbrand.
What brings the archbishop here?

641
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,633
We always run into him
in places of death.

642
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:35,473
Maybe I'll let him live long enough
for you to ask him.

643
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:40,228
He won't wait that long, Konrad.
He won't wait that long.

644
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,199
What's the matter?

645
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,912
Konrad of Laurin.

646
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,626
It's my father's blade you feel.

647
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:24,939
You get the horses, I get the weapons.
- No, you get the horses.

648
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:31,771
What was Wilbrand doing in Toledo?
- You killed him before we could ask.

649
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:36,317
Your father lives. Maybe he committed
the murders. Or somebody copied him.

650
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:39,532
The only one we can ask is Walther.

651
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,185
Gerhard.

652
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,565
Walther von Ascisberg is dead.
- What?

653
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:22,162
Since when?
- A month ago.

654
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:28,794
He had business in Spira. He must
have been attacked on his way back.

655
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:34,880
He was found dead by the roadside.
- And the murderer?

656
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:41,053
Speak.
- What did he go to Spira for anyway?

657
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:43,842
I don't know.

658
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:50,358
A young monk had been murdered.
My lord wanted to inspect the corpse.

659
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:55,938
His heart had been torn out.
- How do you know'?

660
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:01,864
A monk doesn't fit
what you call a pattern.

661
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:11,121
Ever since celibacy was introduced,
a monk is also immaculate and pure.

662
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,254
This is all yours now, lsenhart.

663
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,345
Walther von Ascisberg
appointed you as his sole heir.

664
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,024
Where did you bury your lord?

665
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,377
You needed it more.

666
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,802
Who would have had a reason?

667
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,016
The murderer disguises himself.

668
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:11,897
He pretends to have red hair, while in
fact it's brown. That rules out Wilbrand.

669
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:17,524
You think the murderer is still out there?

670
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:40,342
Sophia, someone's coming.
-lsenhart and Konrad.

671
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,424
What happened to you?

672
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:48,509
Let me take care of you. Come.

673
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:01,147
Where's Father Hieronymus?
- He's very ill. You can't see him now.

674
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,241
Come, you need to be washed as well.

675
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,706
There.

676
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:31,889
Reimar von Vogt has been courting me
for some weeks now.

677
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,152
He couldn't have made a better choice.

678
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,031
I'm going to feed the hens.

679
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,584
What did you say to her?

680
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:08,256
I told her I wish her all the best
with her future husband.

681
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:14,721
You idiot. You're blind and deaf.
She wants you.

682
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,014
I know. I know.

683
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,735
What's the matter?

684
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:33,493
I'm not the right man for her.
Sophia deserves better.

685
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:37,660
Isenhart, sometimes you really are dumb.

686
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:47,382
I often feel like an island,
unconnected to the mainland.

687
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:53,347
Without a bridge or ferryman
to get me across. She deserves better.

688
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:07,986
Father, we're back.
-lsenhart.

689
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,155
How are you?

690
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:28,802
Father, a question. You went out to sea.
- True.

691
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:34,057
But that was long ago.

692
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:38,846
I was still a young madcap.
- Do you know the cross knot?

693
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,731
Yes.
- Can you tie one for me?

694
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,894
Isenhart. ..
- Try it.

695
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,414
Try doing it with one hand.

696
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,828
Do it for me, Father.

697
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:12,509
I can't. The cross knot...
- It's okay.

698
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,547
Is too elaborate.

699
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,347
Why do I have to do that?

700
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:22,390
Because Michael von Bremen
only had one arm.

701
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,859
So someone must have hanged him.

702
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,072
Is that what you're saying?

703
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:49,049
We were in Tarup with the four of us.
Henning stayed with Konrad and me.

704
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:53,337
Only Gunther von Martensen
could have killed him.

705
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:58,259
The question is: what does Henning
know about his master's murders?

706
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,160
Hail.

707
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:31,004
The doctor and his aide left months ago.
Gunther von Martensen was very ill.

708
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,511
They wanted to go to Maulbronn.
- Maulbronn.

709
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,552
The dead monk
von Ascisberg wanted to examine...

710
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:46,565
had two stab wounds in his neck, right?
- Only one. How do you know'?

711
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,231
There's a connection
with another murder.

712
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,922
Henning van der Braake.

713
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:39,117
Isenhart was here, right?
- Yes.

714
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:14,149
Isenhart, you're alive.
I'm glad to see you.

715
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:21,367
What about Konrad?
I hope he's fine as well.

716
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:26,202
Sure, but after our long absence
he didn't feel like riding out again.

717
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:30,244
You're right, it's been a long time.
Come.

718
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,165
I heard that Gunther is ill
How is he doing?

719
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:42,885
The Grim Reaper will come for him.

720
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:47,302
But on his way to the Lord
he wants to be of use for an experiment.

721
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:52,895
Come. Come.

722
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:56,061
Step aside.

723
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:10,909
We did all this while you were gone.

724
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,920
Gunther.

725
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:27,179
Look who's here.

726
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:33,181
Isenhart.

727
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:40,860
I'm so happy...

728
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,317
to see you.

729
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:57,756
I don't have any pain any more.

730
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:04,345
Don't be sad. I'm...

731
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:06,757
I'm curious...

732
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,093
like a little child.

733
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,103
What are those cots?

734
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:25,692
Keep an eye on him.

735
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:30,910
They are all terminally ill.
They come here to die.

736
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:34,793
I take them in
and look after them till the end.

737
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:36,624
Those cots suspended above water.

738
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:44,211
Those ropes. I've seen all that before.

739
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:48,052
In a drawing by a man who'd lost his faith
and searched for the location of the soul.

740
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:51,309
Sydar von Friedberg?
- Yes.

741
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,561
You knew Sydar von Friedberg?

742
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:58,770
No, Gunther knew him.

743
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:05,691
They met in a place in Iberia.
- Toledo. Konrad and I were there

744
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:09,031
Yes, you were there.

745
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,868
At the bazar of knowledge.

746
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,588
Tell me, is it really as wonderful
as Gunther always tells me?

747
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:25,256
Scholars striving for knowledge,
unfettered by origins or religion?

748
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:27,136
Exchanging ideas?

749
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,593
It was impressive.

750
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:35,512
And is it true that the only barriers there
are those of the mind, not of the Church?

751
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,272
Yes, religion hardly plays a role.

752
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:42,022
What progress.

753
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:46,481
What does Gunther know
about Sydal von Friedberg?

754
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,237
A whole lot.

755
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,827
He told me, for example...

756
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,585
that Sydal didn't tolerate it...

757
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:07,176
when they tried to curtail his thoughts.

758
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:11,340
He murdered women.
- The time has come. He's dying.

759
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:49,798
Your soul has set out on its journey.

760
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,381
And is released.

761
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:16,112
On the way to a better world,
if there is one.

762
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:35,260
Did you see the rope?
- I did.

763
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,721
Did you see it go up?

764
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:44,232
At the moment of death.
- After he died, Gunther became lighter.

765
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:48,398
The soul.

766
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:51,739
The soul.

767
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,201
How many grams?

768
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:05,244
45.
- Always?

769
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:08,381
Always.
- And with the dogs?

770
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,209
Not one gram.

771
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:16,093
Have you been able to see one?

772
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:22,012
We tried with water, but no air bubbles
issued from the mouth of the dying.

773
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,771
Maybe...

774
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,855
Maybe it doesn't leave
through the mouth.

775
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:32,272
Did you try it with smoke?
- Also without success.

776
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,449
You have to get Gunther ready.

777
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,499
Of course.

778
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:54,710
Isenhart.

779
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,645
We saw that at Michael von Bremen's.

780
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:17,885
The same handwriting?
- Yes.

781
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:22,423
Look, that's Michael von Bremen's.
It's identical.

782
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:29,597
Gunther or Henning

783
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:33,109
One of them left it in Tarup,
so that we'd find it.

784
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,396
And you thought he was a genius.

785
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:46,993
All those visitors.

786
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,545
You were leaving already?

787
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,217
What do you know
about the murder of Anna of Laurin?

788
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,446
Let go of her.

789
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,828
Put that dagger away.
- Let go of her.

790
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:31,243
Put it away or I'll ruin her beauty.
- Don't talk so much, Simon.

791
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,704
Stop.

792
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:47,891
May I?

793
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:51,429
Murderer.

794
01:45:57,476 --> 01:45:59,649
And now you.
- No.

795
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:03,066
He doesn't even know who he is.

796
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,866
Murderer.

797
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:38,735
My sword, give me my sword.

798
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,793
Detain them.

799
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:09,300
Where are we?
- In Maulbronn Abbey. Trapped.

800
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,851
On your knees.

801
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:42,081
Konrad.
- That's impossible.

802
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,173
I'm afraid not.

803
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:50,385
Did you still want
to measure yourself against me?

804
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:56,554
If your courage has doubled
and you feel man enough by now...

805
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,270
to fight a blind man, anytime.

806
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:09,071
You are under my jurisdiction.

807
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:15,994
Tomorrow Cardinal Ernst of Regensburg
will come to me...

808
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:20,878
to be present at your trial.
- And what are the charges?

809
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:24,336
That we defended my father's castle
against you?

810
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:28,219
That you tried to kill me in Toledo.

811
01:48:28,377 --> 01:48:31,472
Then you might as well
sentence us right away.

812
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:36,761
Not so hot-tempered, Konrad of Laurin.

813
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:39,225
Not so hot-tempered.

814
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:48,981
Tomorrow the Cardinal of Regensburg
will come to Maulbronn.

815
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:52,573
He'll be present at the trial...

816
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:59,208
where you'll be sentenced to death.
- Where is Sophia of Laurin?

817
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:03,045
In my rooms.

818
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:08,047
There <i>she's</i> able to assist me.

819
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:22,565
Here you can rot away.

820
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:36,825
Isenhart?
- I'm over here.

821
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:45,834
Maybe it's our destiny
that it ends like this.

822
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:12,694
What are you doing? Digging?
- There's water under this flagstone.

823
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:17,327
The flagstones are too heavy.
You can't lift them by yourself.

824
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:24,789
'Give me a fixed point in space
and I'll move the world.'

825
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:29,173
Archimedes and the lever rule.
Walther taught us, remember?

826
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,299
No.

827
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:05,993
How many have you opened?

828
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:15,215
Many.

829
01:51:15,377 --> 01:51:18,426
Alive?
- Of course not.

830
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:21,138
I don't enjoy inflicting suffering.

831
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:30,019
You and I are of one kind.
We're both ahead of our time.

832
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:46,492
Sydal von Friedberg made a start,
back in Toledo.

833
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:51,209
I've continued his work. First Gunther
assisted me, now von Hainfeld does.

834
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:57,219
But what could we accomplish together?
- Gunther was your student.

835
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:05,762
I know the theory of the four humours is
false and can do harm, even kill people.

836
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:12,271
Don't you want to share
that knowledge with me?

837
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:19,033
We can expand it.
There's so much more to discover.

838
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,577
What's so funny?

839
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:28,372
Your knowledge is an incredible treasure.

840
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:33,964
Your light would outshine my father's
many times over.

841
01:52:34,122 --> 01:52:40,129
But it won't happen, because you can't
share your knowledge. You'd be burnt.

842
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:50,522
Tomorrow I'll breathe in your soul,
lsenhart, so you will be inside me.

843
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:08,499
What does Wilbrand von Maulbronn
have to do with all this?

844
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:16,875
An alliance of convenience. I wanted to
study the soul, he wanted to possess it.

845
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:21,136
And he got what he wanted.
- What does that mean?

846
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:28,144
He breathed it in. 45 grams.
Did you forget already?

847
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:43,447
I didn't give him this one.
Her shell was unusually beautiful.

848
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,906
Anna of Laurin.

849
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:49,531
Murderer.

850
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:55,004
Wilbrand von Maulbronn picked her out.
He wanted her soul.

851
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:58,382
He gave the stone to a merchant.

852
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:07,472
Anna would never have been harmed if
I'd known it would cause you such grief.

853
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:12,934
If I ruled over life and death,
I would give her back to you.

854
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,815
Who killed her?

855
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:30,265
Who is there?

856
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:23,586
Murderer.

857
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,419
To study the soul, people have to die.

858
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:33,552
What? So many lives destroyed
for the sake of your curiosity?

859
01:57:33,713 --> 01:57:36,592
A few destroyed lives
for many fulfilled ones.

860
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:41,639
The death of a few
can prevent the death of many others.

861
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:00,829
Only when they let us study
typhus and smallpox...

862
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:05,087
and no longer keep us from studying
God's creation more closely...

863
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:12,003
only then will we be able to help alleviate
suffering and perhaps even defy death.

864
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:18,926
If we didn't sacrifice a few, it'd be as if
we killed thousands by not helping them.

865
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:25,266
So who of us is more humane,
more just?

866
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:28,527
Why did Wilbrand
want to breathe in the souls?

867
01:58:28,685 --> 01:58:33,907
Don't you understand? The soul's
essence. That's what it's all about.

868
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:38,115
Immortality?
- An ancient dream of mankind.

869
01:58:38,278 --> 01:58:41,498
Life unlimited.

870
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:48,831
What would a genius like Aristotle be
able to achieve in two or three lifetimes?

871
01:58:48,997 --> 01:58:52,627
Only the ideas we leave behind
are immortal, and the soul itself.

872
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:56,888
Is that right?
So how old is Wilbrand von Maulbronn?

873
01:58:57,047 --> 01:58:59,641
I don't know.
-76.

874
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:03,429
He's 76 and moves like man
in his mid-thirties.

875
01:59:03,595 --> 01:59:07,190
What would that be? Chance?
- Exactly that.

876
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:15,942
You also think Sydal von Friedberg
showed up at your birth by chance?

877
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:19,452
He was on the run
from Walther von Ascisberg.

878
01:59:19,611 --> 01:59:25,084
He knew his time was running out and
Walther would kill him sooner or later.

879
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:31,214
He wanted to leave something behind,
so that in a certain way he'd live on.

880
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:36,595
Something of the souls he breathed in
is alive in you, lsenhart.

881
01:59:38,046 --> 01:59:39,844
And in me.

882
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:59,865
Sydal fathered two children. Two boys.
He kissed both of them upon their birth.

883
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:04,953
Both grew up with adoptive fathers.
One with a blacksmith..

884
02:00:05,115 --> 02:00:10,793
The other with a doctor.
We're not just soul mates, lsenhart.

885
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:16,756
Ernst of Regensburg
has occupied Maulbronn Abbey.

886
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:25,431
Murdered for their souls?

887
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:31,351
Is that what you want to tell me?
- Yes.

888
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:34,861
Those are serious allegations.

889
02:00:37,522 --> 02:00:43,245
Wilbrand, my friend,
it's very questionable...

890
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:50,252
that you didn't know what Henning van
der Braake contrived in your dungeons.

891
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:56,800
I swear it's true.
- That does you honour.

892
02:00:59,586 --> 02:01:03,432
Still, I can't form a clearjudgment.

893
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:09,893
Or you must want a judgment of God.

894
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:15,645
If Wilbrand von Maulbronn
and Henning van der Braake win...

895
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:19,314
the accusations against you
will be deemed lies.

896
02:01:19,481 --> 02:01:23,657
But if lsenhart
and Konrad of Laurin win...

897
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:27,072
Henning van der Braake
will be convicted of heresy...

898
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:33,541
and you and Wilbrand von Maulbronn
will suffer God's punishment.

899
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:42,305
And I'll personally assume responsibility
for the estates and lands of Maulbronn.

900
02:01:45,006 --> 02:01:48,055
I call for a judgment of God.

901
02:01:48,218 --> 02:01:51,347
Then let the judgment of God decide.

902
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:06,323
Tell me where they are...

903
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:10,282
and I'll vanquish them.

904
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:17,464
Not today, my friend.

905
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:20,379
Not today.

906
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:25,050
Let your rage guide my hand.

907
02:02:38,142 --> 02:02:40,270
You're not immortal.

908
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:12,394
No. lsenhart, don't.

909
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:17,604
No, let go of me.

910
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,912
I don't want to kill you.

911
02:03:33,364 --> 02:03:35,082
What for?

912
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:39,746
What for?

913
02:03:57,972 --> 02:04:02,478
We're half-brothers.
We have the same father.

914
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:06,365
We both carry him inside us, lsenhart.

915
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:50,491
We both stand outside our own time.

916
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:55,952
That's an illusion. We're stuck in
this time, whether we like it or not.

917
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:59,079
No.

918
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:53,638
No, stay here.

919
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:56,803
Stay here.

920
02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:02,105
Will you follow the way of your father?

921
02:06:11,564 --> 02:06:13,612
I don't have to.

922
02:06:18,613 --> 02:06:20,490
I'm home.

923
02:06:24,952 --> 02:06:29,628
