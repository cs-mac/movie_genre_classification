1
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,307
<i>About 300,000
people, displaced by Katrina,</i>

2
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,887
<i>have been scattered
to at least a dozen states.</i>

3
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,888
<i>Surviving Katrina was one thing.</i>

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,686
<i>Now people arejust
trying to survive the aftermath.</i>

5
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,523
<i>Buses with
New Orleans evacuees were rolling in.</i>

6
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,692
<i>It is being called the largest
migration in the country since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.</i>

7
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>I don't think anybody
anticipated the breach of the levees.</i>

8
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,765
<i>For years, officials
had warned that the levees could break.</i>

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,070
<i>I don't believe for one minute...</i>

10
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,113
<i>that anybody allowed people to suffer
because they were African-Americans.</i>

11
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,708
<i>Do you think the country would have
had the same reaction if they were all white people?</i>

12
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>We've got a job to
defend this country in the war on terror,</i>

13
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,980
<i>and we've got a job
to bring aid and comfort...</i>

14
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,491
<i>to the people of the Gulf Coast,
and we'll do both.</i>

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,809
<i>Uh, hey, Jeff, we're ready for
the interview. You got time right now?</i>

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,141
<i>Yeah. See, look. See
how you doing. I was doing that.</i>

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,680
<i>Can we hook up with you
in, like, 15 minutes? Yeah, sure.</i>

18
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,910
I'll be around. We're gonna be around
front here, so, are you inside or out?

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,249
We're about to be inside.
'Cause we about to go

20
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,482
We gotta go get our phone. But we gonna be
around. We'll probably see y'all in front.

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,115
<i>I'll be waiting.
We'll catch up with you.</i>

22
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,593
<i>What you need to do, if you could, is, if
you don't mind, just meet 'em out front, okay?</i>

23
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,757
<i>That's my purpose in living, man, so
I can tell people what I been through, man.</i>

24
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,062
Yeah, man. What I got
Whoo!

25
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,694
<i>I've been saving it, 'cause I don't
want to give it to nobody local,</i>

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,569
you know, for them to mess it
around and put it on local stations.

27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,006
This need to be worldwide.
Yeah.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,273
<i>'Cause all the footage I seen on TV,
nobody ain't got what I got. Yeah.</i>

29
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,279
I got right there, in the hurricane.

30
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,815
So when y'all gonna get with me?

31
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,909
<i>Tell me your name to the camera,
please. My name is Scott Michael Roberts.</i>

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,888
And I'm Kimberly Roberts.
And this is my wife, Kimberly Roberts.

33
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,959
<i>Where you from?
We're from New Orleans,</i>

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,585
the Ninth Ward, underwater.

35
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,130
Right.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,770
Currently in our area, 88
degrees under mostly cloudy skies

37
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,967
<i>This is August 28, 2005.</i>

38
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,341
<i>We got this Hurricane Katrina coming
through. The National Weather Service</i>

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,414
<i>You know me. I'm still me.</i>

40
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,508
Kimberly Rivers. It's me, putting
it down for the '05 documentary,

41
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,053
how it really is, starting right now.

42
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,613
<i>Me and my husband, we're trying
to get our stuff together. Look.</i>

43
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,889
<i>This is my cat. Grey.! Grey.!</i>

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,830
<i>See our barbecue stuff
so we can barbecue.</i>

45
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,266
<i>Got our food.
No meat, just ice.</i>

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,898
<i>Something to get us through this hurricane,
'cause God knows people is afraid, man.</i>

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,274
<i>Everybody's scared.
Even my dogs are scared.</i>

48
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,404
<i>Tell 'em. Tell 'em, boy.
Tell 'em.</i>

49
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,541
<i>Tell 'em. Get down, boy.
Get down. Good.</i>

50
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,917
<i>U.S. Army trucks and stuff.</i>

51
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,652
<i>Ya heard me. National Guard here. Everybody's
trying to do something for theyself.</i>

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,160
<i>All right, big brother. Y'all
getting out ofhere, huh? Yeah. Yeah.</i>

53
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,730
<i>Ain't nothing wrong with that.
If I had wheels, I'd be gone too.</i>

54
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,299
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

55
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,497
<i>Oh, yeah. I already know. I'm
taking my before and after shots now.</i>

56
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,531
<i>What's going on, bro?</i>

57
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,269
<i>Huh?</i>

58
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,471
<i>I'm gonna shut it off, bro, 'cause I don't
know when I'm gonna get something next.</i>

59
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,209
<i>Right, right, right. I'm trying
to hold down for the fucking storm.</i>

60
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,217
<i>Anyhoo.</i>

61
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,584
Signing off. Off top.
It's me. Kold Madina. Till later.

62
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,089
<i>Ready to go?</i>

63
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,659
You guys set?

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,526
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Uh, we're here for our update...

65
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,464
<i>on Hurricane, um, Katrina.</i>

66
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:59,027
<i>There's not a meteorologist
or an expert that I have talked to...</i>

67
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,436
that says that this storm will not...

68
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,237
impact New Orleans
in a major way.

69
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,007
As a result of that,
a mandatory evacuation order...

70
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,639
is hereby called
for all of the Parish of Orleans.

71
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,982
<i>How many people do you
expect will be in the city when the storm hits?</i>

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,988
<i>I have no idea.</i>

73
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,422
Uh, we're hoping
that everyone will leave.

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,828
<i>That's the
sky. It look pretty now,</i>

75
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,459
<i>but it sure soon will change.</i>

76
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,663
<i>People leaving now.
I ain't going nowhere.</i>

77
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,740
<i>I'm gonna be here
to give y'all this live...</i>

78
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,742
<i>and direct footage
of this here when it go down.</i>

79
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,835
<i>So what you got to say
to the world?</i>

80
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,676
<i>What you got to say to the world?
Tell 'em your name first.</i>

81
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,682
My name is Diamond Sims.

82
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,150
<i>Okay. You scared
of the hurricane?</i>

83
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,221
<i>No.
No? What you gonna do?</i>

84
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,552
Nothin'.
I'm going with my mama.

85
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,558
<i>You going with your mama?</i>

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,594
<i>Well, I'm gonna be next door.
You leaving me?</i>

87
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,322
<i>Huh?
You leaving me?</i>

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,330
<i>Yeah.
Yes? That's a shame.</i>

89
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,366
<i>But I'm gonna miss you.</i>

90
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,631
They said on the news that it's, like,
aiming toward Mississippi,

91
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,206
<i>so we might get the outskirts of
it. Well, guess what.</i>

92
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,300
<i>We got the outskirts of, uh, Betsy.
Betsy's eye didn't even touch us.</i>

93
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,845
<i>Let's go see what these people
over here got to talk about.</i>

94
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:19,282
<i>Scared? No, I'm from the
uptown Third Ward. Ya heard me?</i>

95
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,977
<i>You scared?
Who?</i>

96
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,282
<i>I know the hurricane is coming, but</i>

97
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,358
<i>I know it's coming, but I ain't
never scared of a hurricane.</i>

98
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,792
<i>The hurricane is nothing but water.
Who's scared of water? Not me. Not me.</i>

99
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,694
That water is eight feet, baby!

100
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,097
<i>I'm gonna do the storm. I'm gonna
do it out. You staying, mama?</i>

101
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,862
<i>Yes.
You staying too?</i>

102
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,027
No.

103
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,230
<i>Where you going? Superdome? I
don't know where we're going.</i>

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,672
<i>Those who could not get out</i>

105
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,073
<i>and that may be about 100,000
are still here in the city.</i>

106
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,705
<i>People who simply have
no means, no transportation.</i>

107
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:53,718
<i>There are at least 12,000 of them
in the Superdome behind me.</i>

108
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,984
<i>Uh, the people here
will be in here for at least two days,</i>

109
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,025
<i>but what is their alternative?</i>

110
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,030
A lot of people going to the
Superdome. I'm about to go to the store...

111
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,727
<i>and get something
to make some beans with.</i>

112
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>Some people stayed. Some people left.
The majority of people left.</i>

113
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,575
<i>Seems like I'm the only
stupid nigga that stayed.</i>

114
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,775
<i>Nigga's running a red light.</i>

115
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,783
<i>Some people buying
all the food they can buy.</i>

116
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,149
<i>Staying for the storm, brother?
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be here.</i>

117
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,415
<i>Oh, yeah, man.
Just a little doc I'm doing.</i>

118
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,957
<i>Just in case it's all gone,
I got it on tape. See?</i>

119
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,892
<i>I'm showing the world that we did
have a world before the storm come.</i>

120
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,020
<i>You scared, Earl?
All them people gone.</i>

121
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,031
<i>You scared?
All of them gone.</i>

122
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,567
<i>Already, right?
Shit, I ain't never left for a storm.</i>

123
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,364
<i>I'm not leaving because I
can't afford it.</i>

124
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,032
<i>But look. Let me get, um, smoked
neck bones, one pound of them.</i>

125
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,303
<i>Ya heard me?
And cut 'em up for me.</i>

126
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,777
<i>What you looking at? You</i>

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,780
<i>You got me on camera? Shit.</i>

128
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,182
<i>What's up, bro. It's the day before the
fuckin'hurricane. You don't know no better than that?</i>

129
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,917
Oh, you taking a picture of me?

130
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,931
Ain't no motherfucking picture. Yeah.
It's the real deal here! Film that.

131
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,401
Hit that, baby. Oh, yeah. Hit me with
it. You want to fight now. Put 'em up.

132
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,132
<i>The police ain't gonna come, 'cause, you know, they
tryin' to get out of the way for the hurricane too.</i>

133
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,606
<i>They ain't coming.
They ain't coming, brother.</i>

134
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,802
<i>Like Patti.
# On my own #</i>

135
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,210
<i>Yeah.! I like that.!</i>

136
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,772
This is a nightThis is gonna
be a day to remember, but it's all good.

137
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,648
<i>Right. It is gonna be a day
to remember. That why I'm recording.</i>

138
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,654
<i>"Hey. This thing really hit us,
you know. '"</i>

139
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,781
<i>I'll be having something to
show my children.</i>

140
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,759
<i>If I get some exciting shit, I might could
sell it to them white folk. Ya heard me?</i>

141
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,457
<i>- They'll be looking for shit.
- Right. And here come the motherfucking police.</i>

142
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,864
<i>You know they always
gotta have the fucking police.</i>

143
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,994
<i>They're going to the store,
get their snaps and chips too.</i>

144
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,368
<i>They're getting their snaps
and shit too.</i>

145
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,605
<i>Hey, I ain't no motherfuckin'rat.</i>

146
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,514
<i>Mr. Larry Sims.
You can run, but you can't hide.</i>

147
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,951
<i>I'm doing it for the hurricane thing, bro.
Checking the weather, ya heard me?</i>

148
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,162
<i>Yeah.</i>

149
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,628
<i>Oh!</i>

150
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,727
<i>Yeah.
The weather's changing.!</i>

151
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,170
<i>There is a shingle.</i>

152
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,606
<i>Pick 'em up, little man.</i>

153
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,577
<i>Let's walk over here to this guy,</i>

154
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,912
<i>see what he's gonna be doing...</i>

155
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,509
<i>on the day of the hurricane.</i>

156
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,148
<i>Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.</i>

157
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,249
<i>Y'all see what he doing
for the hurricane, huh?</i>

158
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,555
<i>Don't do that when y'all
get big.</i>

159
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,157
<i>Nat.!</i>

160
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,397
<i>What?</i>

161
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,804
<i>Get your ass up, man. The hurricane's
gonna take you away from right here, man.</i>

162
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,877
Well, why you yelling at me?

163
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,455
They are still saying that
it could come ashore as a Category 5,

164
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,788
but it could also come ashore
as a Category 4.

165
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:25,660
Either one promises a significant
impact for those near the eye,

166
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,699
where the most
severe winds will be.

167
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,270
<i>Well, Paw Paw,
it's getting darker out here.</i>

168
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,362
<i>Girl, I hear some thunder.</i>

169
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,910
<i>Right. I'm about to go hurry up
and take me a shower before it start lightning.</i>

170
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,172
<i>Be careful. Be safe.</i>

171
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,441
All right. Well, thank you.

172
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,449
<i>You're welcome. Um</i>

173
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,746
<i>I know you're kind of thin now.
Don't get blowed away.</i>

174
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,083
If the house don't blow away,
I'll still be there.

175
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,282
<i>Hey, I might be around there.</i>

176
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,760
<i>God forbid, in the name ofJesus.</i>

177
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,706
<i>I'm-I'm back now.</i>

178
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,377
I'm breathing and stuff, me and Scott.
We're the last two Mohicans.

179
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,751
<i>Thank God.</i>

180
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,122
I ain't got nobody else to thank.
Thank God. Yeah. We straight.

181
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,591
<i>Now I'm on my way to New Orleans
to get some stuff.</i>

182
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,725
Yeah. Some people I met,
they're doing a documentary.

183
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,203
Like a real documentary.
Like, you know, on-on-on-on, um,

184
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,274
hurricane and stuff.

185
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:27,437
<i>And all in the same minute I'm
teaching Brian how to be a director.</i>

186
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:37,315
<i>We're going to show
our New York friends...</i>

187
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,516
<i>what the N. O. Had to offer.</i>

188
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,093
<i>I sure wish we could walk 'em
through the streets andjust-just...</i>

189
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,324
show 'em the the, uh, hurricane, before
we had before Hurricane Katrina hit.

190
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,629
You know what I really believe?
When we get to the neighborhood

191
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,999
What's that?
It won't be much of a difference.

192
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>'Cause we were staying
in slum conditions anyway it go.</i>

193
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,509
Off top.
The bottom of the barrel.

194
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,272
<i>Off top. You know,</i>

195
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:05,146
we was the season-all at the bottom of
the can that don't want to shake out.

196
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,722
<i>Look at that waterline.
For real.! Geez.!</i>

197
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,487
That's the waterline from the flood.
Flooded out here. My God.

198
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,634
<i>Look at these houses, went
all the way flat. All the way.</i>

199
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,636
<i>My God.</i>

200
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,606
<i>Man. You know how many times I hustled
through here? I never expect to see this.</i>

201
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,308
Man, this is just like
a movie, man. This is

202
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,284
<i>This can't be real.
It's a horror movie.</i>

203
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:47,153
<i>'Cause there go the levee right here. That's where the
river at. Behind us. So all the water came this way.</i>

204
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,853
<i>Right. All the water came
here. All the water came right here.</i>

205
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,311
<i>Do you know all the
people who live on this street?</i>

206
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,746
Everybody, this is
this is my neighborhood.

207
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,115
This is my neighborhood.
I know everybody around here.

208
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,848
It hurt me to my heart not to see
none of my neighbors.

209
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,414
My old friend right here Moms used to
sit on the porch all day, every day,

210
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,858
and just talk to people as they pass by.

211
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,726
<i>You know. I miss Mom.
You know?</i>

212
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,824
I miss all of that. You know what I'm saying?
Right here. The other lady. I call her Moms.

213
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,563
Another old lady who own this
house right here. You know?

214
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,971
I used to come over here and sit with this old
lady. She owned this house, kept the property up.

215
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,909
And just talk, man. You know,
and I just miss those days.

216
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,277
And it's hurtin' me to know that
it's not gonna be the same anymore.

217
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,580
Oh, I knowed everybody.
I mean, right here,

218
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,746
a friend of mine well, I
knew the kids, and they were

219
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,529
<i>Golly.! Look

220
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,531
<i>Whoo.! Lord.!</i>

221
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,363
<i>Y'all all right over there?</i>

00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,801
<i>All right except for

00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,203
<i>No, not yet.
Mine's dripping.</i>

224
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,209
<i>Mine's dripping, and if I get something
too hard, dog, mine might come down,</i>

225
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,472
<i>so I've been moving
my stuff out of my bedroom.</i>

226
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,481
<i>Right. Shit.</i>

227
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,213
If it get, uh, too high,
y'all know we might have to...

228
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,982
punch a hole in the roof
and get on the, uh in the attic.

229
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,455
We got no attic. Well,
you gonna have to make a hole.

230
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,994
<i>Yeah. Make a hole. Right.
Get your hammer. Keep your hammer around.</i>

231
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,495
<i>Put everybody up top, if it get too bad.</i>

232
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,090
<i>Anything's better than drowning.
Come on, Baby. Let's go in.</i>

233
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,533
<i>A hurricane for the history books...</i>

234
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:46,441
<i>is on track to make a direct hit on
the low-lying city of New Orleans...</i>

235
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,345
<i>with maximum sustained winds
of 165 miles an hour.</i>

236
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>Darling, you see
how high this shit is?</i>

237
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,686
<i>Oh, geez.!</i>

238
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,953
This is my face
after just opening my back door.

239
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,496
<i>Ooh, be with us, Lord, please. Man.!</i>

240
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,622
<i>I'm talking about niggas
gonna take a dip if they want.</i>

241
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,209
<i>We're going to Plan "B, '"
and Plan "B'"is...</i>

242
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,973
<i>we about to start stacking our
furniture, uh, to try to get to the roof.</i>

243
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,985
<i>We need to get that stepladder
to get up there.</i>

244
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,420
<i>Just right over my head.</i>

245
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,498
<i>I'm sorry, baby.</i>

246
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,158
<i>Here we go.</i>

247
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,201
<i>What you gonna have to do is...</i>

248
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,245
<i>grab on to that
and... give me your foot.</i>

249
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,715
<i>Oh, shit.!</i>

250
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,512
How How do you even
begin to prepare for this,

251
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,746
let alone, uh, long-term,

252
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,755
plan for the continuation of this?

253
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,849
Well, you've just described our
lives right now at FEMA.

254
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,056
<i>Uh, as theas President Bush watched
the, uh, uh, noon meeting yesterday,</i>

255
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,156
he made the note that he was very impressed
with everything that we're doing.

256
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,395
<i>We're ready to respond in any way
that these governors might need. Yeah.</i>

257
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,701
We're actually prepared for the worst,
but hoping for the best.

258
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,105
<i>We're in the attic.</i>

259
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,677
<i>As long as it doesn't
start flooding up here.</i>

260
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,611
<i>Hey. So, me and
my neighbors we cold.</i>

261
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,587
<i>Yep. It's wet.
And we'rejust doing the best we can.</i>

262
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,455
<i>I don't know how long we're gonna
be up here, but hope it ain't long.</i>

263
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,056
<i>It's history.</i>

264
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:51,432
<i>And wejust pray to the Lord that our roof
don't come off. That's our last thing.</i>

265
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,062
<i>I got food, y'all.
Y'all welcome to everything.</i>

266
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,073
Just open the ice in there.

267
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,008
<i>Oh, I got some beaucoup
water and cold drinks.</i>

268
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,046
<i>Make y'all
Mines is yours until it's all gone.</i>

269
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:07,244
It is, uh, just after
eight, uh

270
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,616
8:20 in the morning
eastern time,

271
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,155
and stuff is flying
down the street.

272
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,490
These are
the hurricane-force winds.

273
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,026
All right. That's it, guys.
I'm gonna come back in.

274
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,327
See? Debris goes flying.

275
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,335
We're gonna let it go.
All right.

276
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,906
<i>Reporting from the hurricane,</i>

277
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,907
in New Orleans.

278
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,977
Come on.
Let's go for cover.

279
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,982
<i>It's 10:00 something.
We're still in the attic.</i>

280
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,021
<i>- This is how I'm looking now.
- I wish I could go out there with a flashlight.</i>

281
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,091
<i>This how I'm looking now.
Just walk downstairs,</i>

282
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,419
smoke this cigarette.

283
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,120
Yeah. No. No, you don't, mama.
You all right.

284
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,629
<i>You don't want to walk down these stairs.</i>

285
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,325
<i>It's not a game.</i>

286
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,665
<i>All this water,
coming through the windows,</i>

287
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,670
<i>flooding us in.</i>

288
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,673
<i>Yeah, man.
This is a total bummer, man.</i>

289
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,744
<i>Say, bro, what you gonna do about
the dogs? They gonna drown, huh?</i>

290
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,314
It ain't looking good at all,

291
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,351
for nobody,
in the city of New Orleans.

292
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,438
I urge the citizens there in the region...

293
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,537
to continue to listen
to the local authorities.

294
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:48,311
Don't abandon your shelters until you're
given clearance by the local authorities.

295
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,651
Take precautions,
'cause this is a dangerous storm.

296
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,717
When the storm passes, the federal
government has got assets and resources...

297
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,387
that we'll be deploying to help you.

298
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,561
In the meantime, America will pray.

299
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,637
<i>This is Katrina.</i>

300
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,704
<i>She doing her thing. Everything they said
she was gonna do, she's doing it and more.</i>

301
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,982
<i>It's like an ocean out there.</i>

302
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:23,316
<i>It's like a straight-up ocean out there.
This water. Look. Waves and shit.</i>

303
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,448
<i>You could start surfing and shit
if you wanted to.</i>

304
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,562
<i>For real.</i>

305
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,267
<i>Say, bro, you come floating
in here on a what? Apunching bag?</i>

306
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,932
<i>I came over here in a
World Sporting Goods Right.</i>

307
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,509
<i>From Mobile, Alabama.
Mobile, Alabama.</i>

308
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,377
<i>Yeah. They got two old people
brought them to the third floor.</i>

309
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,211
<i>Well, that's good then,
man. You weren't out there by yourself.</i>

310
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:56,185
<i>People out there trying to help. Say, bro, I'm so
glad you came though, man. Ain't gonna lie, 'cause,</i>

311
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,122
<i>you know, something could have been happening with us,
and you werejust right on time to come see about us.</i>

312
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,557
<i>How many more people you see
out there? Just you by yourself?</i>

313
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,959
<i>I don't know. Just me
by myself. Right, right.</i>

314
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,395
<i>It bust the levee.
It bust the levee?</i>

315
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,160
<i>Yeah.
Out here?</i>

316
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,168
<i>Yeah, you know
that levee right there?</i>

317
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,781
<i>We under siege, truly.</i>

318
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,950
<i>Truly under siege. Everybody
done lost everything around here.</i>

319
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,492
<i>Nobody left with no valuables.
Nothing but our lives.</i>

320
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,493
<i>And I hope people living.</i>

321
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,192
<i>'Cause we barely living up here,
but the Lord with us.</i>

322
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,200
<i>We barely making it.</i>

323
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,228
<i>Hey. Last seconds of me right quick.</i>

324
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,639
Hey. Now you have seen for the '05
what Katrina has done to us.

325
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:56,180
She has stuck us in a attic. We got a couple of
items of food you can see over there. It ain't much.

326
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,181
But, uh, I'm running out of juice too.

327
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,673
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.</i>

328
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,081
<i>They're not gonna
come out until the weather</i>

329
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,244
<i>Sir, at this time, there's no
available units for emergencies at this time.</i>

330
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,949
<i>Hey, we still need help.!</i>

331
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,789
<i>Larry out there swimming in that
water, trying to get us over here.</i>

332
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,888
<i>Got my man Larry, man. He's truly a hero,
man. He's taking care of everybody, bro.</i>

333
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,969
<i>I just hope the Lord really bless him,
'cause he's just truly being an angel.</i>

334
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,714
<i>Hey.! Help us get off the roof, man.!</i>

335
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,815
<i>We still gotta get
down though, bro.</i>

336
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,393
<i>I got you.</i>

337
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,733
<i>Larry.! You're a real hero, boy.!</i>

338
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,142
Hold up, y'all.
Give me a cigarette, man.

339
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,846
<i>No, that's Brownie, man.</i>

340
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,449
<i>- What?
- That's Brownie, that other dog...</i>

341
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,586
<i>from across the street.
On the ground?</i>

342
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:28,029
<i>Hey, "B"! Come here, boy!</i>

343
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,033
<i>That's your dog? Hey, boy!</i>

344
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,433
Come here, Kizzie!
Kizzie!

345
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,437
Come here, girl!
Come here, mama.

346
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,870
<i>That's your dog there?
Yeah.</i>

347
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,874
- For real?
- Yeah!

348
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,307
<i>You lying.
Hey, mommy!</i>

349
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,005
Get down. Get down. Get down.
Get down. Get down. Sit down.

350
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,138
<i>They were holding
it down till y'all came back.</i>

351
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,183
Sit down.
Let's go. Come on.

352
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,649
Y'all missed us? I missed y'all. We gonna
get it together, y'all. What's up, mommy?

353
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,283
<i>- Where the picture at?
- Right there, boy.!</i>

354
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,864
I longed for this.

355
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:06,063
I longed for this. This is a picture
of my mom, y'all. I been waiting to get

356
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,571
And I don't know what
I was gonna do without it.

357
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,212
It's the woman of my life, man.

358
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:20,546
You know? My mama died when I was
13 years old of H.I.V. Had Al DS.

359
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,984
And I just
Only thing I have is...

360
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,717
the memories of her, how she
raised me and things she did.

361
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,818
Cynthia Diane Rivers.
That's my baby.

362
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,321
There's two tears coming out.

363
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,765
Tears of joy and then, you know
and then tears of sorrow.

364
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,829
You know, but, um, it's tears of
joy now, 'cause she is proud of me.

365
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,671
Know what I'm sayin'?
I've been keeping myself.

366
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,677
It's been hard out here
in New Orleans.

367
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,407
I've been keeping myself up,
taking care of myself.

368
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,676
You know, I ain't let
problem situations,

369
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,309
you know, take me away
from my identity.

370
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,912
You know, so, if nothing else,
she got, you know,

371
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,686
that to be proud of me,
that, hey, I'm keeping myself.

372
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,194
I'm holding on, being strong,
going through the hard times.

373
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,528
I'm try I'm-I'm-I'm trampling
over tribulations.

374
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,228
So, hey, that's a lot to be proud of.
I'm still here, still sane,

375
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:17,707
still in the flesh, healthy, strong,
married, looking for a better tomorrow.

376
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,647
<i>My brother Larry came along, and...</i>

377
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,879
<i>he got us to higher ground,</i>

378
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,479
<i>one by one, with a punching bag.</i>

379
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,392
<i>We came, set up camp
over here for two nights.</i>

380
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,429
And it's just like how we left it.

381
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,531
I don't know where we gonna go
from here or what we gonna do.

382
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,605
But it's sure hard.

383
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,807
<i>Coming through.</i>

384
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:55,812
<i>Well, y'all, as you can see, we're still in
the same situation we was in across the street.</i>

385
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,439
<i>That's my house over there
with the blanket.</i>

386
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,541
<i>I was in that attic.
I'm across the street now.</i>

387
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,950
<i>See. There go the stop sign.</i>

388
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,420
<i>We're still on a low battery, but</i>

389
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,551
Gotta give it up
for my brother Larry, bro.

390
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,151
<i>'Cause he's really handling
his business, man. Look at him.</i>

391
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,992
<i>Going back out there to get
some more people to bring 'em up.</i>

392
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>Larry, where the
punching bag? Ah, it's down there.</i>

393
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,969
<i>Oh. I still got it.</i>

394
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,869
<i>Yeah.
Look at this shit.</i>

395
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,306
<i>2005, August 29, baby.</i>

396
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,344
<i>Katrinashe's a bad chick.</i>

397
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,380
<i>I'm Julie Chen, and you're
watching The Early Show online.</i>

398
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,507
Today, the search for survivors.

399
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,949
<i>We'll show you how rescue crews
are trying to help victims...</i>

400
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,884
<i>of Hurricane Katrina.</i>

401
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,685
<i>Also, how much of a wallop will the
storm have on prices at the gas pump?</i>

402
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,785
<i>Those stories arejust ahead
on The Early Show online.</i>

403
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,657
I can't stand being nasty and dirty.

404
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,363
<i>Hmm. And then the sun got
the nerve to come out. Yes, ma'am.</i>

405
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,371
<i>That wind blowing, mama?
Mm-hmm.</i>

406
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,373
<i>Feel good out here. Mm-hmm.</i>

407
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,990
<i>We all in this house together, and we're
all trying to salvage what we can get...</i>

408
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,091
<i>and try to make ourselves
comfortable No, no.</i>

409
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,035
<i>Over here at this house until</i>

410
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,369
<i>Uh, the rescue people come,
when they come,</i>

411
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,273
<i>hopefully.</i>

412
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,539
<i>They have to come.</i>

413
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,911
<i>Republicans
know the disaster and response...</i>

414
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,246
<i>could have enormous
political consequences.</i>

415
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:44,287
<i>Mr. Bush dismissed calls for U.S. Troops
in Iraq to be redeployed for Katrina relief.</i>

416
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,357
<i>L- I-I just completely disagree.</i>

417
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,120
<i>We've got a job to defend this country
in the war on terror,</i>

418
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,752
<i>and we've got a job
to bring aid and comfort...</i>

419
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,094
<i>to the people of the Gulf Coast,
and we'll do both.</i>

420
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,028
You don't see no marks on these houses.
They ain't been in this neighborhood yet.

421
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,039
These houses have
not been inspected yet.

422
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,736
There could be dead people right now,
as we speak, in these houses.

423
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,575
'Cause the-the National Guard
they have not been here.

424
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,208
Only thing you seewhat
L.A.S.P.C.A. Or somethin'.

425
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,014
And it's two weeks
after the hurricane?

426
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,612
Somebody in there?

427
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,692
Sister, you're not I'm not
getting a good view out of this.

428
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,752
All right. It ain't
recording, my brother.

429
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,991
Got 30 more minutes.
Right here was the house,

430
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,865
and the lady who was staying here
she had the daughter who couldn't walk.

431
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,165
These people didn't have
no water or lights.

432
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,173
<i>That's why she That's why the woman
didn't know the hurricane was comin'.</i>

433
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,971
She couldn't even
see on the TV, man.

434
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,638
Y'all inspected these houses yet?

435
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,810
Hey, y'all did these houses
for the dead people yet?

436
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,251
Y'all don't care, huh?

437
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,755
We still love y'all.

438
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,459
<i>N- Now that's one of the reasons why...</i>

439
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,726
<i>I'm so much against this President
Bush character, or whoever he is.</i>

440
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,428
Look at this, man. These people ain't been through
my neighborhood yet, looking for dead bodies.

441
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:09,906
I bet ya I bet ya my uncle's still in
the house, y'all, at my grandpa's house.

442
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,309
All right, sis. I got you.

443
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,152
<i>Yeah, he been
decomposing right here. Oh, Jesus!</i>

444
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,285
<i>Yeah, he died up in here.
You heard me?</i>

445
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,364
<i>Somebody in there?</i>

446
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:37,901
<i>- Yeah. He was dead in the front room. They got him out of there.
- The smell is strong, huh?</i>

447
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,971
You can smell it from right here
he was in there.

448
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, he was dead in there.

449
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,209
My God.

450
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,212
<i>He was a good dude. Hejust got his
little drink on, and he loved everybody.</i>

451
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,376
<i>Everybody was cool with him.
Lovable person, man.</i>

452
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,976
<i>Last time I saw him
when it was on camera.</i>

453
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,319
I said, "Get round the corner, man, before
the hurricane come take you away from here. "

454
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,258
He said, "I'm going. I'm going. " He
stumbled, and it's the house he came to.

455
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,489
Uh, this is the number
to the Mortuary Affairs.

456
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,294
If you guys want the remains of, uh

457
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,732
<i>the remains of the body
that was here. The mortuary?</i>

458
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,736
<i>Paw Paw?
Hey, can I ask you a question?</i>

459
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,534
I'm at the house now on Lesseps. The
prisoners that was in Orleans Parish

460
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,541
And they had got Nat out
already. What about them?

461
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,111
'Cause I have a brother-in-law.
Beaucoup blood on the living room floor.

462
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,237
<i>I wanna try to get him
out ofjail.</i>

463
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,373
Yeah.

464
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,680
No, I ain't in the house. I'm standing outside
in the street. I'm gonna go back in there.

465
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,686
I'm gonna snatch the whole
drawer out of there...

466
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,723
and just pull everything together,
and it's easier for me to do it like that.

467
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,420
I can't go through it and all that, 'cause
it's too stank in there right now, Paw Paw.

468
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,497
<i>Y'all be encouraged. Y'all stay up. I
don't know how to salute too good, but...</i>

469
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,793
we thank y'all for being
in the city of New Orleans.

470
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,166
Thank y'all for doing what y'all
are doing. God bless y'all, man.

471
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,331
<i>Yeah. Same to you, man. And I pray that
y'all don't have to go back to Iraq.</i>

472
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,340
It's not our war.

473
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,536
<i>Right.
This is the war, right here.</i>

474
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,930
These streets gone, man.

475
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,262
<i>Ain't no more New
Orleans. You can listen to it.</i>

476
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,336
<i>This don't even sound right no
more. New Orleans is through.</i>

477
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,998
Ain't no more New Orleans. If they
rebuild, it ain't gonna be the same.

478
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:27,407
I'm scared to even I'm not even coming
back. I ain't coming back no more.

479
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,360
<i>Who is that?</i>

480
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,162
<i>Man, them people ain't
picking us up from no fucking bridge.</i>

481
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,605
<i>We can't leave, bro. We got too
many little ones over here, bro.</i>

482
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,939
<i>Five.
About five of'em, bro.</i>

483
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,007
<i>Then we got somebody that's
disabled, dog.</i>

484
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,320
<i>They do.</i>

485
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:21,455
<i>Everywhere across New
Orleans, people are headed for higher ground...</i>

486
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,158
<i>wherever they can find it.</i>

487
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,735
<i>Some are living in parking garages.</i>

488
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,466
<i>Others picked up what they could and
moved to higher ground on the interstate.</i>

489
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:34,170
How can it be that hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of victims...

490
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,610
have not received any food and water...

491
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:40,377
more than a hundred hours
after Katrina hit?

492
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,749
<i>Thousands
of residents of New Orleans,</i>

493
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,484
<i>for whom there was
no transportation of any kind,</i>

494
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,026
<i>simply started walking.</i>

495
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:55,489
<i>It was just a mass
amount of people, you know,</i>

496
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,534
helping each other out,
pulling debris out the way...

497
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,729
so that the boats could get through
in knee-deep water.

498
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,534
<i>Me and Larry
we already had a long boat...</i>

499
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,940
<i>that we found
floating past the house.</i>

500
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,607
<i>We went on ahead, picking up
women, children and elderly people.</i>

501
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,951
Nightfall came soon, you know.
It started raining.

502
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,047
And the Coast Guard went to leaving,
and I asked the Coast Guard man

503
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,854
I said, "So what we supposed to do,
just wait here?"

504
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,452
He said,
"No. Go to the U.S. Navy base,

505
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,022
and they'll be able to
house you right there. "

506
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,262
<i>It was about two nights after the storm hit.</i>

507
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:38,365
<i>I think the night of August 30, we had
a group of people that wound up here...</i>

508
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:43,038
<i>because, uh, this was one of
the highest and driest places in the city,</i>

509
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,775
and they were... destitute.

510
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,851
So, just...

511
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,921
the whole crowd just started
coming down this way, you know.

512
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,820
'Cause I told everybody.
"Let's walk down to the navy base. "

513
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,362
<i>And this is one of the navy bases
that Bush had planned to close down.</i>

514
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,454
<i>So they have extra rooms, you know.</i>

515
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,363
<i>We have about 200 family
housing units on the base...</i>

516
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,700
<i>and also over 500
evacuated rooms in the barracks.</i>

517
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:12,400
We got the call from, uh, our folks
that were standing at the gate...

518
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,536
that there were a major issue
at the front gate.

519
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,640
We went over there to where that little
brown building is that brown checkpoint.

520
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,549
<i>So I say, "Why can't we stay overnight? '"</i>

521
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,750
<i>They said, "Well, we can't
help you. You on your own. '"</i>

522
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,726
So I say,
"What about the women and children?"

523
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:35,288
They said, "Get off our property,
or we're gonna start shootin'."

524
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,425
But I'm still just trying to
talk to these people.

525
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,404
All of a sudden, I see the man
get on his C.B., call for backup,

526
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:47,672
and they had at least 20 troops that
came out there, all of them with M16s.

527
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,269
And they loaded up
the guns in front of us,

528
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,009
cocked them
and aimed them at the crowd.

529
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:57,178
There was, uh,
never any hint of us...

530
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,689
planning to use any type
of force, and we weren't.

531
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,784
When they got their guns,
put the clip in,

532
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,057
cocked it and aimed it at the crowd,

533
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,395
my life flashed in front of my eyes.

534
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,163
It was a real eerie feeling, I thought,
but, uh, you know, we had to do our job,

535
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,398
and that was to protect
the interests of the government,

536
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,373
and, uh, that's what we did
in, uh, maintaining the base.

537
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,639
<i>These people wasn't worrying
about our safety, you know.</i>

538
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,204
That's why I keep saying
the government let us down.

539
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:30,515
If you can't even go to a naval base that's closed
down that they'd evacuated all the rooms out of...

540
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,818
and let people
get at least a decent night's sleep...

541
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,621
to be able to move in the morning,
you know,

542
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,821
what good does it, uh, really serve us?

543
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,025
Before it cut off.
Come on. Quickly.

544
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,227
<i>There you go. Do your
thing. Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

545
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,236
this is the exact street,

546
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,900
hundreds of me
and my friends, neighbors,

547
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,943
<i>what have you, all together</i>

548
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,206
<i>we were struggling
down this same street.</i>

549
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,044
In knee-deep water.

550
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,087
<i>The government let us down,
so we came down here to the high school.</i>

551
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,455
<i>People were held up in here,
I guess, not able to get out.</i>

552
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,758
And, uh, I don't know how
many civilians were in here,

553
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:19,700
but they were just basically had gotten their
hands on whatever food they could and whatnot.

554
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,171
<i>This place was a wreck. Yeah. They completely
thrashed the inside of this building.</i>

555
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,505
<i>I mean, I have, you know No No, uh
Urine and feces all over the place.</i>

556
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,603
Offense to civilian people, but they have
no concept of how to survive, you know.

557
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,374
Yep.

558
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,818
<i>The same way the army people are sitting out
there, there were people sitting out there,</i>

559
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,824
<i>waiting for somebody
to come pick 'em up.</i>

560
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:46,260
All this open space,
how come they ain't see us down here?

561
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,060
They kept on flying by
in their helicopters.

562
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,431
<i>How y'all doin'?
How y'all doin; fellas?</i>

563
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:57,371
Um, see in that classroom,
where the, uh, window's busted up at?

564
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,705
We was in that room,
and we wanted to, you know

565
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,338
I wanted them to see how it was when we
stayed in this school for a couple of days.

566
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,178
Let me, uh, see if we can get
our Public Affairs officer out here.

567
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,185
<i>I graduated from this school, man.
Is that right?</i>

568
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,754
Graduated, '89.
My high school also.

569
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,985
We're all from pretty far away.
We're all from Oregon, so, you know.

570
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,060
<i>It's, uh
We came a little ways to be out here.</i>

571
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,461
Tell you one thing. I appreciate y'all
here now, you know. Yeah, I really do.

572
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:28,470
<i>Well, we got in the R.O. T.C.
Room. We got clothes, T-shirts and socks.</i>

573
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,973
You got a broken window up there,
probably from the storm.

574
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,840
<i>No. Probably from somebody
trying to get air to breathe.</i>

575
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,845
<i>Right. There's no storm.</i>

576
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,609
Right. That's what
they was doing to these windows.

577
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,949
<i>I'm gonna set this chair back, but I want
to show them how me and my wife had to sleep.</i>

578
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,694
Don't never let nobody tell you
sleeping on wood don't hurt,

579
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,561
<i>'cause it does.
But you're a survivor.</i>

580
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,634
I'm a survivor.

581
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,299
"I had a dream. "

582
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,571
And I give them an
A- plus on cleaning the school up.

583
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,911
<i>I think they should tear the whole
building down and build them a new school.</i>

584
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,477
<i>I think that New Orleans children deserve
it. The government get enough money for it. So</i>

585
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,556
<i>But who am I?</i>

586
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,921
Mr. Brian.

587
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,052
<i>Do you go here?
I used to go here.</i>

588
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,494
There go the boat, boy!
Oh, that's our boat!

589
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,863
They got our boat right here, boy!
That's our boat! That's our boat, right here!

590
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,027
<i>- Yep.
- Y'all mind if I put it on the ground?</i>

591
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,037
<i>That's the boat.!
Bam! That's our boat!</i>

592
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,369
<i>That's the boat. I had to...</i>

593
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:41,104
just my feet going,
just holding on, pushing the boat.

594
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,180
<i>He can't swim.
No, I can't swim at all.</i>

595
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,716
I never got this feeling
inside of this boat.

596
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,048
<i>Nothing but the outside. You can
feel it now. Come sit in here with me.</i>

597
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,590
<i>Ouachita. That's the name of it.
Ouachita. At least let me get one sit in it.</i>

598
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,354
Give me a cigarette.

599
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,864
Oh, yeah. Ain't that somethin'?

600
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,368
This boat will
come in handy for somebody.

601
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,802
<i>"Wet dream. "</i>

602
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,033
<i>And it was a wet dream.</i>

603
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,042
Right.

604
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,044
<i>Not the wet
dream they talk about, but</i>

605
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,171
Yo, that was a wet nightmare.

606
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,547
<i>They all follow orders,
and whoever sent the orders...</i>

607
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:31,116
<i>told them to turn around,
and they didn't get here fast enough.</i>

608
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,220
I wish they was camped out and doing
all this when we really needed them.

609
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,789
What's the purpose now? They're out here, sitting
on their ass, waiting on a terrorist attack.

610
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,996
Or waiting on something violent to
happen so they can shoot or something now.

611
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,772
<i>We had to wait for the
logistics to be able to get down here,</i>

612
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,368
<i>because with the other
operations going on,</i>

613
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,643
there just wasn't enough planes
to get everybody down here.

614
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,584
<i>You know, I told my guys that one of
the first things they would hear...</i>

615
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,588
<i>is, uh, somebody being angry...</i>

616
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,022
that we didn't get here earlier.

617
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,095
And basically we told them
that we're here now.

618
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:08,131
- We're here to help.
- We need y'all here in America.

619
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,996
We got war on the streets.
We got war right here in Louisiana.

620
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,501
Right here in New Orleans's streets, man.

621
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,767
That's the reason why I'm leaving, man.
I don't want to see no more.

622
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,809
<i>Good luck to you guys. Stay safe.</i>

623
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,310
Y'all pray for us too.
We do, every night.

624
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,381
<i>All right. Take it easy.</i>

625
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,382
<i>Thanks.
Come on.</i>

626
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,352
It's going to be all right, bro.
Yeah.

627
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,479
It's gonna be all right, sis.

628
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,159
<i>Corpses left in the streets,</i>

629
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,857
<i>rescue helicopters and police gunfire,</i>

630
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,663
<i>survivors battling for seats
on buses out of New Orleans.</i>

631
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,567
<i>This city that has fallen into near chaos,</i>

632
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,833
<i>as thousands of National Guard units...</i>

633
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,637
<i>rush to try to restore
some semblance of order.</i>

634
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,716
<i>I had a dream that I was
gonna get me some transportation,</i>

635
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,379
<i>no matter what it took,
to get my people out of New Orleans.</i>

636
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,082
<i>My husband and them said,
"Man, we gotta go get a truck.! '"</i>

637
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,216
<i>If they call that lootin; I looted.</i>

638
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,420
<i>Wejust loaded everybody up.
About four or five different families.</i>

639
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,998
<i>We had 25 people on that one truck.</i>

640
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,691
<i>My original plan was for me to...</i>

641
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,293
<i>drive my family
over to the convention center.</i>

642
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:25,501
<i>And I was supposed to go back
and pick up a lot more people.</i>

643
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,203
<i>We rolled past Canal Street.</i>

644
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,212
<i>I said,
"Man, look at all these police.</i>

645
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,216
<i>They're not by the convention center helping
people, you know. '" They didn't care.</i>

646
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,513
<i>They was chilling by the Harrah's Casino.</i>

647
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,487
<i>By Harrah's Casino.</i>

648
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,558
<i>That was pitiful.</i>

649
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:48,465
<i>We got to the convention center.
We see the thousands of people.</i>

650
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,091
<i>People begging tojump on the truck.</i>

651
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,160
<i>"Please take us with you. We got $50.
Just drop us off down the road. '"</i>

652
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,208
<i>People was running up to us,
you know, putting their children up here.</i>

653
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,802
<i>We were like,
"No, man. You can't You can't go. '"</i>

654
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,142
<i>That's a hurtin'feeling just to
see thousands and thousands of people,</i>

655
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,085
<i>little babies and all that, just cryin;</i>

656
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,349
<i>And they ain't never sent no help.</i>

657
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,391
<i>That-That hurt.</i>

658
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,661
<i>That was the hurtingest part, man</i>

659
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,026
<i>seeing people you know
and you couldn't help.</i>

660
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,566
<i>#Said I will carry you #</i>

661
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,033

00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,547
<i># Until we meet again #</i>

665
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,918
<i># Until it's like it was #</i>

666
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,787
<i># Until then #</i>

667
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,020

<i># Until the spirit and the mind

674
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:16,476
<i># Until the scenes

675
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,953
<i># Will finally play #</i>

676
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,650
<i>#Said I will carry you #</i>

677
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,663
<i># Through the hurricane waters #</i>

00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:42,008
<i>#See, I will carry you ##</i>

681
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,646
Yep.

682
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,909
This is how we came down here,

683
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,682
loaded with 30 people.

684
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,917
<i>'Cause I knew my uncle
had property nobody was staying in.</i>

685
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,484
So the night we stayed here,
ain't have no-no lights on or no water.

686
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:36,828
So we just stayed up in the house. It was
hot, but we was glad to have a place to stay.

687
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,129
And the other 25 people
They was like,

688
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,763
<i>"Man, y'all brung us all the way out here
with a house with no lights and no water. '"</i>

689
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,206
I'm like, "I ain't know they had no lights
and water. Thought I would just bring y'all,

690
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,302
'cause I knew my uncle had property
nobody was staying in, you know. "

691
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,438
<i>So they went to the shelter.</i>

692
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,483
<i>Hey, you. Hello.</i>

693
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,780
<i>How's it goin'?
Ma'am, you can't use that in here.</i>

694
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,821
<i>I can't use that?
I'm just interviewing my family.</i>

695
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,255
<i>So come here, mama. Come talk
to the world right quick. Hey.</i>

696
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,088
<i>Since the hurricane
you had a lot to say.</i>

697
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,958
<i>So what you been
doing since then?</i>

698
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,295
Boy, I was scared that day.

699
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,960
<i>You miss your home? Did I?</i>

700
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,903
<i>But I won't go back to New
Orleans. Why?</i>

701
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,464
<i>It's messy around there.
Yeah, I know, huh?</i>

702
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,771
<i>How about you,
brother Larry Sims?</i>

703
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,814
Well, I thank God for that day,
'cause you know why?

704
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,816
<i>Why? I never thought God
could use a man like me.</i>

705
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,546
<i>Show 'em what you
learned, brother Larry. Huh?</i>

706
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:34,920
<i>The saving people
dance? Oh, my saving people dance?</i>

707
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,485
<i>Watch that footstep now.
Ah! Get back!</i>

708
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,862
<i>## Thank you
for your service to your country.</i>

709
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,095
<i>And God bless you and your families.
God bless America.</i>

710
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,037
<i>And I salute you.</i>

711
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,341
<i>In Alexandria,
Louisiana, they welcome their soldiers home,</i>

712
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,641
<i>whether they have a home or not.</i>

713
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,515
So I got a lot of guys in my unit itself
that lost a lot of lost everything.

714
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,213
They were 10,000 miles
away when the storm hit,

715
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,450
<i>but nearly all of their lives
were changed.</i>

716
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,622
Our car, our jobs, our house
and just his whole hometown wiped out.

717
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,193
L
- I can't even really explain how it feels.

718
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,568
<i>To me it hurts because now it
involves everyone that I care about</i>

719
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,300
family, friends,

720
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,899
neighbors
everybody that's in my city.

721
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,379
<i>If these soldiers need a reminder ofjust what
it is they've come back to, they don't have to look far.</i>

722
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,212
The dome-shaped building in the
background there is a Red Cross shelter.

723
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,984
Go step on it, and you get a feather.

724
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,151
<i>Oh, right.</i>

725
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,252
<i>- Oh, you're playing Mario 1.
- Oh, man!</i>

726
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,855
<i>- That's 2.
- Oh, that's 2? Where your garbage, boy, at?</i>

727
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,903
<i>I'm telling you, he garbage. He
can't beat me. He doing garbage right here.</i>

728
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,972
Ah!
Game over?

729
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,007
For you it is!
Let me take a turn.

730
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,509
<i>Let me show you how to do this, Nathaniel.
My granddaughter knew I was in there.</i>

731
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,571
She told the police that
"My grandmama's down in there. "

732
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,582
So he said,
"You can't go in there. "

733
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,879
<i>I didn't hear nothing
about the storm.</i>

734
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,787
I didn't have no TV, no electric lights.

735
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,351
Wasn't for Larry,
I'd have got drowned.

736
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,453
Wasn't for him,
I'd have got drowned.

737
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,032
<i>Can you swim? No, ma'am.</i>

738
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,294
Can't swim at all.

739
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,597
And that's why I said,
"I'll never go back to New Orleans. "

740
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,469
<i>So everything we did,
we did it as a family.</i>

741
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,138
That's right.
We did it as a family.

742
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,147
These two just met that day.

743
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,513
<i>Me and him
been knowing each other.</i>

744
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,609
<i>- We always spoke, and that was it.
- That was it.</i>

745
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,484
But that day there
brought us to a brotherhood.

746
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,990
<i>- Something we will never leave.
- Right.</i>

747
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,857
I don't like talking on camera
too much, so Keep talking, baby.

748
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,488
<i>Y'all be loved, you know what I'm
sayin'? I have something to say.</i>

749
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,467
Kim was the only one, in the midst
of all our sorrow, that saved us,

750
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,161
<i>'cause she gave us a place to stay.</i>

751
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,672
<i>She was the bravest one out of all. She said, "Miss
Pearl, you all gonna be all right. Just pray. '"</i>

752
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,835
She came back and she said, "Mama,
water goin' down. We got it made.

753
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,641
We gonna quiet down, we gonna
sit down and we gonna eat. "

754
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:14,774
She gave us a lot of food. She gave us a lot
of blankets and stuff, and she rescued us too.

755
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,853
But she didn't tell y'all, did she?

756
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,219
We ate. We smiled at one
another. We played jokes.

757
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:24,124
<i>We had a lot oflaughter in us. She's a
wonderful, blessed person. She love the Lord.</i>

758
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,620
<i>Y'all should have known
me before the storm hit.</i>

759
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:32,168
Yeah, but you
Yeah, but you brought us too though.

760
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,169
<i>I'm glad you appreciate
it, ma. I did.</i>

761
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,899
<i>I feel good about it. I mean it
from the bottom of my heart with you.</i>

762
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,373
<i>I didn't know y'all saw me
like that. Yes, I did too.</i>

763
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,910
<i>You think I was playing with you?</i>

764
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,313
I love you, mama.
I love you too.

765
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,442
<i>Daisy?</i>

766
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,078
<i>Was someone wanting
to go to Austin?</i>

767
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,713
Oh, me!

768
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:58,158
<i>Well, honey, FatherJose is up here.
Oh, that's me he wanted to see!</i>

769
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,688
She ain't got no family. It's
her and her daughter in a wheelchair.

770
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,597
They come from New Orleans with us,
and I can't leave them here.

771
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:09,468
So I got to make sure they get on their
way with 'em, or they be coming with us.

772
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,401
I'm on my way.
Ain't that wonderful, ma?

773
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,479
Yeah, it's wonderful.
You're leaving me.

774
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,239
You're leaving me, ma.
Well, you better give

775
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,911
You better give me, uh,
the address.

776
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,649
Address. Yeah, I know. You gotta
call tonight and get me an address.

777
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,918
I'll call where you can
get the address. Right.

778
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,586
Right. You know

779
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,425
You know, you admit I ain't gonna
forget you. I gotta call you.

780
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,989
I know. You gotta keep in contact with
me, ma. I gotta keep in contact with you.

781
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,592
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're just
like a big sister of mine.

782
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,171
A big sister?
Yeah!

783
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,173
You 69. I'm 24. I'm a big sister.
That ain't got nothing to do with it.

784
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,005
Yeah, 'cause you're just like a big

785
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,944
You just like a big sister.
I'm glad.

786
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,448
What's going on?
She leaving tomorrow.

787
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,609
She's supposed to meet
the Father over here,

788
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,949
and the Father gonna bring her
to the bus station.

789
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,955
Beautiful.
Wonderful, right?

790
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,117
Just wonderful.
Ma, you about to leave us.

791
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,286
I'm leaving this state.

792
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:11,299
When FEMA ever decides to pay us,
we're moving to Memphis.

793
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,802
<i>This is my UncleJerome.
I love him well.</i>

794
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,202
How y'all doing?

795
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,104
And he's just been
real super to me.

796
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:22,804
My favorite uncle. Yeah, for the
record, he's my favorite uncle of'em all.

797
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,881
If you ain't know, now you know.

798
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,882
I looked for 'em
several times, you know, to be

799
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:32,478
when the storm was going on, and I got on the
Internet and everywhere trying to locate them.

800
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,490
It was about 2:30 in the morning.
She knocked on my door.

801
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,119
I said, "Man, who is that?" And my wife
got up. She said, "That's your niece, Kim. "

802
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,993
So I got up, and she said,
"Don't worry about me. I'm all right. "

803
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,591
<i>You should see in the truck.
They had little babies and grown-ups...</i>

804
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,829
<i>and a woman that they had
to carry on their back.</i>

805
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,498
<i>And I said, "Y'all don't have to
go nowhere. I got another home.</i>

806
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,235
<i>If she want it, she can have it. '"</i>

807
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,005
<i>A lot of people was walked
off and left behind Right.</i>

808
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,013
Like they was trash, you know.

809
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,848
But, you know, my mom
she was one that was in the hospital.

810
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,853
She was in Memorial Hospital,

811
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,186
<i>and they didn't evacuate her,
and I lost her.</i>

812
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,660
<i>And they said
that they had evacuated that Tuesday.</i>

813
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,662
<i>Come to find out,
they never did move her.</i>

814
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,930
<i>I saw the images on TVof the hospital
and a lot ofbodies laying there covered up.</i>

815
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:26,031
<i>It's hard to look at it and try to figure out
which one of them is your mom.</i>

816
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:30,375
<i>- Still today, we hadn't received her body yet, and we don't know
- How long's it been?</i>

817
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,380
It's been since
Two weeks, huh?

818
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,542
<i>It's been two weeks so far.</i>

819
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,780
They left her behind.
They left my mom behind.

820
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,527
Yeah.

821
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:30,867

Bye.

00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,979
I don't want to let Louisiana
play games with my life no more.

825
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:48,888
I don't want to put my life in their
hands no more. And I won't trust you

826

What happened?
They told you to cut it off?

837

Yes. Kimberly Rivers.

Huh?
Kimberly Rivers.

868
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,515
Yes. Kimberly.
You have registered.

00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:45,532
But it does sound like you do need to
check your files on the computer here.

873
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,865
Hopefully you've not somehow
gone off...

874
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,805

892
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,029
Like Larry
Me and Larry didn't like each other,

893
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,034
but the storm brought us together.

894
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,036
Now we're brothers, you know?

895
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,197
<i>The way I was going in New Orleans,</i>

896
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,606

897
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,803
or under the ground.

898
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,711
You know,
'cause I was selling drugs.

899
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,376
You know,
making money the wrong ways.

900
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,478
You know,
I wasn't doing nothing right.

901
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,889
Down there you don't have
no other way to go but that way.

902
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,893
All the high-paying jobs,

903
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,122
you have to be done
graduated high school...

904
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,631
and had a couple years of college
just to get a job...

905
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,896
that's gonna pay you at least
$10 an hour, you know?

906
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,733
And people are like,
"Hell, why am I gonna go ahead on,

907
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,898
"you know, and do all that...

908
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,909
"when I could just go
on this corner right here,

909
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:39,175
make me like $500, $600
and call it a day?"

910
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,588
I hated my life
down there, you know?

911
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,954
I really did, 'cause...

912
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,584
it was horrible.

913
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,095
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

914
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,067
I want to start my life all over.

915
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:04,105
I want to see how it is
to do it right from the beginning.

916
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,769
<i>New Orleans gets hit again.</i>

917
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,279
<i>Wind and rain from
Hurricane Rita's outer bands...</i>

918
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,874
<i>caused water to flow over
the city's already failed levees.</i>

919
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,781
And this is in the Ninth Ward
area Hmm. That's New Orleans again.

920
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,880
This is one of the hardest
hit areas. The Ninth Ward.

921
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:26,018
And our governor was very
blunt in asking people to leave,

922
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,063
<i>even going so far to ask them...</i>

923
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:32,066
<i>to write their Social Security
numbers on their arm or leg.</i>

924
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,796
Yeah, so I don't know
what Kim and them plan on doing.

925
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,965
They're planning on doing something. She
said she wants to get out this trailer though.

926
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,374
<i>'Cause they said we're gonna have strong winds,
so she's trying to get up out this trailer.</i>

927
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,041
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?
So I think I don't know.</i>

928
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,515
I think we might pull out today.

929
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,715
<i>Right above Louisiana is Arkansas.</i>

930
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,124
That's right above Louisiana.

931
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,560
Follow 165.
That put us in Wilmot in

932
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,661
in Arkansas.

933
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,930
If we go this way, we might as well
go get straight into Tennessee first.

934
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,437
Then we go holla at them. That's what
I'm sayin'. That's what I said. Yeah.

935
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,838
Now the good news
is that the water is cascading...

936
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,342
into neighborhoods
that were already flooded.

937
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:20,280
<i>And as far as we know, there has
been no loss oflife. But the water is</i>

- Go out there, start my music career.</i>

939
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:27,352
Find me a church
where I can go worship.

940
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,652
I'm already at the bottom.
I can't I can't go down.

941
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,387
I can't do nothing but go up.

942
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:36,261
Hopefully, I can put this
hurricane stuff behind me.

943
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:40,200
But if not, I'm ready to face that
head on, nose to nose, neck to neck too.

944
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,203
It don't matter to me.

945
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,631
But I'm at least trying
to do something different.

946
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,642
Trying to, you know
Trying.

947
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,871
When you try, you know,
you get results,

948
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,311
so I'm trying to better my life.

949
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,646
I see it now. I couldn't see
it when I was inside the city.

950
01:00:55,752 --> 01:01:00,155
Now I'm on the outside looking in, and
I don't want to be part of that no more.

951
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,881

01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,071
<i>Yeah, everything, man.
Yeah, you know me, boy. I love the N.O.</i>

1005
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,406
<i>Die-hard New Orleans.
Oh, yeah, man.</i>

1006
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,742
Where y'all get this truck from?

1007
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:17,079
Thank God for some shelter. Somebody
opened their heart up for us.

1008
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,986
You know, come stay with them
till we get our things situated.

1009
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,260
Just pray that, you know, God
finish leading us in the right way.

1010
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,796
Right areas, around the right people.

1011
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,700
I mean, it's just so hard to

1012
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,776
I know somebody that's a
survivor. You know what I'm sayin'?

1013
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,040
<i>Right. I went through
all of that, and I just</i>

1014
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,046
I mean, y'all went through all that.

1015
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:48,446
Still shocked about it.
I'm just I'm just shocked.

1016
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,918
Maybe a week or two from now,
I might start crying.

1017
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,955
I mean, I've been crying
the whole time. You know?

1018
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:58,925
I was just, like I can't believe
all of what we seeing on TV.

1019
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:02,964
That's the type of stuff you see,
you know, in third world countries.

1020
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,465
This is America.
It shouldn't be happening here.

1021
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,800
They treated us like we was un-American,
like we lost our citizenship.

1022
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,240
<i>They cannot say
that they did not have the means.</i>

1023
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:18,211
Our government is
supposed to be one of the greatest,

1024
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,816
but it's proven to me that, hey,

1025
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:27,049
if you don't have money and you don't
have status, you don't have a government.

1026
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,820
And thisYeah.
My son wanted to join the army.

1027
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,989
I'll be damned if he does.

1028
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,623
No. No way.
You gonna go to college,

1029
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:43,171
even if I have to wash somebody's
floors to make sure you go.

1030
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,002
You are going to college.
You're not gonna fight for a country...

1031
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,008
that does not give a damn for you.

1032
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,509
No way.

1033
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,747
These people out here
are so friendly.

1034
01:05:55,885 --> 01:06:00,185
It's nice. That's what I thought
it would be like, you know.

1035
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,814
So So everything is going just right,

1036
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,825
<i>how I planned it to go.</i>

1037
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,124
<i>I feel great. I don't know
how she feels, you know.</i>

1038
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,698
You know how I feel. Don't try to play
me. I feel like I'm already at home.

1039
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,428
I smell the Freshness in the air.

1040
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,596
<i>Who there? Oh, my cousin? Look at
that boy coming down the street.!</i>

1041
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,610
<i>Oh, y'all be bumping my CD?</i>

1042
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,044
<i>I got fans down here.!</i>

1043
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,717
What's happening, boy?

1044
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:37,225
I see ya. I smell ya. And
I taste ya, nigga!

1045
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,658
What's happening?

1046
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,662
What's up, babe?
Hey, baby.

1047
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,824
Glad to see your fuckin' ass, bud.
What's happening, coz?

1048
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,629
Come here, B.

1049
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,227
He's a good dude, bro.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1050
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,068
We met him along the way. He's been
down with us. He's real solid, bro.

1051
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,404
What's up, big man? This is my
cousin Brian. Brian, this is Brian.

1052
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,410
Brian, Brian.
You got a good name, yo.

1053
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,072
<i>Man, second day in Memphis,
a new beginning.</i>

1054
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,083
But we have so many places
we gotta go to.

1055
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:09,420
We gotta go get these things together about getting
our houses, you know, and getting everything straight.

1056
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,256
I feel great about this day.
This is the day I've been waiting for.

1057
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,697
<i>Are you scared about the future?</i>

1058
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,634
I know one thing. He gonna keep me
going and keep me faithful in his word.

1059
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,604
So, nah, I'm not afraid.

1060
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,675
Fears are the devil.

1061
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,338
I serve a true and living God.

1062
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,533
<i>Last name?
Nobles. N-O-B-L-E-S.</i>

1063
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,934
<i>Okay. Your name?</i>

1064
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,937
Kimberly Rivers.

1065
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,371
<i>You got I.D., Kimberly?
Yep.</i>

1066
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,635
<i>Uh, my name is Brian Nobles.</i>

1067
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,010
I never received any kind
of FEMA assistance.

1068
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,083
I can't talk to Blanco today?

1069
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,479
Governor Blanco.

1070
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,986
If I hear her voice,
I'll feel more comfortable.

1071
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,717
Okay.

1072
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,167
<i>It's like one big circle.</i>

1073
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,397
<i>I just can't see nothing working.</i>

1074
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,577
<i>It's not my battle.
It's the Lord's battle,</i>

1075
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,238
<i>so I'm gonna leave it alone
and let him deal with it.</i>

1076
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,984
<i>- Boy, you let that dog in the shed
- Where Brian at, man? He done went somewhere and hid?</i>

1077
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,115
Brian!

1078
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,854
You need me to be there,
you need me to talk for you,

1079
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,591
you need me to sign anything or do anything
you need me to do, just let me know, Brian.

1080
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,599
<i>I will patiently do it, bro.</i>

1081
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,862
Say a scripture. I'm listening.

1082
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,870
<i>Kick a scripture.
You kick one.</i>

1083
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,372
No, you can't get the brightening
of the day. I'm the one

1084
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,841
I need encouragement. You got it.
Well, I need encouragement now.

1085
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:12,744
'Cause I feel like you down, man. You gotta, you
know what I'm sayin', just lay up there and just

1086
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,078
I'm not down. I can't get
down. Well, just be patient.

1087
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,550
Do me a favor.
Just be thankful right now.

1088
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,214
<i>If everything is going good for us,
you know it's going good for you.</i>

1089
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,950
You know what's up with us.

1090
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:25,652
Stop being down! I just Sometimes
I go in my secret closet.

1091
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,729
Stop going in your
secret closet around us,

1092
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,028
'cause you make us think that we ain't
doing enough, when really we're maxed out.

1093
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,227
What if I just get down
and be, like, just sad?

1094
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,065
<i>Then I'm-a have to come and
encourage you. There you go.</i>

1095
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,639
You'll be like,
"Man, what's wrong with you?"

1096
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,403
<i>You're my nigga, man. Just stay up,
bro. Andjust, you know, stay positive.</i>

1097
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,569
<i>All right.
That'll make me feel better.</i>

1098
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,647
<i>All right.
All right.</i>

1099
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,577
<i>And the scripture you wanted?
I'm listening.</i>

1100
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,019
"Those who wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength. "

1101
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,054

<i>I'm talking to the bondsman.</i>

1108
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,746
They're searching the computer
to try to find him...

1109
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,112
to see if they'll be able
to post the bond.

1110
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,120
Yes.

1111

<i>Good to see you.
I'm chillin; man.</i>

<i>- What's happening, baby?
- That's what I'm talking about.</i>

1113
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,029
<i>They ain't even tell
us the hurricane was coming.</i>

<i>They didn't tell y'all?
Y'all ain't see no TVor nothing?</i>

1115
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,571
So, like

01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,145
<i>Oh, yeah? Yeah.</i>

1117
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,155
<i>Day before the hurricane?
Yeah.</i>

1118
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,226
'Cause Sunday night, when it
started storming outside, I was like,

1119
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,487
<i>"Damn, it's storming up
something real bad. '"</i>

1120
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,723
<i>The next morning,
they came up there, and he was like,</i>

1121
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,993
<i>"It's a hurricane out there,
and it's flooded. '"</i>

1122
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:16,470
<i>We like, "Where the food and stuff at? '"
They was like, '"Uh, ain't gonna be no food. '"</i>

1123
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,632
<i>When the guards and everybody left,
itjust went crazy.</i>

1124
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,274
<i>We couldn't drink the water.
It's contaminated.</i>

1125
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:28,180
<i>Ain't had nothing to eat.
Eating paper and toothpaste.</i>

1126
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,845
<i>People were buggin'
you know, beating on the cells.</i>

1127
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:35,014
<i>I'm like, "Man, these boys goin'crazy.! '"</i>

1128
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:39,185
<i>And I'm like, "This can't be real.
Gotta be a dream or something.</i>

1129
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,593
<i>A dream. '"</i>

1130
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,461
<i>All the deputiesgone.</i>

1131
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,534
<i>Just left us for to die.</i>

1132
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,195
<i>Ain't no guard to protect nobody.</i>

1133
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,603
<i>I was in there on a misdemeanor.</i>

1134
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:58,639
<i>They had some dudes, they was jumping
on out the windows andjust lost.</i>

1135
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,545
<i>Ya heard me? They got us living
like animals, you heard me?</i>

1136
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,211
<i>Like coming from Africa,
like some slaves.</i>

1137
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,222
<i>Why they gonna do us like that?
We humans just like them.</i>

1138
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:13,887
<i>Some of the hardest people you see
on the streets was crying, for real.</i>

1139
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,227
<i>Crying. You heard me?
We got families.</i>

1140
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,564
<i>You got most dudes that was in there
missing their little children</i>

1141
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,830
<i>might be drowned in the storm.</i>

1142
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,873
<i>Concerned where their people was.
I know I was.</i>

1143
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,242
I still feel
kind of shocked when I wake up.

1144
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,251
Like I don't even much sleep on
account of 'cause of that. Ya heard me?

1145
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,585
I still be thinking about that there,
that that happened to me, ya heard me?

1146
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,783
And I'm kind of blessed to get out of that.

1147
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,259
And hope I don't ever go back to that,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1148
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,992
Because that wasn't right, bro.
They ain't do us right, bro.

1149
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,533
They ain't treat us right.

1150
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:58,333
<i>#See, Mama took good care #</i>

1151
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,708
<i>- # Of all the kids #
- All right now.</i>

1152
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,440
<i>#And they all had to learn, yeah #</i>

1153
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,450
<i>#Everything she did #</i>

1154
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,783
<i>#She always taught 'em
Yes, she did #</i>

1155
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,620
<i># Taught us right from wrong #</i>

1156

1157
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,592

1158

<i>#I can see her #</i>

1159
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,963
<i>#I can see Miss Carrie Mae smilin'
Yeah #</i>

1160
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:33,030
<i># Oh, yeah ##</i>

1161
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:39,707
<i>That storm, it not only
took homes, it took people.</i>

1162
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:44,047
It took my grandmother. She kept our
family together through thick and thin.

1163
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,485
<i>She never closed the door on anyone.</i>

1164
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:50,080
<i>I can tell you this.
She sure packed a wallop.</i>

1165
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,126
<i>Two. 38s in her purse.</i>

1166
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,320
She had 12 kids,

1167
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,330
<i>76 grandkids...</i>

1168
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,663
<i>and over a hundred and some
great-grandchildren one woman.</i>

1169
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,670
If it wasn't for Miss Carrie Mae Hall,
my grandmother,

1170
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,763
I wouldn't be here.

1171
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:09,503
When I was young, I was like
trippin' out. My mama was a rock head.

1172
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,670
My mama was a drug addict.

1173
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,839
When she had got sick

1174
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:18,010
We were just Me and my little brother, we were just
running through the city, like, know what I'm sayin'?

1175
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,113
Being wherever we was at,
like surviving, you know, on the streets,

1176
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,523
'cause we didn't want the child protection
people to get us and separate us.

1177
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,688
I used to have to go in the stores
and steal soap,

1178
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:33,700
steal personal hygiene things,
dish-washing liquid.

1179
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,793
All my needs,
I used to have to steal 'em.

1180
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,702
That's why I got an eye for a need.
I just see a need.

1181
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:43,710
You know, I see kids in the store beggin' for change
or whatever, you know, I can just see their face.

1182
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,406
You know, I just see their need
and I just want to act.

1183
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:50,110
'Cause when I was little, people
didn't see the need, and I had it hard.

1184
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,052
Hoping that somebody would,
you know, see my need...

1185
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,623
and help me when I was little.

1186
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:01,395
When I started selling drugs, it took
me out of that misery of not having.

1187
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,624
So that made me want
to continue on doing it.

1188
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,566
Because it made me have everything
I needed, everything I wanted.

1189
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,070
I lacked not nothing.
Went without nothing. You dig?

1190
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:16,110
And that's everybody's dream, so everybody
would probably do it if they knew how.

1191
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,441
Or knew how to do it.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1192
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,038
So that's the way that go,
as far as that there.

1193
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:24,312
I'm not proud if it. You know what
I'm sayin'? I'm not proud of it.

1194
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,785
You know what I'm
I don't want to do it no more,

1195
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,325
because, you know what I'm sayin',
I don't want to hold nobody down.

1196
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,699
<i>Yeah, I lost my music in the hurricane.</i>

1197
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,434
So I come here to Memphis.

1198
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,274
And my cousinwhen he came down to see my
grandmother before she passed away in the hospital

1199
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,543
I gave him my CD. And just so
happened, he happened to have it.

1200
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,847
So I'm gonna burn copies.
I'm gonna make that the master.

1201
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:02,947
<i>## That song right
there, it's called "Amazing. "</i>

1202
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,026
It's about me.
Things I been through.

1203
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,392
<i>And I'm telling people I don't need
y'all to tell me that I'm amazing.</i>

1204
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,227
Just look at me.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1205
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,233
So let's peep this song out.

1206
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,235
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what's up.

1207
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,498
<i>I love you for this one,
sis. #Brighter day tomorrow #</i>

1208
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,437

- That cut.</i>

1209
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,805
<i>You like that one?</i>

1215
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,989

1216
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,962
#Tryin' to swallow me up

1217
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,659
# Had enemies everywhere
but I was determined to make it #

1218

# Sayin', Mama, don't cry

1222
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,310
#You've been takin' them every day
I'm in a danger zone #

1223
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:03,316

write something that means something.

Man, I don't feel good when I see all this fucked-up
stuff, 'cause this used to be my house, man.

1284
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,692
I used to like this house.
Get out of there!

1285
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,034
You don't want me
to come in, babe?

1286
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,664
<i>No. 'Cause they could have
snakes in here.</i>

1287
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:19,107
I don't know. You might
be able to see through, um

1288
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,114
through the window.

1289
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:26,219
<i>When I was working in Memphis,
I was working at the paper factory.</i>

1290
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:31,224
<i>When they hit me for taxes,
I'd be having like maybe $25, $30 a day.</i>

1291
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,624
That's how I had to survive
in Memphis.

1292
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,219
<i>You know, you have to be
a graduate out there.</i>

1293
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,266
<i>'Cause if you didn't graduate,
you can't make no money out there.</i>

1294
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,392
Sit down, mommy.
Sit down.

1295
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:45,599
<i>That's one of the real reasons
why I came back home to get some work.</i>

1296
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,804
<i>When my girl dog had her puppies,</i>

1297
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:55,849
once I sold all the puppies, that was enough
money for me to make that trip back home.

1298
01:20:55,951 --> 01:21:00,251
<i>Miss Kizzie
Roberts. Ten puppies.</i>

1299
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,726
<i>You hear them puppies?
Huh? You hear them puppies, boy?</i>

1300
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:11,265
Yeah, I sold 10 puppies
to make it back here.

1301
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:16,360
I hooked a five-by-eight trailer
from U-Haul up to the back of my car...

1302
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,371
<i>and pushed.</i>

1303
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:22,603
<i>It was just too hard to try to start
all over in a strange place, basically.</i>

1304
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,179
Right. You know, it was more
harder than we thought it was,

1305
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,748
<i>so I came back home.</i>

1306
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,916
<i>Now that I'm back in New Orleans,
I don't regret coming back.</i>

1307
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,218
<i>And I ain't trying to leave no more.</i>

1308
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,350
<i>This is our home, our food, our
neighbors What's happening, bro?</i>

1309
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:40,758
<i>Our problems.</i>

1310
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:43,296
I never thought they'd come back,
you dig, but, see

1311
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:46,799
Look. All my people, Three cars of
people done pass, and they all know me.

1312
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,700
You know what I'm sayin'?
So this is where I want to be at.

1313
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:53,467
If something happened to me right
around here right now, all them cars

1314
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,907
Somebody's gonna do something for me.
'Cause they know me.

1315
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:00,812
Somebody gonna call some 911. If I ain't
got no ride, somebody's gonna give me a ride.

1316
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:04,147
If I need some money, you dig,
they might not loan me no money,

1317
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,278
but they'll give me some conversation.

1318
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,331
<i>They still treating us third world.</i>

1319
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,831
The sameTen months or whatever how many
months, it's still the same out here.

1320
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,569
You know? So how can people
come back to New Orleans?

1321
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:33,512
<i>Our research has showed us that people
want to come here for a vacation.</i>

1322
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,778
They want to come and relax. They
don't want to constantly be reminded...

1323
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:40,412
about, you know, devastation when you're
trying to have a good time on a vacation.

1324
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:44,151
The mall looks great. The French Quarter
looks great. It's really been cleaned up.

1325
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,023
<i>People have the perception
that we're closed.</i>

1326
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,189
<i>And while 80% of the city
was devastated,</i>

1327
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:55,429
<i>that 20% where the tourists are
was not.</i>

1328
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,971
<i>The aquarium
just came open a few weeks ago.</i>

1329
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:01,634
<i>Harrah's Casino
opened in time for Mardi Gras.</i>

1330
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:06,112
It seems like every week we're having
some celebration, some reopening.

1331
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:11,117
And it's just amazing, the energy in the
city right now. Everything's a celebration.

1332
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:15,121
This is actually a DVD that we
produced right before the storm,

1333
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:20,727
but everything in the DVD is perfect.

1334
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,729

<i>I'll catch up with these people.

<i>That's what I really love about it.</i>

1370
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,710
<i>And then I get to do
something that matters...</i>

1371
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,574
<i>that I always can come back and
look at and say, "Man, I did that. '"</i>

1372
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:33,249
<i>I love myjob.
I got a cool boss. You know?</i>

1373
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:36,755
<i>And then he teaching me
everything I need to know.</i>

1374
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:42,194
<i>How did you guys get hooked up?</i>

1375
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:48,202
<i>Oh, he had a house on Gallier,
and his supplies kept coming up missing.</i>

1376
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,567
He wanted to really rent my dogs.

1377
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,334
And I was like, "No, man.
I wouldn't rent 'em.

1378
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:57,241
<i>I'll just leave them over here, you know, to
make sure nobody don't break into your stuff. '"</i>

1379
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:00,439
<i>And he said, "I'll get you a job.
Just come to work tomorrow. '"</i>

1380
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,482
<i>And that's how I started.</i>

1381
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:06,111
<i>He was talking to a buddy of mine,
and Scott said to him,</i>

1382
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,987
"Well, all I really want to do is work. "

1383
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,286
And once I heard that,
I was like, you know,

1384
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,885
"That's the kind of guy
that you know you can rely on. "

1385
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:18,192
<i>At first I wasn't even coming back.</i>

1386
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:22,292
<i>I'm happy I did come back,
'cause now I get to rebuild my city.</i>

1387
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,634
<i>I'd rather do a job that's
meaningful than just, you know,</i>

1388
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:30,302
<i>doing something stupid like fixing people's
drink, getting drunk all day in the French Quarter.</i>

01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:34,313
<i>I come in in the morning
andjump straight to work.</i>

1390
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,713
<i>I love the smell of that sawdust.</i>

1391
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,649
It's hard right now
for some people, you know,

1392
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:45,157
but you just got to keep going at it.

1393
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,162
That's the only thing I can say.
Keep going at it every day, you know?

1394
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,357
Try to make a difference
in your neighborhood...

1395
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:54,629
if you can't make a difference
