1
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,912
You poor, poor young thing.

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,758
Running out of gasoline
on such a hot day.

3
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,589
Yeah, that's my own fault, ma'am.

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,917
How's that?

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,150
Well, I got a little
wasted last night.

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,356
I did a stupid thing.

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,757
Well, I got shit-faced.

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,391
I stole that truck.

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,997
Went on a little joyride.

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,872
A drunk and a thief?

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,629
Now, Father.
Let he who is without sin ,,,

12
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,158
You need ...

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,995
... a guiding hand.

14
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,669
You need a family.

15
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,036
You need ...

16
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,637
... a thing called love.

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,314
I need a snapshot.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,748
Oh, for chrissake.

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,638
No.

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,875
Scotty?

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,349
Scotty, come out here.
Bring your camera.

22
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,676
Oh, God.

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,189
You leave Scotty alone.

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,197
Come on, baby, up.
They didn't mean it.

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,948
Oh, my baby.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,678
You don't mind, do you?

27
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,871
Well, actually, if ...

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,675
A memento.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,874
Filthy.

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,798
Filthy.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,638
Say cheese.

32
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,393
Hey, settle down, boys.

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,589
Don't you yell at me.

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,478
- Sons--
- Don't yell at me.

35
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,433
Where's your mother at?

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,839
Oh, fuck.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,678
Oh, God. Oh, God.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,118
- Oh, God. Honey, honey, help me.
- You son of a ...

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,794
- You filthy sinner.
- Help. Help.

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,111
- Help, honey. Help.
- You filthy sinner.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,231
Oh, yeah. Get him.

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,556
You defiled my soul mate.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,872
Give it to him, baby!

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,149
Yes.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,870
- Fornicator.
- Yes, yes, yes!

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,878
Oh, baby, do it for Jesus.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,797
Please forgive me, Jesus.

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,757
Oh, baby, tell him.

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,717
We're just doing his will.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,717
The Lord Jesus wants us
to cleanse you.

51
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,477
To cast out the demons that
have tainted your immortal soul.

52
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,398
You son of ...

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,233
Sweet lamb of God!

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,638
And if thy hand causeth thee
to fall into sin ...

55
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,236
... cut it off.

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,192
Yes, Jesus!

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,668
And if thine eye causeth thee
to fall into sin ...

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,549
... cut it out.

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,631
Smile for the camera.

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,035
- I'm feeling the spirit, Scotty.
- So sweet.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,269
Come on, boys.

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, come on, boys.

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,552
Here we go, boys.

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,710
Come on, pick it up.

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,239
Smile.

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,435
What ...?

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,272
Oh, my God.

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,874
Check him out.

69
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,674
I love a man in a uniform.

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,118
You didn't come back from the fucking
war to party with your parents, did you?

71
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,629
You know, I used to help him
with his homework.

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,028
Yeah.

73
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,474
Oh, God.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,631
I don't know.
A lot can happen in 18 months.

75
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,518
Tommy, I know I keep saying this ...

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,398
- Go ahead.
- ... but we're proud of you.

77
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,030
Thanks, Dad. Mom.

78
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,431
Don't worry, little brother.

79
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,592
I'll find you.

80
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,640
That's crazy. All right,
I'll check you later, man.

81
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,354
This is sweet and shit,
but none of this would be there--

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,590
People don't have a sense
of history anymore.

83
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,398
Oh, hey. You take this.

84
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,869
Yo, Tom.

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,392
Welcome home,
Captain Shock-And-Awe.

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,953
- Well, thanks, man.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,989
So how was it?

88
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,992
Now, come on. No, tell me.
What? Did you get shot at?

89
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,191
You kill somebody,
eat their heart?

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,430
- What?
- All the above.

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,312
Yeah.

92
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,833
So you and Marilyn ...

93
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,994
... together again?

94
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,758
Of course.

95
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,150
Jared, you don't know anything,
do you?

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,874
About my little brother?

97
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,157
Oh, no, no. I mean, I know
what everybody else does. Right?

98
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,713
Like, Jesse and Nicole ...

99
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,869
... took off for Hollywood a year ago,
and they haven't been heard from since.

100
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,551
If you don't get me
out of here right now ...

101
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,790
... I'm gonna go Columbine.

102
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,077
I'm going tomorrow.

103
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,272
What? Where?

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,714
California.

105
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,917
I got 10 days' R and R. Time enough
to get to Hollywood and back.

106
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,115
Tom ...

107
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,479
... baby, they're dead.

108
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,079
We don't know that.

109
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,558
Nicole was my best friend.

110
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,711
She would've called me.

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,913
And your brother,
he would've called you, right?

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,231
Think you're gonna find them?
Cops couldn't, their parents couldn't.

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,913
They're not me.

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,836
Listen, Jesse is my little brother.

115
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,636
I always looked out for him.

116
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,869
If I wasn't overseas, I--

117
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,600
I'd have gone after him
the minute I heard.

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,797
I want you to go with me.

119
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,189
I found him. Come on, guys.

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,319
Jeez, dude. I haven't been up
this early since high school.

121
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,152
Well, it's good for you.

122
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,393
Anyway, I wanna make El Paso today,
maybe even Las Cruces.

123
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,994
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,555
Oh, no.

125
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,119
Please. No, no, no.

126
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,874
No, Tom.
He's so not coming with us.

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,958
I heard that.

128
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,350
Tom is my best friend
and I just wanna help out.

129
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,794
You are not his best friend.

130
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,236
No, no. I said he's my best friend.
I can't control who Tom likes.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,237
- Like you, for instance.
- I don't mind.

132
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,637
We got a lot of ground to cover.

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,189
We could use another vehicle,
but that piece of shit?

134
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,918
She's gonna hear you.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,354
Come on. She can make it.

136
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,192
I know that she can.

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,876
If she dies,
you are not riding in this truck.

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,157
If she dies along the way,
you can bury me with her.

139
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,313
Deal. Let's get out of here.

140
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,515
I talked to my cousin, Jake.
He lives in L.A.

141
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,915
I think he was the last
to hear from Jesse.

142
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,150
-Well, what'd he say?
-Not much.

143
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,788
Jess was looking to crash
at his place.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,428
Told him he was on something
called the Old Highway.

145
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,794
I looked on the map.

146
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,712
There's nothing called
the Old Highway.

147
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,672
It's weird.

148
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,872
What the hell are you doing?

149
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,155
Enjoying myself.

150
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,799
What are you doing?

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,110
Jesus Christ, Marilyn,
we'll get pulled over.

152
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,998
Don't be a dork.

153
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,795
I'm a corporal in the U.S. Army,
sweetheart.

154
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,520
You know what could happen to me
if I got arrested?

155
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,753
Why don't you wanna be over here
with the other dinosaurs?

156
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,992
I don't like it with the other
dinosaurs. I don't like it at all.

157
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,151
I'm gonna eat him
if he's over here with me.

158
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,117
That's what I'm gonna do.

159
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,276
He's asleep.

160
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,788
It's about damn time.

161
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,996
The kid hasn't shut up
since high school.

162
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,833
Oh, it's nice of him to help.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,718
You know why he's
really here, right?

164
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,552
Why?

165
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,518
Jared's had a hard-on for Nicole
since, like, second grade.

166
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,035
He thinks if he finds her,
he'll finally get laid.

167
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,112
- Oh, good goddamn luck.
- I'm not kidding.

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,192
Marilyn ...

169
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,150
... are you glad I'm back?

170
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,392
What do you think?

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,075
It must have been hell for you.

172
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,593
Must have been so lonely.

173
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,830
You know, I'd understand if you
partied some while I was gone.

174
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,956
I want you to know that.

175
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,158
Don't worry.

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,991
I was a good girl.

177
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,915
I went to this store in Dallas
and bought a dildo.

178
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,230
I wrote your name on it
with a marker.

179
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,630
- You didn't.
- I did.

180
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,517
You wanna see it?

181
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,996
I packed it.

182
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,316
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

183
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,192
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

184
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,954
But you get your ass back in bed.
That's an order.

185
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,555
Hey, Nicole.

186
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,551
Big daddy's coming to rescue you.

187
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,755
Yeah.

188
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,159
Hey, guys, it's me.

189
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,198
I'm burning oil like Marilyn
through a case of beer.

190
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,839
Fuck you, you dweeb.

191
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,315
Oh, whenever you're done with Tom.

192
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,952
Hello?

193
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,476
All right, there's a gas station
up ahead. We'll pull over.

194
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,270
It was just a joke.

195
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,556
l didn't think it was funny.

196
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,835
He didn't mean anything.

197
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,752
I'm not some kind of fucking drunk.

198
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,273
He didn't say that.

199
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,237
What do you think?

200
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,198
l don't even wanna
have this conversation.

201
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,708
Zip it up, boys.

202
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,476
Zip it up.

203
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,633
Hey, how you doing?

204
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,715
l don't know.

205
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,956
Listen, we're on our way
to California.

206
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,599
My buddy here needs some oil.

207
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,357
Suppose we could use a fill-up too.

208
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,315
It's self-serve.

209
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,316
l never touch the pumps
unless l have to.

210
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,752
Causes cancer in the testicles.

211
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,555
Thirty-weight, over there.

212
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,390
Bathroom's in the back.

213
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,151
Try our snack bar.

214
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,557
Something tasty for everybody's taste.

215
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,870
-Sh--?
-I'll pay for it.

216
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,919
Listen, we're looking for somebody.

217
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,640
Might have come through here
about a year ago.

218
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,037
They were in a blue convertible,
headed for Hollywood.

219
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,590
One of them was my brother.

220
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,430
l was hoping you might remember.

221
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,069
Come on, Tommy.
Let's get out of here.

222
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,475
Yeah.

223
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,231
Yeah, l remember.

224
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,352
l remember them all.

225
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,473
Young dreamers, young lovers.

226
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,799
Heading for the coast,
heading for a new future.

227
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,275
But them.

228
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,718
Them, l remember.

229
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,636
They're stuck in my memory
like gum under my chair.

230
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,673
Young.

231
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,753
So young.

232
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,758
But, hey ...

233
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,874
... for 22.95 ...

234
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,113
... I'll tell you everything.

235
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,514
Oh, for God's sake.

236
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,069
Tom, can we please
get out of here now?

237
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,309
Just tell me what the fuck you know.

238
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,599
They were lost.

239
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,830
Babes in the woods.

240
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,558
Lambs to the slaughter.

241
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,474
l tried.

242
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,348
l tried to steer them away.

243
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,315
l did.

244
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,757
l really did, l swear.

245
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,349
What did you tell them?

246
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,475
l told them I'd seen a lot of shit,
and they'd better watch their asses ...

247
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,477
... or they'd end up shit
under somebody's shoe.

248
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,352
And what did Jesse say to that?

249
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,559
My brother, what did he say?

250
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,031
He told me to have sexual
relations with myself.

251
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,639
That's not a bad idea.

252
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,512
This is hers.

253
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,432
l swear. This ...

254
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,512
This is Nicole's.

255
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,236
l remember when she won this
for riding.

256
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,469
We were, like, 1 1 .

257
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,639
You remember?

258
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,835
Yeah, l remember.

259
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,837
Dude, you're such a joke.

260
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,031
Where did you get this?

261
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,315
l don't know.

262
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,993
Where?

263
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,397
Where did you get it?

264
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,869
You know what? l do remember.

265
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,834
l know, yeah.

266
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,035
l--

267
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,194
About a year ago,
l found it on the Old Highway.

268
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,833
What Old Highway?

269
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,156
There's no Old Highway on the map.

270
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,914
You gotta know where it is.

271
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,394
Will you show me?

272
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,552
Sure.

273
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,829
It's about a mile up that way.

274
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,671
You can't miss it.

275
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,478
How much?

276
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,156
It's on the house.

277
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,198
Thanks.

278
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,516
Tom, come on.

279
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,433
Who's the most awesome guy?
Jared's the most awesome guy.

280
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,878
Hey, yo, it's me. l gotta pull over.

281
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,514
Fuck, Jared. Not more oil.

282
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,356
No, l have to go to fudge town.

283
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,637
A little too much information, dude.

284
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,759
Oh, sorry.

285
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,995
Oh, it's terrible.

286
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,638
We're close to a rest stop.
l just saw a sign.

287
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,832
It can't wait.

288
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,757
Breakfast gave me the McShitties.
I'll catch up with you.

289
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,600
My gosh. Shit.

290
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,909
Shit.

291
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,193
The next services
are miles up the road.

292
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,912
I'm betting they at least
made a pit stop here.

293
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,235
Yeah, well, if l know Nicole,
she sure wouldn't pee in the dirt.

294
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,236
-Hey, Tom?
-Yeah.

295
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,993
Nothing.

296
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,912
Shit.

297
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,758
Literally.

298
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,835
Klingons, perfect.

299
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,438
The fuck?

300
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,517
What the fuck? Fuck, dude.

301
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,273
Sir?

302
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,795
It's occupied.

303
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,591
Jesus Christ.

304
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,790
Oh, shit.

305
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,877
Oh, fuck.

306
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,232
Damn it.

307
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,672
Jesus Christ.

308
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,833
It's occupied. It's occupied.

309
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,309
I'm almost done. I'm almost done.
l swear it.

310
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,513
As soon as Jared gets here,
you think we could find a motel?

311
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,511
l could use a little minibar action.

312
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,395
All right.
I guess I'll use the facilities.

313
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,192
Tommy?

314
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,878
Tommy?

315
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,474
Hey, are you okay?

316
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,233
Jesse.

317
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,279
I'm so sorry, Jesse.

318
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,671
I'm so sorry.

319
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,875
Did l hear you say Jesse?

320
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,718
Nicole?

321
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,959
What the fuck?

322
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,516
''KZL-303. ''

323
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,871
''Nicole''? Oh, my God.

324
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,159
What the fuck?

325
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,238
Tom?

326
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,198
Tom?

327
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,709
Tom.

328
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,797
l don't like this.

329
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,913
What the fuck?

330
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,309
Oh, come on. Come on.

331
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,916
Just stellar.

332
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,552
Guys, it's Jared.

333
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,312
Can you hear me?

334
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,919
It's Jared. Please come in.

335
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,837
Thanks for the ride.

336
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,908
Oh, my ...

337
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,912
Nicole.

338
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,029
What happened to you?

339
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,994
It's been, like, a year.

340
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,151
Nobody's heard anything.

341
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,916
Oh, you look like shit.

342
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,752
What happened?

343
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,355
Yellow truck.

344
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,072
The driver ...

345
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,711
He took me to the bus.

346
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,353
Who the hell are you?

347
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,315
You're getting yourself
into a shitload of trouble.

348
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,198
You know that?

349
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,078
You hear me?

350
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,158
You hear me?!

351
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,359
Look at me, you fuck!

352
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,270
What do you think you're doing, huh?

353
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,157
What do you think this is?

354
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,632
Did you do something
to my brother, you fuck?

355
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,829
Say something to me,
you sack of shit!

356
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,232
l said, say something!

357
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,433
What the ...?

358
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,310
All right.

359
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,238
Here we go.

360
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,272
Let me take a look.

361
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,350
''KZL 303. ''

362
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,432
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-l missed you.

363
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,038
Really?

364
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,670
l missed you too.

365
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,796
I've always missed you.

366
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,275
Ever since the sixth grade ...

367
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,273
... when you sat next to me ...

368
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,390
... I've always kind of liked you.

369
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,720
l thought you loved me.

370
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,832
Of course. l just never thought,
in, like, a million years ...

371
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,275
... that you and l
would ever have a chance.

372
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,590
Oh, Jess.

373
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,029
He was a good guy.

374
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,719
ls. ls a good guy.

375
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,429
l mean, Tom and Marilyn,
they're out looking for him right now.

376
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,271
But l came because of you.

377
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,919
And whoever did this to you
is one sick fuck.

378
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,798
Pardon my French.

379
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,789
I'll kill him.

380
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,552
The driver, we'll kill him
for what he did to you.

381
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,233
The bathroom thing?

382
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,198
No, no. That's, like, nothing
compared to what he did to you.

383
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,952
We'll kill him.

384
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,071
First, we gotta get you to a hospital.

385
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,357
-Then we're gonna go to the cops.
-No, no, no.

386
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,795
l tried the cops. l tried everything.

387
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,393
Don't you see?

388
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,194
Ends here.

389
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,238
Ends here.

390
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,952
Ends here, ends here.

391
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,195
Nicole. Nicole.

392
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,511
Hey, easy, easy, easy.
Come on, come on.

393
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,751
I'll protect you.

394
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,756
I'll protect you.

395
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,671
Jesse.

396
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,198
Jesse.

397
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,992
You know what we have to do?
We have to go. We have to go.

398
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,390
Tom and Marilyn,
they're looking for us.

399
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,472
They're at the rest stop.

400
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,799
Hey.

401
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,319
Asshole.

402
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,118
Listen to me.

403
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,954
I'm a corporal in the U.S. Army.

404
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,558
They're gonna be looking for me ...

405
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,838
... and they're gonna find you ...

406
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,990
... and you're gonna be fucked.

407
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,196
You understand?

408
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,398
So you better let me go right now!

409
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,037
Hey, I'm talking to you.

410
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,557
My brother was here, wasn't he?

411
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,751
Jesse, my little brother.

412
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,229
You hurt him, didn't you?

413
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,711
Just tell me, you fucker!

414
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,672
Did you kill my brother?

415
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,354
Tell me!

416
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,676
Then you better kill me, fucker.

417
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,149
Don't you fucking dare!

418
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,952
You hear me?

419
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,155
No.

420
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,515
No, no, no.

421
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,870
I'll kill you-- No!

422
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,913
Fuck! Fucker!

423
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,233
l will fucking kill you!

424
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,869
Jesse.

425
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,996
It's Jared.

426
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,073
Jesse.

427
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,912
It's Jared.

428
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,158
Oh, Jesse.

429
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,912
Nicole.

430
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,159
Nicole.

431
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,719
Jesse.

432
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,919
Oh, my God.

433
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,076
He's got Tom too.

434
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,316
He's got Tom in the bus.

435
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,038
What?

436
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,879
Ends here.

437
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,712
Ends here.

438
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,271
Ends here.

439
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,117
Ends here, ends here, ends here.

440
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,434
Nicole.

441
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,789
Oh, Jesus.

442
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,309
Jesus! Jesus!

443
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,597
Nicole?

444
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,317
Nicole? Wh--?

445
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,552
Okay.

446
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,314
Everything's gonna be okay.

447
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,798
Goddamn it.

448
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,150
Goddamn it.
You're letting me down, bitch!

449
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,115
So far, this trip sucks.

450
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,915
Hey, hey. Hey, please, please, please.

451
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,392
Thank you.

452
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,072
Thank you.

453
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,756
Thank you.

454
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,434
My car just, like, died back there.

455
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,869
The smell, I'm so sorry.

456
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,474
l fell ...

457
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,275
This guy, like, tried to kill me. l ...

458
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,550
-Popsicle?
-No, no, thank you.

459
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,711
Such a hot day.

460
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,799
Be nice to have something cool
to suck on.

461
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,276
Better take it, son.

462
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,634
Sure.

463
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,435
Scotty, Popsicle.

464
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,789
Thanks, Scotty.

465
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,830
There, isn't that nice?

466
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,310
You said someone
tried to facilitate your demise?

467
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,118
Yeah.

468
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,511
This dude in, like,
a big yellow truck and--

469
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,829
Yellow truck?

470
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,996
Did you see
who was behind the wheel?

471
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,993
- Did you see?
- No, not really.

472
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,912
It was some Dukes of Hazard reject.

473
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,599
Then you must be a sinner, boy.

474
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,752
Otherwise he wouldn't be on your ass.

475
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,480
- He was one too.
- What?

476
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,558
The one behind the wheel, the driver?

477
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,358
He was a sinner once, like you.

478
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,029
A fornicator.

479
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,676
His soul as black as coal.

480
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,236
-We cleansed him.
-He got what he deserved.

481
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,635
And then he gave us
what we deserved.

482
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,348
Look, all that l know is that
some asshole tried to kill me, okay?

483
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,629
Hey, l think we're really close
to the rest stop now.

484
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,395
You can just let me out,
I'll go find my friends.

485
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,515
He's gonna like you, boy.

486
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,676
You're a dirty boy, aren't you?

487
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,708
Dirty boys must be cleansed.

488
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,559
It only hurts for an instant.

489
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,909
What only hurts?

490
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,191
What are you talking about?
What only hurts?

491
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,628
Show him, my sons.

492
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,232
And if thine eye causeth thee
to fall into sin, cut it out.

493
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,434
Thanks for the ride, you freaks.

494
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,835
Jared, what are you doing?
That's our ride.

495
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,197
No, l don't think so.
It's a bunch of wackos.

496
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,113
I don't care. I just wanna
get the hell out of here.

497
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,078
- Where is Tom?
- He's gone.

498
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,515
What do you mean, gone?

499
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,875
I went into the bathroom,
and when I came out ...

500
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,598
... Tom, the car, just vanished.

501
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,115
- Well, that's fucking weird.
- Yeah.

502
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,951
And that's not the only thing.

503
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,554
I can't go in there.
It's the girls' room.

504
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,190
You're not gonna suddenly
sprout tits, all right, Jared?

505
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,714
You know, I didn't know
that girls could be this yucky.

506
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,791
All right, listen to me, okay?

507
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,715
I don't think that this is how it is.
I think that this is how it was.

508
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,155
What the fuck are you talking about?

509
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,912
Look, the first time that l came in here,
it was nice and clean and new.

510
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,831
And l thought l saw Nicole, okay?

511
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,318
l thought l saw her tag this stall.

512
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,589
Look at it.

513
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,235
Jared, look at it.

514
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,994
What do you think,
I'm drunk off my ass and seeing shit?

515
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,912
No, l don't.

516
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,151
l saw her too.

517
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,152
Fuck.

518
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,312
Fuck.

519
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,036
Fuck!

520
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,791
Fuck!

521
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,075
What the fuck?

522
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,912
What the fuck? We're seeing ghosts.

523
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,710
-Why is that so hard to believe?
-Yeah, like, a ghost bathroom?

524
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,916
Jared, all l can do
is believe what l saw.

525
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,640
Okay? This bathroom is as real
as Nicole was.

526
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,997
And she was so real,
you could reach out and touch her.

527
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,196
You know what I'm talking about.

528
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,919
Are you fucking blushing,
you little weenie?

529
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,400
Oh, my God, you are.
What did you do with her, dude?

530
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,591
It's nobody's business.

531
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,792
Wow, you finally get laid,
only the chick's dead.

532
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,672
l don't wanna talk about it.

533
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,552
It's personal.

534
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,358
Wait, she told you
Tom was on the bus?

535
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,590
-What does that mean?
-l don't know.

536
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,351
Well, she wrote
that some psycho took Jesse.

537
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,078
The driver.

538
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,037
-Maybe the bus is his little playpen.
-Could be.

539
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,153
But she didn't say where it was?

540
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,192
''Ends here.''

541
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,439
That's what she said, ''Ends here.''

542
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,358
We gotta find that bus.
We gotta save Tom.

543
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,909
No, wait, wait, wait.
We're gonna wait right here ...

544
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,355
... until somebody comes along
and call the police.

545
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,034
That gas station, remember?
With that crazy old guy.

546
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,112
- We can walk there.
- No, that's, like, 60 miles from here ...

547
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,356
Come on, it's just over here.

548
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,797
The road goes around these hills,
but it's really just over there.

549
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,674
Tell me you're not thinking
about hiking.

550
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,990
It's the middle of the night.

551
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,277
Don't be a fucking pussy.

552
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,670
I'm not being a pussy,
there are snakes.

553
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,114
There are tarantulas.

554
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,556
There are inbred zombie cannibals.
God knows what else is out there.

555
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,358
Fuck it.

556
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,113
Marilyn, there could be
another explanation for all this.

557
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,032
-Like what?
-Here, here.

558
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,714
Maybe it's, like,
some kind of mass psychosis.

559
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,871
You and me got, like,
a mind meld going.

560
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,917
Read my mind, Jared.
Shut the fuck up.

561
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,275
l can do that. Sure.

562
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,996
-Jared, Jesus.
-Sorry.

563
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,195
Holy shit.

564
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,589
That's the fucking truck.

565
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,272
-What the hell is that?
-l took it out of Tom's, come on.

566
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,838
So, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna, like, shoot the driver?

567
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,355
Yes, if we have to.

568
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,671
There's nobody in there.

569
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,350
Maybe he ran off.

570
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,557
No, maybe he's in there. Come here.

571
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,191
Jesus, he killed him.

572
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,789
-What?
-Jesus.

573
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,350
Goddamn it. You just scared
the shit out of me, you asshole.

574
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,834
You're the asshole.

575
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,077
-You fucked my nap.
-All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

576
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,952
Cash register's open.

577
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,675
Take everything.
Just don't hurt me, okay?

578
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,150
We're not here to rob you. We wanna
know where that customer is outside.

579
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,511
Customer? l got a customer?

580
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,911
-Where is he?
-That's what we wanna know.

581
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,874
-l think he took my boyfriend.
-He tried to kill me on the toilet.

582
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,958
-You're shitting me.
-No, he's not.

583
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,873
So he didn't come in here?
You haven't seen him anywhere?

584
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,759
You're the only one to disturb
my slumber and my supper.

585
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,388
Fuck your supper.
He's gotta be here somewhere, right?

586
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,949
l mean, do you have a bathroom?

587
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,752
-Locked, out back.
-Do you have a phone?

588
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,915
Our cells are dead.

589
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,757
Yeah, got a pay phone.

590
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,152
In the garage.

591
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,155
Hello. Hello.

592
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,835
-Hello?
-Yeah, is this 91 1 ?

593
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,069
-ls this 91 1 ?
-91 1.

594
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,437
-Great. Okay, my name is Jared Schnoz.
-Schnoz.

595
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,593
We're at a gas station,
right near the California border.

596
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,437
My friends and l think that our friend
might have been kidnapped.

597
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,428
Friend? Kidnapped?

598
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,396
Yes, his name is Tom.

599
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,439
- Tom Hilts.
- Tom.

600
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,713
Is this really 911?

601
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,318
- Who the hell is this?
- Tom.

602
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,357
Tom.

603
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,555
- Tom.
- Listen, fucker.

604
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,996
- Do you know something about this?
- Fucker?

605
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,196
Yeah? Well, fuck you.

606
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,191
Where's Tom?
What did you do with him?

607
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,920
Fuck you.

608
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,959
Jess?

609
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,557
- Jesse.
- No!

610
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,110
It's me. It's me. Jesse, Jesse.

611
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,709
It's Tommy. It's big bother.
It's Tommy.

612
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,398
It's me.

613
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,392
I found you, you little shit.

614
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,715
I knew you weren't dead.

615
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,355
I wouldn't let you be dead.

616
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,557
Tommy? Is that ...?

617
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,517
- Is that you, Tommy?
- Jess.

618
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,831
Are you Tommy? Is that you?

619
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,871
What did he do?

620
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,113
What did he do?

621
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,789
- What are you hoping to find?
- I don't fucking know.

622
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,078
This fucker's license, registration,
maybe the address for that fucking bus.

623
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,792
- I wouldn't do that if I was you.
- Yeah.

624
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,035
What if he comes back?

625
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,028
What if he finds you messing around
in that truck? What if he gets mad?

626
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,878
That's what this is for.

627
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,594
He gets mad, you blow
his fucking balls off.

628
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,470
Please, please.

629
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,398
That's private property.

630
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,439
Put it back. Right now.
Put it back.

631
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,349
Son of a bitch. He took Jesse.

632
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,120
He took Nicole,
and now he's got Tom.

633
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,072
Marilyn.

634
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,316
- What?
- Check it out.

635
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,993
There's blood.

636
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,040
-Oh, my God.
-What?

637
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,919
-Oh, my God.
-Jared, show me.

638
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,355
l saw this on Court TV
about serial killers.

639
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,632
They take trophies. They're fetishistic.

640
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,438
This is like some sexual thing.

641
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,919
You're right. He probably
just spanked all over that stuff.

642
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,395
Gross.

643
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,990
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

644
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,236
Oh, the eyes.

645
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,949
-The eyes.
-What?

646
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,149
What are you talking about?
What about the eyeballs?

647
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,154
Nothing, l don't know nothing.

648
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,039
He said that l was a sinner.

649
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,355
The driver?

650
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,432
No, the preacher.

651
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,835
Preacher? Who the hell is he?

652
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,993
l don't know. He seemed to work
for the driver, l guess.

653
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,390
So I'd wake up and there they'd be.

654
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,549
The preacher, his wife ...

655
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,318
... and their kids.

656
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,708
He brought his family ...

657
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,632
... to fuck you up?

658
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,076
They'd always stand around and pray.

659
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,116
They said they were helping me.

660
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,069
Helping you what?

661
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,992
Get to heaven.

662
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,555
And how the fuck
were they gonna do that?

663
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,159
l never knew when they were coming,
and then you'd hear the Winnebago.

664
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,035
- Winnebago?
- The family's.

665
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,714
And then he'd bring me casseroles.

666
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,998
l fucking hate casseroles.

667
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,559
- And then ...
- Fuck.

668
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,152
The driver would
drag me out of here ...

669
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:04,713
... and the preacher would start
praying, and then the fun would begin.

670
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,397
Don't bullshit me.

671
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,279
You know something,
something about the eyeballs.

672
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,632
Try our snack bar. Tasty.

673
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,472
For everybody's taste.

674
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,558
You know everything
that goes on on this road.

675
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,196
I'll bet you know all about this driver--

676
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,434
Where he is, what he wants.
--and you're gonna tell me.

677
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,473
No, l swear.

678
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,989
Tell me everything.

679
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,956
Everything you know,
or l will shoot your fucking ass.

680
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,236
Do you understand?

681
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,358
I try to warn them. I try.

682
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,712
But he hears.

683
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,073
He knows.

684
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,199
I gotta be careful.
I gotta be very careful.

685
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,188
- Who the hell is he?
- It's not who.

686
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,795
It's what.

687
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,192
There's an old Indian legend.

688
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,679
If you're buried
without your eyeballs ...

689
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,357
... your spirit is cursed
to wander the earth.

690
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,634
Restless, lost, in pain forever.

691
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,519
You're saying that
the driver's a ghost?

692
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,399
And that someone
took his eyeballs too?

693
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,034
That's exactly what I'm saying.

694
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,074
You know, I tried to find them
one day, his baby blues.

695
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,839
I wanted to find them.
I wanted to put him to rest.

696
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,235
Put him to rest?

697
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,990
Burn the eyeballs.

698
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,514
The smoke will rise to heaven.
His spirit will follow.

699
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,236
All right, we gotta find Tom, find this
bus. Do you have a car that works?

700
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,793
Yeah.

701
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,711
- Tow truck.
- Get it.

702
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,553
Take us to the next town,
we gotta get the cops up here.

703
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,871
I hate to say it, but I told you so.

704
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,874
Get the tow truck.

705
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,759
- Where the fuck is the truck?
- I don't know, Jared.

706
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,388
There's not even any tire tracks.

707
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,036
Ghost driver, ghost truck.

708
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,876
Whatever. We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, right? Doesn't matter.

709
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,396
Oh, shit.

710
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,712
Wait, wait, wait.

711
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,277
If it is a ghost,
do you think a gun ...?

712
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,713
Come on, Scooby-Doo,
let's find the mystery bus.

713
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,993
I think it was a van.

714
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,397
Hey, mister?

715
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,312
Hello?

716
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,389
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

717
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,239
Oh, shit.

718
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,515
He's here somewhere. All right.

719
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,835
There, there, there! There he is!

720
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,074
Did you get him?

721
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,712
No, it's not him.
It's the gas-station guy.

722
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,278
Then who's this?

723
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,152
Jared?

724
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,953
You all right?

725
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,992
That's yours.

726
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,270
That's your truck.

727
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,200
- Come on, let's go.
- Shit.

728
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,273
I got you.

729
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,432
Oh, no.

730
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,078
Oh, God.

731
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,633
Okay. Good.

732
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,118
He wants you to understand.

733
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,036
- Understand what?
- Your duties.

734
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,153
Look, please, just please
don't let him hurt me.

735
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,950
No. No, don't you get it?

736
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,758
No, he doesn't wanna hurt you.

737
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,115
He ...

738
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,072
He

739
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,870
He wants you to hurt her.

740
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,630
No.

741
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,629
What?

742
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,718
He thinks she's a sinner.

743
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,276
- And he wants you to cleanse her.
- No.

744
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,550
No. No way. No fucking way.

745
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,552
He knows she was unfaithful, okay?

746
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,917
When her soldier boy
was off at war ...

747
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,318
... she took solace in drink ...

748
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,749
... and in the company of men.

749
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,477
I won't hurt her.

750
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,877
I was afraid you'd say that.

751
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,555
No, please.

752
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,070
I wish the goddamn
cell phone worked.

753
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,838
I can't wait to call Mom.

754
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,355
It's been really hard on her,
you know.

755
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,797
I thought about
you every day, man.

756
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,552
Once, I could have sworn I saw you.

757
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,395
We were running a checkpoint
in Buhriz.

758
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,676
It's just outside of Baghdad.

759
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,829
A car goes through. I see you
sitting in the back seat.

760
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,075
You don't think moments like that.

761
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,795
What the fuck
would you be doing in Iraq?

762
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,078
It was just a kid.

763
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,276
Had a jacket like yours.
You know, the red one?

764
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,877
You should have saved me.

765
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,599
You're my brother.
You should have saved me.

766
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,075
I did save you, shithead.

767
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,872
What are you talking about?

768
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,034
You're not gonna, Jared.
You're just not gonna do it.

769
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,269
Oh, my God.

770
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,029
Jared, you're not going to.
You're just not gonna.

771
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,071
Oh, my God.

772
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,960
Jared, please. Jared, please.
You don't have to do this.

773
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:01,032
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

774
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,355
Leave him alone!

775
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,352
Jared, don't you fucking dare do it.
Jared, don't you dare.

776
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,790
Jared, don't you dare!
Jared, don't you dare!

777
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,592
- I'm sorry.
- Jared, no!

778
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,716
- I'm sorry.
- No, Jared.

779
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,958
I can't. I can't.

780
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,791
- I can't.
- Fuck you!

781
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,160
Jared, no, no.

782
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,076
Oh, my God.

783
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,631
I'm so sorry.

784
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,118
All right!

785
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,272
You all right?

786
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,673
You all right?

787
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,317
I prayed for you ...

788
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,076
... to save me.

789
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,150
- You never came.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

790
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,550
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

791
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,755
Jess.

792
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,234
Jess. Jess, hold on.

793
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,877
- I'll get you to a hospital.
- You should have saved me.

794
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,473
What?

795
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,477
Jesse!

796
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,556
Jesse!

797
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,675
Jesse!

798
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,392
Marilyn?

799
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,437
-Marilyn?
-Tommy.

800
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,394
-Tommy.
-I'm here, baby. I'm here.

801
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,229
- You were on the bus?
- Yeah.

802
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,036
- Is there any sign of your brother?
- My brother's dead.

803
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,039
So is Nicole.

804
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,232
And they took Jared. I'm sorry.

805
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,593
We gotta get you some help.

806
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,797
I'm gonna be fine.
Let's just get home, okay?

807
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,830
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

808
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,234
Oh, my God.

809
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,069
This is it. That's what Nicole
was trying to tell Jared.

810
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,753
Ends here.

811
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,354
- This is it. This is where we should look.
- Marilyn.

812
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,557
- They must be here somewhere.
- What?

813
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,474
- His eyes.
- The fuck you talking about?

814
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,038
The driver. Burn his eyes
and we can put him down.

815
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,352
- I got this guy.
- Tom.

816
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,352
Tom.

817
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,552
Jared?

818
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,999
Jared, what happened to you?

819
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,556
The family made me dinner.
It's casserole.

820
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,396
Okay, listen to me, okay? Jared.

821
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,999
Jared, listen.

822
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,229
The driver's eyes...

823
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,391
Look at me!
... they're here somewhere.

824
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,154
Okay, we have to find them
and burn them.

825
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,913
Jared, you check out here.

826
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,831
Oh, shit. I think I might have it.
I think I might ...

827
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,069
Oh, God.

828
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,512
- You find anything?
- Nothing.

829
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,438
Me either.

830
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,397
How do you burn
somebody's eyes, anyway?

831
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,635
That'll do.

832
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,994
Wait, how am I gonna light that?

833
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,716
- Wait.
- Jared, just find them.

834
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,992
Fuck.

835
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,112
What the fuck?

836
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,753
- He's gone. He's just fucking gone.
- Tom!

837
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,758
- What?
- They're there. Here's a picture of them.

838
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,592
The twins.

839
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,473
The twins have the eyes.

840
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,839
Tom, look out!

841
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,352
Open up.

842
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,030
Thanks for the fucking ride.

843
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,553
Tom.

844
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,234
Tom. Baby, it's over.

845
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,594
Come on.

846
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,998
What the ...?

847
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,991
Goddamn it.

848
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,470
Maybe he went on ahead.

849
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,231
It's just not like him.

850
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,116
And that car of his ...

851
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,310
I drove practically the
whole way back. It's weird.

852
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,592
Marilyn.

853
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:19,394
I know this has been hell for you.

854
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,678
We did the right thing.

855
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,672
We stopped the bad guy ...

856
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:35,159
... even if this whole thing
was completely fucking crazy.

857
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,311
Marilyn, please stop crying.

858
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,909
You should have saved me.

859
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,639
The fuck?

860
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,270
You should have saved me.

861
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,194
I don't fucking believe it.

862
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,110
Tom, help me.

863
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,158
Marilyn.

864
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,432
Marilyn!

865
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,393
Marilyn!

866
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,470
Marilyn!
