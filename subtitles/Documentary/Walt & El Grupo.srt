How about a souvenir picture? 

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,940
Can you turn towards each other?





1
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.948
My God ! My phone just
does not work out here.

2
00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.367
Oh, my God !
How are we ever gonna live?

3
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.664
Uh ! Thanks.

4
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.666
There's a counsellor. Oh, excuse me.

5
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.710
Um, can you tell me where
the Navajo bunk is?

6
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.129
- It's right over there.
- Thanks.

7
00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:22.094
Now, girls, let's find our duffles
as quickly as we can.

8
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.305
We have a big first day
ahead of us.

9
00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.933
I'm going to turn the bullhorn
over now to my daughter,

10
00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.685
and right-hand man,
Marva, Jr.

11
00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:34.023
Marva, bunk assignments,
if you please.

12
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.943
All right, ladies,
here we go. Listen up.

13
00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.741
Wait a minute.
I thought this was a boy's camp.

14
00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.709
Okay, found my duffle.

15
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:02.635
Now the question is...
how do I get it out?

16
00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.057
Okay, I can do it.
Okay... no, I can't.

17
00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.601
- You must be new.
- How could you tell?

18
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.937
- You didn't know how
to grab your duffle...

19
00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.439
before the aides tossed
it into the heap.

20
00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.441
-I would say you need some serious help.
-Thanks.

21
00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:19.652
It's the big, yellow one.

22
00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.990
Whoa ! Now,
that's my kinda woman.

23
00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:26.450
- Yo, tie-dye girl !
- Hmm?

24
00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:29.078
Could you give me an hand
with my duffle? It's the yellow one,

25
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.080
- buried way in there.
- Sure.

26
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.041
Oh, that?
No problem.

27
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.586
Hey, you're
from California?

28
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:41.257
Do you, like, live in Hollywood?
Do you, like, live next door
to a movie star?

29
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.342
What are you two,
Lucy and Ethel?

30
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.553
I've never even been
to Hollywood.

31
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.889
I live in Napa.
That's northern California.
And I live next door to a vineyard.

32
00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:50.891
- A what-yard?
- A vineyard.

33
00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:53.352
It's where you grow grapes
to make wine.

34
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.397
That's what we do.
Me and my dad, we own a vineyard.

35
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.150
- Parker, Hallie !
- Right here.

36
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.485
- Arapaho.
- Same as me.
That's where I am.

37
00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:05.906
- Yes ! Come on, you guys.

38
00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:09.744
So, ah, either of you, by any chance,
know how to play poker?

39
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.121
- No.
- Never played it before.

40
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.665
No? Gee,
what a shame.

41
00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:18.044
So, ah, how much cash did you guys
bring with you this summer?

42
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.671
- How much?
- A lot.

43
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:25.259
- Whoa ! Who is in there?

44
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.261
Come on. Let's go.

45
00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:40.191
Well, here we are.

46
00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:43.569
Camp Walden for Girls.

47
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.155
We travelled all the way
from London for this?

48
00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.408
Well, it's rather picturesque.
Don't you think?

49
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.410
- Eh, um--

50
00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.788
Not exactly the term
I think I would have used.

51
00:06:53.954 --> 00:06:56.832
- All right. Shall we review
your mother's list?
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.919
- Now, let's see. Vitamins?
- Check.

53
00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.921
- Minerals?
- Check.

54
00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:05.591
- List of daily fruits and vegetables.
- Check. Check.

55
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.885
Check for fruits,
check for vegetables. Go on.

56
00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:11.138
Sun block, lip balm,
insect repellant,

57
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:14.975
stationery, stamps, photograph
of your mother, grandfather...

58
00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:17.394
and, of course,
your trusty butler, me.

59
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:20.105
- Got it all, I think.
- Oh, and, um--

60
00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.316
Here's a little something
from your grandfather.

61
00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:24.652
A spanking-new deck
of cards.

62
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:29.156
Maybe you'll actually find
somebody on this continent
who can whip your tush at poker.

63
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:31.158
Well, I doubt it.
But, thanks.

64
00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:33.244
And thanks for
bringing me here, Martin.

65
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:41.418
Now, you remember,
if you change your mind...

66
00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:45.256
and want me to come here and
collect you at the end of camp,
I'm only a phone call away.

67
00:07:45.422 --> 00:07:47.883
Thanks,
but I'll be fine.

68
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.095
Really. See you in eight weeks,
Marty ol' pal.

69
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.890
Missing you already,
queen of my heart.

70
00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:13.617
- Have fun, old bean.
- I will.

71
00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:22.293
- Toodle-oo.
- Toodle-oo.

72
00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:25.296
- Airport, please.

73
00:08:40.936 --> 00:08:42.813
- Okay, hurry up.

74
00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:52.906
She brought a date.

75
00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:54.950
She didn't.

76
00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:58.245
Mom ! Mom ! Are you there?
Pick up ! Mom !

77
00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:01.457
Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa !
Slow down. Thank you.

78
00:09:01.623 --> 00:09:05.127
- Have some too, okay?

79
00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:08.505
- It's something.
- It smells good.

80
00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:11.216
- I'll save ya a seat, Annie.
- Okay, thanks.

81
00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:18.724
Excuse me, girls. I've just got to have
a scoop of these gorgeous strawberries.

82
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.894
- Would you care for some, dear?
- Oh, no thanks.
Can't. I'm-- I'm allergic.

83
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.563
Oh, that's too bad.
How 'bout you, dear? Strawberries?

84
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.900
Oh, sorry, wish I could, but I can't.
I'm-l'm allergic.

85
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.902
Yes, allergic.

86
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.072
You just... told me that.
How did you get over there?

87
00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:37.367
Oh, well. First day of camp.
You'll have to excuse the old girl.

88
00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:41.497
At least I'm not putting
salt in the sugar shakers.

89
00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:46.835
Ah, well, I mean, you know.
Sugar in the salt shak--

90
00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:48.837
Now where did she go?

91
00:10:00.974 --> 00:10:03.143
Touche.

92
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.187
Good job.

93
00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:07.606
All right !
Excellent, kid.

94
00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:10.567
The winner, and still undefeated
champ from Napa, California,

95
00:10:10.734 --> 00:10:14.780
- Miss Hallie Parker.
- Yeah, Hallie.

96
00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.782
Do we have
any challengers?

97
00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:22.079
Oh, come on. Ladies,
let's not be damsels in distress here.

98
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:24.164
I'll take
a whack at it.

99
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.753
Okay. We've got ourselves
a chal-len-ger. Suit up.

100
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.422
Cool.
Ooh, thanks.

101
00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:41.807
Here I go.

102
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.727
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

103
00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:48.564
Go, Annie. Whoa !

104
00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.733
Fencers ready?

105
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.028
- Ready.
- All set.

106
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.240
En garde ! Fence !

107
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.914
- Oops.
- Ah !

108
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.392
Touche !

109
00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:29.521
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

110
00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:41.074
Touche !

111
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:45.621
- Sorry, let me help you.
- No, let me help you !

112
00:11:45.787 --> 00:11:47.623
- What'd ya do that for?
- Me? You pushed me in.

113
00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:50.709
- I did not.

114
00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.712
Okay, that was
quite a show.

115
00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:57.633
All right. I think we've got ourselves
a new camp champ from London, England,

116
00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:01.219
Miss Annie James.

117
00:12:01.386 --> 00:12:04.306
All right, girls.
Shake hands.

118
00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.308
Come on, girls.

119
00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:32.793
Oh, my !

120
00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:36.254
Why's everyone
staring?

121
00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:38.924
- Don't you see it?
- See what?

122
00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:43.011
- The resemblance between us.
- Resemblance? Between you and me?

123
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:46.306
Let me see.
Turn sideways.

124
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.852
Now the other way.

125
00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:57.025
Well, your eyes are
much closer together than mine.

126
00:12:57.192 --> 00:12:59.277
Your ears, well, don't worry,
you'll grow into them.

127
00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:03.532
Your teeth are a little crooked.

128
00:13:03.698 --> 00:13:06.159
Ah ! And that nose ! Well, don't worry,
dear, those things can be fixed.

129
00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:12.124
- Want me to deck her for ya?
- Hold on. I'm not quite finished yet.

130
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.459
You wanna know
the real difference between us?

131
00:13:14.626 --> 00:13:18.672
Let me see.
I know how to fence and you don't?

132
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.883
Or, I have class and you don't.
Take your pick.

133
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.346
- Why, I oughta--
- Ladies, it's time
to break up this little lovefest.

134
00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:30.892
Annie, Hallie.
I mean, Hallie, Annie.

135
00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.103
I-I-I mean-- Whoa !

136
00:13:40.944 --> 00:13:45.323
Sorry, ladies. Two pair.
Read 'em and weep.

137
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.701
Aah ! I'm out.

138
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:51.204
- So that's it? No more takers?
- I have nothing left.

139
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:53.915
I'll take
a whack at it.

140
00:14:06.386 --> 00:14:08.221
Take a seat,
Parker.

141
00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:14.561
Deal me in.

142
00:14:43.256 --> 00:14:46.426
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll make you a little deal.

143
00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:50.013
Loser jumps into the lake
after the game.

144
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.850
- Excellent.
- Butt naked.

145
00:14:54.017 --> 00:14:59.731
Even more excellent.
Start unzipping, Parker.

146
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.859
Straight.
In diamonds.

147
00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:05.862
You're good, James.

148
00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:08.782
But, you're
just not good enough.

149
00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.703
In your honour,
a royal flush.

150
00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:18.458
- Love the birthday suit.
- Lookin' good.

151
00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:20.460
Oww, baby !

152
00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:37.560
Grab her clothes.

153
00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:47.404
Oh, right. Fine.

154
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.951
If that's the way you want it,
then let the games begin.

155
00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:58.706
I swear I heard your evil clone
sneaking all the way up toward
the mess hall this morning.

156
00:15:58.873 --> 00:16:03.128
I am so tired. I'm going back
into bed and sleeping till lunch.

157
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.341
That does not seem like
a possibility, babe.

158
00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:11.469
- Why not?
- That's why not.

159
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:16.724
No... way.

160
00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:30.905
- Be quiet.
- Oh, I hope they're sleeping.

161
00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:35.660
The coast is clear.
Okay, let's go in.

162
00:16:38.413 --> 00:16:41.291
- Payback time.
- Don't wake her.

163
00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:46.087
- Careful.

164
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.727
Got milk?

165
00:17:45.855 --> 00:17:48.775
Oh, my God.

166
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.082
She didn't get me.

167
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.220
Ah ! That girl
is without a doubt...

168
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:20.848
the lowest, most awful creature
that ever walked the planet !

169
00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:23.184
Thank you. Thank you very much.

170
00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:29.148
- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Marvas.

171
00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:32.026
Marvas !

172
00:18:32.193 --> 00:18:34.696
Surprise inspection.

173
00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:36.989
Attention !

174
00:18:42.954 --> 00:18:45.206
No, no, Marva.
Do not go in there.

175
00:18:45.373 --> 00:18:50.086
One of the girls got sick last night,
and it is a big, big mess.

176
00:18:50.253 --> 00:18:53.256
Save yourself the aggravation.
It's really disgusting.

177
00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:56.759
Oh, well, if someone's sick,
dear, then I must go in.

178
00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:03.266
- Move aside, dear.
- No, no, really. I insist.

179
00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:06.686
I can't let you go in there.
She's highly contagious.

180
00:19:06.853 --> 00:19:09.147
Honest.

181
00:19:09.313 --> 00:19:11.816
Actually, we're all
quite fine in here,

182
00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:16.070
unless Hallie Parker knows
something we don't know.

183
00:19:16.237 --> 00:19:20.366
Really. I insist. Open the door
and come see for yourself, ma'am.

184
00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:22.827
Stand aside, Hallie.

185
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:34.380
Mommy !

186
00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:42.138
No ! No !

187
00:19:42.305 --> 00:19:45.183
No !

188
00:19:51.898 --> 00:19:56.777
- I told you it was a mess in here.
- She should know. She did it !

189
00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:58.821
You !
And you !

190
00:20:00.114 --> 00:20:02.658
Pack your bags !

191
00:20:24.847 --> 00:20:27.725
Okay, girls.
The rest of you...

192
00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:30.269
back to your activities.

193
00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:36.943
You two...
the isolation cabin.

194
00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:48.681
Oh, gosh,
it's stuck.

195
00:21:55.104 --> 00:21:58.315
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

196
00:21:59.817 --> 00:22:03.904
Ah ! Oh, man !

197
00:22:13.914 --> 00:22:18.919
- Oh, here's your--
- Cuppy.

198
00:22:22.506 --> 00:22:24.759
Any of your
pictures ruined?

199
00:22:24.925 --> 00:22:28.721
- Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.
- Who?

200
00:22:28.888 --> 00:22:31.849
You've never heard
of Leonardo DiCaprio?

201
00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:33.851
How far away
is London anyway?

202
00:22:34.018 --> 00:22:36.270
Well, from here
it's 3,000 miles,

203
00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:39.523
but sometimes
it seems much further.

204
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:44.737
- How far away is your home?
- Oh, California is way at
the other end of the country.

205
00:22:44.904 --> 00:22:48.073
Actually, here's a picture of my house.

206
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.869
- Wow ! It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

207
00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:54.872
We built it when I was little.
We've got this incredible porch...

208
00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:57.041
that looks over
the entire vineyard.

209
00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:59.752
- And then--
- Who-- Who's that?

210
00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.213
Oh, that's my dad. He didn't know
I was taking the picture then...

211
00:23:02.379 --> 00:23:04.215
or else he would have
turned around.

212
00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:08.052
He's kinda like my best friend.
We do everything together.

213
00:23:11.931 --> 00:23:16.352
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's chilly in here, that's all.

214
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:25.319
- Want one?
- Oh, sure, I love Oreos.

215
00:23:25.486 --> 00:23:28.781
At home I eat them with--
I eat them with peanut butter.

216
00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:33.369
You do?
That is so weird. So do l.

217
00:23:33.535 --> 00:23:36.914
You're kidding. Most people
find that totally disgusting.

218
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:38.958
I know.
I don't get it.

219
00:23:39.124 --> 00:23:41.377
Me either.

220
00:23:44.922 --> 00:23:46.757
What's your
dad like?

221
00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:48.968
I mean, is he the kind of father
you can talk to,

222
00:23:49.134 --> 00:23:51.845
or is he one of those
workaholic types who says,
"I'll talk to ya later, honey,"

223
00:23:52.012 --> 00:23:53.847
but, you know,
never really does?

224
00:23:54.014 --> 00:23:56.976
- I hate that.
- I don't have a father, actually.

225
00:23:57.142 --> 00:23:59.853
I mean, I had one once,
I suppose.

226
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.606
But my parents
divorced years ago.

227
00:24:02.773 --> 00:24:04.942
My mother never even
mentions him.

228
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:08.028
It's like he evaporated
into thin air or something.

229
00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:11.115
It's scary the way nobody
stays together any more.

230
00:24:11.282 --> 00:24:14.201
- Tell me about it.
- How old are you?

231
00:24:14.368 --> 00:24:17.538
- I'll be 12 on October 11.

232
00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:20.958
- So will I.
- Your birthday's on October 11?

233
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:23.252
- Yeah.
- How weird is that?

234
00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:25.963
Extremely.

235
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.257
Oh, hey.
It stopped raining.

236
00:24:28.424 --> 00:24:31.969
You wanna go get
a Popsicle or something?

237
00:24:39.268 --> 00:24:43.022
- What's the matter?
- Hallie, what's your mother like?

238
00:24:43.188 --> 00:24:48.318
I never met her. She and my dad split
up when I was a baby, maybe even before.

239
00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:51.363
I'm not sure.
He doesn't like to talk about her.

240
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.033
But I know she was
really, really beautiful.

241
00:24:54.199 --> 00:24:56.618
How do you know that?

242
00:24:56.785 --> 00:25:00.831
Well, because my dad
had this old picture of her
hidden in his sock drawer,

243
00:25:00.998 --> 00:25:04.835
and he caught me looking at it,
like, all the time,
so he gave it to me to keep.

244
00:25:05.002 --> 00:25:08.756
Look, I'm-l'm really thirsty.
Sure you don't want to go to
the mess hall and get a lemonade?

245
00:25:08.922 --> 00:25:12.342
Will you stop thinking about
your stomach at a time like this?

246
00:25:12.509 --> 00:25:15.179
- At a time like what?
- Don't you realize what's happening?

247
00:25:17.014 --> 00:25:19.099
I mean,
think about it.

248
00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:21.101
I only
have a mother,

249
00:25:21.268 --> 00:25:23.312
and you only have
a father.

250
00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:25.314
You've never seen
your mom,

251
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:27.608
and I've never
seen my dad.

252
00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:30.110
You have one old picture
of your mom,

253
00:25:30.277 --> 00:25:32.696
and I have one old picture
of my dad.

254
00:25:32.863 --> 00:25:35.324
But at least yours
is probably a whole picture.

255
00:25:35.491 --> 00:25:37.451
Mine is a pathetic
little thing,

256
00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:39.828
all crinkled and ripped
right down the middle and--

257
00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:43.665
What are you rummaging
in your trunk for?

258
00:25:43.832 --> 00:25:46.043
This.

259
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.045
It's a picture
of my mom,

260
00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:50.047
and it's
ripped too.

261
00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:52.549
Right down
the middle?

262
00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:54.927
Right down
the middle.

263
00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:15.322
This is so...
freaky.

264
00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:18.784
Okay.

265
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:22.120
On the count of three,
we'll show them to each other, okay?

266
00:26:22.287 --> 00:26:24.498
Okay.

267
00:26:24.665 --> 00:26:26.750
One.

268
00:26:26.917 --> 00:26:29.378
Two.

269
00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:31.421
- Three.
- Three.

270
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.640
- That's my dad.
- That's my mom.

271
00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:45.644
That's the lunch bell.

272
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:49.064
I'm not so
hungry any more.

273
00:26:50.274 --> 00:26:52.943
So if--
if your mom...

274
00:26:53.068 --> 00:26:55.320
is my mom...

275
00:26:55.487 --> 00:26:58.198
and my dad
is your dad...

276
00:26:58.365 --> 00:27:02.202
and we're both born on October 11...

277
00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:04.204
then you and I
are like--

278
00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:06.248
like sisters.

279
00:27:06.415 --> 00:27:08.250
Sisters?

280
00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:11.295
Hallie, we're
like twins.

281
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.431
I just don't know what to say.

282
00:27:22.597 --> 00:27:24.433
What's that
you're holding?

283
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:27.269
My locket.
I got it when I was born.

284
00:27:27.436 --> 00:27:29.521
It has an "H"
on it.

285
00:27:29.688 --> 00:27:32.733

I got mine when I was born, too,

286
00:27:32.899 --> 00:27:36.653
except mine has
an "A" on it.

287
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.865
Ooh, now I've got goose bumps.

288
00:27:40.032 --> 00:27:42.534
My God, so I'm
not an only child.

289
00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:45.746
I'm a twin.
I'm a twin-- there's two of me.

290
00:27:45.912 --> 00:27:47.748
I mean,
two of us.

291
00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:49.916
- This is like--
- Mind boggling.

292
00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:52.586
- Totally.
- Completely.

293
00:27:52.753 --> 00:27:55.964
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

294
00:28:01.303 --> 00:28:04.181
Tell me, what's Mom like?

295
00:28:04.347 --> 00:28:08.185
Well, she designs wedding gowns.

296
00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:10.854
Really?

297
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:13.356
She's becoming
quite famous, actually.

298
00:28:13.523 --> 00:28:16.651
A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns.

299
00:28:16.818 --> 00:28:18.653
Wow.

300
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.531
Y-You know what's
interesting?

301
00:28:21.698 --> 00:28:25.035
Neither one of our parents
ever got married again.

302
00:28:25.202 --> 00:28:27.412
Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?

303
00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:32.209
Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life.

304
00:28:32.375 --> 00:28:34.377
Yeah, Mom's never
come close either.

305
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.554
I have a brilliant,
beyond brilliant idea.

306
00:28:44.721 --> 00:28:47.140
I'm serious.
I am a total genius.

307
00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:49.601
You want to know
what Dad is like, right?

308
00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:51.603
Right.

309
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.772
And I'm dying
to know Mom.

310
00:28:53.939 --> 00:28:56.316
So what I'm thinking is--
Don't freak out, okay?

311
00:28:56.483 --> 00:28:59.194
I think we should switch places.

312
00:28:59.361 --> 00:29:02.239
When camp's over
I'll go back to London as you,

313
00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:04.366
and you go back
to California as me.

314
00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:08.870
- What?
- Annie, we can pull it off.
We're twins, aren't we?

315
00:29:09.037 --> 00:29:12.290
Hallie, we're totally
and completely 100% different.

316
00:29:12.457 --> 00:29:14.960
So, what's the problem?
I'll teach you to be me...

317
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:17.170
and you teach me
to be you.

318
00:29:17.337 --> 00:29:19.172
Look, I can
do you already.

319
00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:22.259
Yes, you want to know
the difference between us?

320
00:29:22.425 --> 00:29:24.427
I have class
and you don't.

321
00:29:24.594 --> 00:29:29.349
Come on, Ann. I got to meet my ma.

322
00:29:29.516 --> 00:29:32.644
The truth is, you know,
if we switch,

323
00:29:32.811 --> 00:29:36.398
sooner or later
they'll have to unswitch us.

324
00:29:36.565 --> 00:29:38.441
And when they do,
they'll have to meet again,

325
00:29:38.608 --> 00:29:41.987
- face to face.
- After all these years.

326
00:29:42.153 --> 00:29:46.616
Thank you. I told you
I'm brilliant.

327
00:29:46.783 --> 00:29:49.911
Okay. 'Tis grandfather.

328
00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:53.290
- He's so cute. What do we call him?
- Grandfather.

329
00:29:53.456 --> 00:29:55.792
Why didn't I think of that?

330
00:29:55.959 --> 00:29:58.044
This is Martin,
he's our butler.

331
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:00.714
- We have a butler?
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.092
Okay. Living-room's first.
Then over here is the dining room.

333
00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:06.303
But we never eat in there
except for Thanksgiving...

334
00:30:06.469 --> 00:30:08.888
and Christmas and,
of course, October 11.

335
00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:33.580
Okay. I-I'm ready.

336
00:30:55.435 --> 00:30:58.229
- Don't shut your eyes !
- Oh. Okay. Right.

337
00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:00.607
Sorry. Just got
a little nervous.

338
00:31:00.774 --> 00:31:03.443
You're nervous?
An 11-year-old is cutting my hair.

339
00:31:03.568 --> 00:31:05.487
Hey, you sounded just like me.

340
00:31:05.653 --> 00:31:09.532
Well, I'm supposed to, aren't I?
Go on, just do it.

341
00:31:13.912 --> 00:31:15.789
Don't panic.
You look great.

342
00:31:26.382 --> 00:31:28.218
Looking good.

343
00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:36.142
This is so... scary.

344
00:31:36.309 --> 00:31:39.270
Honey, you never
looked better.

345
00:31:39.437 --> 00:31:43.775
Oh, my God !

346
00:31:43.942 --> 00:31:45.777
What?

347
00:31:45.944 --> 00:31:47.779
I have
pierced ears.

348
00:31:47.946 --> 00:31:50.406
No. No, no and no.

349
00:31:50.573 --> 00:31:52.408
Not happening.
Sorry, wrong number.

350
00:31:52.575 --> 00:31:54.744
I won't.
I refuse.

351
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:56.746
Then cutting your hair
was a total waste,

352
00:31:56.913 --> 00:31:58.748
'cause, I mean, there's no way
I can go to camp...

353
00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:00.750
with pierced ears
and come home without 'em.

354
00:32:00.917 --> 00:32:02.961
I mean, come on.
Get real.

355
00:32:18.852 --> 00:32:20.687
Needle sterilized.

356
00:32:20.854 --> 00:32:22.981
Y-You-- You sure you know
what you're doing?

357
00:32:23.147 --> 00:32:26.526
Relax. I've gone with all my friends
to get their ears pierced.

358
00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:29.362
It's nothing.
Just close your eyes,

359
00:32:29.487 --> 00:32:31.823
and it will be over
before you know it.

360
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.201
- Earring ready?
- Yes.

361
00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:37.203
Good.
Hand me the apple.

362
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:41.624
Thank you.

363
00:32:41.791 --> 00:32:44.586
Just relax. I'm telling you,
this is not a big deal.

364
00:32:44.752 --> 00:32:47.547
On the count of three,
remove the ice.

365
00:32:47.714 --> 00:32:50.925
One... two...

366
00:32:51.092 --> 00:32:53.219
three.

367
00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:10.361
Girls, time to say
your last goodbyes.

368
00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:13.072
- The busses are loading.
- Busses one and two leaving.

369
00:33:13.239 --> 00:33:16.075
I'll see you guys
next summer, I promise.

370
00:33:16.242 --> 00:33:19.037
Okay, so call me every single day.

371
00:33:19.203 --> 00:33:21.039
All right. And write me.
Don't forget.

372
00:33:21.205 --> 00:33:23.625
I won't.

373
00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:26.085
Okay. This is it.

374
00:33:26.252 --> 00:33:29.255
So remember, you're going
to find out how Mom and Dad met.

375
00:33:29.422 --> 00:33:32.175
- And you're going to find out
why they broke up.
- Annie James,

376
00:33:32.342 --> 00:33:35.011
- your car is here.
- That's you.

377
00:33:35.136 --> 00:33:38.139
Here's your ticket and passport.
Martin will pick you up
at the airport tomorrow morning.

378
00:33:38.306 --> 00:33:42.644
- What time do you leave?
- Oh, not for a couple of hours.
Give Mom a kiss for me.

379
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.022
- Give Dad one for me.
- Annie James, front and centre.

380
00:33:46.189 --> 00:33:48.024
Bye.

381
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:51.027
- Bye.
- Last call, Annie James.

382
00:33:55.865 --> 00:33:57.700
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

383
00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:07.043
Good luck.

384
00:34:19.263 --> 00:34:23.810
Okay. This is it.

385
00:34:23.976 --> 00:34:26.854
God, I hope
she likes me.

386
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:29.148
Please like me.

387
00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:31.150
Please.

388
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:06.185
- Annie !
- Martin.

389
00:35:10.273 --> 00:35:12.650
- Missed you.
- Missed you.

390
00:35:12.817 --> 00:35:16.279
- What have you done to your hair?
- Cut it. Do you like it?

391
00:35:16.445 --> 00:35:19.532
Love it. It's the new you.

392
00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:21.534
And you've had
your ears pierced.

393
00:35:21.701 --> 00:35:23.619
Give me five,
girlfriend.

394
00:36:56.379 --> 00:36:59.090
- Home again.
- Thank you.

395
00:37:01.258 --> 00:37:04.762
This is it.
7 Primbrook Lane.

396
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.751
Hello.

397
00:38:03.988 --> 00:38:06.449
Grandfather?

398
00:38:08.993 --> 00:38:12.997
- I'm home.
- Is that my little girl?

399
00:38:13.164 --> 00:38:15.833
That tall, gangly thing?

400
00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:18.335
Yes, it's me.

401
00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:22.965
Oh, welcome home.

402
00:38:23.132 --> 00:38:26.177
- Did you have a good time, sweet pea?
- Uh-huh, great.

403
00:38:26.343 --> 00:38:28.345
What are you doing?

404
00:38:28.512 --> 00:38:30.347
- Just smelling.
- Smelling?

405
00:38:30.514 --> 00:38:32.474
- I'm making a memory.
- Oh.

406
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.643
Years from now,
when I'm all grown up,

407
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.979
I'll always remember
my grandfather...

408
00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:39.273
and how he
always smelt of...

409
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.442
peppermint
and pipe tobacco.

410
00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:43.444
Good to have you back.

411
00:38:43.611 --> 00:38:45.446
Annie?

412
00:38:50.326 --> 00:38:52.912
Annie?

413
00:38:54.121 --> 00:38:56.373
- Mother.
- You're back.

414
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:16.685
- I can't believe it's you.
- And I can't believe
it's you.

415
00:39:16.852 --> 00:39:20.272
And with short hair.
Who cut it for you?

416
00:39:20.439 --> 00:39:23.359
A girl I met at camp.
Do you hate it?

417
00:39:23.525 --> 00:39:26.111
No, I absolutely
love it.

418
00:39:26.278 --> 00:39:29.448
You got your ears pierced?

419
00:39:29.615 --> 00:39:31.867
Well, are there any other surprises?

420
00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:35.037
Belly button rings,
tattoos?

421
00:39:35.204 --> 00:39:37.581
Ah, darling,
what is it?

422
00:39:37.748 --> 00:39:40.417
I'm sorry.
It's just--

423
00:39:40.542 --> 00:39:42.878
I've missed you
so much.

424
00:39:45.422 --> 00:39:47.257
I know.

425
00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:50.970
- It seems like it's been forever.
- You have no idea.

426
00:39:57.893 --> 00:40:01.647
So, come on. Tell me,
did you like everyone? Was it fun?

427
00:40:01.814 --> 00:40:06.235
- Ah, Martin.
- I found a stowaway in your suitcase.

428
00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:08.237
Oh, my God. Cuppy !

429
00:40:08.404 --> 00:40:10.739
- Cuppy?
- He-- He belongs to my friend,

430
00:40:10.906 --> 00:40:13.200
the one I was, umm,
telling you about.

431
00:40:13.367 --> 00:40:15.577
I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase.

432
00:40:15.744 --> 00:40:19.289
Well, since he's not our Cuppy, shall
we dispose of the little creature?

433
00:40:19.456 --> 00:40:24.253
No ! I mean, no.
I'll-- I'll mail him to her.

434
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.922
She loves this thing a lot--
a lot, a lot.

435
00:40:27.089 --> 00:40:29.133
And she's, like,
slept with this thing her entire life,

436
00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:33.262
And she could never be, like--
Stay in a foreign country without him.

437
00:40:33.429 --> 00:40:36.265
No, no. I'll take care of it.

438
00:40:36.432 --> 00:40:39.476
That will be all, Martin.
Thank you.

439
00:40:39.643 --> 00:40:41.937
Hello.

440
00:40:42.104 --> 00:40:44.940
Oh, hi.
How's the photo shoot going?

441
00:40:49.278 --> 00:40:53.240
Hmm. Well, can't you
manage without me?

442
00:40:53.407 --> 00:40:55.742
I mean, Annie just
got home from camp.

443
00:40:57.453 --> 00:40:59.288
Hmm. Yeah.

444
00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:24.688
Okay. Hold on a moment.

445
00:41:24.855 --> 00:41:29.067
Annie, would you hate very much
running down to the studio with me?

446
00:41:29.234 --> 00:41:32.154
No, I'd love it.

447
00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:14.029
Wow. That's incredible.
You designed that?

448
00:42:14.196 --> 00:42:17.032
Well, I had to do something
while you were at camp.

449
00:42:17.199 --> 00:42:20.911
- You don't think it's too--
- No, it's gorgeous. I love it.

450
00:42:21.078 --> 00:42:24.414
You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?

451
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:27.125
- I mean, like, really beautiful?
- Who?

452
00:42:27.292 --> 00:42:29.211
- You.
- Me?

453
00:42:29.378 --> 00:42:32.089
You know what? I think that time
change has made you a little loopy.

454
00:42:32.256 --> 00:42:34.549
Come on. Let's see
what all the fuss is about.

455
00:42:34.716 --> 00:42:36.551
Okay. I'm here.

456
00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:38.553
Ah, we're saved.

457
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.848
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi. Sorry, we don't know
what to do with the veil.

458
00:42:42.015 --> 00:42:44.142
If she wears it, it covers the back
of the dress, and if she doesn't,

459
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:46.395
- the dress looks--
- Incomplete, you're right.

460
00:42:46.561 --> 00:42:49.398
Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?

461
00:42:49.564 --> 00:42:52.609
Yeah, I see the problem.
Can I have the veil? Annie, darling,

462
00:42:52.776 --> 00:42:56.113
pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

463
00:42:56.279 --> 00:42:58.115
- Me?
- Yes.

464
00:43:03.161 --> 00:43:05.622
- Which one do you like?
- The white one.

465
00:43:05.789 --> 00:43:08.291
Me too.

466
00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:10.335
Try this.

467
00:43:10.502 --> 00:43:13.922
Now, throw the veil
straight back.

468
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:16.258
That's it. Now spin around.
I want to see the back of the dress.

469
00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:19.511
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls. Just down there.

470
00:43:19.678 --> 00:43:22.973
Don't worry about the bouquet.
You're married now.
You've got to learn to juggle.

471
00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:28.854
- Don't forget you look happy.
It is your wedding day.
- My mom is too cool.

472
00:43:54.671 --> 00:43:58.133
So, doesn't designing
all these wedding gowns
ever make you think about...

473
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.303
getting married again, or at least
make you think about the "F" word.

474
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.305
The "F" word?

475
00:44:03.472 --> 00:44:06.933
- My father.
- Oh ! Oh, that "F" word.

476
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.935
Well, no, actually,

477
00:44:09.102 --> 00:44:12.522
because I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the "F" word.

478
00:44:12.689 --> 00:44:15.859
- You didn't? Why not?
- Why the sudden curiosity...

479
00:44:16.026 --> 00:44:17.861
about your dad,
huh?

480
00:44:18.028 --> 00:44:19.863
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned.

481
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.948
And you can't blame
a kid for wondering.

482
00:44:22.115 --> 00:44:23.950
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject forever.

483
00:44:24.117 --> 00:44:25.952
At least tell me
what he was like.

484
00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:29.206
Okay. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

485
00:44:29.372 --> 00:44:32.876
When we met he was...
actually, entirely lovely.

486
00:44:33.043 --> 00:44:34.878
- All right?
- All right.

487
00:44:35.045 --> 00:44:36.880
So, did you meet
him here in London?

488
00:44:37.047 --> 00:44:39.341
- We met on the Q.E. 2.
- Q.E. what?

489
00:44:39.508 --> 00:44:43.345
The Queen Elizabeth 2.
It's an ocean liner that sails
from London to New York,

490
00:44:43.512 --> 00:44:46.431
'cause I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father.

491
00:44:46.598 --> 00:44:50.644
We met our first night
on board ship. We were seated
next to each other at dinner.

492
00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.729
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding?

493
00:44:52.896 --> 00:44:56.066
So, was it love at first sight?

494
00:44:56.233 --> 00:45:00.987
I knew you were going to ask me
all these questions one day. Taxi !

495
00:45:01.154 --> 00:45:03.198
Dear ol' Dad.

496
00:45:03.365 --> 00:45:06.451
I wonder what he's doing
at this very moment.

497
00:45:16.253 --> 00:45:18.088
Thanks.

498
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.218
- Got it?
- Oh, gosh.

499
00:45:23.385 --> 00:45:25.220
It's him.

500
00:45:25.387 --> 00:45:27.889
Hey, Hal !

501
00:45:28.056 --> 00:45:29.891
Welcome home,
kiddo.

502
00:45:34.896 --> 00:45:36.731
Get into these arms,
you little punk.

503
00:45:36.898 --> 00:45:39.234
Dad. Finally.

504
00:45:46.324 --> 00:45:50.245
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp, because you are not going back.

505
00:45:50.412 --> 00:45:53.248
I missed you too much.

506
00:45:53.415 --> 00:45:55.417
What happened
to you, Hal?

507
00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:57.419
Something's changed.

508
00:45:57.585 --> 00:45:59.963
Are you
getting taller?

509
00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:04.342
So, what's up,
Dad?

510
00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:06.594
I mean, how's Chessy
and everybody?

511
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:10.098
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

512
00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:12.142
Eight weeks really
is too long, Hal.

513
00:46:12.308 --> 00:46:16.062
- A lot's been happening around here.
- A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

514
00:46:16.229 --> 00:46:19.274
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

515
00:46:21.443 --> 00:46:23.778
What's the matter?
I cut myself shaving?

516
00:46:23.945 --> 00:46:28.116
No, it's just-- just seeing you
for the first time.

517
00:46:28.283 --> 00:46:31.578
I mean, you know,
in so long.

518
00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:34.456
You look taller to me, too, Dad.

519
00:46:34.622 --> 00:46:36.791
Come on, squirt.
Let's get home.

520
00:46:51.806 --> 00:46:54.059
Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.

521
00:46:54.225 --> 00:46:56.978
I'm really glad I bought you
that personalized stationery...

522
00:46:57.145 --> 00:46:58.980
you just had
to have.

523
00:46:59.147 --> 00:47:01.691
- Well, we meant to write,
Dad, but we just got so--
- We?

524
00:47:01.858 --> 00:47:03.693
Oh !
Oh, me and my friend.

525
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.529
I-I met this girl at camp
and we got really close.

526
00:47:06.654 --> 00:47:09.991
- Great.
- Practically like sisters.

527
00:47:10.158 --> 00:47:12.494
- She was a lovely girl.
- Lovely girl?

528
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.746
All of sudden
you're so proper?

529
00:47:14.913 --> 00:47:18.374
You're still biting those nails, I see.

530
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:20.919
- Dad, you noticed.
- What do you mean noticed?

531
00:47:21.085 --> 00:47:22.921
You've been biting
them since you could chew.

532
00:47:23.087 --> 00:47:26.758
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

533
00:47:26.925 --> 00:47:28.843
Lovely girl, horrid habit.

534
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.055
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

535
00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:35.099
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

536
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:38.102
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

537
00:47:39.562 --> 00:47:42.232
Sorry, Dad.

538
00:47:42.357 --> 00:47:45.360
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "dad"?

539
00:47:45.527 --> 00:47:49.113
- The truth?
- Because you missed your
old man so much, right?

540
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.202
Exactly. It's because
in my whole life,

541
00:47:54.369 --> 00:47:56.788
I mean, you know,
for the past eight weeks,

542
00:47:56.955 --> 00:48:00.917
I was never able to say the word "dad."
Never. Not once.

543
00:48:01.084 --> 00:48:03.419
And if you ask me,
I mean,

544
00:48:03.586 --> 00:48:06.756
a dad is an irreplaceable
person in a girl's life.

545
00:48:06.923 --> 00:48:11.010
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

546
00:48:11.177 --> 00:48:13.846
Just imagine someone's life
without a father--

547
00:48:14.013 --> 00:48:18.059
never buying a Father's Day card,
never sitting on their father's lap,

548
00:48:18.226 --> 00:48:23.940
never being able to say,
"Hi, Dad" or "What's up, Dad"
or "Catch you later, Dad."

549
00:48:24.107 --> 00:48:27.735
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "dada," aren't they?

550
00:48:27.902 --> 00:48:31.322
Let me see if I get this--
You miss being able to call me dad?

551
00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:35.118
Yeah.
I really have, Dad.

552
00:48:41.249 --> 00:48:43.584
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

553
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:46.504
Now you're starting to sound
like your old self.

554
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.114
Hello, gorgeous !

555
00:49:13.281 --> 00:49:15.283
Oh, look at you !

556
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.952
Oh, you grew.

557
00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:21.706
Oh, we missed you
so much.

558
00:49:21.873 --> 00:49:24.959
Hey, don't you dare let
your old man talk you out of
going back to camp. Okay?

559
00:49:25.126 --> 00:49:26.961
You're a growing girl.
You need adventure.

560
00:49:27.128 --> 00:49:30.173
- Okay.
- Oh, you hungry?

561
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.175
I made corn bread
and chili.

562
00:49:32.341 --> 00:49:34.802
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing, it's just--

563
00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:36.971
I'm so happy
to be home.

564
00:49:37.138 --> 00:49:39.849
Hey, did I hear somethin' about
corn bread and chili?

565
00:49:40.016 --> 00:49:42.685
Yeah, it's on
the stove. So...

566
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:45.104
something's changed
about you, Hal.

567
00:49:45.271 --> 00:49:47.482
Umm, I can't
put my finger on it,

568
00:49:47.648 --> 00:49:51.694
- but something about you
is definitely changed.
- Really?

569
00:49:51.861 --> 00:49:55.740
Well, it's just
the same old me. Honest.

570
00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:00.870
- Hi, Sammy.

571
00:50:03.247 --> 00:50:06.459
What is wrong with you,
you goofball? It's Hallie.

572
00:50:06.626 --> 00:50:10.755
Oh, I-I probably just smell
like camp, that's all.

573
00:50:10.922 --> 00:50:12.757
What's the matter
with you?

574
00:50:12.924 --> 00:50:17.178
It's like you didn't
even recognize her.

575
00:50:20.598 --> 00:50:24.101
Wow !
It's even better than the pictures.

576
00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:29.190
Okay, kiddo.
What do ya wanna do first, huh?

577
00:50:29.357 --> 00:50:34.904
You wanna eat and then unpack?
Or, uh, we could unpack and then eat.

578
00:50:35.071 --> 00:50:39.450
- Or we could eat while we unpack.
- Do you mean I can eat in my room?

579
00:50:39.617 --> 00:50:42.453
Yeah, I'd say it's
a definite possibility.

580
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.290
Hey, Hal,
when you're done, come on down.
There's someone I want you to meet.

581
00:50:46.457 --> 00:50:49.627
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, Hal.

582
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:57.385
Look at you. Always eating.

583
00:50:57.552 --> 00:50:59.303
- Did you tell her?
- No.

584
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.347
Nicky.

585
00:51:01.514 --> 00:51:04.016
- I will. I will.
- Tell me what?

586
00:51:04.183 --> 00:51:08.229
Hal, it is none of my business
how your father makes a fool
out of himself. Okay?

587
00:51:08.396 --> 00:51:10.565
He's a big boy.
He can do what he wants.

588
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:13.025
Okay. Okay.
So, who is she?

589
00:51:15.778 --> 00:51:17.613
Her name's
Meredith Blake.

590
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.199
She's a publicist
from San Francisco.

591
00:51:20.366 --> 00:51:22.201
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer...

592
00:51:22.368 --> 00:51:24.537
to do some publicity
for the vineyard.

593
00:51:24.704 --> 00:51:28.708
If you ask me, she's doin' a better job
of sellin' herself than the grapes.

594
00:51:28.874 --> 00:51:31.544
What do you mean?

595
00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:35.923
Look, you and I both know
your father's...

596
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.676
not some kind of suave, debonair
bachelor-of-the-month type.

597
00:51:38.843 --> 00:51:41.053
So, I gotta ask myself, "What does
a hot, young thing like that...

598
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.348
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hangin' out...

599
00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:47.393
and his cereal bowl
full of chili?"

600
00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.438
Then, I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's gigglin'.

601
00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:56.235
And all of them are sitting at
the Napa Valley Community Bank.

602
00:51:56.402 --> 00:51:59.363
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

603
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.449
Eh, what do I know?
But I'll tell you one thing.

604
00:52:01.616 --> 00:52:03.868
This one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

605
00:52:04.035 --> 00:52:06.287
They do everything together.
They ride together.

606
00:52:06.454 --> 00:52:09.874
They swim together.
They go out to eat dinner every night.

607
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:14.128
But, you know what? Meet her. See for
yourself. Don't let me influence you.

608
00:52:14.295 --> 00:52:16.255
There's my girl.

609
00:52:16.422 --> 00:52:21.969
Honey, I want you to meet
a friend of mine. Hal,

610
00:52:22.136 --> 00:52:23.554
this is Meredith Blake.

611
00:52:27.224 --> 00:52:29.226
Hi.

612
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:33.939
Hi,
Meredith Blake.

613
00:52:34.106 --> 00:52:37.360
Wow. I can't believe I'm finally
meeting the famous Hallie.

614
00:52:37.526 --> 00:52:40.488
I have looked forward
to this all summer.

615
00:52:40.654 --> 00:52:42.490
Really?
Well, here I am.

616
00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:44.784
Oh, Nicky,
she's adorable !

617
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:47.411
You know, the way your father
talked about you,

618
00:52:47.578 --> 00:52:50.581
I expected to meet a little girl,
but you are so grown up.

619
00:52:50.748 --> 00:52:54.251
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

620
00:52:54.418 --> 00:52:57.129
Twenty-six.

621
00:52:57.296 --> 00:52:59.799
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you, again, Dad?

622
00:52:59.965 --> 00:53:01.801
Wow ! Suddenly, you're
so interested in math.

623
00:53:01.967 --> 00:53:04.345
Look, I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna get some more chili,

624
00:53:04.512 --> 00:53:07.473
maybe a bottle of champagne
to celebrate.

625
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.811
- What are we celebrating?
- Your homecoming, of course.

626
00:53:11.977 --> 00:53:15.272
Be right back.

627
00:53:15.439 --> 00:53:17.942
Meredith Blake.

628
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:21.487
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

629
00:53:21.654 --> 00:53:26.283
Mm-hmm. Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

630
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.036
Oh, yes.
I am writing it all down.

631
00:53:30.538 --> 00:53:32.456
Okay, it sounds
very worthwhile, I agree.

632
00:53:32.623 --> 00:53:34.500
But, unfortunately,
I see that Mr Parker...

633
00:53:34.667 --> 00:53:36.836
is going to be
out of the country on those days.

634
00:53:37.002 --> 00:53:40.714
Yes. Absolutely.
I will be sure to mention it to him.

635
00:53:40.881 --> 00:53:42.716
Thank you.

636
00:53:42.883 --> 00:53:46.846
So, how was camp, Hal?
Was it fabulous?

637
00:53:47.012 --> 00:53:50.057
My dad's going
out of the country?

638
00:53:50.224 --> 00:53:54.061
Oh, no.
I just had to tell a little
white lie to get him out of something.

639
00:53:54.228 --> 00:53:57.857
You know, I have never heard a man
talk about his daughter...

640
00:53:58.023 --> 00:54:00.526
the way Nicky
talks about you.

641
00:54:00.693 --> 00:54:02.903
You two are obviously
incredibly close.

642
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:05.239
Well, you know,
we're closer than close.

643
00:54:05.406 --> 00:54:07.241
We're all
each other has.

644
00:54:08.868 --> 00:54:12.329
Ohh !

645
00:54:12.496 --> 00:54:14.748
Sorry. Did I
get you wet, Mer?

646
00:54:14.915 --> 00:54:17.293
Just a little, Hal.

647
00:54:20.713 --> 00:54:22.548
Hey.
Guess what?

648
00:54:22.715 --> 00:54:27.219
Your daddy took me riding the other day,
and he let me ride your horse.

649
00:54:27.386 --> 00:54:29.430
I hope that's okay
with you.

650
00:54:29.597 --> 00:54:34.143
Oh, sure. She's probably used
to strange women riding her.

651
00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:36.979
Not that you're
strange or anything.

652
00:54:37.104 --> 00:54:40.399
Actually, compared to the others,
you are relatively normal.

653
00:54:40.566 --> 00:54:43.068
Others?
What others?

654
00:54:43.235 --> 00:54:46.405
- Do you want the 411?
- What's the 411?

655
00:54:46.572 --> 00:54:49.074
The information--
the lowdown on other women.

656
00:54:49.241 --> 00:54:51.076
Can't say
I blame you.

657
00:54:51.243 --> 00:54:54.747
I'd wanna know if I was number 28--
I mean, 29 in a man's life.

658
00:54:54.913 --> 00:54:57.499
I'm number 29?

659
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:59.418
Yeah. It's always
the same routine--

660
00:54:59.585 --> 00:55:01.545
horseback riding
through the vineyards,

661
00:55:01.712 --> 00:55:04.757
romantic dinners with
his special reserved-label wine,

662
00:55:04.923 --> 00:55:07.259
- moonlight swims--
- Here we go--

663
00:55:07.426 --> 00:55:10.971
a bottle of my special
reserve-label.

664
00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:13.932
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

665
00:55:15.476 --> 00:55:19.313
- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does.

666
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.275
Will somebody
grab that, please?

667
00:55:26.153 --> 00:55:28.906
James residence.
Annie?

668
00:55:29.073 --> 00:55:31.617
- Yes, Martin.
- Oh, dear. It sounds
just like you on the phone.

669
00:55:31.784 --> 00:55:34.745
I'm sorry.
To whom did you wish to speak?

670
00:55:34.912 --> 00:55:37.164
Annie?
Of course.

671
00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:39.291
One moment, please.

672
00:55:39.458 --> 00:55:41.752
A Mildred Plotker
for you.

673
00:55:41.919 --> 00:55:43.754
Sounds just like
your twin.

674
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:45.839
My twin?
Very funny.

675
00:55:46.006 --> 00:55:47.966
Good one, Martin.
Hello.

676
00:55:48.133 --> 00:55:51.470
Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi. How are you?

677
00:55:51.637 --> 00:55:54.765
- Hey, how's it going over there?
- Oh, everything's quite lovely here.

678
00:55:54.932 --> 00:55:56.767
W-We're expecting
a bit of rain today.

679
00:55:56.934 --> 00:55:59.186
But, Mildred, can you--
can you hold on for a moment?

680
00:55:59.353 --> 00:56:02.481
Okay, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

681
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.446
Okay. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God ! Mom's incredible.

682
00:56:09.613 --> 00:56:12.449
I cannot believe I lived
my entire life without knowing her.

683
00:56:12.616 --> 00:56:14.451
Sh-She's beautiful
and fun...

684
00:56:14.618 --> 00:56:18.122
- and smart, and I love
the gowns she designs.
- But--

685
00:56:18.288 --> 00:56:20.999
And I got her talking about how she
and Dad first met. And, if you ask me,

686
00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:24.211
- there's like
a whole possibility, like--
- Hallie, stop !

687
00:56:24.378 --> 00:56:26.964
We've got a major problem.
You're going to have to bring
Mother out here immediately.

688
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.384
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her.

689
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:32.386
I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't.

690
00:56:32.553 --> 00:56:35.681
But this is an emergency !
Dad's in love.

691
00:56:35.848 --> 00:56:38.142
Get out of here !
Dad doesn't fall in love.

692
00:56:38.308 --> 00:56:40.185
I mean,
at least not seriously.

693
00:56:40.352 --> 00:56:42.604
Trust me.
He's serious about this one.

694
00:56:42.771 --> 00:56:45.315
He's always holding her hand
and kissing her neck...

695
00:56:45.482 --> 00:56:47.317
and waiting on her
hand and foot.

696
00:56:47.484 --> 00:56:49.820
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

697
00:56:49.987 --> 00:56:52.865
Well, you'll just have to break 'em up.
Sabotage her. Do whatever you have to.

698
00:56:53.031 --> 00:56:55.868
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

699
00:56:56.034 --> 00:56:58.787
I only met the man
12 hours ago.

700
00:56:58.954 --> 00:57:01.248
Hal, you've got to get
back here to help me.

701
00:57:01.415 --> 00:57:04.334
Annie, I can't.
I want more time with Mom.

702
00:57:04.501 --> 00:57:06.670
What's going on?

703
00:57:06.837 --> 00:57:09.047
Ann, are you still there?
I can barely hear you. Ann.

704
00:57:09.214 --> 00:57:11.800
- I'm here. What do you--
- Operator. Operator.

705
00:57:11.967 --> 00:57:14.344
- I think I lost you, Ann.
- Hello?

706
00:57:14.511 --> 00:57:18.140
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

707
00:57:21.226 --> 00:57:25.022
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

708
00:57:25.188 --> 00:57:27.274
Yeah. I-It's
an old camp tradition.

709
00:57:27.441 --> 00:57:31.528
Talk to your friend from
inside a closet. [ Laughs ]
Kinda stupid, I know, but--

710
00:57:31.695 --> 00:57:37.451
So, breakfast anyone?

711
00:57:37.618 --> 00:57:41.663
Okay. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day.

712
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.917
Eggs sunny-side up,
bacon, side of toast...

713
00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:46.919
and, in case you're
really hungry,

714
00:57:47.085 --> 00:57:49.755
a stack of humongous chocolate chip
pancakes, which smell incredible,

715
00:57:49.922 --> 00:57:54.051
- if I do say so myself.
- Thanks, Chessy.

716
00:57:54.217 --> 00:57:56.386
You're not hungry again?

717
00:57:56.553 --> 00:57:58.305
You hardly touched your chili,
your favourite food in the world.

718
00:57:58.472 --> 00:58:00.807
And now you don't want breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

719
00:58:00.974 --> 00:58:02.893
I'm fine.
I promise.

720
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.895
Where's Dad?

721
00:58:05.062 --> 00:58:07.564
Oh. He and Miss "I'll Just Have
Half A Grapefruit, Thank You"...

722
00:58:07.731 --> 00:58:09.650
left about
an hour ago.

723
00:58:09.816 --> 00:58:12.277
You overslept,
and he didn't want to wake you.

724
00:58:12.444 --> 00:58:14.613
Of course, I'd probably oversleep, too,
if I were up until midnight...

725
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.990
making mysterious phone calls
from my bathroom.

726
00:58:17.157 --> 00:58:20.035
Oh. Oh. That.

727
00:58:20.202 --> 00:58:22.120
I was calling a friend
from camp, Mildred.

728
00:58:22.287 --> 00:58:24.831
She lives
in New York.

729
00:58:24.998 --> 00:58:27.876
Oh, I see. So, you wanted
to wait and call Mildred...

730
00:58:28.043 --> 00:58:31.088
at a time that was convenient for her
because of the time difference.

731
00:58:31.254 --> 00:58:33.674
Exactly. Because--
Because of the time difference.

732
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.344
Uh-huh. So, you waited until it was
3:00 in the morning her time?

733
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:40.639
- That makes perfect sense.
- Actually--

734
00:58:41.932 --> 00:58:43.767
It was 7:00 at night
her time.

735
00:58:43.934 --> 00:58:45.769
You see, she lives in New York,
but she was on vacation...

736
00:58:45.936 --> 00:58:47.771
with her family
in Bora Bora.

737
00:58:50.148 --> 00:58:54.653
Very smooth.

738
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.322
Okay, look, smarty pants,
your father wants you...

739
00:58:57.489 --> 00:58:59.491
to meet him at his office as soon
as you're done with breakfast.

740
00:58:59.658 --> 00:59:02.160
He does?
Thanks.

741
00:59:02.327 --> 00:59:04.329
I'm done.

742
00:59:08.667 --> 00:59:10.502
That dog
has gotten so weird.

743
00:59:10.669 --> 00:59:13.338
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

744
00:59:16.049 --> 00:59:18.969
Push, Hal.

745
00:59:19.136 --> 00:59:22.848
Sorry. I... forgot.

746
00:59:28.478 --> 00:59:31.022
Honey, I'm really glad
you're here,

747
00:59:31.189 --> 00:59:34.025
'cause there's something really
important I want to talk to you about.

748
00:59:34.192 --> 00:59:38.196
That's funny, because there's
something really important that
I want to talk to you about.

749
00:59:38.363 --> 00:59:40.782
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

750
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:45.370
Okay. I want to talk to you
about Meredith.

751
00:59:45.537 --> 00:59:48.748
And I want to talk to you
about my mother.

752
00:59:48.915 --> 00:59:52.627
- What about Meredith?
- Well, what about your mother?

753
00:59:52.794 --> 00:59:54.838
Dad, I'm almost 12.
How long do you expect me...

754
00:59:55.005 --> 00:59:57.883
to buy that story that the stork
dropped me on your doorstep?

755
00:59:58.049 --> 01:00:01.219
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your mother.

756
01:00:01.386 --> 01:00:03.430
No, we haven't.
Not really.

757
01:00:03.597 --> 01:00:06.975
A girl needs more in life than
a half a crumpled old photograph.

758
01:00:07.142 --> 01:00:08.977
Dad, I'm almost
a teenager.

759
01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:11.062
Face it.
I need a mother.

760
01:00:11.229 --> 01:00:13.356
You know what?
You're right.

761
01:00:13.523 --> 01:00:17.903
You're absolutely right. You do need
a mother. Which brings me to--

762
01:00:20.614 --> 01:00:23.283
- Meredith.
- Hi. Hello, Hal.

763
01:00:23.408 --> 01:00:25.243
Hi.

764
01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.412
Hallie, this is
my assistant, Richard.

765
01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:30.290
Richard, this is Nick's daughter, the
one I've been telling you so much about.

766
01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:33.251
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi there.

767
01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:35.754
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

768
01:00:35.921 --> 01:00:37.923
- [ Sighs ]
- Hey, if you're free later,

769
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:39.925
why don't we all
have lunch on the terrace?

770
01:00:40.091 --> 01:00:43.595
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together this afternoon.

771
01:00:43.762 --> 01:00:46.306
Oh, no problem.
I've got plenty to do.

772
01:00:46.473 --> 01:00:50.268
I'm working on a new label design,
Nicky, featuring Y-O-U.

773
01:00:50.435 --> 01:00:53.104
You're gonna love it.
See you for dinner, darling.

774
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:56.608
- Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

775
01:00:56.775 --> 01:00:58.985
The first change I make is to send
that two-faced little brat...

776
01:00:59.152 --> 01:01:01.237
off to boarding-school
in Timbuktu.

777
01:01:01.404 --> 01:01:03.281
Ooh. Ice Woman !

778
01:01:03.448 --> 01:01:05.533
And proud of it, babe.

779
01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:15.418
Come on, Dad.

780
01:01:19.673 --> 01:01:21.591
Okay. Okay. You win.

781
01:01:21.758 --> 01:01:24.260
Pull up.
Give that horse a rest.

782
01:01:24.427 --> 01:01:26.763
Whoa, Sprout.

783
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.558
So, honey, are you excited
about our camping trip?

784
01:01:30.725 --> 01:01:33.500
- What camping trip?
- What camping trip?

785
01:01:33.512 --> 01:01:37.000
The one we take every summer
before you go back to school.


787
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:41.528
Oh. Oh. That camping trip.
Yeah. Sure. I can't wait.

788
01:01:41.695 --> 01:01:44.999
So, uh, Hal.

789
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.283
What do you think of Meredith?

790
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:49.000
As what, Dad?

791
01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:52.707
Your... Your publicist, 
your friend, your...

792
01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:57.168
No. Just what do you think
of her as a person?

793
01:01:57.335 --> 01:01:59.129
Oh. She's cute.

794
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.131
She has nice hair, good teeth.

795
01:02:01.297 --> 01:02:03.174
She can spell the word "you."

796
01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:06.344
Honestly, Dad, the woman is
a complete stranger to me.

797
01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:08.471
Why do you
want my opinion, anyway?

798
01:02:08.638 --> 01:02:10.515
Well, I'll tell you why, Hal.

799
01:02:10.682 --> 01:02:13.685
- Because, believe it or not--
- Race you back to the ranch, Dad.

800
01:02:13.852 --> 01:02:16.271
H-Hal.

801
01:02:16.438 --> 01:02:20.275
Hal, I'm trying
to tell you something.

802
01:02:22.694 --> 01:02:25.196
Hey !
Slow down.

1
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,340
I'm in so over my head here.
I can't handle this, I just can't.

876
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,770
I'm only one kid. <i>(gasps) </i>

877
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:55,710
You got something you want to 
share with the class  there, Hal? 

878
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,280
Chessy, you gave me a fright.

879
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,159
I gave you a fright? 

880
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,920
You scared me. 
I didn't know you were, like, in here.

881
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,890
Are you sure there isn't anything 
 you want to talk to me about? 

882
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,760
Like why Sammy 
 never comes near you anymore.

883
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:20,230
or why your appetite's 
 changed.

884
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,170
Or why all of a sudden you're 
 neat as a pin

885
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:27,710
and using expressions like, 
 "You gave me a fright."

886
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,340
Chessy, I changed a lot 
 over the summer, that's all.

887
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,310
OK.

888
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:40,280
Boy, if I didn't know 
 any better, I'd say 
 it's almost like you were...

889
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,020
Forget it. It's impossible.

890
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,860
Almost as if I were who, 
 Chessy? 

891
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,430
Nobody. Nobody. Forget 
 I mentioned it.

892
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,070
Almost as if I were... Annie? 

893
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,800
You know about Annie?

894
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,340
I am Annie.

895
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,850
<i>(Nick) </i> Hal.

896
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,120
Hal, why did you take off 
 on me like that? 

897
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,350
I told you I wanted to 
 talk to you about something.

898
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,320
Chessy, why are you looking at her like that? 

899
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:24,100
Like what? I'm not looking 
 at her any special way.

900
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,430
I'm looking at her like I've 
 looked at her for 11 years.

901
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,070
Since the day she came home 
 from the hospital.

902
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,510
Six pounds, 11 ounces. 21 inches long. 
 This is how I look at her.

903
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,810
Can I hug her? 

904
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,410
Oh, she's so beautiful.

905
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,020
And so big.

906
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:51,290
I'm going to make you 
 something special to eat. 
 What would you like? Anything? 

907
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,830
You know what, 
 it doesn't matter.

908
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,260
I'm just gonna go whip up 
 everything we've got. OK? 

909
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,570
Hal, come here.

910
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,270
- We have to talk. 

911
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,260
OK. Shoot.

912
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,210
OK.

913
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,080
Honey...

914
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:13,110
I want to know what you think 
 about making Meredith 
 part of the family.

915
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:17,890
Part of our family? - Yeah.

916
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,390
- I think 
 it's an awesome idea. 
 - Yeah? 

917
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,960
- Inspired! Brilliant! 
 - You do? Really? You do? 

918
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:28,020
Totally. I mean, like it's 
 a dream come true. I've always 
 wanted a big sister.

919
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,900
Oh.

920
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,300
Um... Honey, I think you're 
 kind of missing the point.

921
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,010
No, I'm not. You're going 
 to adopt Meredith.

922
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,710
- That is so sweet, Dad. 
 - No, I am not going to adopt her.

923
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:47,120
I'm... going to marry her.

924
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,310
Marry her? That's insane.

925
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,490
How can you marry 
 a woman young enough 
 to be my big sister? 

926
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,290
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère. 
 Meredith, ce n'est pas 
 une fille pour toi.</i>

927
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,160
<i>Mais c'est pas possible, 
 je rêve. Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

928
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:00,390
Calm down. Hal!

929
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,200
Are you speaking French? 

930
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,170
I learned it at camp.

931
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,540
OK. I'm sorry.

932
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:12,470
Let's discuss this calmly. 
 Calmly and rationally.

933
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,040
Yeah, and in English, 
 if you don't mind. Right? 

934
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,140
OK.

935
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,610
Sweetheart, 
 what has gotten into you? 

936
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:23,250
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

937
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:27,450
Dad, you can't get married. 
 It'll totally ruin 
 completely everything.

938
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,360
Hal. Hal.

939
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,530
Hallie.

940
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,160
Don't look at me. 
 I don't know a thing.

941
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,900
<i>(music blasts from car stereo) </i>

942
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:56,050
She thought I was going to adopt her? 

943
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,120
Hi, doll. - Hi.

944
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,090
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

945
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,460
How about a martini? - How about a double? 

946
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,930
Coming right up.

947
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,700
Chessy!

948
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,340
Don't you love it? 
 It's just what we need, 
 it's such a big house. Chessy!

949
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,900
You rang? 

950
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,350
Two martinis, please.

951
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,080
And make Mr. Parker's 
 a double.

952
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,750
Chess, please. 
 I'm getting a migraine.

953
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,360
- I told Hallie. 
 - You did? And? 

954
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,260
She went ballistic.

955
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:45,970
She started yelling in French. 
 I didn't even know 
 she spoke French.

956
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,500
- I don't know what's gotten into her. 
 - Oh, Nicky.

957
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:51,170
This reaction 
 is totally classic.

958
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,310
It's "Daddy's 
 Getting Remarried 101."

959
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,180
I'd be worried 
 if she didn't act this way.

960
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,010
Look.

961
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,420
Why don't I go talk to her? 
 You know, woman-to-woman.

962
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:07,150
I think she's a little 
 sensitive about you right now.

963
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:12,430
That's why I need to do it. 
 We've got to 
 break the ice sometime.

964
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,930
Wear your shirt like this. 
 I like it when 
 I can see a little chest hair.

965
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,380
Knock, knock. Can I join you? 

966
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,620
Sure.

967
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,420
Guess the news of the 
 engagement came 
 as a bit of a shock, huh? 

968
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,130
Basically.

969
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,560
You know, I remember 
 what it was like to be 11.

970
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:53,200
I had my first beau at 11. 
 It's a wonderful age.

971
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:57,140
You're just starting to feel 
 like a woman and, 
 believe it or not, 

972
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:00,610
soon you'll understand 
 what it's like to be in love.

973
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,740
Me? I don't think so.

974
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,450
I don't even have 
 my 12-year-old molars yet.

975
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,250
Well, take it from someone 
 who got their molars 
 very early in life, 

976
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:15,060
being in love is a fantastic 
 mystery that takes a man 
 and a woman...

977
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:19,160
I don't mean to be jerky when 
 you're trying to be all mushy 
 and everything, 

978
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:21,230
but I know what mystery 
 my dad sees in you.

979
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,160
You do? 

980
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:27,200
You're young and beautiful and 
 sexy and, hey, the guy's 
 only human.

981
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,200
But if you ask me, 

982
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,810
marriage is supposed to 
 be based on something more 
 than just sex, right? 

983
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,480
Boy, your father 
 underestimates you.

984
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:40,480
But you won't. 
 Will you, Meredith? 

985
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:43,550
Being young and beautiful's 
 not a crime, you know.

986
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,350
And for your 411, 
 I adore your father.

987
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:51,390
He's exactly the kind of man 
 I always planned on marrying.

988
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,700
This is the real deal, honey. 
 And nothing you do is going 
 to come between us.

989
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:00,570
Hate to break it to you, angel 
 but you are no longer the only 
 girl in Nick Parker's life.

990
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:04,240
- Get over it. 
 - If this is the real deal, 

991
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,840
then my dad's money has 
 nothing to do with you wanting 
 to marry him, right? 

992
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:12,650
OK, puss. You listen 
 and you listen good.

993
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:16,150
I am marrying your father in two weeks 
 whether you like it or not.

994
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,450
So I suggest you do not tangle 
 with me anymore.

995
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,590
You are in way over your head. 
 Is that clear? 

996
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,890
Crystal.

997
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,400
<i>(Grandfather) </i>Martin! 
 A refill, please.

998
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,180
- Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin. 
 - Thank you, sir.

999
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:48,320
- May I have a sip? 
 - I don't think 
 you're going to like it.

1000
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:03,800
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet's a little 
 too robust for a Merlot, 

1001
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:07,430
but then again I'm partial to 
 the softer California grape.

1002
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,610
Has she learned about wine 
 at the summer camp? 

1003
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,540
She must have.

1004
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:26,220
Darling! Are you all right? - I had one sip too many, 
 I guess.

1005
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:29,760
You know, Mother, 
 I feel like I could use 
 a bit of fresh air.

1006
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:32,330
Would it be OK if I stepped 
 outside for a moment? 

1007
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,330
Are you OK? 
 Would you like me 
 to go with you? 

1008
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:38,900
No, no, no. I'll be fine. Just 
 got a touch woozy, that's all.

1009
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,200
Woozy, huh? 

1010
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,230
I'd like to place a collect call to America, 
 please.

1011
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,730
<i>(rings) </i>

1012
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,970
- Hello? 
 - What's up? 

1013
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:16,270
Hal, I'm desperate. 
 Dad's getting married.

1014
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,270
What do you mean, 
 getting married? 

1015
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,270
I mean black tie, white gown, 
 the whole enchilada.

1016
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:23,710
- What? 
 - <i>The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

1017
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,480
If there's any hope of getting 
 Mum and Dad back together 
 we've got to do it fast.

1018
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,550
And I mean really fast.

1019
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,520
OK. So Mom and I are going out 
 to the theater tonight.

1020
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,290
I'll drop the bomb on her 
 first thing in the morning.

1021
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,460
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

1022
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,090
- And, Hallie, hurry! 
 - OK. I will.

1023
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,930
Oh, excuse me, sir.

1024
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,870
- Uh-oh. 
 - Uh-oh. Yes.

1025
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,570
Now, what say you and I take 
 a little stroll in the park, 
 eh, young lady? 

1026
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:54,810
OK.

1027
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,810
Now...

1028
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,410
Come on, 
 what's this all about? 

1029
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,680
Well, it's a long story.

1030
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:05,020
Well, it's a very big park 
 and we've got plenty of time, 
 you know.

1031
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:07,420
Well, first of all...

1032
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:11,790
<i>(Elizabeth) Féminine? 
 Vraiment... Je ne sais 
 pas comment expliquer</i>

1033
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,430
<i>mais vous aurez 
 le dessin demain, en tout cas.</i>

1034
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:19,600
<i>En satin? Non, non, ce sera 
 quelque chose plus moderne</i>

1035
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:23,970
<i>avec de la dentelle, du tulle 
 blanc très, très jeune, 
 très léger.</i>

1036
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,910
Just do it, sweet pea.

1037
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,780
<i>Non, c'est trop, non. Oui, 
 mademoiselle, vous aurez 
 le dessin demain matin.</i>

1038
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:35,950
<i>Oui, tout à fait. Ne vous 
 inquiétez pas. Allez, 
 au revoir.</i>

1039
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,050
Darling, come in. I just 
 have to finish this sketch 
 and fedex it off to Paris.

1040
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,450
Then how about you 
 and I go out to lunch

1041
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,990
and spend the rest of the day 
 getting lost in Harrods. Hm? 

1042
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,660
I can't, Mum, I'm sorry. 
 I have to go 
 out of town today.

1043
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,930
Oh, you have to go 
 out of town? 

1044
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,370
<i>(laughing) </i> And where, 
 may I ask, are you going? 

1045
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:57,870
Annie. Annie.

1046
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,440
<i>(American accent) </i> That's where 
 I have to go. 
 I have to go see Annie.

1047
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,610
I see. 
 And where might Annie be? 

1048
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:07,410
In Napa. 
 With her father Nick Parker.

1049
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,990
You're not Annie.

1050
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,930
That would be correct.

1051
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,830
You're Hallie? 

1052
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,800
I am.

1053
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:34,370
Annie and I met up at camp and 
 we decided to switch places.

1054
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:40,980
I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you, and I dreamt of meeting 
 you my whole life.

1055
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:47,120
Annie felt the exact same way about Dad, so we sorta 
 just switched lives.

1056
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,790
I hope you're not mad, because I love you so much

1057
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,060
and I just hope that one day 
 you can love me as me, 

1058
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,800
and not as Annie.

1059
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,800
Oh, darling.

1060
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,370
I've loved you 
 your whole life.

1061
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,800
<i>(sobbing) </i>

1062
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,440
I've never been so happy 
 in my entire life.

1063
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,520
<i>(wails) </i>

1064
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,520
So, I...

1065
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:24,460
I guess you have 
 to switch us back now, huh? 

1066
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:30,320
Well, technically, you belong 
 to your dad and Annie 
 belongs to me.

1067
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:35,200
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom, but this arrangement 
 really sucks.

1068
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,610
I agree. It totally sucks.

1069
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:43,910
Then I say we fly to Napa, 
 see Annie and Dad, and work 
 this whole thing out.

1070
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,980
And I say you're right. 
 Not to worry, darling. 
 I'll take care of everything.

1071
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,550
You're not to worry, OK? 

1072
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,660
I'm sorry. 
 I can't handle this.

1073
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,890
I mean, I haven't seen 
 or heard from Nick Parker 
 in over 11 years, 

1074
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:04,000
and suddenly I'm flying 
 halfway across the world to...

1075
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:06,530
I'm not mature 
 enough for this.

1076
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,800
If the man didn't make me so nuts,
 I'd still be married to him.

1077
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,010
I mean, we came up with this 
 arrangement so that

1078
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,300
we'd never have to see each other again. I mean, look at me, Martin.

1079
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,910
Have you ever seen me like this? 

1080
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,110
- Well... 
 - Don't answer that.

1081
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,850
I mean, what if he doesn't 
 recognize me? 

1082
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,480
No, don't answer that, either.

1083
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,560
So, Hallie said 
 he was a... a hunk.

1084
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,990
He was rather dishy.

1085
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,260
He had a smile that made me 
 go weak at the knees, 
 if you can imagine that.

1086
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:38,030
- OK. I'm all set, Mom. 
 - Great. Me too. Almost.

1087
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,100
Mom, your suitcase is, 
 like, totally empty.

1088
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,770
Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

1089
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,710
Did you speak to your father, 
 dear? 

1090
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,070
Um... Yeah, yeah. 
 I just hung up with him, 
 actually.

1091
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,940
He said he's really anxious 
 to see you.

1092
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,910
Anxious nervous, 
 like he's totally, 
 completely dreading it? 

1093
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,050
Or anxious excited, 
 like he's looking forward 
 to it? 

1094
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,090
- Anxious excited. Definitely. 
 - Oh.

1095
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:04,720
He said he'll meet us tomorrow 
 at noon at the Stafford Hotel 
 in San Francisco.

1096
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,890
My, my, my. That's incredibly 
 soon, isn't it? Well. Um...

1097
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:10,300
Why don't you run downstairs 
 and gather up our tickets

1098
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:12,630
from your grandfather 
 while I finish up here? 

1099
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,940
OK.

1100
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,340
- <i>(whispers) </i> Liar, liar, 
 pants on fire. 

1101
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:22,140
Sh! Oh, Martin, I have a really 
 ridiculous, somewhat childish 
 request to make.

1102
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:24,710
Martin, you know that you're 
 more than a butler to me.

1103
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,250
You're more like a lovable 
 brother who just happens 
 to wait on us and...

1104
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,680
Anyway, I was wondering if...

1105
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,920
I'd accompany you on the trip? 

1106
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,250
Make it a bit easier for you? 

1107
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,050
Would you, Martin? 
 Thank you so much.

1108
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:37,290
I'd be so grateful. And you 
 don't even have to come as our 
 butler, just as a friend.

1109
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,990
Madam, I'd be honored. 
 And may I say, as a friend, 

1110
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:45,630
if I was seeing my ex, 
 after 11 years, 
 and I had your legs...

1111
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,000
I'd wear this little baby.

1112
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,000
You'll kill in it.

1113
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,210
Bye, Daddy, darling. - Bye, darling.

1114
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,650
- Wish me luck. 
 - Good luck.

1115
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,320
- Bye, Pop. 
 - Bye, Hal.

1116
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,290
So you're coming to Napa 
 for Thanksgiving, right? 

1117
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,830
I wouldn't miss 
 it for the world.

1118
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,060
Bye.

1119
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,600
Oh, and say hello 
 to your father for me.

1120
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,640
I will.

1121
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:33,380
Airport, please.

Now, be nice, Daddy.

Hi, darling.

1131
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:22,560
Hallie. Chessy. And Sammy. 
 What in the world are you doing here? 

1132
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,830
Honey, a dog at the Stafford? 

1133

- Hal begged me to bring him. 
 - Oh, you're such a softy.

Good doggy. So, Meredith, 
 these the folks? 

1136
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:36,080
Yes. Mom, Dad, 
 you finally meet.

1137
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:40,050
This is my fiancé and the love 
 of my life, Nicholas Parker.

1138
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:43,280
Hello, Nicholas. 
 I'm so pleased to meet you.

1139
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,250
- I'm Vicki. 
 - Hi.

1140
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:48,290
And this is Nick's adorable 
 daughter Hallie.

1141
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,290
This entire prenuptial 
 get-together was her idea, 
 I'll have you know.

1142
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,300
How are you, young lady? 
 We've heard nothing but 
 wonderful things about you.

1143
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:59,300
Hello, pet. 
 You may call me Aunt Vicki.

1144
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:13,850
Other end, madam. - Whoops.

1145
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:23,490
That was a great flight, wasn't it? I mean, 
 it was so quick.

1146
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,330
I've never seen you quite 
 so thirsty before, madam.

1147
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:30,300
Well, would you believe, 
 Martin, darling, I've never 
 tasted vodka before this trip? 

1148
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,330
Could have fooled me, ma'am.

1149
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,970
<i>(Elizabeth) </i> Come on. 
 Let's rock and roll.

1150
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,340
I am in such major 
 trouble here.

1151
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:41,370
If the hotel can do it, 
 I think that room is perfect 
 for the wedding.

1152
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,440
Not too big, not too cramped.

1153
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:45,810
And not that I don't like 
 the idea of having the wedding 
 at the house, 

1154
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,880
it's just that this 
 could be amazing.

1155
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,920
So I've already checked us in. 
 Why don't we go upstairs, 
 freshen up, 

1156
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,020
and then rendezvous for lunch? 

1157
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,220
- Great. 
 - Meet you in the bar in ten. 
 OK? 

1158
01:20:57,230 --> 01:21:00,130
Perf.

1159
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,060
Sweetheart, now that we're 
 here, why don't we go check 
 out the honeymoon suite? 

1160
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:07,130
I bet it is to die for.

Oh, whoops. 
 I forgot my bag.

1163
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,480
Hang on.

1164
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:21,080
Sammy.

1165
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,000
Sammy!

1166
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:29,190
Excuse me. 
 Did you find a beige...

1167
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,290
Thank you.

1168
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,790
- Ooh. 
 - Mum!

1169
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,030
Darling, you didn't have 
 to wait for me. I could have 
 found the room by myself.

1170
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,070
Besides, I need to get 
 a little fresh air.

1171
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,140
Go on, sweetie. 
 I'll meet you upthairs.

1172
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,910
I like that jacket, 
 by the way.

1173
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,270
Were you wearing that 
 the whole time we were 
 on the plane? 

1174

- Mum, watch out! 
 - <i>(bellboy) </i>Sorry, sorry.

 had more than one glass 
 of wine in her entire life, 

1176
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:59,990
and she chooses today 
 to show up totally zonked.

1177
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,250
Yeah, well. Just do what the 
 woman says and meet 
 her "upthairs."

1178
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:14,890
Maybe that's why they make "do not disturb" signs.

Alone at last.

Oh, don't do this to me. 
 I'm already seeing double.

Oh, my girls.

I can't believe you're 
 together. But how could you 
 do this to me?

<i>(clears throat) </i>

Excuse me. 
 I hate to interrupt, but...

1188
01:22:55,590 --> 01:23:00,610
might I suggest that 
 we continue this little 
 powwow inside? 

1189

- Hi. You probably 
 don't remember me. 
 - Chessy.

1190
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,750
I knew I always liked her.

1191
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,960
One of you... I'm not sure 
 which one at the moment, 

1192
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:15,600
but one of you told me 
 your father knew I was 
 arriving here today.

1193
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:18,600
And I'm here to tell you 
 that the man I just saw 
 in the elevator

1194
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:21,670
had absolutely no idea 
 he and I were 
 on the same planet, 

1195
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,400
- let alone in the same hotel. 
 - You saw Dad already?

Yes, I did.

 cold for my head?

 pondered what it was going 
 to be like

 around another woman's arms

 him go through with it.

 marry her is if...

You tell her.

Yes. Technically, yes.

that I am here for one 
 purpose, and one purpose only.

And that is 
 to switch the two of you back.

Now, let's do what we have 
 to do and be done with it.

01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,660
Understood? 

1247
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,001
- Hey, Dad. What's up? 
 - Hi. Just running down 
 to the lobby.

1248
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:02,609
- Hey, Hal. 
 - Huh? 

1249
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:04,160
Do me a favor, will ya, 
 while I'm gone? 

1250
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,230
Will you just look after 
 Meredith for me? 
 Huh? Thanks.

1251
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,730
- Hallie. Hallie. 
 - Yeah? 

1252
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:11,570
How do I look? 
 Like, presentable 
 and everything? 

1253
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:15,210
- Not too old? 
 - You look fab, Dad. 
 Young and fab.

1254
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:25,790
Dad.

1255
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,150
I thought you were gonna 
 keep Meredith company.

1256
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:30,660
I was? I mean, I am, yeah.

1257
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:33,690
I was just looking for her, 
 actually.

1258
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,260
It's great to see you, Dad.

1259
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,630
It's great to see you too, 
 squirt.

1260
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,400
- Nice outfit. 
 - Oh, thanks.

1261
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,340
Well, go on. 
 Get up there. Come on.

1262
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,740
Let's get together, yeah, 
 yeah, yeah

1263
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,280
Why don't you and I combine? 

1264
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:52,750
Let's get together...

1265
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,780
- Have you seen your father? 
 - You talking to me? 

1266
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:58,120
What, are you Robert De Niro? 
 Yes, I am talking to you.

1267
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,890
Oh, Meredith.

1268
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,620
- Uh... Yeah. I just saw him. 
 - Well, hello. Where was he? 

1269
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:07,160
Uh... He went that way. 
 I think.

1270
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,700
What are you staring at? - Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1271
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,340
You're just really very pretty. 
 That's all.

1272
01:27:20,341 --> 01:27:21,640
Oh...

1273
01:27:21,641 --> 01:27:25,610
Don't tell me you're gonna 
 break your rotten streak and 
 suddenly be nice to me.

1274
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:30,310
If you see your father, 
 tell him he's late 
 and I'm waiting.

1275
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,180
Whatever you say, Cruella.

1278
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:48,510
- Just don't ask what's in it. 
 - OK.

1279
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:53,570
Here's to...
Here's to you. 

1280
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:57,270

 May your life be far less 
 complicated than mine.

1281
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,480
Thank you.

1282
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:01,210
Ugh.

There's your martini, 
 and your bill, Miss James.

1286
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:15,830
Thank you.

You're Elizabeth James?

01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,010
- Guilty. 
 - Oh!

1289
01:28:30,015 --> 01:28:34,780
I just saw a wedding dress you 
 designed in <i>Vogue</i> and fell 
 completely in love with it.

1290
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:37,250
I faxed your office just 
 yesterday, and they said that 
 you were out of town

1291
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,650
and didn't know 
 if you could make another.

1292
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,550
I can't believe it. It's fate.

1293
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:44,920
- I'm Meredith Blake. 
 - How do you do?

Sorry.

1296
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,980
Excuse me. - Excuse me.

1297
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:07,980
Where have you been? 
 We've been looking 
 all over for you.

1298
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:11,250
Nicholas, I think this hotel 
 is perfect for the wedding.

1299
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,320
The more I see of it, 
 the more I like it.

1300
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:15,320
Me too.

1301
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:19,930
Absolutely.

1302
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:23,860
Now, tell me, dear. How many 
 are we expecting from your 
 side of the family? 

1303
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:26,700
Just a guesstimate.

1304
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:30,840
Uh... Can I get back to you 
 on that? I... I'm not sure 
 at the moment.

1305
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:32,940
Excuse me.

1306
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,470
Pardon me. Sorry.

1307
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:40,280
Oh! Boss, you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine.

- <i>(man) </i> Uh... Sir. 
 - Dad, watch out!

 - Argh!

1310
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,310
Hello, Liz. - Hello, Nick.

1311
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,850
Well, gosh. There you are. 
 What do you know? 

1312
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:19,150
Uh... Is there something going 
 on here that I should know 
 about? 

1313
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,650
Because I'm stunned 
 to see you.

1314
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:25,830
But, uh... you don't seem 
 as stunned to see me.

1315
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,890
I mean, I haven't seen or 
 heard from you 
 in, what, ten, eleven years.

1316
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:33,870
- All of a sudden, on the very day that... 
 - Dad.

1317
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,400
I can explain why she's here.

1318
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:38,970
Hallie, you know who this is? 

1319
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:43,870
Actually, yes. 
 And, actually, I'm not Hallie.

1320
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,650
Actually, I am.

1321
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,650
Both of them? 

1322
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:53,880
Annie? 

1323
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:56,260
Hallie? 

1324
01:30:56,370 --> 01:31:00,390
I guess you and Mum kind 
 of think alike, 'cause you 
 both sent us to the same camp.

1325
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:04,660
We met there, 
 and the whole thing 
 just sort of spilled out.

1326
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:08,500
They switched places on us, 
 Nick.

1327
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,100
You mean I've had Annie 
 with me all this time? 

1328
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:16,500
Well, I wanted to know what 
 you were like, and Hallie 
 wanted to know Mum, and...

1329
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:20,710
Are you angry? - Oh, honey. Of course not.

1330
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,010
I just can't believe it's you.

1331
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:29,590
Last time I saw you, you had diaper rash. 
 Oh, sorry - you're all wet.

1332
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:33,760
- It's all right. 
 - Look at you.

1333
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:38,130
Well, I'm quite grown-up now, 
 and quite without a father.

1334
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,100
And I'm headed into my crazy, 
 mixed-up teenage years, 

1335
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:45,910
and I'll be the only girl 
 I know without a mother 
 to fight with.

1336
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,140
Hallie, you've been in London 
 all this time? 

1337
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:52,140
Come here, squirt.

1338
01:31:56,090 --> 01:32:00,800
Mom's amazing, 
 Dad. I don't know how you ever 
 let her go.

1339
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,930
Girls, why don't you let your 
 father and I talk alone for 
 a couple of minutes, OK? 

1340
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:08,990
- Sure, fine. 
 - Take your time.

1341
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:12,530
I don't believe this.

1342
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:17,500
Seeing them together, 
 seeing you.

1343
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:20,040
- Ow. 
 - Ooh. 
 Let me help you with that.

1344
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:21,940
Oh, excuse me. 
 Do you have a first-aid kit? 

1345
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:23,980
Yeah, of course.

1346
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:26,910
Why don't you lie down? 

1347
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,850
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks.

1348
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,520
So... how are you, Lizzie? 

1349
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:36,960
Or does everyone 
 call you Elizabeth now? 

1350
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:39,830
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's... 
 Lizzie's fine.

1351
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,230
- My dad still calls me 
 Lizzie. 
 - Yeah? 

1352
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,730
- Yeah, I've been... 
 uh, been terrific. 
 - Oh.

1353
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:50,070
You know, 
 you haven't changed a bit.

1354
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,710
Finally. There you are. 
 Oh! Uh... Oh, good. 
 You've met.

1355
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,480
Honey, Elizabeth 
 designs wedding gowns, 
 and she's going to make my...

1356
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:03,680
Wait, um... 
 I don't understand. 
 How did you two meet? 

1357
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:06,050
And, Nicky, 
 why are you all wet? 

1358
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,120
You're making 
 my fiancée's wedding gown.

1359
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,660
- Well, I didn't know 
 she was your fiancée. 
 - Well...

1360
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,030
How did we meet? 
How did you two meet? 

1361
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,000
- Am I missing something here? 

1362
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,500
- Know what? This is one small world.

1363
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,500
How small? 

1364
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,530
- Hi, Mer. 
 - Hello.

1365
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:24,900
- How you doing? 
 - <i>(shrieks) </i>

1366
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:29,170
Honey, did I ever mention 
 to you that Hallie was a twin? 

1367
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:32,540
No, I'm afraid you forgot 
 that little detail.

1368
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,980
Don't feel bad, Mer, 
 he never mentioned it to me, 
 either.

1369
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:39,650
By the way, 
 I'm the real Hallie. 
 This is Annie.

1370
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,220
She was pretending to be me, 
 while I was pretending 
 to be her.

1371
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:47,590
And this is our mother, 
 Elizabeth James.

1372
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,730
This is your mother?

- Yeah. 
 - Guilty again.

1376
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,810
- Oh, well. 
 This is a small world. 
 - And getting smaller.

1377
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:03,740
And what a coincidence that 
 we're all here on the exact 
 same weekend.

1378
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,650
My, my, my. How sweet.

1379
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,160
Hal, I've had enough surprises for one day.

1380
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:18,960
Will you please just tell me 
 where we're going? 

1381
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:21,290
You're gonna love it, Dad. 
 Trust me.

1382
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,000
Hello.

1383
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,170
Hey.

1384
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:34,200
So...

1385
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,970
Do you have any idea 
 where they're taking us? 

1386
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:40,110
- Not a clue. 
 - Right.

1387
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,230
Where are we? 

1388
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:06,270
This is where we're eating? 

1389
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,840
No, actually, 

1390
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:13,280

 </i> Wow! 
So how exactly are we paying for this? 

1393
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,220
Well, we pooled our allowances.

1394
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:27,860
- Yeah, right, Annie. 
 - OK. Grandfather chipped in a bit.

1395
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:31,200
- Annie. 
 - OK. He chipped in a lot.

1396

 You guys are gonna love it.

1397
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,700
<i>(Nick) </i> Pretty snazzy.

1398
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:40,640
Elizabeth and Nick, your dinner awaits you.

1399
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,050
Girls.

1400
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,160
The table's only set for two.

1401
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:05,530
- Oh. That's the other part of the surprise. 
 - We're not joining you.

1402
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,830
-You're not? 
- No, but I am.

1403
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:12,340
Good evening. I'm Chessy, and I'll be your server this evening.

1404
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:16,040
- No wisecracks, please. 
 - And I am Martin, your sommelier.

1405
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:20,180
May I offer you both a taste 
 of the bubbly in the hope that 
 you'll get a bit schnockered

1406
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:23,680
and not fire this lovely lady 
 and myself

1407
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:27,420
for following 
 the orders of these 
 audacious 11-year-olds? 

1408
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,860
Annie, mood music, please.

1409

1410
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:41,870
Just relax. 
 Sail through time.

 - Yes, I'm beginning to.

1413
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,890
They're recreating the night we met. 
 The boat, the music...

1414
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,190
The help.

1415
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,360
It's so sweet.

1416
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:09,220
Martin, 
 I think I'll take that drink.

1417
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,960
Thank you, Martin.

1418
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:16,010
Oh. Yeah.

1419
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,440
To tell you the truth, I haven't been on a boat 
 since the <i>QE2.</i>

1420
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,040
Neither have I.

1421
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,050
Well, then, here's to, uh...

1422
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,080
Our daughters.

1423
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,120
Our daughters.

1424
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,530
Now I know how a goldfish feels.

<i>(groans) </i>

1426
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:48,200
You know, sometime 
 if we're ever really alone, 

1427
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:53,270
maybe we could talk about 
 what happened between us.

1428
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,310
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

1429
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,540
It ended so fast.

1430
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,110
It started so fast.

1431
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,250
Well, that part 
 I remember perfectly.

1432
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,320
Looks like things are heating up quite nicely.

1433
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:13,830
I'd say it's safe to serve 
 the vichyssoise.

1434
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,230
You ladle, I'll serve.

1435
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,330
I'm sorry.


1355
01:38:26.564 --> 01:38:29.901
Yes, I'll...
uh, ladle.

1356
01:38:30.068 --> 01:38:33.696
Right.
And then I'll--

1357
01:38:33.863 --> 01:38:35.698
- Serve?
- Right.

1358
01:38:35.865 --> 01:38:37.700
Right.

1359
01:38:37.867 --> 01:38:43.581
So... you've done
fantastically well. Um...

1360
01:38:43.748 --> 01:38:47.752
your dream of owning your own
vineyard actually came true.

1361
01:38:47.919 --> 01:38:49.921
What about you?
You were always drawing...

1362
01:38:50.088 --> 01:38:52.757
on napkins
and corners of newspapers.

1363
01:38:52.924 --> 01:38:57.428
- Now you're this major designer.
- Yeah, it's great.

1364
01:38:57.595 --> 01:39:00.014
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

1365
01:39:00.181 --> 01:39:02.558
Yeah, we did.

1366
01:39:04.852 --> 01:39:08.356
Anyway, what are we going
to do about the girls?

1367
01:39:08.523 --> 01:39:11.192
Well, now that they met,
we can't very well keep them apart.

1368
01:39:11.359 --> 01:39:14.612
Well, I could keep them for half of
the year, and then you could keep them.

1369
01:39:14.779 --> 01:39:17.448
- Well--
- Guys. They can't go to
two different schools every year.

1370
01:39:17.615 --> 01:39:19.617
- That's nuts.
- I agree.

1371
01:39:19.784 --> 01:39:21.702
Well, then, I could keep them both for
a whole year, and you could keep them...

1372
01:39:21.869 --> 01:39:23.704
Liz.

1373
01:39:23.871 --> 01:39:25.706
That's why we came up with--

1374
01:39:25.873 --> 01:39:30.795
Oh, G-- Sorry. Ignore me.
Enjoy your soup.

1375
01:39:30.962 --> 01:39:33.881
That's why we came up
with the solution that we have.

1376
01:39:34.048 --> 01:39:36.843
Really?
I thought it was because...

1377
01:39:37.009 --> 01:39:39.512
we decided never to see
each other again.

1378
01:39:39.679 --> 01:39:42.098
Not we, Liz.

1379
01:39:42.265 --> 01:39:45.810
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me, too, over the years.

1380
01:39:45.977 --> 01:39:50.440
- You don't remember the day you packed?
- No, that day I remember perfectly.

1381
01:39:50.606 --> 01:39:52.775
Did I hurt you when
I threw that, um...

1382
01:39:52.942 --> 01:39:56.612
- What was it? Uh, uh--
- It was... a hair dryer.

1383
01:39:56.779 --> 01:39:57.999
Oh, right.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.659
 Sorry.

1384
01:40:03.786 --> 01:40:07.748
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

1385
01:40:07.915 --> 01:40:12.837
So, about that day that you packed--
Why'd you do it?

1386
01:40:13.004 --> 01:40:15.256
Oh, Nick.
We were so young...

1387
01:40:15.423 --> 01:40:18.467
and we both had tempers.

1388
01:40:18.634 --> 01:40:21.470
We said stupid things
and so I packed.

1389
01:40:21.637 --> 01:40:23.681
Got on
my very first 747,

1390
01:40:23.848 --> 01:40:28.686
and... you didn't
come after me.

1391
01:40:28.853 --> 01:40:31.522
I didn't know that
you wanted me to.

1392
01:40:34.358 --> 01:40:36.444
Well, it doesn't
really matter any more.

1393
01:40:36.611 --> 01:40:39.363
So, let's just
put a good face on...

1394
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:42.617
for the girls and get the show
on the road, huh?

1395
01:40:42.783 --> 01:40:46.245
Yeah, sure.
Let's...

1396
01:40:46.412 --> 01:40:48.998
get the show
on the road.

1397
01:40:55.046 --> 01:40:57.632
Your passport, Ms James.
Have a safe trip home.

1398
01:40:58.257 --> 01:40:59.634
Thank you.

1399
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.471
- All set then. Where's Annie?
- I just rang up. She's on her way down.

1400
01:41:03.638 --> 01:41:05.473
Right.

1401
01:41:07.725 --> 01:41:09.894
So, I'll send Hallie
back to you over Christmas.

1402
01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:13.898
And Annie will spend Easter with you.

1403
01:41:18.653 --> 01:41:21.197
Honey, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

1404
01:41:21.364 --> 01:41:26.077
Here's the deal, Mom.
We thought it over, and
we decided we're being totally gypped.

1405
01:41:26.243 --> 01:41:30.665
Dad promised we'd go on our camping
trip. And we want to go... together.

1406
01:41:30.831 --> 01:41:32.792
What camping trip?

1407
01:41:32.959 --> 01:41:35.211
The one we go on every summer
before school starts.

1408
01:41:35.378 --> 01:41:37.296
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and put your clothes on.

1409
01:41:37.463 --> 01:41:40.383
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course, I'm sure.

1410
01:41:40.549 --> 01:41:43.500
But, it's kind of hard
to be 100% positive, isn't it?

1411
01:41:43.501 --> 01:41:48.224
Girls, this is totally unfunny.
You're gonna make your mother
miss her aeroplane.

1412
01:41:48.391 --> 01:41:50.184
- Annie !
- Yes !

1413
01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:00.319
This one's Hallie.
I'm positive.

1414
01:42:00.486 --> 01:42:02.446
You know, I hope
you're right, Dad.

1415
01:42:02.613 --> 01:42:06.701
Because you wouldn't want to send the
wrong kid all the way back to England.

1416
01:42:06.867 --> 01:42:08.703
Would you?

1417
01:42:15.209 --> 01:42:18.629
Here's our proposition.

1418
01:42:18.796 --> 01:42:20.923
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

1419
01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:23.843
and the four of us leave
on the camping trip.

1420
01:42:24.009 --> 01:42:26.679
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

1421
01:42:26.846 --> 01:42:30.141
- we'll tell you who's Annie
and who's Hallie.
- Or you do as we say,

1422
01:42:30.307 --> 01:42:35.146
and I take one of you back with me
to London whether you like it or not.

1423
01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.363
And what am I supposed to do
for three days? Sit home and knit?

1424
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:46.991
Honey, we have kind of
a sticky situation.

1425
01:42:47.158 --> 01:42:52.329
- Sticky situation? What do you mean,
"sticky situation"? What exactly--

1426
01:42:54.248 --> 01:42:56.459
Excuse me.
What is she doing here?

1427
01:42:56.625 --> 01:42:58.461
You see, that's part of the deal.
The four of us--

1428
01:42:58.627 --> 01:43:01.088
We... go together.

1429
01:43:01.255 --> 01:43:03.757
- What are you suddenly,
the Brady Bunch? This is ridic.... Hello.

1430
01:43:03.924 --> 01:43:05.801
Everything all right?

1431
01:43:05.968 --> 01:43:07.803
Well, no. Actually it isn't.

1432
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:11.015
I didn't realize that
you were going on this little outing.

1433
01:43:11.182 --> 01:43:15.060
- And to tell you the truth, I'm not
so sure that I'm okay with it.
- I agree.

1434
01:43:15.227 --> 01:43:18.564
I think the ex-wife in
the next sleeping bag is a little weird.

1435
01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:23.068
- Thank you.
- I absolutely insist that you come with us. Really.

1436
01:43:23.235 --> 01:43:24.321
Liz--

1437
01:43:24.322 --> 01:43:27.323
No, honestly, Nick.
I've messed up your entire weekend.

1438
01:43:27.489 --> 01:43:31.202
It's the least I can do.
Really, please.

1439
01:43:42.171 --> 01:43:44.006
Dad, what's Meredith
doing here?

1440
01:43:44.173 --> 01:43:47.593
- Your mother invited her.
- What?

1441
01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.595
Be nice.

1442
01:44:02.024 --> 01:44:05.986
- Okay. All set? Have fun, everyone.
- What?

1443
01:44:06.153 --> 01:44:08.239
Liz, what are
you doing?

1444
01:44:08.405 --> 01:44:12.493
Well, I really think that
you and Meredith need some time
alone before the big day.

1445
01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.620
Mom, come on !
That's not the plan.

1446
01:44:14.787 --> 01:44:17.039
Ah, honestly, you'll have
much more fun without me.

1447
01:44:17.206 --> 01:44:20.501
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

1448
01:44:20.668 --> 01:44:22.503
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

1449
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:24.588
But this is your chance
to really get to know the girls.

1450
01:44:24.755 --> 01:44:27.508
I mean after all,
starting next week, they're--

1451
01:44:27.675 --> 01:44:29.510
they're half yours.

1452
01:44:35.391 --> 01:44:37.393
Have fun all of you !

1453
01:44:41.981 --> 01:44:43.816
Bye-bye !

1454
01:44:43.983 --> 01:44:47.987
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman climb a mountain.

1455
01:44:56.161 --> 01:44:58.414
Whoa !

1456
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.126
- Come on, you guys.
- Whoa ! Oh !

1457
01:45:15.931 --> 01:45:20.310
Oh, I'm gonna
kill my trainer.

1458
01:45:20.477 --> 01:45:24.440
He says I'm in such great shape. I can't
believe people actually do this for fun.

1459
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:28.152
Hold on.
We're stopping.

1460
01:45:28.318 --> 01:45:31.655
Again? Dad, at this rate,
it'll take us...

1461
01:45:31.822 --> 01:45:33.657
three days just
to get to the lake.

1462
01:45:33.824 --> 01:45:37.995
Meredith isn't used to the altitude.
Just chill, okay?

1463
01:45:38.162 --> 01:45:42.458
Ooh.

1464
01:45:42.624 --> 01:45:45.461
Ah, I'm in serious pain.

1465
01:45:45.627 --> 01:45:49.715
Somebody hand me my Evian.
I can't move.

1466
01:45:49.882 --> 01:45:51.967
Sure.

1467
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:58.015
Brilliant.

1468
01:46:02.895 --> 01:46:04.730
Here you go, Mer.

1469
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:16.533
Honey, you okay?
What happened?

1470
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.703
This little guy was
on her Evian bottle.

1471
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:22.664
Oh, he won't hurt you, Meredith.

1472
01:46:22.831 --> 01:46:25.000
Oh, right, right, right. Right. I know.

1473
01:46:25.001 --> 01:46:28.587
You, uh, go ahead.

1474
01:46:28.754 --> 01:46:30.839
I'll be fine.

1475
01:46:31.006 --> 01:46:33.258
Get that thing away from me.

1476
01:46:33.509 --> 01:46:34.593
I hate things that crawl.

1477
01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.971
Aagh ! How can you touch that?
Just put it down.

1478
01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:40.974
Okay. Okay.
I'll put it down.

1479
01:46:42.726 --> 01:46:46.188
- Girls?
- What?
- What?

1480
01:46:46.355 --> 01:46:49.525
I'm going to take the lead. The two
of you help Meredith. All right?

1481
01:46:49.691 --> 01:46:52.361
Sure, you'll help me.

1482
01:46:52.486 --> 01:46:56.031
Right over a cliff,
you'll help me.

1483
01:46:56.198 --> 01:46:59.534
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. See any cliffs?

1484
01:46:59.701 --> 01:47:02.371
- Aah, my backpack.
- Need a hand, Mer?

1485
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:10.295
Not from you, thank you.
Don't think I can't see
right past those angelic faces.

1486
01:47:10.462 --> 01:47:12.297
One more trick from you two,
and I promise...

1487
01:47:12.464 --> 01:47:16.927
I will make your lives miserable
from the day I say "I do."

1488
01:47:17.094 --> 01:47:20.555
Got it?

1489
01:47:20.722 --> 01:47:24.184
Got it, Cruella.

1490
01:47:24.351 --> 01:47:27.271
What did you call me?

1491
01:47:27.437 --> 01:47:31.066
Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella.

1492
01:47:31.233 --> 01:47:35.737
Oh, by the way, Mer, I think there's
something on your head.

1493
01:47:49.501 --> 01:47:53.880
Are you all right?

1494
01:47:54.047 --> 01:47:59.177
- Aah !
- What... happened?

1495
01:47:59.344 --> 01:48:03.348
Ask... them.

1496
01:48:03.521 --> 01:48:13.734
What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you.

1497
01:48:17.571 --> 01:48:20.365
Here we go, girls.
This will hold us for a while.

1498
01:48:25.537 --> 01:48:27.706
Sure you don't want some trout, Mom?

1499
01:48:27.873 --> 01:48:30.208
Is that okay, by the way,
if we start calling you mom?

1500
01:48:30.375 --> 01:48:33.670
I think your mother would prefer if you called me Meredith.

1501
01:48:33.837 --> 01:48:39.301
And no thank you. 
I do not eat... trout... for the thousandth time.

1502
01:48:39.468 --> 01:48:41.762
I will wait until breakfast.

1503
01:48:41.928 --> 01:48:43.889
- What are we having?
- Trout.

1504
01:48:44.055 --> 01:48:46.641
Come on. It's part of the experience.

1505
01:48:46.808 --> 01:48:50.187
Mmm. And what's the other part?
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes?

1506
01:48:50.353 --> 01:48:52.898
God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

1507
01:48:53.064 --> 01:48:56.193
Well, what's that you're using?
Let me see that.

1508
01:48:59.696 --> 01:49:03.867
Well, you're gonna attract every mosquito in the state with this stuff,
It's sugar and water.

1509
01:49:04.034 --> 01:49:06.286

Where'd you get it?

1510
01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:11.917
That's it. 
I am taking one large sleeping pill...

1511
01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:14.085
and going to bed.

1512
01:49:20.884 --> 01:49:24.054
Meredith,
what are you doing?

1513
01:49:24.221 --> 01:49:27.641
I don't want the mountain lions to--

1514
01:49:27.807 --> 01:49:31.895
There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

1515
01:49:33.647 --> 01:49:35.482
No.

1516
01:49:51.373 --> 01:49:53.208
Good night.

1517
01:49:57.712 --> 01:50:00.882
Girls, I'm telling you.
Lay off.

1518
01:50:01.049 --> 01:50:04.094
This isn't her thing, okay?
I'm not marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.

1519
01:50:04.261 --> 01:50:06.096
Who's Annie Oakley?

1520
01:50:06.263 --> 01:50:09.349
Just cool it.

1521
01:50:25.699 --> 01:50:27.993
Come on. Come on.

1522
01:50:28.159 --> 01:50:29.995
Okay.

1523
01:50:30.161 --> 01:50:33.498
I hope that
one large sleeping pill worked.

1524
01:50:41.047 --> 01:50:43.633
You take that side.
- All right.

1525
01:50:46.803 --> 01:50:51.266
- Gosh, she's heavy.
- She's also like... snoring.

1526
01:50:59.524 --> 01:51:02.485
Nicky?

1527
01:51:29.179 --> 01:51:32.432
Sweet dreams, Mommie Dearest.

1528
01:51:47.739 --> 01:51:52.202
Mmm.
That feels nice.

1529
01:52:02.253 --> 01:52:05.590
Nicky !

1530
01:52:08.259 --> 01:52:11.471
Oh, man.

1531
01:52:11.638 --> 01:52:13.473
Ooh !

1532
01:52:20.104 --> 01:52:21.940
Ugh !

1533
01:52:24.776 --> 01:52:27.904
Ugh ! Ugh !

1534
01:52:28.071 --> 01:52:31.074
- What's goin' on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy !

1535
01:52:31.241 --> 01:52:34.786
The day we get married is the day
I ship those brats off to Switzerland.

1536
01:52:34.953 --> 01:52:39.874
Get the picture?
It's me or them. Take your pick.

1537
01:52:42.168 --> 01:52:44.379
- Them.

1538
01:52:44.546 --> 01:52:49.592
- Excuse me?
- T-H-E-M, them.

1539
01:52:49.759 --> 01:52:51.594
Get the picture?

1540
01:53:08.778 --> 01:53:11.531
Hello.
You're back so soon.

1541
01:53:11.698 --> 01:53:15.201
- Did you have fun?
- Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.

1542
01:53:15.368 --> 01:53:19.372
- You wouldn't?
- We've been punished to the end of the century.

1543
01:53:19.539 --> 01:53:24.252
- Starting now. Go !
- Where's Meredith?

1544
01:53:24.419 --> 01:53:30.000
We played a couple of harmless tricks on her and she kind of freaked out a little.

1545
01:53:30.001 --> 01:53:33.428
A little?
Hmm.

1546
01:53:33.595 --> 01:53:36.889
She threw this at my head.

1547
01:53:37.056 --> 01:53:39.726
At least it's smaller than a hair dryer.

1548
01:53:39.851 --> 01:53:42.562
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go--

1549
01:53:42.729 --> 01:53:46.190
Or tricked!
Tricked would be more like it.

1550
01:53:46.357 --> 01:53:48.484
Like mother,
like daughters.

1551
01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:50.486
I-I really am sorry.

1552
01:53:50.653 --> 01:53:53.323
- We are too, Dad. Really.
- Yeah.

1553
01:53:53.448 --> 01:53:55.950
Up to your room...
now.

1554
01:54:02.123 --> 01:54:04.542
I gotta remember
to thank them one day.

1555
01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.300
So, where's Chessy?
I'm starving.

1556
01:54:12.467 --> 01:54:17.680
Well, she and Martin went off on a picnic around noon... yesterday.

1557
01:54:17.847 --> 01:54:20.933
Really ! Who would
have thought-- my nanny, your butler !

1558
01:54:23.561 --> 01:54:26.314
Well, what do you say,
I whip us up something to eat?

1559
01:54:26.481 --> 01:54:31.819
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can, uh, make pasta and pasta and, uh--

1560
01:54:31.986 --> 01:54:36.741
- Mmm, pasta sounds good.
- Well, pasta it is.

1561
01:54:42.288 --> 01:54:44.373
Okay, I'll take two.

1562
01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:49.629
- Hey, Dad!
- Wow! You look so nice!

1563
01:54:49.796 --> 01:54:54.467
- Where are you going?
- Good night, ladies.

1564
01:55:02.475 --> 01:55:06.896
- Oh, wow !
- This is where I keep my private stash.

1565
01:55:07.063 --> 01:55:09.357
Did you know
I also collect wine?

1566
01:55:09.524 --> 01:55:13.277
- Really?
- I'm a man of limited interest.
Come here.

1567
01:55:15.446 --> 01:55:19.617
This...
is a 1921 Burgundy.

1568
01:55:19.784 --> 01:55:25.456
- They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested.
- Oh.

1569
01:55:25.623 --> 01:55:27.959
Now, you will appreciate this.
Come here.

1570
01:55:38.052 --> 01:55:39.971
Look.

1571
01:55:40.137 --> 01:55:43.266
"VJ day, 1945."

1572
01:55:43.432 --> 01:55:46.394
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

1573
01:55:51.566 --> 01:55:54.944
Now, this is the same wine that
was served at my parents' wedding.

1574
01:55:55.111 --> 01:55:57.071
A Bordeaux-- '52.

1575
01:55:57.238 --> 01:56:00.575
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

1576
01:56:02.743 --> 01:56:06.914
What's this one?
"Where dreams have no end--

1577
01:56:07.081 --> 01:56:11.836
- 1983."
- That one actually
took me years to track down.

1578
01:56:12.003 --> 01:56:15.840
Why?
Where's it from?

1579
01:56:16.007 --> 01:56:19.468
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

1580
01:56:22.346 --> 01:56:24.515
I know. I have
every bottle ever made.

1581
01:56:24.682 --> 01:56:27.393
You do?

1582
01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:30.396
I do.

1583
01:56:33.858 --> 01:56:37.320
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one I'd drink it with.

1584
01:56:40.823 --> 01:56:45.119
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I just got
a little dust in my eye.

1585
01:56:45.286 --> 01:56:47.413
Hmm?
I can offer you a clean sleeve.

1586
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:52.585
No, no.
I'm fine really. All better.

1587
01:56:52.752 --> 01:56:56.255
You don't always have
to be so brave, you know.

1588
01:56:56.422 --> 01:57:00.134
Oh, but I do actually.

1589
01:57:07.558 --> 01:57:10.227
That will be Chessy.

1590
01:57:10.394 --> 01:57:13.564
She has a key.

1591
01:57:24.617 --> 01:57:29.205
Hello. Anybody home?

1592
01:57:29.372 --> 01:57:31.207
We'll be right up.

1593
01:58:46.532 --> 01:58:51.662
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, I will. You too.

1594
01:59:05.426 --> 01:59:08.596
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1595
02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:09.657
Hello.
We're home.

1596
02:00:09.823 --> 02:00:13.911
- Grandfather?
- I'll check the study.

1597
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:22.044
Hey, stranger.

1598
02:00:25.422 --> 02:00:29.218
Hey, Mom, did you know the Concorde
gets you here in half the time?

1599
02:00:29.385 --> 02:00:32.137
Yes, I-I've heard that.

1600
02:00:34.264 --> 02:00:36.934
Huh !
What are you doing here?

1601
02:00:37.059 --> 02:00:40.062
It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left...

1602
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:42.523
for us to realize we didn't
want to lose you two again.

1603
02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:45.234
We?

1604
02:00:48.362 --> 02:00:50.239
We.

1605
02:00:52.574 --> 02:00:55.369
I made the mistake of not coming
after you once, Lizzy.

1606
02:00:55.536 --> 02:01:00.040
I'm not going to do that again
no matter how brave you are.

1607
02:01:00.207 --> 02:01:04.420
And I suppose you just expect
me to go weak at the knees...

1608
02:01:04.586 --> 02:01:07.423
and fall into your arms and cry hysterically...

1609
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:11.260
and say we'll just figure this whole thing out-- a bicontinental relationship...

1610
02:01:11.427 --> 02:01:15.639
with our daughters being raised here an-and there and...

1611
02:01:15.806 --> 02:01:21.562
and you and I just... picking up where we left off, and--

1612
02:01:21.728 --> 02:01:24.648
and growing old together and--

1613
02:01:24.815 --> 02:01:26.650
and--

1614
02:01:26.817 --> 02:01:30.070
Come on, Nick.
What do you expect?

1615
02:01:30.237 --> 02:01:33.365
- To live happily ever after?
- Yes...

1616
02:01:33.532 --> 02:01:35.409
to all the above.

1617
02:01:35.576 --> 02:01:37.744
Except you don't have to cry hysterically.

1618
02:01:39.663 --> 02:01:41.498
Oh, yes, I do.

1619
02:02:19.119 --> 02:02:22.581
We actually did it.

1749
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:29,680
<i>This will be the one 
 I've waited for</i>

1750
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:31,480
<i>This will be</i>

1751
02:02:31,481 --> 02:02:37,320
<i>The first time anyone 
 has loved me</i>

1752
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:41,020
<i>I'm so glad you found me 
 in time</i>

1753
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:44,760
<i>And I'm so glad that 
 you rectified my mind</i>

1754
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:46,900
<i>This will be</i>

1755
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:50,630
<i>An everlasting love for me, 
 yeah</i>

1756
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:52,540
<i>Whoa</i>

1757
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:56,470
<i>Loving you 
 is some kind of wonderful</i>

1758
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:00,410
<i>Because you've shown me 
 just how much you care</i>

1759
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:03,780
<i>You've given me 
 the thrill of a lifetime</i>

1760
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:07,699
<i>And made me believe 
 you've got more thrills 
 to spare</i>

1761
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:09,720
<i>Oh, this will be</i>

1762
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:12,590
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1763
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,960
<i>Oh, yes, it will, now</i>

1764
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:23,030
<i>You've brought 
 a lot of sunshine into my life</i>

1765
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:26,840
<i>You've filled me 
 with happiness I never knew</i>

1766
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:29,970
<i>You gave me more joy 
 than I ever dreamed of</i>

1767
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:34,310
<i>And no one, no one 
 can take the place of you</i>

1768
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,980
<i>This will be</i>

1769
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,820
<i>You and me</i>

1770
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:39,850
<i>Yes, sirree</i>

1771
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:41,790
<i>Eternally</i>

1772
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,650
<i>Hugging and squeezing 
 and kissing and pleasing</i>

1773
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:45,720
<i>Together, forever, 
 through rain or whatever</i>

1774
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:49,030
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 you and me</i>

1775
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,060
<i>So long as I'm living, 
 true love I'll be giving</i>

1776
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:53,400
<i>To you I'll be serving 
 'cause you're so deserving</i>

1777
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:56,070
<i>Hey, you're so deserving</i>

1778
02:03:56,080 --> 02:04:05,710
<i>From now on</i>
