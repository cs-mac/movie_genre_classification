00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:27,376
- Who the fuck are you two?
- Jehovah's fucking Witnesses.

154
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,168
Keep your fucking mouth shut. You hear me?

155
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,501
You speak when you're
fucking spoken to. You get it?

156
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,084
- I said, do you fucking get it?
- Aye, aye, aye!

157
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,668
- Get the fuck out!
- Oh, a lady.

158
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:38,584
How old are you then, madam?

159
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,876
My father's a very well respected lawyer,
you know.

160
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,418
What does that make me then?

161
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,001
Very good. How old are we?

162
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:47,876
- Sixteen.
-ID?

163
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,876
No, you don't.

Please note, female is below

No relation to Conrad Donaldson QC
by any chance, are we?

167
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,543
Bingo.

00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:16,043
Please don't say anything.

171
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,126
What's it worth, Stephanie? A gam?

172
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,209
Can you imagine what his posh pals would say

173
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:29,918
if they found out that his wee princess
was riding all the low-life scum

174
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,668
he gets paid fortunes for to keep out the nick?

175
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,584
Do you want to do that to him?

Fucking hell! Jesus Christ!

Who taught you that technique?
A fucking cheese grater?

179
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,793
I've got a good mind to tell your daddy now
anyway after that poor excuse of an attempt.

180
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,376
Please, don't. That's not fucking fair!

It's not the best time to be inside

I make you right.
Still, he's only gonna do six months.

- Fair enough. Two years then.

- Hey, come on, now, boys, eh?
- Aye, eight would do it.

191
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,834
Then the poor cunt's life

Suppose this stoat-the-baw

that could help the law-abiding officers.

Nah, I'm not a grasser.

Right, see, Ocky, there's this one guy

Shouldn't really be inside a normal prison,
to be fair.

No, but the last time
he escaped from a mental institution

the local livestock bore
the brunt of his frustrations.

- Tore the horns clean off the poor bastard.

Ronnie says the only way
they can keep The Beast quiet

is by putting a new model
in his cell every few weeks.

- A model?
- Aye.

That's what Ronnie and all the boys call
the fresh-faced laddies they send him.

- Supposed to be a big fucker as well.
- Fuck off.

- Oh, yes!

That's it. Turn off my gas, Carole. Go.

Did you really mean what you said
about falling in love with me?

228
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:31,043
You're a fucking cow, do you know that?

229
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:36,751
We have been turning off the gas for
each other and you are a work mate's missus.

230
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,209
So, do you know what that makes you
in my book?

Do ya? It makes you a fucking cow.

232
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,418
- Why are you being like this?
- Because... Because, darlin',

233
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:47,834
you let me in here and you let me in there.

234
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,126
You don't let me in here.
And that's what love is.

235
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,668
What was all that? What was all that?
What was all that fucking good stuff, eh?

236
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,834
That was all just games, weren't it?
Sad, silly wee games.

237
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,168
A test if you will. A test which you
have sadly and miserably failed.

238
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:07,043
Why are you saying all this?
And why did you call me by your wife's name?

239
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,668
You said you loved me, not Carole.

240
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,668
I need you to take a good, long, hard think
about what feelings actually are, OK?

241
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,668
Because, if you want me to fix your head,
easy-peasy Japanesey,

242
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,543
but only you...only you can get in touch
with your heart.

243
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,001
- But, Bruce...
-if you want a fucking,

244
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,959
if you want a shagging
and a riding, I'm your man.

245
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:25,834
However, I've got to inform you,
I find all this just a little bit sordid.

246
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,543
And I can only imagine
how much this would hurt poor old Dougie

247
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,626
if he found out.
In his own fucking bed, Christ!

248
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,626
Bruce, please stay. We need to talk.

249
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,168
No! I am on a murder case here.

250
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,626
That's M-U-R-D-E-R,

251
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,459
which spells S-E-R-I-O-U-S.

252
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:47,543
So, if I don't get my A-R-S-E in G-E-A-R,
I am in serious S-H-I-T, OK?

253
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,376
You're being so cruel.

254
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,959
Love is cruel, Chrissie.

255
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,584
Love is cruel.

256
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,251
I think she's fucking somebody else
as well, Robbo.

257
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,501
No, no, no, no. (SHUSHING)

258
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:06,543
It's killing me because I can't even prove it.
Some detective me, eh?

259
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,751
Listen, listen, listen.

260
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,126
Your Chrissie is about as loyal as they come.

261
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,834
- Ah, fuck off.
- Come on, now. Come on.

262
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,584
And cheer the fuck up.

263
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,834
You know you're the favourite
for the Chief Inspector position?

264
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,668
You reckon?

265
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,959
Hey, you're lucky. Carole's great.

266
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,376
She's a real beauty as well.

267
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:31,418
Aye. I'd say you're right on that.

268
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,834
- You two still as happy as ever?
- Couldn't be happier.

269
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,334
- How old's...
-Seven. Stacey's seven.

270
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,459
Stacey, aye.

271
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,543
- Here are the lads.
- Gus.

272
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,168
Thank Christ.
Come on, sheriff's in town. Give us two.

273
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:50,334
Just the stuff, huh. That'll do nicely.

274
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,751
- And how's that wife of yours keeping then?
- Every day is Valentine's Day. (LAUGHS)

275
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,459
- And you'd be Cupid, aye?
- I'm the very boy, Robbo.

276
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:02,334
- Some man, some man.
- I'm the very boy.

277
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,501
Well, I'd better be going home then, boys.

278
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:11,043
Right enough. Take care of yourself then, pal.

279
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,126
What's up With him?

280
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,376
Never got a good word
to say about anybody, that guy.

281
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,334
Who, Dougie Gillman?

282
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,168
Stab you in the back
without even thinking about it.

283
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,334
Catholic, you see.

284
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:34,793
Saying that, look at young Ray Lennox there.
He's as Protestant as you and I, and yet...

285
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,668
Better no' say anything, actually. He's... Nah.

286
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,751
- Oh, no, go on, Robbo.
- No, he's a good boy, he's a good boy.

287
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,959
Oh, go on. Go on.

288
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,334
Do you see him in here?

289
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:49,209
I don't even have to look around
and I know that the answer is no.

290
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:52,459
It's 3/1, he's in that deviant wine bar

291
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:55,751
with the lesbian Amanda Drummond,
cooking up all sorts of shenanigans.

292
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,834
Oh, you're an awful man, Robbo.

293
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,959
What do you think the main topic
of conversation between them is gonna be?

294
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,209
You.

295
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,751
Maybe me.

296
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:09,459
Promotion. That's what, my friend.

297
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:12,543
You think young Lennox is running with
the hounds and hunting with the hares?

298
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,126
You said it, Gus.

299
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:16,918

you have to shag them regularly.

I wouldn't normally ask

they're all mouth and no trousers.

I know this guy, he's gonna like that.

00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:29,751
We'll nail this slimy bastard for you, Clifford,
no danger.

451
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,251
Bunty, we're gonna get him.
I can promise you that.

452
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,543
Now, I want you to look after
that brave, brave woman.

453
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,126
Oh, IWill, Bruce, lWill.

454
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:40,459
- I can't tell you how grateful I am, Bruce.
- Oh, you just thank your hubby here.

455
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,626
Low friends in high places, eh, Bladesey boy?

456
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,084
(SNORTING)

457
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,251
A quick word, sir?

458
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:14,001
Bruce. How goes the case?

459
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,418
- Aye, fairly cut and dried actually, Bob.
- Aye.

460
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:23,459
A well-known, nasty little mob have been
fingered by a willing informant, so it's...

461
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:24,626
New poster.

462
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:27,418
...just a case of gathering
the necessary evidence.

463
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:29,668
- Me and Gus are on surveillance.
- Good.

464
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:34,543
The political thing has died a death now
and the papers have got bored with it.

465
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:37,751
A wog's a wog for all that,
eh, Brother Robertson?

466
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:42,918
You said it, Brother Toal.
Your words, not mine. (CLEARS THROAT)

467
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,334
Right, about my cycling trip to Germany, sir.

468
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,043
Oh, I can't say I'm pulling handkerchiefs
out of my arse at the prospect

469
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:53,918
but I suppose a few days
won't put us too far behind.

470
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:57,126
What does Carole have to say
about you going away so close to Christmas?

471
00:28:57,209 --> 00:29:00,126
Oh, her and Stacey are just looking forward
to their big presents.

472
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:03,126
I always bring them back something nice,
so there's never any problem.

473
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,126
- You're the boss at home, then, Robbo?
- Man of the fucking house and all that.

474
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,043
(BOTH LAUGHING)

475
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,543
Quite. OK...

476
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:20,043
Just make sure you brief Amanda Drummond
before you go.

477
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:28,126
Do you really think she's got the balls
to take over the reins in my absence?

478
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,793
Think I'd rather hand temporary control
over to Gus Bain if you don't mind.

479
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:34,876
It's only for a short while
and she needs the experience anyway.

480
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,126
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:44,751
How the fuck did she ever get out of uniform?
By shagging Toal, that's how.

482
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,626
No!

483
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,876
See, every time
a woman drops her trousers, promotion.

484
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:51,751
Every time a man drops theirs,
disciplinary action.

485
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,168
Where's the equality in that?

486
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,043
Bingo! There's the fucker we're after.

487
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:02,834
No, no, just you wait there, Gus, OK?
No point going in mob-handed.

488
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,043
OK.

489
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:13,084
Wanna buy some flowers.

490
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:22,584
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

491
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,251
Can I help you, sir?

492
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,293
How's business?

493
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:29,793
All right, I suppose.

494
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,543
Really? I just seen a man
leave empty-handed.

495
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,001
- No' have anything in his line, no?
- No.

496
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,251
- Who was he?
- Just some guy after roses.

497
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,501
- I guess he changed his mind.
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:43,376
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

499
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:47,293
No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.

500
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,251
- What have I done wrong?
- Wasting police time,

501
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:52,209
withholding information
and possibly harbouring a murder suspect.

502
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,376
- That's shite.
- You will fucking cough up

503
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:58,126
or I swear to God you will be stuffing
cuddly toys in Corton Vale Prison

504
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,959
faster than you can tie
a bunch of fucking daffodils.

505
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:02,751
Or maybe...

506
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:07,251
maybe you would rather get your tulips
around my bulbs.

507

(GROANS)

508
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:11,001
Would you like that?

509
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:12,793
I think you would.

510
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:16,001
Look, he's just a guy I know from the clubs.

511
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,709
He comes in to talk about music and that is all.

512
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,376
So, are you and your wee boyfriend just
a two-man musical appreciation society then?

513
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,293
- Is that what you're fucking telling me?
- He's not my boyfriend, honest.

514
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:31,376
I hope not.

515
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,293
For his sake, you fat bastard.

516
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,751
- Watch where you're...
- Sorry.

517
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,793
Hello. Eh...

518
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,209
How are you?

519
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:50,209
Yeah, I'm just going to pick the flowers up.

520
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,084
- Oh, what, is the funeral today, aye?
- Yeah.

521
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:57,876
Right. Was that your wreath?
The one that says "Dad"?

522
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,001
- Yeah.
- Um...

523
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,001
How many kids have you got?

524
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,709
Just one, a wee boy.

525
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:14,668
You ever lost anyone close?

526
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,376
Mmm-hmm.

00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,376

Listen, I've got to go.
I'm really sorry, I've got to go.

Ah, Bruce, I hear you have a pain, yes?

539
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,584
Oh, a pain indeed, Doctor.

540
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,168
And would this pain be
one of your physical pains, yes?

541

No, Doctor, my other kind.

Well, the final destination
of the pain recovery train

543
00:33:57,376 --> 00:34:00,168
is self-help via abstinence, Bruce, eh?

I've already booked my seat in advance.
Super-saver all the same.

No more cocaine and chip suppers
for Bruce, eh?

546
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:10,126
Oh, those items were previously favourites
of the Detective Sergeant,

547
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,418
of course they were.

548
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:14,793
And what of this promotion, eh?

549
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,209
A mere formality, I'm sure.

550

Only champions can rewrite history, yes?

551
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,793
Yes, I've always believed that it's the winning
that's important, not the taking part.

552
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:29,376
Only winners are more attractive
to the opposite sex, Bruce, eh?

553
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:34,084
Like our successful friend here, the tapeworm.

- Yes?
-(CHUCKLES)

Why, no one, of course.

Not your friends, not your family,
not even yourself, Bruce.

Especially not yourself, eh?

questions your sexuality.

It's silly.

Oh, come on, man.
You elected me your union representative

in this outrageous manner any longer.

No, no, you're all right, Bruce.
I'll just go and clean it off.

- And I just hope...

and see some more of this disgusting graffiti

- What, sir?

You're gonna have to be careful
what you say here, sir.

Is he?

591
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:45,209
Whether he is or isn't
is entirely his own business,

for it is these days.

is his own business.

that much about the chap, but... Oh.

your mother wouldn't.

I only do it for love now, son.

this is the boy for the job.

as a young stallion, aren't you, pal, eh?

00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:23,751
Right, we'd better be off-ski.
We've got the Christmas party.

- Thank you.
- Thanks very much, son.

621

I tell you, Gus,
this is the only kind of networking

624

Edith and I, we're actually thinking of going to
Sri Lanka next year for our holidays.

I remember when I used to work in Sydney,
we played this party game at the crimbo party.

629
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:03,209
What was that, then?

- OK, then, Raymondo.

635

to the photocopying room.

No offence if that's your thing.

And what we'd do is we would photocopy
an image of our wedding tackle.

GUS: Oh, I just knew what was going on here!

639
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:37,001
And then one of the sheilas
would pin it to a notice board.

640
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:41,084
It'd then be up to the lassies to match the
male member with the corresponding owner.

it was that kind of scene.

Well, I'm gonna have to consider my position
on that one, Bob.

the moment with this murder case nuisance.

On top of that, not only is there
a latent Nazi racist homophobe

How can you have confidence in a man who
is constantly undressing you with his eyes,

masturbating over images of you?

need not imply an attitude of misogyny.

-while only 50% of homosexual couples do.

It's all fucking bullshit
cos I read this article, proper, medical.

695
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:27,793
It says that white women, right,
are 10 times more likely

696

to give blowjobs than black women.

who they're referring to

As you obviously know, Bruce,

Amanda took a lead role
in the murder investigation in your absence.

762
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:02,959
I have decided after some deliberation
that this should remain the case.

You have got to be fucking joking me!

Since you've been away
the media have taken an interest again.

that Amanda here is strong in.

Amanda, can you please brief Bruce
on the latest developments?

Yes, Bob.

OK, then, Mandy, fire away.

Enough with the idle banter.
Shall we crack on with the case?

779

Maybe start by finding this blonde witness
you forgot to tell us about.

I wanted to thank you personally

Aye. Aye, well, I just wish
I could have done more to help him.

He helped when the others
just stood back and watched.

He's a fine man, son.

about the chang to anybody, you know?

1063
01:09:51,168 --> 01:09:52,918
Fuck off, Drummond.

1064
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:55,584
- You can say it's none of my business.
-It's none of your fucking business!

1065
01:09:55,668 --> 01:09:56,918
What were you doing
in the women's toilets, Bruce?

1066
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:58,001
Look, I'm sorry.

1067
01:09:58,084 --> 01:10:01,334
I'm just feeling a bit wrong
at the moment. OK?

1068
01:10:01,418 --> 01:10:03,293
OK, well, if you want to talk about it,
then I'm here.

1069
01:10:03,376 --> 01:10:07,334
Spare me your airy-fairy,
namby-pamby, care-in-the-community,

1070
01:10:07,418 --> 01:10:09,418
human-resources, left-wing bullshit.

1071
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,293
Well, I'm just worried about you, Bruce.

1072
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:15,918
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm worried about you, Bruce.

1073
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:18,001
Oh, right, I see. You're worried about me.

1074
01:10:18,168 --> 01:10:20,709
What? Oh, don't flatter yourself.

1075
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:24,376
- I think you're a silly, silly, little, little man.
- You fancy me.

1076
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:28,001
I have no interest in you,
apart from us having to work together.

1077
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:30,918
- Just give in to your instincts, darling.
- Oh, God, you're pathetic.

1078
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,001
- You're pathetic. You're an alcoholic.
- Fuck off.

1079
01:10:33,084 --> 01:10:35,668
You stink.
Do you know what, Bruce?

1080
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:40,001
You're the kind of sad case
that preys on weak, stupid women

1081
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:42,584
in order to boost your own shattered ego!

1082
01:10:42,668 --> 01:10:44,501
What about Karen the other night
at the Christmas party?

1083
01:10:44,959 --> 01:10:46,709
She was wasted, Bruce.

1084
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:49,209
Well, she shouldnae have
fucking drunk then, should she?

1085
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:50,918
She wanted a drink, so she had one.

1086
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:52,918
She wanted a ride,
so she had one of them as well.

1087
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,293
So, don't treat me like a fucking rapist!

1088
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,126
Jesus Christ,
what are you so interested in her for anyway?

1089
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:01,543
- Are you a lesbian?
- I'm not a bloody lesbian, Bruce.

1090
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:04,709
I have a boyfriend
and he's far younger than you

1091
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,709
and he's far more intelligent than you

1092
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:10,626
and he's far better endowed than you,
Mr Photocopier Enlargement.

1093
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,126
What did you fucking say?

1094
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:15,876
Go on, fucking hit me, Bruce!
Are you gonna hit me, Bruce? Yeah?

1095
01:11:20,668 --> 01:11:21,709
No.

1096
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:28,584
Oh, my darling, I'm sorry.

1097
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,959
- You sicken me.
-(SCOFFS)

1098
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:35,084
You repulse me.
Can I make that any fucking plainer?

1099
01:11:42,293 --> 01:11:44,751
I wasn't gonna hurt you, you know?

1100
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:48,418
I didn't mean it.

1101
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,209
As your colleague...

1102
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:08,584
...and as a human being, I'm telling you,
Bruce, you've got some stuff to sort out.

1103
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:14,084
OK? Then you might become
the sort of person

1104
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,543
that you seem to imagine yourself to be,

1105
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,668
although Christ only knows what that is.

1106
01:12:19,584 --> 01:12:22,209
I used to be good at this job, Amanda.

1107
01:12:25,918 --> 01:12:27,501
I used to be a good person.

1108
01:12:28,418 --> 01:12:30,334
Yeah. I heard that.

1109
01:12:33,793 --> 01:12:36,709
- Have you got a wife, Bruce?
- Yeah.

1110
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:40,876
Have you got any kids?

1111
01:12:41,001 --> 01:12:42,584
Stacey.

1112
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:49,168
I think they've left me.

1113
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:54,918
I think my family have left me.

1114
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,251
I don't know how.

1115
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:06,876
I can't remember why.

1116
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:09,668
OK.

1117
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:14,834
You see, there's something wrong with me.

1118
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,084
There's something seriously wrong with me.

1119
01:13:21,709 --> 01:13:26,084
Have you spoken to anyone?
Have you been to see a doctor?

1120
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:28,001
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1121
01:13:28,793 --> 01:13:29,793
No.

1122
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:34,126
I don't know. I don't know.

1123
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:39,751
No, I'm in charge.

1124
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:42,959
I'm in charge of me.

1125
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:45,251
I'm in charge of me.

1126
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:48,293
I'm in charge of this investigation
and don't you ever fucking forget that.

1127
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:51,709
OK, Bruce. You need to listen to me.
Can you hear me?

1128
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:56,584
I'm really worried about you.
I don't think you're fit for work at the moment.

1129
01:13:56,709 --> 01:14:00,501
Just you go up there
and suck someone's cock

1130
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:06,168
and stop playing the amateur fucking
psychologist, you evil witch!

1131
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:13,709
Hey, Robbo.

1132
01:14:13,793 --> 01:14:15,959
Are you holding a guy
by the name of Clifford Blades?

1133
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,501
Do you ever get the impression
he was a pervert?

1134
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,751
Just give me the fucking keys!

1135
01:14:24,959 --> 01:14:28,209
- You piss-taking little fart!
- What's wrong, Bruce?

1136
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:31,501
You strung me along from the fucking start!
Didn't you?

1137
01:14:31,584 --> 01:14:33,709
It wasn't me.
You have to believe it wasn't me.

1138
01:14:33,793 --> 01:14:36,251
Don't make me punch your face
through your shoulders

1139
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:39,126
and out through your fucking arse,
you speccy wee fanny!

1140
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:41,709
Why? Why did you drag me into this, Cliff?

1141
01:14:41,793 --> 01:14:45,293
Why did you drag me into this with you?
You're supposed to be my mate.

1142
01:14:45,376 --> 01:14:47,376
I didn't. We are mates, Bruce.

1143
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:50,084
You're my best friend, Bruce.
You're my best friend.

1144
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:58,793
Why do you bully me, Bruce?

1145
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:02,709
- What?
- Why do you do it?

1146
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,584
Because“.

1147
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:11,001
Because I can't fucking help myself.

1148
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:16,001
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

1149
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:17,834
Bruce! Bruce!

1150
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:22,168
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
-(SHOUTING)

1151
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:30,418
Fuck!

1152
01:15:31,168 --> 01:15:34,334
I tried to call you at work.
Where have you been?

1153
01:15:35,376 --> 01:15:37,959
- Bruce, Dougie's in hospital.
- And?

1154
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:40,126
He tried to kill himself.

1155
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:41,793
Slashed his wrists.

1156
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:45,918
He found out about us, Bruce.

1157
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,293
Couldn't take the humiliation of that
and getting suspended.

1158
01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:50,084
How's that my fault? That's all your fault!

1159
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:54,168
My God, this place fucking stinks.

1160
01:15:54,293 --> 01:15:55,793
I just need you to fucking leave!

1161
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,084
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

1162
01:15:57,209 --> 01:15:59,293
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, don't. Chrissie.

1163
01:15:59,418 --> 01:16:02,584
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, I need you to leave!

1164
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:10,001
Come on!
I wanna turn off the fucking gas for you!

1165
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,793
Fucking...

1166
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:17,418
Come on, get fucking hard, you silly wee poof!
Come on, get it in!

1167
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:19,793
Fuck me with that mouse's cock.

1168
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:22,793
(GRUNTING)

1169

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1170
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:34,293
What's wrong?
You're crying like a wee laddie.

1171
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:39,459
You're no fun any more, Bruce.
You know that?

1172
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:42,293
I'm not well.

1173
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:44,501
What's wrong with you, man?

1174
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:48,918
I hear voices, Chrissie.

1175
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:54,501
I see things, all the time.

1176
01:16:56,793 --> 01:16:58,918
Do you ever hear them?

1177
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:01,418
What are you on about?

1178
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:04,793
Whatever it is you're taking,
you wanna lay off it.

1179
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:09,293
Life's cruel, Bruce. Life's cruel.

1180

Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on, right.
Wait a minute.

- Fuck.
- He saw us do the gook, for fuck's sake!

But dead cunts tell no tales.

We can torch the place with the pig in it.
Or what's left of him.

Smokey bacon, man.
