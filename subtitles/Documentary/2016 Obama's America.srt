00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,004
(Episode 1711)

4
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:16,514
This is Entertainment Weekly, and I am Shin Hyun Joon.

5
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,244
Hello, I am Jung Ji Won.

6
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,713
It's Friday night of the first week in April.

7
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:26,724
This week, many things happened...

8
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,454
in the entertainment world.

9
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,854
Among them was the performances held by South Korean artists...

10
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:34,893
on the 1st and 3rd in Pyongyang to promote peaceful cooperation...

11
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:37,293
between North and South Korea.

12
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:40,164
Right. I was really touched watching their performance yesterday.

13
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,734
We'll talk about it today, right?

14
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:45,304
Yes. We'll see them united by music in a bit.

15
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:47,744
All right. Here's the first news.

16
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,513
Anchor Kim Sun Keun prepared it.

17
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,314
This Week's Hot Click.

18
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:53,643
The late Jang Ja Yeon case...

19
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,484
and the suicide of the sisters who were extras,

20
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:56,713
are being reinvestigated.

21
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:59,213
Entertainment Weekly will report on these cases.

22
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:02,554
We'll report on Kim Saeng Min's sexual harassment case...

23
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,194
and Kim Heung Kook's police investigation...

24
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:08,664
for his sexual harassment allegations as well.

25
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:14,034
The disclosure that Kim Saeng Min committed sexual harassment...

26
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,604
in the past has shocked the nation.

27
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:21,004
The controversy started with a media report on Monday.

28
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,244
(Ms. A claims to have been sexually harassed 10 years ago.)

29
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:25,343
The media exclusively reported an interview with Ms. A,

30
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:27,914
who claims that Saeng Min sexually harassed her 10 years ago.

31
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:31,554
(He put his arms around me. I pushed him, but it was useless.)

32
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:35,623
(No matter how much I resisted I couldn't beat his strength.)

33
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:40,164
The report says that on a day of a get-together for a program,

34
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:42,994
two victims were sexually harassed,

35
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:47,463
and Ms. A, the informant, didn't get an apology from him.

36
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:51,433
Right after the report, Kim's agency officially announced...

37
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,744
that he admits what happened and apologizes.

38
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:57,914
However, as he had an honest and hard working image more than anyone,

39
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:02,284
the disclosure this time was a big shock to the public.

40
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,884
After that, the criticism towards Kim did not stop.

41
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,923
The public opinion wanted him to drop out of all the shows he's in,

42
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:15,263
and on last Tuesday, the next day after the report,

43
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:18,194
he clarified his official position that he would resign...

44
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,263
from every program he's in now.

45
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,803
The programs that he is currently on also announced that...

46
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,534
on top of his resignation, the programs will be stopped,

47
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,273
edited, or pre-empted.

48
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:32,273
Kim has long been working as a reporter in Entertainment Weekly.

49
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,314
After the controversy, he stated that he would resign.

50
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,714
Entertainment Weekly accepted his opinion,

51
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:39,953
and decided to have him step down from the program.

52
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,053
(Saeng Min also resigned from Entertainment Weekly.)

53
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:46,263
He had his first glory day since his debut, 25 years ago.

54
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,993
His flower road lasted only for six months.

55
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,263
His wrongdoing 10 years ago caught up with him.

56
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:55,404
It seemed that he would drive on without a stop,

57
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:59,604
but he resigned from every show his heyday was over so suddenly.

58
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,613
In addition, as he decided to stop working due to a scandal,

59
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:07,684
his responsibility on dozens of commercials he had appeared in...

60
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,513
before the controversy remains.

61
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:13,154
Saeng Min admitted that he committed sexual harassment...

62
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:16,053
and apologized to the victim and the public.

63
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:19,423
All eyes are on his position now.

64
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,694
Last Monday, the Committee on Past Affairs of prosecution...

65
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:26,863
selected the late Jang Ja Yeon case...

66
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,634
and the suicide of the sisters who were extras...

67
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,404
to be reinvestigated.

68
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:36,513
Nine years ago, the late Jang Ja Yeon committed suicide...

69
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:39,073
after leaving a note saying she gave sexual favors to figures...

70
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,284
in the financial and the media world.

71
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:46,483
In regard to all suspicions concerning the late Jang Ja Yeon,

72
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:51,854
we'll make a thorough investigation and get to the bottom of the matter.

73
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:54,823
During the initial investigation, the police said they would...

74
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:57,694
do a thorough investigation regardless of one's rank.

75
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,733
However,

76
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:02,404
It was hard to investigate him as his wife was a prosecutor.

77
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:04,374
He wouldn't make an appearance.

78
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,344
The investigation on influential people beat around the bush.

79
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:12,143
Including a journalist who said he mistook Ja Yeon as a hostess,

80
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,983
many of those under suspicion...

81
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,414
were not reinvestigated or cross-examined at all.

82
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,983
There are people whom we didn't investigate.

83
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:23,253
From A's testimony, we found nothing to investigate those people.

84
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,324
That's why we didn't investigate them.

85
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,824
The investigator kept changing his words.

86
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,863
Thus resulting in suspicion that he was pressured to close the case.

87
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,433
I admit it was my fault.

88
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,733
Many of you are suspicious that I received pressure...

89
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,534
for changing my statement from what I had said earlier,

90
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:37,904
but it's not true at all.

91
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,443
So, there was a controversy on the poor investigation on the case.

92
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,474
The public was resentful.

93
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:46,284
Finally, all of those charged for receiving sexual favor...

94
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,813
were cleared of the charges, and the case was closed.

95
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:53,253
The case was exempted from the prior investigation last February.

96
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,493
But as the public gained interest due to the MeToo Campaign,

97
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:00,623
it was selected as a subject of the secondary investigation.

98
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:01,724
(228,798 people participated in the petition.)

99
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:06,164
The Committee on Past Affairs stated that they will find out...

100
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,264
if there was a problem with the conclusion that...

101
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,334
the former CEO was not guilty of coercion,

102
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:13,503
and whether or not there was pressure on the investigation.

103
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:18,813
Then can the Committee on Past Affairs exercise legal punishment?

104
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,383
A lot amount of time has passed,

105
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,883
so statute of limitations is an issue.

106
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:26,183
Also, it will be hard to get evidence to support the case.

107
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,024
However, depending which crime the investigation identifies,

108
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:32,623
the statute of limitations can be different.

109
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:36,034
Regarding the law on punishment of assisting prostitution,

110
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:39,094
if the prostitution was utilized by relationships of employment...

111
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:40,764
or forced by assault or threat,

112
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,204
one can be sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.

113
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,173
Thus, the statute of limitations is 10 years.

114
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,303
As the statute of limitations is not over in this case,

115
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,543
the possibility of a criminal charge still exists.

116
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:54,014
The public is keeping their eye on whether the truth behind...

117
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:57,914
her decision to end her life in 2009 will be revealed.

118
00:05:57,914 --> 00:05:58,914
(What is the truth?)

119
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,454
Please sign the petition.

120
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:05,193
There's another case that came to the fore with MeToo campaign,

121
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,594
It's the suicide case of the sisters who were extras.

122
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:13,464
Ms. A was recommended to work as a movie extra by her sister,

123
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,464
and began working 14 years ago.

124
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,104
According to Ms. A's record at that time,

125
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:21,704
from July 2004, when the shooting started, to November 2004,

126
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,743
the casting manager and assistant team leader who managed extras...

127
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,613
raped and sexually harassed her frequently.

128
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:29,613
(They sexually assaulted me.)

129
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:33,784
She would hit and break things, so the police came...

130
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,224
and committed her to a mental hospital.

131
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:40,423
After she was hospitalized, she said she was raped...

132
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:42,693
and sexually assaulted.

133
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,894
After Ms. A's mother found out the truth,

134
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,363
she filed a lawsuit against 12 people...

135
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,233
for rape and indecent act by compulsion.

136
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,633
However, the inflictors insisted Ms. A consented to it,

137
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:55,043
and it was not a crime by compulsion.

138
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,113
(I cannot live anymore.)

139
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,914
And after that, Ms. A could not endure her situation...

140
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,014
and made an irreversible choice.

141
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:02,813
(Ms. A's sister committed suicide six days after her death.)

142
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:06,053
After Ms. A's death, her sister who recommended the extra work to her...

143
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:09,423
committed suicide six days after she died.

144
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,524
(The dispute on police's poor investigation was brought up.)

145
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:13,894
When it was revealed that there was a cross-examination...

146
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:16,293
between the victim and the assailant,

147
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,334
there was controversy that it was poorly investigated.

148
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,904
This was the court ruling at the time.

149
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,563
They stated that when reviewing the many witness testimonies...

150
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,274
and the investigations of the assailants...

151
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,844
there was a possibility for rape and indecent act by compulsion.

152
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:29,613
(It is possible she was sexually assaulted by compulsion at work.)

153
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:33,784
However, the court ruled against Ms. A's mother, and she lost.

154
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:37,954
Last Monday, the committee announced the reinvestigation.

155
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:42,183
The police recently organized an investigation team...

156
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,623
to find out the truth behind the sisters' suicide.

157
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,193
(Dismiss the statute of limitations. Please find the truth.)

158
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:48,464
With a reliable investigation,

159
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,894
there shouldn't be any more unfair deaths in the entertainment world.

160
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,764
I haven't committed sexual harassment or assault.

161
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,933
I have nothing on my conscience. I will answer everything.

162
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:02,743
Kim Heung Kook was investigated by the police...

163
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,214
after charges were made against him for sexual assault charges.

164
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:08,284
(Kim Heung Kook was summoned and investigated by the police.)

165
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,553
Suspicions of his sexual assault...

166
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,024
has turned into a war of disclosing truths.

167
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,954
He was summoned for the first investigation...

168
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,594
two weeks after the complaint was filed.

169
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:22,264
He walked into the police station with a grim face.

170
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,863
We got to hear how he felt at the moment.

171
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,664
I apologize to all of my fans.

172
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,104
I am also very sorry for my beloved family.

173
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:34,903
My family...

174
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,643
suffered so much,

175
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:42,753
and I had to leave the industry overnight. It just feels...

176
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,623
I hope the truth gets disclosed today,

177
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:53,993
and I would like to recover my honor as soon as possible.

178
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,194
I truly apologize.

179
00:08:57,434 --> 00:09:01,033
He also strongly denied his charges of sexual assault.

180
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,104
I have a lot evidence...

181
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:05,133
and witnesses.

182
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,574
I really did not live to deserve something like this.

183
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:11,873
I have no idea why this is happening to me.

184
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,143
It's really heartbreaking.

185
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,483
After Heung Kook left for his questioning,

186
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,783
Ms. A's attorney also came forward...

187
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:23,194
in front of the reporters.

188
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:24,594
(The victim's attorney came forward.)

189
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:26,294
Mr. Kim has not once...

190
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:28,623
apologized to the victim...

191
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:31,133
and insists that he did nothing wrong.

192
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,334
The victim wants him to look back on himself...

193
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:37,003
and to sincerely make an apology to her.

194
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:40,104
The victim, Ms. A claimed through a news media...

195
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:43,913
that she was sexually assaulted twice by Mr. Kim at the end of 2016.

196
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,013
She accused him of rape, quasi-rape,

197
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,684
and defamation through printed media.

198
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:52,783
Then Heung Kook denied the charges and filed a suit against her...

199
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:55,523
for defamation and calumny,

200
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:57,794
and prepared himself for a legal battle.

201
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:01,363
Last Tuesday, Mr. B, someone who claimed to be Mr. Kim's old friend,

202
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:04,294
disclosed his sexual harassment once again in an interview...

203
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,363
and shocked everyone once again.

204
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,533
He disclosed many sexual harassments...

205
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,733
that Heung Kook has committed over the years.

206
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:15,544
The first incidents were back in 2002 and 2006 World Cup.

207
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:18,643
He said he used the festive mood to molest women...

208
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:21,483
while everyone was cheering for the Korean team.

209
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:26,013
The next incident happened in 2012,

210
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,724
when he molested a part-timer at his cafe,

211
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,393
and the victim's parents ended up...

212
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,464
coming to the cafe to complain.

213
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,763
Heung Kook claimed the disclosure was absurd,

214
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:39,403
and he has completely denied the allegations.

215
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,104
He claimed to know who the informant is...

216
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:45,304
and said he made up this story out of personal spite.

217
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,273
He argued that none of this is true.

218
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,743
("Claim Done Out of Personal Spite", "Heung Kook Denies Molesting Women")

219
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:53,643
We had a chance to hear more from him...

220
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:56,013
as he walked out from his questioning.

221
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:59,084
I told everything...

222
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,324
to the investigator.

223
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:03,054
I had nothing on my conscience,

224
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,653
and I told them everything.

225
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,964
I want to regain my honor as soon as possible,

226
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,064
and I want to sing and be on TV again.

227
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:13,663
What do you think about additional disclosure from your friend?

228
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,273
That's not even worth refuting.

229
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,334
I think that guy...

230
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,344
turned off his phone and ran away.

231
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,373
It's a scheme that...

232
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,714
he plotted with someone...

233
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,814
to hurt me.

234
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,143
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

235
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:32,153
I really feel sorry for my family...

236
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:33,854
and my fans.

237
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:36,324
I hope something like this would never happen again.

238
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,824
Thank you.

239
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:40,623
The charges against him of rape...

240
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:42,523
along with additional disclosure of sexual molestation...

241
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:45,564
are now in the hands of the legal system.

242
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:49,434
There is much attention given to the result of this case.

243
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:55,243
You can't do this. You'll make me look really weird.

244
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:58,814
Actor Lee Jong Soo is charged with fraud.

245
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,913
On March 28th, one internet news outlet...

246
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:05,653
reported that Lee is facing a lawsuit for fraud.

247
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,983
His charges were as follows.

248
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:13,564
Mr. A asked Lee to preside over his wedding...

249
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:17,533
and sent him 850 dollars for the presiding cost.

250
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,804
However, Jong Soo did not appear on the day of the wedding,

251
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:24,474
and Mr. A filed a suit against him for fraud.

252
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,003
This case was resolved when someone from his agency...

253
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,474
came out and paid for the damage on his behalf on the 2nd.

254
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,913
However, Lee was nowhere to be seen even after he was charged.

("Lee Will Not Get Any Support", "Lee Has Been Gone for a Week")

256
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,153
Last Tuesday,

257
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:42,283
another man came forward and claimed Jong Soo swindled him.

258
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,454
(Mr. B claims Lee borrowed 30,000 dollars for business.)

259
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:47,064
According to Mr. B, Jong Soo borrowed...

260
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,393
30,000 dollars from him for his business.

261
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:53,363
He said he'd pay back 10,000 dollars a month but did not.

262
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,903
Also, an eyewitness said they saw Jong Soo...

263
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,474
on a flight to Los Angeles.

264
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,474
(A witness saw Lee on a flight to Los Angeles.)

265
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,613
On the 21st, a news outlet said he was reportedly seen...

266
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,544
at a Korean restaurant in Los Angeles.

267
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:10,113
He has been off the grid for over a week.

("Lee Apologizes and Claims He Is Not a Con Man")

270
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,824
Last Tuesday, a news outlet reported...

271
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:17,954
on what Lee said to his agency when he contacted them.

272
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:20,724
Lee apologized to the agency...

273
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:24,334
and showed frustration for all the rumors about him.

274
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,834
His agent said it's true...

275
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,033
that Mr. Lee borrowed 30,000 dollars from Mr. B back in 2017.

276
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,204
She also said he has been paying the interest and principal back,

277
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,804
and showed his bank account statement.

278
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,544
(His agency showed his bank account statement.)

279
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:40,513
Jong Soo's anxiety could be seen...

280
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,714
in the second email that he sent.

281
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,554
They decided to take legal actions for any rumors.

282
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,983
We will keep our eyes on this to see how the case will be resolved.

283

Actor Oh Soon Tek﻿, one of the first Korean actors to work in Hollywood,

284
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:57,594
has passed away at the age of 84.

285
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:03,273
We heard of this news yesterday.

286
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:07,704
He passed away at his home in Los Angeles due to chronic disease.

287
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,174
I came to the US because I thought...

288
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,944
it would be great if I can...

289
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,354
study film here.

290
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,684
In 1959, he moved to the US at the age of 25...

291
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:23,954
and made his career in Hollywood and Broadway for a long time.

292
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,694
He is also remembered as the first Korean actor...

293
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,824
to have made his career in Hollywood.

294
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:33,003
He starred on the movie, "The Man with the Golden Gun"...

295
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,104
and many other movies, dramas, and plays,

296
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:38,403
starring in over 200 pieces of work, regardless of the genre.

297
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,844
He was the go-to Asian actor...

298
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:43,044
in Hollywood during the 70s and the 80s.

299
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,613
He returned to Korea in the early 2000s...

300
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,013
to teach his juniors at a university...

301
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,424
and shared his experience with them.

302
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:57,054
Although he has left us, the great actor Oh Soon Tek...

303
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,924
will be remembered through his works.

304
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:01,424
Rest in peace.

305
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,794
(Rest in peace.)

306

00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,944
Let's continue with other news.

308
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:17,044
Ji Yeon and Tae Jin have prepared our next segments.

309
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,783
It's our special segment time,

310
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,513
titled Korea's Favorite 100 Dance Artists.

311

We're going to begin with the 30th singer today.

312
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:27,354
It'll be fun and interesting. Please stay tuned.

313
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,993
Before we go into that, on April 1st, April Fool's Day,

314
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,523
something unreal happened.

315
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:34,794
Some Korean stars have performed in Pyongyang.

316
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:38,564
It's been 16 years since South Koreans performed there.

317
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,233
It was a meaningful moment,

318
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,704
so we went out and asked them for behind-the-scene stories...

319
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,934
and captured their arrival as well.

320
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,444
Let's watch.

321
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,743
(The 31st of last month, Gimpo International Airport)

322
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:51,814
This was March 31st.

323
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:54,243
Amazing celebrities have gathered together...

324
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,253
to go perform at Pyongyang.

325
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,554
There are many legendary seniors...

326
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:02,483
who will be going with us.

327
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,993
(April 1st, the first performance in 16 years,)

328
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,224
(Entertainment Weekly made a review for you.)

329
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,993
(Are you ready? Do not even blink.)

330
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:13,263
(Legendary artists have gathered together for this.)

331
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,373
The king of singers, Cho Yong Pil.

332
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:18,873
The queen of ballads, Baek Z Young.

333
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,643
The hottest girl group, Red Velvet.

334
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,383
What happened in Pyongyang with these amazing artists?

335
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:29,513
Let's find out.

336
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,454
(An in-depth report on what happened in Pyongyang)

337
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:35,454
We rushed over to the airport when we heard...

338
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,594
the performance team was coming home on the fourth.

339
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:43,064
The South Korean performance team is coming back to South Korea.

340
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:46,533
They were scheduled to arrive at 1:21am,

341
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,564
but it's been delayed for over an hour.

342
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,733
And it got delayed even longer.

343
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,174
Please come quickly.

344
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,304
It's been delayed once again to 3am.

345
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:57,074
They'll arrive at 3:51am.

346
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:59,074
It must be my name. Ji Yeon means "delayed".

347
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:00,383
(Ji Yeon looks worn out from the delay.)

348
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:04,213
All of the reporters, as well as the fans,

349
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,423
began to grow weary.

350
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:09,653
That's when the performance team finally arrived.

351
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,494
Unlike when they left,

352
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:14,524
- they looked very close. - It was really fun.

353
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,433
It's an unforgettable experience.

354
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:19,363
I was very thankful.

355
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:20,933
How was it during the performance?

356
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,274
Yes, it was really touching.

357
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:26,074
It was almost unbelievable...

358
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,804
how everything ended in a very friendly way.

359
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,143
Any thoughts?

360
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,913
It was a great journey.

361
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,943
Thank you.

362
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:37,284
The hottest star of the day was definitely Cho Yong Pil.

363
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,854
Everyone did well. It was good.

364
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:44,153
I was the worst performer.

365
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:48,494
Even Yong Pil praised the performance at Pyongyang.

366
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:51,163
What kind of performance were given there?

367
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,304
That's why we prepared this. Pyongyang performance at a glance.

368
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,703
(A North Korean performance team visited South Korea last February.)

369
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,074
Last February, to celebrate the Winter Olympics,

370
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:03,413
a North Korean performance team visited South Korea.

371
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,913
In return, an event that sounds too good to be true...

372
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,413
took place on April Fools' Day.

373
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:11,854
The host of this peace-offering event...

374
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:12,854
was Seo Hyun of Girls' Generation.

375
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,653
I am the host...

376
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:17,393
of this meaningful event.

377
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:18,524
Hello, everyone.

378
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:23,693
Performing next were two singers with captivating voices.

379
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,734
It was Jung In and ALi.

380
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:31,703
(Jung In and ALi show off their captivating voices.)

381
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,314
Baek Z Young delivered an emotional performance...

382
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,943
of "Like Being Hit By A Bullet", which is the most favored song...

383
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,643
of university students in Pyongyang.

384
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:43,713
(The most favored song of Pyongyang students.)

385
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:45,713
Due to its shocking title and lyrics,

386
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,423
the song and its singer received a lot of attention.

387
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:51,024
(Kim Jong Un showed special interest in the song.)

388
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,494
My parents...

389
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,334
have passed away.

390
00:18:56,534 --> 00:19:01,403
However, they're buried in South Hamgyeong Province.

391
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:05,234
Kang San Eh...

392
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:08,443
moved everyone by singing "Raguyo,

393
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,744
the song that portrays the yearning he has for his father.

394
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:17,014
(Oh, how I wish to be able to go there at least just once)

395
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,123
I kept picturing my mother.

396
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,794
On stage,

397
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:29,534
there were a few moments when I had to focus very hard...

398
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,094
to not think about her.

399
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,564
Rock and roll also resonated in Pyongyang.

400
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,604
YB took the stage next.

401
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:37,734
(YB, South Korea's best rock band)

402
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,143
Cho Yong Pil,

403
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:43,373
the legendary artist who held a concert in Pyongyang 13 years ago,

404
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:45,814
and Choi Jin Hee,

405
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:47,413
who is loved equally in the North and South took the stage.

406
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,044
The crowd went wild for them.

407
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:52,514
This marks Ms. Choi's fourth performance in North Korea.

408
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,494
She was asked to perform "A Belated Regret" by the North,

409
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:00,064
and the song became a hit too in the South afterwards.

410
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:03,933
We met with her personally right after she got back.

411
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,133
("A Belated Regret" was re-released after 33 years.)

412
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:07,163
"A Belated Regret"...

413
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:10,873
topped the search engine ranking for quite some time.

414
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,304
So I heard.

415
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,903
While I was in North Korea,

416
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:16,973
I was too busy getting ready for the show...

417
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,643
to know what was happening.

418
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,814
I'm curious as to how it was like meeting Kim Jung Un.

419
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:24,854
What is he like and are there any anecdotes?

420
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,153
He mentioned my song, "A Belated Regret".

421
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,494
He said he enjoyed it.

422
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,054
(She made quite an impression with her captivating voice.)

423
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,663
He was impressed, and he thanked me.

424
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:37,534
I'm sure it felt different to perform there.

425
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:40,663
The audience clapped and cheered...

426
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:41,834
which I found astonishing.

427
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,403
They've never been like that before.

428
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:47,373
So what was it like back in the day?

429
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,074
Here are some of the past performances.

430
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,443
There was a group who showcased a shocking song and style.

431
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,413
It was the charismatic Baby V.O.X.

432
00:20:57,054 --> 00:21:00,284
Shinhwa who attended the concert in 2003...

433
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:02,754
were victims of the non-responsive crowd.

434
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:04,423
Back then,

435
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:07,723
we showcased a dance song and a powerful choreography.

436
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:09,794
Let's take a look.

437
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,264
My gosh. Could the air be any colder?

438
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:13,963
(Shinhwa's performance in North Korea)

439
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,133
The audience seem to be very shy.

440
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,504
Here's the anecdote that even caught CNN's attention.

441
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,344
In 2002, YB heard this...

442
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:24,713
when they first arrived at the airport in Pyongyang.

443
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,044
(YB visited North Korea in 2002.)

444
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:28,883
The band was close to being banned from the stage,

445
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:32,014
but Heo Jun became the first Asian to be on a North Korean TV show...

446
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,754
with colored hair.

447
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,463
The most anticipated group of the whole delegation...

448
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:42,524
was the youngest participants, girl group Red Velvet.

449
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:43,963
There was no intention behind it,

450
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,064
but the song they performed was "Red Flavor".

451
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,034
As the only idol singer of the delegation,

452
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:50,774
everything including their song choice made news.

453
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:53,544
Even Kim Jong Un...

454
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:57,173
watched their performance and talked to them afterwards.

455
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:58,744
Would you have ever expected them in one photo?

456
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:03,514
The audience responded quite well to our performance.

457
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:05,054
They clapped a lot.

458
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,584
The group's name must have been foreign to them.

459
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:11,254
So what would the lyrics be like if translated in North Korean?

460
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:12,354
(Clapping)

461
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,594
"Take a bite, and it'll keep on melting."

462
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:19,663
I'm sorry, but I don't even understand this myself.

463
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,064
"I'm curious of the red flavor, honey."

464
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,334
North Koreans would say, "What was that?"

465
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:24,673
What about this part?

466
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,673
(Find the corner candy shop, baby)

467
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:29,774
"Find the corner candy shop, baby."

468
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,443
"Find the corner candy shop, baby."

469
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:35,784
That's what it would be.

470
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,883
So what was it like after the concert?

471
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,423
The first day of the concert...

472
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,324
ended with a North-South joint performance.

473
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,354
(The event was a success.)

474
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:48,494
You can't do anything on an empty stomach.

475
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,963
The entire delegation headed to...

476
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,994
a naengmyeon restaurant the next day.

477
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:53,504
I'm not camera-ready!

478
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:56,473
It wasn't just any restaurant though.

479
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:58,074
It was Ok Ryu Gwan,

480
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,104
a popular restaurant that gets over 10,000 people a day.

481
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:02,913
So how is the taste of Pyongyang naengmyeon from Pyongyang?

482
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:05,373
Z Young, please let us know.

483
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,183
The concert is important,

484
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,383
but the naengmyeon was just as important to me.

485
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:17,923
- Of course. - It exceeds my expectation.

486
00:23:19,153 --> 00:23:20,723
With another joint performance on the third,

487
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:23,094
the delegation wrapped up its successful concert.

488
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:25,433
Before they headed back, they enjoyed a feast.

489
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:28,933
Which dish was most memorable?

490
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,173
Every dish was delicious.

491
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:34,673
If I had to pick one, it'd be the sturgeon.

492
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:36,344
Really?

493
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:37,643
Dishes made with sturgeon.

494
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:39,883
They were delicious.

495
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:43,213
We were treated as honorable guests there.

496
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,984
Just so you know,

497
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,223
the entire dinner banquet was nothing but harmonious.

498
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,923
It was great.

499
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,163
I can tell that it was just by...

500
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,824
- hearing you say it. - I'll never forget it.

501
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:59,034
I've never been known to enjoy alcoholic beverages...

502
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:01,703
or to enjoy feasts and parties.

503
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:05,774
But I was singing and dancing with everyone else.

504
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,173
It was so much fun.

505
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:14,014
Spring hasn't found us just yet.

506
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,044
(We took a step closer to each other.)

507
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:18,984
However, we hope that music and culture...

508
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,054
can shed a layer off the cold winter.

509
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,723
(Don't forget how we met on April 1.)

510
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,863
We should always remember...

511
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:30,594
how we gathered here on this day.

512
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,094
(Don't forget how we met on April 1.)

513
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,663
Spring is coming. We won't forget that.

514
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:36,734
Thank you all so much.

Korea's Favorite 100 Dance Artists that aired last week...

520
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,693
received a viewer rating of 70 percent.

521
00:24:56,693 --> 00:25:00,163
The people of Korea just can't get enough of dancing.

522
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:02,734
Here is Kim Seung Hye with the details.

523
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,663
Korea's Favorite 100 Dance Artists that aired last week...

524
00:25:05,663 --> 00:25:08,804
brought about a dance frenzy in Korea.

525
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,173
Many viewers danced as they watched the segment.

526
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:15,244
While dancing, one viewer lost his mind...

527
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:16,673
and caused a scene.

528
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:20,613
His moves seem quite silly, don't they?

529
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,344
I wish he'd...

530
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:24,254
restrain himself a bit.

531
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:25,284
Yes, I agree.

532
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,923
I don't care how much you love to dance,

533
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:29,824
there's a line you shouldn't cross.

534
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:32,294
He's a piece of work, isn't he?

535
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:33,494
- I'm sorry. - You're right.

536
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,663
We hope that this never happens again.

537

Korea's Favorite 100 Dance Artists, 30th to 16th place.

538
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,633
- Here they are! - Here they are!

539
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,863
Okay, let's go.

540
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:44,234
Dance is in the air, everyone.

541
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:47,943
It's the special segment that will fire up your Friday night.

542
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:50,744
Korea's Favorite 100 Dance Artists.

543
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:53,544
Here is the artist in 30th place.

544
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,984
It's the artist that took Korea by storm.

545
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,984
She is both elegant and sexy.

546
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,423
It's the devastatingly captivating Sun Mi.

547
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,524
Every single she releases became an instant hit.

548
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,024
She released four hit singles in a row.

549
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,893
So what's the secret to her success?

550
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:14,163
It's none other than her dance moves such as the clock dance...

551
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,463
and the hip dance.

552
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,034
Sun Mi is known for having memorable choreography.

553
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:21,744
Even the nation's MC Yu Jae Seok covered the dance.

554
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:25,244
So how can the dance not be popular nationwide?

555
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,514
Stop it!

556
00:26:26,814 --> 00:26:28,014
("Gashina" swept the nation in 2017.)

557
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:30,014
In 2017, Sun Mi brought back...

558
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:33,883
the dance frenzy with her gunpoint dance move.

559
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:35,953
What's popular is always parodied.

560
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:39,153
Her gunpoint dance move swept the entertainment industry.

561
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:41,994
So we asked the singer for her thoughts on it.

562
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:42,994
(Parodies of it were a craze in 2017.)

563
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:46,433
Which celebrity do you think did the best job on it?

564
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,564
- It has to be Psy. - Psy?

565
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:52,604
I can't bring myself to watch the video though.

566
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,973
Psy's cover of Sun Mi's song left her shock...

567
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,173
and in lost for words.

568
00:26:58,473 --> 00:26:59,883
Isn't it scary?

569
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:01,344
(Ta-da!)

570
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,854
He's a maverick when it comes to parodies.

571
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:05,453
(We look forward to her in 2018.)

572
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:08,653
Also in 2018, we await another great dance number by Sun Mi.

573
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:10,054
Now let's move on.

574
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:12,594
In 29th place on the list...

575
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:15,764
is the artist that went around and around.

576
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:18,663
She's the dancing queen of the 80s, Nami!

577
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,264
(The song made us go around and around in circles.)

578
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,504
There was a time when girls would...

579
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:26,443
dance to this song whenever two or more got together.

580
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,044
Also, here's her signature move that has been loved...

581
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:30,774
for over 30 years.

582
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:33,344
How can I not mention her rabbit dance?

583
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:37,183
The shuffle was the craze back then,

584
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:38,584
and she introduced it in Korea.

585
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:42,354
Her group Nami and Boom Boom spread the dance across the country.

586
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:46,324
Being the trendsetter she was, she had a great sense of fashion.

587
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:48,223
Her style was ahead of time,

588
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:50,633
and she was always in the spotlight for it.

589
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:53,734
Nami is a dancing queen,

590
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:55,703
who dominated an era.

591
00:27:55,703 --> 00:27:58,903
Let me introduce you to Korea's 28th Favorite Dance Artist.

592
00:27:58,903 --> 00:27:59,903
(Legendary dance duo Deux)

593
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:02,604
This hiphop duo was one of the biggest stars of the 90s.

594
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,213
Their hairstyles don't look tacky even today.

595
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:07,744
Their dance skills would give everyone goosebumps.

596
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,913
This legendary duo sure was ahead of its time.

597
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:12,014
It's Deux!

598
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:16,094
Although they were always at the center of attention,

599
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:20,423
they broke up after only two years, leaving many fans heartbroken.

600
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:24,633
In November of 1995, Kim Seong Jae's sudden death...

601
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:26,433
shocked their fans again.

602
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:28,064
It's been 23 years since his death,

603
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:30,373
but we still miss him.

604
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:33,344
In 27th place is Lee Jung Hyun.

605
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:35,903
There is a word that is always associated with her.

606
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:38,213
Were you the nation's little sister?

607
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:39,344
I was...

608
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,744
a female techno warrior.

609
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:42,183
That's right.

610
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,413
Her meteoric debut at the end of last century...

611
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,453
started a techno fad in the country.

612
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:50,554
We call her the female techno warrior.

613
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:54,193
Who hasn't danced to this song?

614
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:57,564
The techno fad in 2000...

615
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,604
is still valid.

616
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,574
The female techno warrior can make everyone...

617
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:06,344
get up from their seats and dance.

618
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,544
Her passionate facial expressions and movements...

619
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:13,213
could never be copied...

620
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:15,084
by anyone.

621
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:19,014
There are items associated with her too.

622
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:22,254
The fan with an eye on it and the finger microphone...

623
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:24,953
were both her own ideas.

624
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:27,393
With each song, she had a unique concept...

625
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:30,363
and showed off different charms.

626
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:32,804
She's been praised as Korea's Lady Gaga.

627
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,604
But she was even 10 years earlier...

628
00:29:35,604 --> 00:29:37,203
than Lady Gaga.

629
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:38,203
(Performance queen)

630
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:41,703
In 26th place is...

631
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:44,213
Momo of Twice. Who is in 25th place?

632
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,683
The original idol group...

633
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:51,453
and dance group, Sobangcha.

634
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:55,254
("Last Night Story" by Sobangcha)

635
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:58,453
When they debuted in 1987, many girls fell in love with them.

636
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:01,893
The team consists of Kim Tae Hyung, Jung Won Gwan, and Lee Sang Won.

637
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:06,264
(I dare say...)

638
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,433
(we were as popular as EXO.)

639
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,973
And he is not wrong. They were EXO of the 80s.

640
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:12,633
Their trademarks include...

641
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:16,044
acrobatic performance, denim outfits,

642
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,744
sunglasses, and horse-riding pants.

643
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:20,814
Everything they put on would become popular.

644
00:30:20,814 --> 00:30:23,883
Sobangcha will always be our idols.

645
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:28,223
In 24th place is...

646
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,193
the tall, beautiful singer of the 90s,

647
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:32,723
Kim Hyun Jung.

648
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:34,594
This song was loved by everyone in the country...

649
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:37,034
and was played in every single club in the 90s.

650
00:30:38,094 --> 00:30:40,064
(You have to sing it whenever you're in a karaoke room.)

651
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,663
This song always heats up the mood.

652
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:44,504
Because of the famous line,

653
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:47,604
many people think this song is called, "Turn Back".

654
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,544
However, it is actually called, "Bruise".

655
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:54,284
Everyone knows this dance move.

656
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:57,584
It's still popular after 20 years.

657
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,084
All the cars are turning right now.

658
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,584
Everyone is turning.

659
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,423
The twister dance makes everyone one.

660
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:07,494
It feels like we're back in the 90s.

661
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:10,633
In 23rd place is Hyo Yeon of Girls' Generation.

662
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:13,804
(Korea's 22nd Favorite Dance Artist)

663
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:16,004
Are you ready?

664
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:20,004
In 22nd place is Beyonce, the queen of pop.

665
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:23,613
Also known as Black Pearl, this sexy diva...

666
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:27,143
has amazing stage presence.

667
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:28,713
(Her charisma is unrivaled.)

668
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,784
Her charisma and passion conquer the stage.

669
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:33,683
This winner of six Grammy Awards in one night...

670
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,653
is the most loved diva of the 21st century.

671
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:39,594
("Crazy in Love" by Beyonce)

672
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:43,693
Even while dancing vigorously, she shows off amazing singing skills.

673
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,403
From the looks to singing and dancing skills,

674
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:49,504
everything about her is praised throughout the world.

675
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,973
Many female singers...

676
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:55,903
have tried dancing to her song, "Single Ladies".

677
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:59,383
They've stolen many people's hearts...

678
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:03,554
by showing off their legs while dancing to this song.

679
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:09,423
If Beyonce is the hottest star of the 21st century,

680
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:13,324
the diva of the 20th century is this lady.

681
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:15,963
In 17th place is...

682
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:19,963
Madonna, the living legend and greatest diva in history.

683
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,703
With her progressive style and performance,

684
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:25,004
she became a pop icon.

685
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:28,203
The word, "seductive", exists just for this lady.

686
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:29,844
(Madonna's best song, "Vogue")

687
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:32,314
She is also a trend-setter.

688
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:35,584
The "Vogue" dance moves were...

689
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,713
inspired by models' poses.

690
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,953
She even pulls off disco dance,

691
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:43,453
proving herself to be a legend.

692
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:46,163
She sure is a textbook example of a pop diva.

693
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:49,463
Even though she is over 60,

694
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:52,633
she proves to us that age is just a number.

695
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:56,304
In 21st place is U-Know Yun Ho of TVXQ.

696
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:59,804
Having debuted in 2004, this is their 15th year.

697
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:03,274
U-Know Yun Ho is the leader and dancer of the team.

698
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:05,913
He is known to have a peculiar habit.

699
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:10,054
He always starts his day with some vigorous dance.

700
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:13,324
This hard-working dancer is Korea's 21st favorite dancer.

701
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,354
The greatest dancer would be Michael Jackson.

702
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:19,663
It's such an honor to be in 21st place.

703
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:22,734
I'll work even harder from now on.

704
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,734
Please give me a lot of support.

705
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,133
Can you dance for us?

706
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,933
It was unexpected. He was asked to dance.

707
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:35,074
- Just like this? - It should be no problem for him.

708
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:38,173
(Dancing)

709
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:42,183
I'm one of Korea's favorite dancers, U-Know Yun Ho of TVXQ.

710
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:44,084
Thank you for the great performance.

711
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:48,054
He's always great, but he shines brightest on stage.

712
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,994
We'll look forward to even more amazing dances from you.

713
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:54,524
In 19th place is Kim Choo Ja.

714
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:55,723
(The 70's icon)

715
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:58,633
She turned the music scene upside down in the 70s.

716
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:03,304
She is Korea's original sexy diva with oriental charms.

717
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:07,843
She was the first Korean female singer to try the butt dance.

718
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,274
Her dance always has a unique feel to it.

719
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:15,084
Even her name means, "Let's dance."

720
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:17,754
This passionate diva...

721
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:20,984
made a comeback in 2014, after a 33-year hiatus.

722
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:23,854
We hope to see more of you in the near future.

723
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,823
In 18th place is...

724
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:29,433
the late 90's teenagers' idol.

725
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,864
The legendary idol group, H.O.T,

726
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:37,473
had an amazing dancer named Jang Woo Hyuk.

727
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,843
Even after the breakup of H.O.T, he is still a great dancer.

728
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:46,643
When he dances, every joint seems to be...

729
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,343
moving separately.

730
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:51,384
He can even pull off this powerful and manly dance.

731
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,854
It seems like he's mastered every kind of dance.

732
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,154
His skills are getting better and better.

733
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:59,763
Recently, he came back to stage as a member of H.O.T.

734
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:02,734
H.O.T is amazing both 20 years ago and now.

735
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,794
Long live the nation's idol!

736
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:07,203
(H.O.T will forever be the nation's idol.)

737
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:11,234
Who is in 16th place?

738
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:14,843
Are you surprised to see him?

739
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:18,743
In 16th place is the clumsy and friendly Kim Jong Min,

740
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:22,484
who is known for his comic dance.

741
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:27,453
Actually, he is an amazing dancer from the dance team, Friends.

742
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:28,783
The dancer of Koyote...

743
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:32,553
can even pull off Michael Jackson's dance.

744
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:33,694
(He is as good as Michael Jackson.)

745
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:35,163
Watch.

746
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:38,933
Forget the Kim Jong Min you know.

747
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:41,303
I'm the king of dance!

748
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:43,604
Back in time,

749
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:46,904
he debuted as a backup dancer for Uhm Jung Hwa.

750
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:51,614
His handsome face and cute gesture stole many girls' hearts.

751
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:53,584
Let's find out the truth.

752
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,614
- That song got him where he is now. - That's right.

753
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:59,314
Some of his fans would even push me away...

754
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:00,524
to see him.

755
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:05,053
Kim Jong Min, who was loved by many girls in the 90s,

756
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:06,964
is Korea's 16th favorite dance artist.

757
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,694
We've looked at 30th through 16th places.

758
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:14,033
Next week, you'll finally find out who is in first place.

759
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:18,604
To wrap up, let me quote Dutch philosopher Spinoza.

760
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,203
"Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces,"

761
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:24,314
"I would still dance today."

762
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:28,584
We'll keep doing our best.

763
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:29,913
Bye.

764
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:33,053
- Bye. - We'll come back next week.

765
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,323
(Find out who is in first place next week.)

766
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:40,723
We were looking at Korea's favorite dance artists.

767
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,694
I didn't expect to find myself in the video.

768
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:44,694
I enjoyed it.

769
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:48,564
Entertainment Weekly has all kinds of videos.

770
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:52,104
Please look forward to who is in first place.

771
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:55,004
Before hearing from Kim Tae Jin,

772
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,743
let's hear from Kim Seung Hye, who showed off amazing dance skills.

773
00:36:57,743 --> 00:36:58,843
They weren't exactly amazing.

774
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,843
I've even prepared some singing.

775
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,553
The star of the night is me, it's me

776
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:07,584
The most popular idol group right now,

777
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,053
- What's that? - Wanna One,

778
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,794
is the star of School Attack tonight.

779
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:13,723
Wasn't it okay? It's me... I'm sorry.

780
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:17,334
They made a sudden visit to a classroom in first period.

781
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,234
Are you curious? Stay tuned.

782
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:22,163
I met some actors who deserve our trust,

783
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:25,803
Ma Dong Seok, Kwon Yul, and Han Ye Ri.

784
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:27,843
They had such great chemistry.

785
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,614
Find out more about their fun movie and interview now.

786
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,473
(15 years as a reporter)

787
00:37:32,473 --> 00:37:34,643
No one intimidates me...

788
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:35,683
except...

789
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:37,513
this man.

790
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,584
Why would he look at my script?

791
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:41,984
He startled me.

792
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,593
(Will it be my last day?)

793
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:47,464
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to today's champion.

794
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:50,433
Ma Dong Seok, the arm champion.

795
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,064
His expressionless face looks scary.

796
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,464
Ma Dong Seok!

797
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,134
He's so adorable when he smiles.

798
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:59,033
The interview with the cheerful actors starts right now.

799
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,274
We're looking forward to seeing the movie.

800
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:02,814
Is it like a uniform?

801
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:06,214
- Who'll introduce the film to us? - I'm not good, but I will.

802
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:07,843
Usually, younger actors do this, but are you doing it because...

803
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:08,843
you're the producer?

804
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:11,384
No. It's only because I've memorized the lines.

805
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:15,123
"Champion" is...

806
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:18,694
the first Korean film about arm wrestling.

807
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:20,464
It's about a touching yet entertaining story.

808
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:23,493
- It's a family drama about sports. - I think It'll be really good.

809
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:28,504
(It's about a guy and his journey to become arm wrestling champion.)

810
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:30,174
It's hilarious.

811
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,433
It's the second time.

812
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,444
And it's thrilling.

813
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,243
- What are you doing alone? - I was thirsty.

814
00:38:36,243 --> 00:38:39,444
It's the first Korean film ever about arm wrestling.

815
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:43,053
What does it feel like to work with Ma Dong Seok?

816
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,654
He's so caring...

817
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:46,854
and enthusiastic in action scenes,

818
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,424
so I just hoped he wouldn't get injured during the shoot.

819
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:50,694
What do you call each other?

820
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:52,794
- Executive Ma? - Executive Ma?

821
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:54,593
Executive Ma.

822
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:56,393
He's the executive of the Arm Wrestling Association.

823
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:58,234
- Is that why you call him that? - Yes.

824
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:00,803
Are you really the executive of the Arm Wrestling Association?

825
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,433
- Let's clap for him. - A round of applause.

826
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,274
Look at his huge arms. They're has big as one's legs.

827
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,274
Your arm is as thick as a skinny woman's waist.

828
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:12,214
You kept saying he looks like he lost weight.

829
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:15,143
Really? I think he looks skinnier now.

830
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:17,654
Yes. I only have skin and bones.

831
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:23,424
Yul, have you ever felt his strength first-hand?

832
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,424
If I ever did, I wouldn't be here right now.

833
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:28,424
I don't ever want to feel it.

834
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:31,433
- Have you two ever arm wrestled? - No, because...

835
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,234
I could die.

836
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,763
- That's possible. - They resemble each other.

837
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:37,774
- I have another question for you. - Okay.

838
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,643
It's a pretty well-known story,

839
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,473
but the way you became an actor is interesting.

840
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:45,774
- I majored in dance in university. - Okay.

841
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:48,683
I became close friends with people in the film industry,

842
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:52,453
and I was their dance instructor on set at first.

843
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,584
That's how I set my foot in the industry.

844
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:58,993
And from then on, I sometimes played small parts in their movies,

845
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:00,564
and that's how I started my career as an actor.

846
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,464
Do you play the role of Dong Seok's little sister?

847
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:03,493
- Yes. - Yes.

848
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:06,263
But you don't look like each other at all.

849
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,734
That's possible.

850
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,373
That's possible. I feel sorry for her.

851
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:11,734
I'm sorry.

852
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,404
He took everything, and that's why I look like this.

853
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:18,873
If this movie is a success, it'll be the third successful movie in a row.

854
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,384
Your income last year must have been huge.

855
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:23,614
(I earn money by the thickness of my arm.)

856
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,553
You've shown my so much love and support.

857
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,924
I just hope that this movie can entertain you.

858
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:30,924
I think that's all I can do for the fans.

859
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,623
I hope you'll support us.

860
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:34,694
We've prepared another section with cutout boards.

861
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,163
"I'm the champion of blank."

862
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:38,893
What did they write about themselves?

863
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:40,464
Show us your belts.

864
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,134
"I'm the champion of public relations."

865
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,604
For PR, can you make hearts with your hands,

866
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:49,044
wink, or put your hand under your chin?

867
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,614
I can do anything but putting my hand under my chin.

868
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:54,944
Let's say that...

869
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:56,254
you were asked to come to...

870
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,683
Entertainment Weekly's live studio for PR.

871
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:00,123
Would you do it?

872
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:01,984
His pupils are shaking.

873
00:41:01,984 --> 00:41:03,453
You're the champion of PR.

874
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,393
- Why did you write that? - I don't think he meant it.

875
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,364
You can't write something like that.

876
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:10,834
- I'd do my best. - I see.

877
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:13,734
And Yul wrote that he's the champion of happiness.

878
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:16,203
It's embarrassing to write something like this...

879
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:18,774
- myself. - I wrote this myself.

880
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,243
(Will he get his belt taken away from him?)

881
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,473
When we greet our fans on stage and such,

882
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:26,643
I try my best to entertain them and...

883
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,314
- keep them happy. - I think he's blushing.

884
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:29,783
I'm the champion of embarrassment.

885
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:31,814
I'm the champion of happiness and embarrassment.

886
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:34,354
Out of the three of you,

887
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:36,593
- we'll see who's the strongest. - Okay.

888
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:40,024
Anyone can tell who it is, though. So...

889
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,364
here it is.

890
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:45,433
We prepared a toy that requires you to flick instead of punch.

891
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:47,734
Whose finger is the strongest?

892
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,073
(What's Ye Ri's score?)

893
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:51,734
I didn't know that existed.

894
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:53,973
You got 550 points.

895
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,643
Maybe you'll get 5.5 million viewers for your film.

896
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,814
That's my prediction.

897
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:00,013
(She's happy.)

898
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:01,643
Go, Dong Seok!

899
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:03,614
The actors seem cheered up.

900
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:04,884
I'll go.

901
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:06,953
(Inhaling)

902
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:08,854
It's actually nerve-wracking.

903
00:42:11,223 --> 00:42:14,464
They might get 7.36 million viewers.

904
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:16,794
Finally,

905
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:18,533
- It's the viewer count. - it's Dong Seok's turn.

906
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:20,564
- Maybe he'll break the toy. - Let's go.

907
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:22,033
How do I do this?

908
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:23,473
(He's cute.)

909
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:27,044
(Executive Ma has flicked it.)

910
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:30,314
- 799 points. - He's weaker than I thought.

911
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:34,343
- I'll go again. - He's ambitious.

912
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,643
(The champion arm wrestler is ambitious.)

913
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,314
825.

914
00:42:39,154 --> 00:42:41,053
Since he said it could be the viewer count, I lost control.

915
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:43,194
- I became competitive. - The champion is...

916
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,694
Dong Seok.

917
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:48,694
Can you make an acrostic poem with "Champion"?

918
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,334
Since this is the first interview for us,

919
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,464
we just wanted to get it over with quickly.

920
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:56,933
Upon the sudden request, they froze.

921
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,973
- Has the screen paused? - No. Sorry.

922
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,114
- I thought it was paused. - Me too.

923
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,444
- Cham. - "Champion" is...

924
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:06,714
Pi.

925
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:07,913
(Pi)

926
00:43:07,913 --> 00:43:09,214
A movie you can't avoid.

927
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:10,913
On.

928
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:14,024
You have to watch this at least once.

929
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:17,194
- That's good. - It's impressive.

930
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,093
- I hope that's true. - Sesame seed oil...

931
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:22,663
does not go well with pizza.

932
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,294
- That's lame. - Can I go again?

933
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:27,163
I can't think right now.

934
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:31,433
Our movie, "Champion", will be out on the 3rd of May.

935
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:35,274
I hope you'll show your love and support for this movie.

936
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:37,614
Anyone who watches... I'll go again.

937
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:39,913
Anyone who watches...

938
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:41,643
(He's the champion of making mistakes.)

939
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:45,154
- Anyone who watches... - Is a champion.

940
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:46,953
We'll look forward to it.

941
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:48,123
Thank you.

942
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:50,593
(Entertainment Weekly)

943
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:54,424
Anywhere these guys go, the road gets covered in flowers.

944
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:57,033
Don't tell anyone about this.

945
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:59,763
The celebrities on this week's School Attack are...

946
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:02,533
I can't believe this. It's Wanna One.

947
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,873
Really? No way.

948
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:06,843
(Wanna One)

949
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:09,174
We'll go over there.

950
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:11,913
- Everyone, - Let's go.

951
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:15,814
For this event, the members of Wanna One are here early morning.

952
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:19,354
Will the surprise event be successful? Let's find out.

953
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,584
The students have gathered for their first period.

954
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:24,024
They still look sleepy.

955
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:28,123
What will happen if the members of Wanna One...

956
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,993
- enter the classroom? - They'll go crazy.

957
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:32,263
We'll welcome the special lecturer for the day.

958
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:38,303
The class you won't see anywhere else will begin now.

959
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:41,973
Hello, everyone!

960
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:44,973
This is Entertainment Weekly's School Attack.

961
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,143
Hello.

962
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:50,183
Is this real? The students are speechless.

963
00:44:50,283 --> 00:44:53,323
Because you're so happy to see them, you all froze.

964
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,984
- They're so excited. - That's right.

965
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,754
It's Wanna One!

966
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:00,393
In 1, 2, 3.

967
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:03,033
- All I want to do Wanna One. - Hello, we're Wanna One.

968
00:45:04,064 --> 00:45:06,904
Now that you saw them in real life, who do you think is the handsomest?

969
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,904
- Ha Sung Woon. - Ha Sung Woon?

970
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,004
Can you scream and show him your love?

971
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,343
(Screaming)

972
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:16,143
- She's too shy. - Your throat isn't...

973
00:45:16,143 --> 00:45:17,944
- Right. - warmed up yet.

974
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:20,214
Let's make some acrostic poems with their names.

975
00:45:20,243 --> 00:45:22,854
One student raised his hand with confidence.

976
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,714
I didn't know...

977
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:27,854
- a male student would come up. - Hello.

978
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:30,953
Everyone's greeting him politely.

979
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,524
Who is your favorite member?

980
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:35,593
My favorite is Yoon Ji Sung.

981
00:45:35,593 --> 00:45:37,334
(The male student picks Ji Sung.)

982
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,933
Stand next to him...

983
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,834
Really?

984
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,573
Stand next to him and...

985
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:47,274
This is very nice. Let's give them three seconds for eye contact.

986
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:51,174
Since they like each other. In 1, 2, 3.

987
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:52,373
Look at him.

988
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,084
(Just looking at each other's face makes them happy.)

989
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,683
They're so happy.

990
00:45:57,814 --> 00:45:59,723
(Ji Sung is his first pick.)

991
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,723
Can you shake his hand?

992
00:46:02,723 --> 00:46:04,493
- Okay. - Yes.

993
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:07,024
Great. Please say the syllables.

994
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,163
Yoon.

995
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:09,964
Mr. Yoon Ji Sung.

996
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:11,964
(His heart stops.)

997
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,404
What's with him?

998
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,734
(What is this feeling?)

999
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:16,104
Is this how this feels?

1000
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,033
- Ji. - Ji Sung.

1001
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,044
- Sung. - My life as a fan is complete.

1002
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,614
(My life as a fan is complete.)

1003
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:25,444
Thank you.

1004
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:28,044
- Thank you. - Everyone,

1005
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:31,553
He's very cool. He didn't shake my hand at the end.

1006
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:33,323
- Did he just leave? - Yes.

1007
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:36,093
- There's another. - Wanna One has lots of male fans.

1008
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,093
They're so popular.

1009
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:39,864
Who is your favorite?

1010
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,493
Park Ji Hoon.

1011
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:42,964
(He picks Ji Hoon.)

1012
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:44,834
Okay. Please come up.

1013
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,433
Why do all Wanna One members...

1014
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:49,263
have red ears?

1015
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,433
- Just take it easy. - He's so red.

1016
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,143
They're so red.

1017
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,904
Take it easy.

1018
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:56,243
He's too shy.

1019
00:46:56,243 --> 00:46:58,314
I'm shy right now.

1020
00:46:58,473 --> 00:46:59,984
Do you want to do the five-syllable talk?

1021
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:01,683
Sure.

1022
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,053
Okay. Make it short. Go.

1023
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,823
Have you eaten?

1024
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,723
No, I haven't.

1025
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,323
Do you want to eat with me?

1026
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:18,194
The atmosphere is becoming flirty.

1027
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,064
Whenever you want.

1028
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,734
This is such a natural conversation.

1029
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:26,404
People might think these two are just talking normally.

1030
00:47:28,674 --> 00:47:30,513
His ears are even redder.

1031
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:34,084
Let's see if there's a peculiar person in this room.

1032
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,154
I think he's a professor. The gentleman in the back.

1033
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,013
(Professor Lee Moon Ki)

1034
00:47:39,013 --> 00:47:41,524
The professor was watching us...

1035
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,024
with a big smile on his face.

1036
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:45,223
Who is your favorite Wanna One member?

1037
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:47,393
The one in the middle in blue.

1038
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:50,163
That's Ong Seong Wu. Yes.

1039
00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:52,593
- He says you look cool. - Yes.

1040
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:55,134
Can you make a poem out of Ong Seong Wu's name?

1041
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:56,573
All of a sudden?

1042
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:57,734
Yes. You're a professor.

1043
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:59,843
He looks so kind.

1044
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,803
Just look at their eyes.

1045
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:07,183
- Ong. - Ong my gosh.

1046
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:11,783
He has a humorous side to him.

1047
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:14,584
- Seong. - I hope you succeed.

1048
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:16,623
That's great.

1049
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:19,623
- Wu. - Wanna One is the universe's best!

1050
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:26,663
- Were you preparing for this? - No, no.

1051
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:29,533
Lastly, do you have anything...

1052
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:31,774
to say to the students here?

1053
00:48:32,973 --> 00:48:35,573
I became a university student in 2011.

1054
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:37,473
I might seem really old to you.

1055
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:39,243
When I was in school, my professor told me...

1056
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:42,584
I should just tell him if I needed a break and to take a year off.

1057
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:43,854
- Really? - Yes.

1058
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:46,623
- I don't think he agrees. - What?

1059
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,424
I don't think he agrees with you.

1060
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:50,223
I think he's just watching...

1061
00:48:50,223 --> 00:48:52,154
to see what you'll say.

1062
00:48:52,154 --> 00:48:54,993
Your early 20s will never come back.

1063
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:58,064
It's an age where you can be forgiven for whatever you do.

1064
00:48:58,064 --> 00:49:00,004
I hope you'll always do your best.

1065
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:03,404
Did you like his speech, professor?

1066
00:49:03,404 --> 00:49:04,834
Yes, yes.

1067
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,973
- Yes, yes. - Yes, yes.

1068
00:49:08,143 --> 00:49:10,174
I dare you to try and skip my class.

1069
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:11,774
Try to skip my class.

1070
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:16,584
The reaction was wilder than ever with Wanna One's School Attack.

1071
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:19,424
We could feel the popularity of Wanna One skin deep.

1072
00:49:19,654 --> 00:49:21,524
After meeting with the passionate students,

1073
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:24,453
we had the opportunity to have...

1074
00:49:24,453 --> 00:49:25,694
a deeper conversation with Wanna One.

1075
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:26,763
(They had an enjoyable time with the students.)

1076
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:31,364
It's time to get to know more about Wanna One.

1077
00:49:31,694 --> 00:49:34,364
You got to meet some students. How was it?

1078
00:49:34,364 --> 00:49:36,634
Since they're studying hard,

1079
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:38,674
I wanted to cheer them up.

1080
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:40,803
How would you cheer up...

1081
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,274
the university students?

1082
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:44,944
Everyone, cheer up.

1083
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:49,044
I have to continue interviewing,

1084
00:49:49,044 --> 00:49:51,214
but I almost fainted too.

1085
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:54,154
We have a few members who just turned 20.

1086
00:49:54,654 --> 00:49:58,354
I wanted to go back to school after seeing them in their desks.

1087
00:49:58,354 --> 00:49:59,593
It reminds me of the past.

1088
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,064
He was reminded of the past.

1089
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:03,334
Are you...

1090
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,464
- Are you old? - You must be very old.

1091
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:06,533
You were reminded of the past.

1092
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:09,904
Everyone dreams about their ideal university life.

1093
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:13,004
Universities have campuses.

1094
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:16,473
I heard getting Chinese delivery is a delicacy.

1095
00:50:17,073 --> 00:50:20,544
Yoon Ji Sung, you actually graduated university.

1096
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,984
I think all I did was drink.

1097
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:24,453
(I was drinking every day.)

1098
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:26,013
He's ruining every child's imagination.

1099
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:28,053
- I'm being honest. - Yes.

1100
00:50:28,053 --> 00:50:30,123
- That's true. - Don't you agree?

1101
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:33,163
That's why you should never tell them you're living alone.

1102
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,593
Once they know, the senior students...

1103
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:38,493
force you to come out to drink.

1104
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,033
That's a good tip.

1105
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,303
How do you feel after hearing these stories?

1106
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,404
Will your dream come true?

1107
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:45,303
I'm in trouble.

1108
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:46,604
I'm in trouble.

1109
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:50,473
If you can name one thing that defines you, what is it?

1110
00:50:50,473 --> 00:50:52,373
- Ji Hoon has one. - Ji Hoon has a charm.

1111
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:54,143
- It's his cuteness. - It's your trademark.

1112
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,484
Everyone in Korea has tried this pose before.

1113
00:50:57,484 --> 00:50:59,553
However, no one can be as cute as the original.

1114
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,123
We were all busy saving things in our hearts.

1115
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,223
We must watch the original version.

1116
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:05,393
I'll save Entertainment Weekly in my heart.

1117
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,593
Show them the new one.

1118
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:11,093
Entertainment Weekly, you're mine.

1119
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:13,134
Entertainment Weekly, you're mine.

1120
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:16,674
- Gosh. - Thank you.

1121
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,674
- Ji Sung, you have your tears. - Yes...

1122
00:51:20,604 --> 00:51:22,473
We thought you'd cry like this, but...

1123
00:51:22,714 --> 00:51:24,314
(Wailing)

1124
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,843
That's him. That's this guy here.

1125
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:29,283
Lee Dae Hwi is good at copying Ha Sung Woon.

1126
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:30,683
Sung Woon tries to hold it in.

1127
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:31,984
It boils inside of him.

1128
00:51:32,553 --> 00:51:33,924
His nostrils move.

1129
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,484
(Sung Woon cries with his nostrils.)

1130
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:36,723
The nostrils.

1131
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:38,823
I saw him cry like this.

1132
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:40,223
Kim Jae Hwan cried too.

1133
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,564
(They're copying Jae Hwan.)

1134
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:43,033
That looks the same.

1135
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,464
Hwang Min Hyun. Look at him.

1136
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:47,464
Everyone cried except for Lai Kuan Lin.

1137
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,904
We thought you would cry a lot since you're the youngest.

1138
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:52,334
- I don't cry much. - He's mature.

1139
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:53,873
You're such a man.

1140
00:51:53,873 --> 00:51:55,274
What is it, Jae Hwan?

1141
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:58,114
I know how Kuan Lin cries.

1142
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,484
Have you seen him cry?

1143
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,513
Let's reveal how everyone cries today.

1144
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:03,314
Most people have weird expressions.

1145
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,114
But Kuan Lin makes sounds.

1146
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:08,024
(Humming)

1147
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:11,223
- That's because... - Do you agree?

1148
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:13,524
he wasn't crying in front of me.

1149
00:52:13,694 --> 00:52:16,493
- Was he crying by himself? - I overheard him crying alone.

1150
00:52:16,493 --> 00:52:18,694
- In his room? - Yes. I felt so sorry for him.

1151
00:52:18,694 --> 00:52:19,734
Yes, that happened.

1152
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:23,834
Unfortunately, Wanna One has a limited time together.

1153
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:27,143
What do you think you'll be doing one year from now?

1154
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,973
If I may be honest,

1155
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:32,944
- we haven't talked about our end. - No.

1156
00:52:33,214 --> 00:52:35,444
Really. We haven't talked about it.

1157
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:38,953
We're too busy thinking about our performances day by day.

1158
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:41,524
Just like how we're performing hard as Wanna One,

1159
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:44,754
no matter what position we're in,

1160
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:49,024
I assume we'll be giving our best while thinking of each other.

1161
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:51,234
You look teary.

1162
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,163
When your eyes are dry...

1163
00:52:53,163 --> 00:52:55,203
(Their present is too precious to talk about their end.)

1164
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:57,303
Thank you so much for all your love.

1165
00:52:57,303 --> 00:53:00,203
Entertainment Weekly is the best. We had a lot of fun today.

1166
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:03,314
I hope you'll listen to our new album...

1167
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:04,314
and cheer for us.

1168
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,183
See you later, Entertainment Weekly! We promise!

1169
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,044
Wanna One had a great time with their fans.

1170
00:53:09,044 --> 00:53:10,984
We'll continue to cheer you on!

1171
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:12,053
(We'll visit you again, Entertainment Weekly!)

1172
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,854
We wish Wanna One the best.

1173
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:16,623
They're so charming and handsome.

1174
00:53:16,623 --> 00:53:19,924
Also, Ma Dong Seok's movie trailer looks like a lot of fun.

1175
00:53:19,924 --> 00:53:22,194
I hope your film becomes a hit and reaches three million in sales...

1176
00:53:22,194 --> 00:53:24,334
so that you would visit us at the studio.

1177
00:53:24,464 --> 00:53:26,404
We'll prepare a strong chair for you.

1178
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,604
- Good luck. - We'll look forward to it.

1179
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,373
That's all we prepared for today.

1180
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,573
We'll see you next week on Entertainment Weekly.

1181
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:34,444
- Everyone, be happy! - Be happy!

1182
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:46,524
