1
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,945
Any signs got my name on them?

2
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,448
Quite a few.

3
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,450
What do they say?

4
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,286
The usual.

5
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,705
"Death to Rosenberg. "

6
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,790
"Retire Rosenberg. "

7
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,460
"Cut off the oxygen. "

8
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,963
That's my favorite.

9
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,551
Of course, you, Mr. Grantham...

10
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,679
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

11
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,184
"Rosenberg equals the government
over business...

12
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,647
...the individual over government,
the environment over everything...

13
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,733
...and the Indians, oh,
give them whatever they want. "

14
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,820
With all due respect,
that wasn't my line, that was a quote.

15
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,866
From one of your unnamed
Senior White House officials.

16
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,869
Senior White House bastard,
you should have said.

17
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,537
Got in there by...

18
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,874
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

19
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,462
Never fails to amaze me...

20
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,383
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

21
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,239
Yes?

22
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,492
Looking for Mr. Sneller.
Mr. Sneller?

23
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,537
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

24
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,446
Hello.
Everything is in place.

25
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,699
All the money must be there
when I arrive in Zurich.

26
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,910
It will be there
if the job is finished.

27
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,705
It will be finished.

28
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,213
May I help you?
I'd like to order room service.

29
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,299
- What would you like?
- Coffee...

30
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,969
...scrambled eggs, whole-wheat toast
and orange juice, please.

31
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,054
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

32
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,183
When we substitute
threat for an argument...

33
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,436
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

34
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,605
...to overcome our capacity for reason.

35
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,817
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

36
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,738
...which brings us
to Bowers against Hardwick.

37
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:14,326
A police officer entered Mr. Hardwick's
apartment to serve him a warrant...

38
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,829
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

39
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,332
They caught him with an open beer.

40
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,084
When he entered
Mr. Hardwick's bedroom...

41
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,712
...he found him in bed with a man.

42
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,089
The officer arrested Hardwick...

43
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,259
...for violating Georgia's statute
which outlaws sodomy.

44
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,095
Even though Georgia dropped the case...

45
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,974
...Hardwick challenged
the constitutionality of the statute.

46
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,601
Now, what was his claim?

47
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,939
- That it violates the right of privacy.
Why?

48
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,276
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

49
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:54,449
But what if he decided to sell drugs
at his home or engage in child abuse?

50
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,370
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

51
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,664
The court, beginning with Griswold...

52
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,959
...has limited the right of privacy
to actions which are intimate...

53
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,755
...which are deeply personal,
which allow us to control our lives...

54
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,465
...to define who we are.

55
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,635
But is that a constitutional claim?
There's no...

56
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,680
...right to define oneself
written into the Constitution.

57
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,765
It's not even in the Bill of Rights.

58
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,810
If the State of Georgia can regulate
Hardwick's sexuality...

59
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,272
...engaged in private with consenting
adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

60
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,983
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

61
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,820
If there's no right of privacy
and Georgia can enforce the statute...

62
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,198
...we sacrifice the liberty the framers
thought they'd guaranteed us.

63
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,867
The Supreme Court disagreed with you.

64
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,912
They found that the statute
did not violate the right of privacy.

65
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,330
Why?

66
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
They're wrong.

67
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,943
So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

68
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,820
Sexual attraction.

69
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,406
You mean he's just got it?

70
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,074
Does he ever!

71
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,868
What you're saying...

72
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,705
...is that if you could clone
three of him, you'd all be happy.

73
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,833
Okay, tell us, what is your secret?

74
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,210
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

75
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,464
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

76
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,716
A very big secret.

77
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,887
My goodness gracious!
I can't believe my ears!

78
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,764
Hope my mom's not watching.

79
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,432
She hopes so too!

80
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,225
Ma, I was just kidding.

81
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,145
Ladies, have you changed
your opinion about our stud?

82
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,230
You still like him?

83
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,900
I like big guys!

84
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,486
I think your fan club has increased.

85
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,237
Everything has increased!

86
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,656
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

87
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,033
His nurse was also murdered.

88
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,119
Jensen was found two hours later
in some queer club.

89
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,958
Voyles called me, wildly upset.
It's hardly good for FBI's reputation.

90
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,252
He and Giminski are on the way.
Giminski?

91
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,171
Yes. The CIA should be involved,
at least for now.

92
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:05,426
You must wait two hours to address
the nation if we want an audience.

93
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,430
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
How about a cardigan?

94
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:14,269
You want me to talk to the nation in a
time of crisis wearing a sweater?

95
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,687
Mr. President...

96
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,942
...I've already told Justice
to put together a list of nominees.

97
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,653
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

98
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,822
Mr. President.

99
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,076
Mr. Voyles,
does the FBl have any suspects?

100
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,494
It's too soon.

101
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,289
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

102
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,960
I would like to have a report
on your security and where it broke down.

103
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,671
You're assuming it broke down.

104
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:47,093
We have two dead judges, both of whom
were being protected by the FBI.

105
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,470
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

106
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,182
Are these killings in any way
linked to the CIA...

107
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,520
...or to any other agency
of the United States government?

108
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,522
I'm shocked you'd think that.

109
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,816
Bob, just look into it, okay?

110
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,736
I suggest we meet back here at five.

111
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,322
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

112
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,248
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

113
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,335
Your approval ratings will go
through the roof.

114
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,173
That's the weather
in New Orleans. This is Tim Bellew.

115
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,134
We interrupt our program now
for a special bulletin.

116
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,512
In a special address,
live from the White House...

117
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,182
...the president of the United States.

118
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,268
My fellow Americans...

119
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,022
...our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

120
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,941
Last night...

121
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,279
...Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

122
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,198
...were assassinated.

123
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:56,788
These assassinations may be an
attempt to strike at the very fabric...

124
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,665
...of our government.

125
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,376
But I can assure each...

126
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,670
...and every American...

127
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,799
...that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

128
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,761
Everything...

129
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,057
...is being and will be done
to bring the culprit...

130
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,060
...or culprits to justice.

131
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,729
For justice must...

132
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,190
...and shall prevail.

133
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,278
I wish you could have known him
when I used to clerk for him.

134
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,241
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

135
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,576
That's why they killed him.

136
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,829
That mind was still a threat.

137
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,291
But why kill him now,
when he had so little time left?

138
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,921
Maybe they couldn't take a chance
he'd last till the elections.

139
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,632
So why Jensen?
This president nominated him.

140
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,510
He and Rosenberg had almost
nothing in common.

141
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,098
That's what they should look for.

142
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,600
Decisions on which they both agreed.

143
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,771
Boy, if there ever was a moment
for a drink...

144
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,360
One day at a time, right?

145
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,293
We're talking a conspiracy,
then who are the conspirators?

146
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:30,006
If we've let foreign terrorists in,
there'll be hell to pay politically.

147
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,802
The intelligence community can't be
blamed for a weakness in immigration.

148
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,805
Denton, who are your suspects?

149
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,142
This has to be kept very quiet.

150
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,479
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

151
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,860
At least 11 Underground Army members
have been in the D.C. area...

152
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,531
...and we suspect them in at least
100 bombings of abortion clinics...

153
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,326
...porno houses,
gay clubs all over the country.

154
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,162
The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

155
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,333
Correct?

156
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,795
Watch your claws.

157
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,597
Gray Grantham covers the
Supreme Court for the Washington Herald.

158
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,434
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg...

159
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,230
...before he was shot on,
as it turned out, the day he died.

160
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,734
Did he say anything that might shed
some light on these dreadful events?

161
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,694
Yes. He spoke about things...

162
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:38,324
...off the record,
appropriately for a sitting justice.

163
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,369
But I think it would be appropriate
to quote him now.

164
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,414
He said, "The campaign waged
by the president was so ruthless...

165
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,335
...in its manipulation of the
middle-class fears of minorities...

166
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:55,049
...had been so exploitive and divisive
that it created a climate of distrust. "

167
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,469
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

168
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,765
Everyone wants to know
when you're starting classes again.

169
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,642
That includes me.

170
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,481
You know what they say:
Drinking makes depression worse.

171
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,902
What do they recommend for anguish?
Where've you been?

172
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,447
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket.

173
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,242
I even made a list of possible suspects.

174
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,745
And then threw it away
because they'd be obvious to everyone.

175
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,792
Then you looked for areas
Jensen and Rosenberg had in common.

176
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,085
Exactly.

177
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,673
Jensen generally protected the rights
of criminal defendants.

178
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,133
Some notable exceptions.

179
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,887
He wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment.

180
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,264
And almost always supported
tax protestors.

181
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,186
So they might have been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector?

182
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,980
As yet, I rule no one out.

183
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,650
Everyone is assuming the motive
is hatred or revenge.

184
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,278
Or an attempt to influence
the social agenda of the court.

185
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,324
What if the issue involved
old-fashioned material greed?

186
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,951
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

187
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,997
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see this file, please.

188
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,041
Why?

189
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,293
It's public record, isn't it?

190
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,961
Semi-public.

191
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,506
Are you familiar with
the Freedom of Information Act?

192
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,843
This file has the pleading...

193
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,472
...and correspondence.
The rest is discovery and the trial.

194
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,182
When was the trial?
Last summer.

195
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,726
Went on for 2 months.
Where's the appeal?

196
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,813
Not perfected yet.
I think the deadline is August 1 st.

197
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,238
So, who done it?

198
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,452
You have some obscure suspect unknown
to the FBI and the CIA and...

199
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,080
...Secret Service
and 10,000 police departments?

200
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,582
I had one...

201
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,793
...which I have now discarded.

202
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,424
You skipped class, ignored me for a
week, just to throw it away?

203
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,925
Let me see it.

204
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,806
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of me
to think I could solve it.

205
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,933
Hubris of the young, huh?

206
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,811
Don't knock the hubris that I love.

207
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,819
I'm leaving tomorrow.

208
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,865
I'm going up to Rosenberg's memorial
in Washington.

209
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,164
I went through Rosenberg's decisions
the other night...

210
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,335
...and in the back of my mind
there's an idea...

211
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,296
...to do a book on him.

212
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,465
No one could do it better.

213
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,135
I started making notes...

214
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,141
...about what he meant to me:
surrogate father, mentor, you know.

215
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,482
I started to get very thirsty.

216
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,988
I deserted you this week.

217
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,157
Not the greatest timing.

218
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,160
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

219
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,706
It's Alice.

220
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,753
Want to come out with me for a burger?

221
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,839
No, thanks.

222
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,633
It might do you good to get out.

223
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,219
I'm fine, thanks.

224
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,637
You sure?
Yes.

225
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,850
Okay, bye.

226
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,689
Hey, Sarge.

227
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,149
Hey, son.

228
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,902
Dark coffee, three sugars.

229
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,696
So how's the president?

230
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,656
Which one?

231
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,658
Not Coal, the real one.

232
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,243
Cool and mellow.

233
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,456
Would you believe he's all tore up
about Rosenberg?

234
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,709
And all fired up about...

235
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,711
...restructuring the court.

236
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,713
Thinks it'll make his place in history.

237
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,923
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

238
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,926
There's a short list of nominees.

239
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,431
The original had 20 or so names,
then they cut it to 8. I gave you 2.

240
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,558
What about the investigation?

241
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,560
I haven't heard much...

242
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,687
...but I'Il keep my ears open.

243
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,231
- I know you will. Thanks.
- I got that.

244
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,774
I'll see you later.

245
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,776
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

246
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,406
Martini, please.

247
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,993
Good day.
Good to see you.

248
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,913
Another coffee, please.

249
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,832
You read the Grantham article.

250
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,752
It had me running around all day.

251
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,465
Coal blasted the director, saying the
judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

252
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,969
The director said Coal had leaked them
himself to test the waters.

253
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,765
Coal ran the most divisive campaign
in 20 years...

254
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,475
...and the president did nothing.

255
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,313
I'd like to have seen your name
on this list ofjudges.

256
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,650
We all voted you
most likely to make the court.

257
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,321
These days, it's hard enough
just to make my class.

258
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,990
How old is she, this time?

259
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,953
Twenty-four. But she's...

260
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,621
...extremely mature.

261
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,125
At 24, she's mature.

262
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,128
I don't know if I believe that.
Do you have a photo?

263
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,549
No, I don't. She's not a puppy dog
or a grandchild.

264
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,300
Thank God.

265
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,845
Who killed them, Gavin?

266
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,141
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,
I'm not an agent.

267
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,144
But, as I recall, you have great ears.

268
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,148
To be honest, we don't have a clue.

269
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,071
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

270
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,491
...on who might have ordered
the assassinations.

271
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,326
Your girlfriend has a theory?

272
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:26,083
Here, take a look at it. You'll get
a kick out of the way her mind works.

273
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,188
Is this Gray Grantham?
- Yes, it is.

274
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,943
Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.
I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.

275
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,322
I can't call from home or the office.

276
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,365
What kind of office?

277
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm an attorney.

278
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,244
Private or government?

279
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,371
I'd rather not say.

280
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,958
I may know something
about Rosenberg and Jensen.

281
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,836
Are you recording this?

282
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,756
Can this call be traced?

283
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,343
I'm not recording it or tracing it.
I promise you.

284
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,720
I may know who killed them.

285
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,641
What's your name?

286
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,226
Garcia.

287
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,397
That's not your real name.

288
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,904
I think I saw something at the office
I wasn't supposed to see.

289
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,366
Do you have a copy?

290
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,079
I need to think about this.

291
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,373
- I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

292
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,918
Listen, I promise you...

293
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,089
...I will protect you
as a confidential source.

294
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,430
Hello.

295
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,114
Got you.

296
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,417
Mr. Grantham's not here,
but he left his car number for you.

297
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,506
It's Garcia.
I still don't know what to do.

298
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,967
Mr. Garcia...

299
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,513
...I've gone to jail
rather than reveal a source.

300
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,016
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

301
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,479
You're clearly a decent human being,
a good citizen.

302
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,151
But could you live with yourself
if you don't reveal what you know?

303
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,155
MORGAN
I'll get back to you.

304
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,022
Taxi!

305
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,534
French authorities reviewed footage
from the airport cameras in Paris...

306
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,997
...and think they recognized a face
that might be Khamel's, the terrorist.

307
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,002
He may have arrived here on a flight
10 hours after we found Jensen's body.

308
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,005
Anything else?

309
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,008
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

310
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,553
What's the wrinkle?

311
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,807
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

312
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,100
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

313
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,562
He's afraid it might be damaging
to the president.

314
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,275
How's that?

315
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,611
It's all there in the brief.

316
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,330
It's amateur stuff...

317
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,543
...but how often does something make
Coal sweat and run for cover?

318
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,462
He didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

319
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,423
But his stone face showed
he wasn't happy.

320
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,092
Did he have any symptoms?

321
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,971
As I told you, the president
is here for his annual checkup.

322
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,931
I wish I was in as good shape.

323
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,976
Was this timed to counter
the age issue in the next election?

324
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,978
Why didn't I think of that?

325
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,272
He hasn't decided whether to run again.

326
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,148
When will he decide?

327
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,110
Do you really expect me to answer that?

328
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,447
One rumor I can deny is
that he checked in to get away from you.

329
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,449
Although could you blame him?

330
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,953
Thank you again.

331
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:18,834
Commander, go downstairs and tell them
I have a date for golf this afternoon.

332
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,335
Yes, sir!

333
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,298
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

334
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,134
Good.
Now, what's so important?

335
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,219
This is...

336
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,138
...a brief...

337
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,349
...written by an eager-beaver
law student.

338
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,144
It's a theory about the assassinations.

339
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,479
And indirectly...

340
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,315
...it implicates the White House.

341
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,987
The premise is so far-fetched
it's absurd.

342
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,116
But Director Voyles, for reasons
both you and I can guess...

343
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,326
...is going after it.

344
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,540
Well, we...

345
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,710
We can't interfere
with his investigation.

346
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,671
You should ask Giminski
to have the CIA investigate.

347
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:10,177
When we confirm that this is garbage,
you can ask Voyles to back off.

348
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,679
It's domestic.

349
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,267
The CIA can't go nosing around.
It's illegal.

350
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,353
Yes, technically.

351
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,523
What about...

352
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,192
...your friend...

353
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,862
...Barr, and the Unit,
I think you call it.

354
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,239
I've spoken to Barr.

355
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,368
They're very good
for small specific missions...

356
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,453
...but they aren't the CIA.

357
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,707
How does it implicate the White House?
What are there, names?

358
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,377
One name.

359
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,381
Someone we both know?

360
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,907
Mr. President...

361
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,791
I've decided my agenda for the future.

362
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,210
I'll stay in bed...

363
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,087
...drink...

364
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,297
...make love...

365
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,760
...and forget the whole damn business.

366
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,431
You don't approve.

367
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,517
What about the book on Rosenberg?

368
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,602
You should write it.

369
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,647
- Let's go.
- You should.

370
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,109
You have the youth, the energy,
the certitude.

371
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,819
You'd be perfect.

372
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,113
Can I have the keys?

373
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,830
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

374
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,458
You've drunk too much.

375
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,838
Give me the keys.

376
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,551
Remember the Mashed Potato?
Give me the keys.

377
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,470
- You're too young.
- I know it.

378
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,014
Do you remember the Fishback?

379
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,308
- The Slide?
- No. Please.

380
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,685
- Please what?
- Give me the keys.

381
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,813
Give me the keys.
I'll drive or I'll walk.

382
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,356
You'Il walk?
Yes.

383
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,070
Have a nice stroll.

384
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,372
Miss Shaw!

385
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,587
You take my breath away!

386
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,095
Thomas!

387
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,517
Oh, my God!

388
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Watch the door.

389
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,585
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

390
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,880
You'll be safe in my car.

391
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,553
Your name?

392
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,895
Darby Shaw.

393
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,609
Let's go.

394
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Is this your car?

395
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,415
Come here.

396
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

397
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,754
I'm taking you to the hospital.

398
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,923
Check the plates.

399
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,926
Did you know the man in the car?

400
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,434
Thomas Callahan.

401
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,947
It'll be a few minutes.

402
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,621
Are you sure that the man who
called himself Rupert said he was a cop?

403
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,629
We don't have a record of a cop
named Rupert. The computer...

404
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,550
...has no record of the tag numbers of
the car you were in. Must be fake.

405
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,222
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

406
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,723
All right?

407
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,162
Gavin Verheek?

408
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,749
This is Darby Shaw.
Do you know who I am?

409
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,627
We have a mutual friend.

410
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,547
Thomas gave you a copy of my theory.

411
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,923
Yes, he did.

412
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,508
Where is it?

413
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,512
I read it and I showed it
to some folks at the Bureau...

414
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,889
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

415
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,684
Has it been seen outside of the FBl?

416
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,853
I can't answer that.

417
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,897
Then I won't tell you
what's happened to Thomas.

418
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,359
Okay, yes.

419
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,697
It's been seen outside the FBl,
but by whom I don't know.

420
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,199
He's dead, Gavin.

421
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,703
He was murdered. Someone planted
a car bomb for both of us.

422
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,456
I got lucky, but they're after me.

423
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,043
What's your phone number?
Where are you?

424
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,879
Not so fast.

425
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,716
Come on! Thomas Callahan
was my best friend.

426
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:14,220
I'll have agents pick you up.
You can't stay on the street.

427
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,308
Thomas is dead because he talked
to you. Tell that to Voyles.

428
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,895
Turn up the TV,
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

429
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,233
Down.

430
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,990
Mr. President.

431
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,913
Sit down. You must see this.
We've been working on this all morning.

432
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,789
You have your first audience.

433
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,417
Over. Roll over.

434
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,253
Roll over.

435
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,923
How serious is this Pelican thing?

436
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,218
I've assigned 14 agents in New Orleans.

437
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,930
I doubt if there's anything to it,
but we must check it out.

438
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,973
I don't have to tell you...

439
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,810
...how much trouble and pain
this nonsense could cause...

440
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,979
...if the press gets wind of it.

441
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,608
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

442
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,737
I just wish...

443
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,364
...that you'd...

444
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,449
...back off the thing...

445
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,493
I mean...

446
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,870
...it's a goose chase.

447
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,123
Are you asking me to ignore a suspect,
Mr. President?

448
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,794
If the press...

449
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,880
...gets wind of what you're after
and starts digging, I'll be-

450
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,340
We'll be crucified.

451
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,973
So you're asking me to back off?

452
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,479
Back off and chase the real suspects.

453
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,983
Ignore it for a few weeks, that's all.

454
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:55,488
Your hatchet man did a real number on me
with the press. They ate my lunch...

455
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,198
...over the security...

456
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,909
...we provided Jensen and Rosenberg.

457
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,082
Get that pit bull off my ass and
I'll forget the Pelican theory a while.

458
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,307
May I have your card?

459
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,978
I'll pay with cash.

460
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,648
Verheek.
Yes.

461
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,235
What did Voyles say?

462
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,030
Mr. Voyles has been unavailable.

463
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,159
But I will try to speak to him
later this afternoon.

464
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,038
I expected more.

465
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,000
There's a memorial service tomorrow.

466
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,461
I'll be there tonight.

467
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,337
I think we should meet.

468
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,257
Darby, I can save your life.

469
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,510
You can't even talk to the director.

470
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,348
Where will you stay?

471
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,518
At the Westin, by the river.

472
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,481
Okay.

473
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,385
She's watching TV.

474
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,306
GIMINSKl: They've been looking under
rocks. She's using credit cards.

475
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,517
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

476
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,519
I'll give her 72.

477
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,605
GIMINSKl:
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

478
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,148
All right, Bob.

479
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,527
Hooten, stay.

480
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,245
This means her little brief
is right on point.

481
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,456
Will you notify the president?

482
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,334
Notifying the president...

483
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,628
...means notifying Coal.

484
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,757
Gray Grantham's article
in tomorrow's Washington Herald...

485
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,635
...maintains that, according
to unnamed White House sources...

486
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,304
...the Mid-Eastern terrorist, Khamel...

487
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:35,101
...may be among those who assassinated
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

488
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:40,064
Those sources say that a country known
for sponsoring terrorist activity...

489
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,691
...may have hired Khamel.

490
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,573
It's Garcia.

491
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,659
I'm on the corner of
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

492
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,289
Take down my license number;
there's a lot of gray Volvos out there.

493
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,165
8-5-6...

494
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,377
...V-N-N.

495
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,630
Right.

496
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,465
Ten minutes.
Yes.

497
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,308
My keys!

498
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,899
I can't do it.

499
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,154
Let's get together anyway.

500
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,117
You'll feel better if we meet
and you don't have to reveal anything.

501
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,161
I have a wife and daughter.

502
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,247
There's a chance they know that I know.

503
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,749
The guys at the firm?

504
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,710
I didn't tell you I was in a firm.

505
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,172
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

506
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,634
You must work at a firm
where they expect people...

507
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,928
...to work at least 100 hours a week.

508
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,911
Garcia, we can work this thing out
if you just get together with me.

509
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,246
Garcia?

510
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,291
Who's this?

511
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,460
Is this Gray Grantham?

512
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,295
Yes. Who's this?

513
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,966
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?

514
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,717
The what?

515
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,886
Pelican Brief.

516
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,724
No. Never heard of it.

517
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,187
It's an unlikely little theory
about who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

518
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,731
A friend of mine took it to Washington.

519
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,068
He gave it to a friend in the FBl
and it was passed around.

520
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,821
My friend was killed in a car bomb.

521
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,823
Wait now.

522
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,284
Your friend took it to the FBl...

523
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,996
...and then he was killed?
What's his name?

524
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,582
I can't tell you that.

525
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,752
How do you know all this?

526
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,921
I wrote the brief.

527
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,258
Are you a lawyer?

528
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,759
No.

529
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,721
Where are you calling from?

530
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,766
I'd rather you not
ask me any more questions.

531
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,269
You called me.

532
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,770
What's your name?

533
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,940
- Alice.
- You called me, Alice.

534
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,529
Can you get a list of the major
presidential campaign contributors?

535
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,283
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

536
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,120
You know who did these killings?

537
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,289
Yes.

538
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,626
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

539
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,546
Let's take it slow.
I'll be in touch.

540
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,797
When?

541
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,083
Hi.

542
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,334
How are you?

543
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,669
How are you?

544
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,507
Did you get into my apartment?

545
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,218
Your computer's gone.

546
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,845
So are your floppy disks.

547
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,348
And your red expandable files.

548
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,936
I need you to do me a favor.

549
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,606
Go to the memorial service tomorrow...

550
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:56,195
...and spread the word I called to say
I'm staying with an aunt in Denver.

551
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,031
And I won't be back until fall.

552
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,952
What is going on?

553
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,875
Are you okay about money?

554
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,921
I have the money my father left me.

555
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,384
Who are you hiding from?

556
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,058
I think you better go now, Alice.

557
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,485
It would be better for me if you go now.

558
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,088
That's not fair.

559
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,758
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

560
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,014
I can't get you to give me a smile?

561
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,770
I saw that.

562
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,606
That's something.

563
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,782
Just one beer?
No.

564
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,204
I've found my mission in life.

565
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,914
To make you smile.

566
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,166
You must find another mission.

567
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,051
Wait!

568
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,638
Will you marry me,
just for 5 minutes?

569
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,308
I know it's stupid,
but I think we're fated for each other.

570
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,976
I must go now.

571
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,230
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

572
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,857
I'd walk a million miles

573
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,068
For one of your smiles

574
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,653
You beautiful

575
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,154
You wonderful girl

576
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,740
From the laundry

577
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,161
You've got the wrong girl.

578
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,165
Go get her.

579
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,614
Please, help me!

580
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,748
Looking for Mr. Sneller.

581
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,124
Mr. Sneller?

582
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,960
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

583
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,848
Have you heard from Darby?

584
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,308
Yes, I did.

585
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,187
I got a note from her.
She's staying with an aunt in Colorado.

586
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,524
But she's going to
be back next semester.

587
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,829
I'll see you later.

588
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,857
Gavin, it's Darby.

589
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,861
I'd just about given up on you.

590
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,739
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'Il come with 3 agents.

591
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,159
I thought the FBl was not involved.

592
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,454
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

593
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,040
We can get you out of the city tonight,
in Washington tomorrow.

594
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,710
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

595
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,295
We'll go from there.

596
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,923
At noon tomorrow,
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

597
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,717
Wait, Riverwalk?

598
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,471
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

599
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,224
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

600
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,059
...and I'll find you.

601
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,228
The riverside bandstand.

602
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,316
- How tall are you?
-5'10".

603
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,609
Your weight?

604
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,778
About 180,
but I'm planning on losing it.

605
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

606
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,199
Tomorrow.

607
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,716
Gavin, it's Darby.

608
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,218
I'd just about given up on you.

609
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,473
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

610
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,560
I thought the FBl was not involved.

611
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,771
It's not involved, not yet.

612
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,065
I have friends.

613
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,735
We'll get you out of the city tonight,
in Washington tomorrow.

614
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,988
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

615
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,115
We'll go from there.

616
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:06,078
At noon tomorrow,
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

617
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,082
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

618
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,252
Wait on the riverside at the bandstand
and I'll find you.

619
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,672
The riverside bandstand?

620
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,385
- How tall are you?
-5'10".

621
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,761
Your weight?

622
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,764
About 180,
but I'm planning on losing it.

623
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,308
All right.

624
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,107
Tell me where you want to meet...

625
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,528
Tell me where you want to meet...

626
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,989
...and within an hour
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

627
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,999
Mr. Sneller on line 2.

628
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,506
Khamel is dead.
We don't know who did it.

629
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,926
- And the girl?
- She's running.

630
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,470
We lost her.
We'll find her.

631
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,696
There's been another murder.

632
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:56,618
You remember my friend gave
the brief to a friend at the FBl?

633
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,622
The FBl friend was killed yesterday.

634
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,667
How do you know?

635
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,754
I was holding his hand.
He was shot...

636
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,340
...in broad daylight
in a crowd.

637
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,510
I'm very sorry.

638
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,554
I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

639
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,183
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

640
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,397
We get crank calls from people claiming
to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

641
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,983
Something you can confirm?

642
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,234
Please.

643
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,069
Such as?

644
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,031
The name of the friend
that was murdered in the car explosion.

645
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,286
Take your time.

646
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,373
Callahan.

647
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,002
His first name?

648
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,336
Thomas.

649
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,588
Where did it happen?

650
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,384
In New Orleans.
I think that should be enough.

651
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,430
All right.

652
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:05,103
What's the name of the friend
that worked at the FBl?

653
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,188
Verheek.

654
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,190
Gavin Verheek.

655
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,693
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

656
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,195
I think that's more than enough.

657
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,283
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

658
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,119
You must follow my instructions.

659
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,801
This is Gray Grantham.

660
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,847
That's right.

661
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,144
Got it.

662
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,746
Did you follow my instructions?

663
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,165
Yes.

664
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,656
You must think I'm crazy.

665
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,659
Yes, I did...

666
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,871
...till I checked New Orleans.

667
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,290
Callahan was...

668
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,543
...killed exactly as you said.

669
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:55,463
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBl...

670
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,216
...they found his body 2 days ago...

671
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,844
...in a hotel room early in the morning.

672
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,431
He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.

673
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,810
That can't be.

674
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,314
Want to talk about the brief?

675
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,653
Everyone I've told
about the brief is dead.

676
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,573
I'll take my chances.

677
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:26,202
You can't, under any circumstances,
use my name...

678
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,414
...or reveal how you got
the information.

679
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,959
Or publish anything until
I've left the country. Agreed?

680
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,420
Unless I can convince you otherwise.

681
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:36,921
You can't.

682
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:41,968
May I sit down?

683
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,724
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

684
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,863
Interesting read, isn't it?

685
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,408
What'd the president say?

686
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,620
He spoke to Voyles...

687
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,373
...who will leave it alone for a while.

688
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,877
The president asked Voyles to back off?

689
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:20,465
We thought it was just another shot
in the dark. Now I'm not sure.

690
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,800
That's obstruction ofjustice.

691
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,011
Assuming the brief turns out to be true.

692
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,389
If it does, you'll be the fall guy.

693
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,895
I won't be the only one.

694
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,481
The old Nixon two-step.

695
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,983
Don't even think that name.

696
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:42,487
Look at the hopeful side,
Irangate, Iraqgate...

697
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,656
Good chance it won't come out.

698
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,659
What's up with Grantham?

699
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,454
We got his car phone.
We haven't been inside the home yet.

700
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,581
Why not?

701
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:57,001
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

702
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,841
Grantham knows about the brief.

703
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,844
He called 3 White House aides today...

704
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,013
...and God knows who else.

705
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,809
What made you hone in
on this particular case so quickly?

706
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:18,523
I remembered this piece
that "Frontline" did a year ago...

707
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:23,653
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

708
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:29,867
They said he'd committed suicide,
but his family thought it was foul play.

709
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,293
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

710
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:42,547
They said he had
a depressive problem years before...

711
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,466
...but medication had taken care of it.

712
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,721
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

713
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,350
They told the police
they were not convinced it was suicide.

714
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,856
But the police
closed the investigation.

715
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,735
Exactly.

716
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,618
That's it.
That's the brief.

717
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,624
Maybe we could...

718
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,419
...finish up in the morning?

719
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,433
I'll be up late going over my notes...

720
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,393
...while they're fresh in my head.

721
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,022
Call me when you wake up.

722
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,736
Try and get some sleep.

723
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:56,913
Mr. Grantham.

724
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,169
I know it sounds silly, but...

725
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:07,131
...would you sleep on the sofa?

726
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,179
No problem.

727
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,562
Good night.

728
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,190
Listen...

729
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,610
At the risk of sounding old-fashioned...

730
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,905
...isn't it time I knew your real name?

731
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,992
Darby Shaw.

732
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,205
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

733
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:44,669
Callahan was a fan.

734
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,849
Does the name Victor Mattiece
mean anything to you?

735
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,517
Money.

736
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,726
Power.

737
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,020
Influence.

738
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:08,985
He's made and lost several
fortunes drilling oil in Louisiana.

739
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,988
In 1979...

740
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:16,534
...his oil company punched some holes
in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.

741
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:17,994
A lot of oil.

742
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:21,038
He needed governmental permission...

743
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,501
...to dredge a channel though
the marshlands to get the oil out.

744
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,130
Enter Mattiece,
the great campaign contributor...

745
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,048
...and as night follows day...

746
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,844
...government permission
to gouge through the endangered marshes.

747
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,765
Mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars...

748
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,267
...when Green Fund...

749
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,644
...an obscure environmental outfit...

750
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:48,065
...trots down to the U.S. District court
in Lafayette and files a lawsuit...

751
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,568
...to stop the entire operation.

752
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:54,363
Of course, Mattiece spares no expense
to win the lawsuit.

753
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:59,160
I don't think there's a top law firm
between Houston and New Orleans...

754
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,204
...that he hasn't hired.

755
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,831
Fucking PBS!

756
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,876
By the time the Green Fund lawyers...

757
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,169
...all two of them...

758
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,338
...wade in, the joint ventures...

759
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,758
...limited partnerships
and corporate associations...

760
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,178
...form an impenetrable maze
that makes Mattiece invisible.

761
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,598
Luckily for the Green Fund's lawsuit...

762
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:25,394
...the heart of the new oil reserve
is near a natural refuge for waterfowl:

763
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:30,233
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

764
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,027
The pelican becomes the hero.

765
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:37,740
After 30 years of contamination
by DDT and other pesticides...

766
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,369
...the Louisiana brown pelican is
on the brink of extinction.

767
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:44,956
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts...

768
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,125
...from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

769
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:53,339
It takes 7 years for the pelican suit
to go to trial in Lake Charles.

770
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,802
The 3-man jury, caring less
about the pelicans than jobs...

771
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,137
...votes in favor of Mattiece.

772
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:05,351
But the judge rules to keep the
injunction against drilling because...

773
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,813
...he thinks Green Fund has proven
its point about the pelican...

774
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:13,276
...a federally-protected species,
and that it will appeal.

775
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:14,986
What's the lawsuit's status?

776
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,863
From the trial level...

777
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:21,993
...it will be appealed to the Court
of Appeals in New Orleans in a month.

778
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,413
Any idea what the court will do?

779
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,373
It could be reversed.

780
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:32,461
Then the fun starts. If either side
is unhappy with the court...

781
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,839
...they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

782
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:39,302
From today, how long would it take
for a decision by the Supreme Court?

783
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,013
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

784
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,140
Rosenberg would have died.

785
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:48,644
But another president could be
in the White House when he died.

786
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,396
So if you're Mattiece...

787
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,691
...and you don't mind killing
a couple of Supremes...

788
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,653
...now's the time to kill them,
when you can predict their replacement.

789
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,196
But why Jensen?

790
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,658
He shared one piece
of common ground with Rosenberg:

791
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,535
Protecting the environment.

792
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,746
I didn't mean to wake you.

793
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:02,259
You said that Mattiece hired law firms
from Houston to New Orleans.

794
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,429
Were there any in Washington?

795
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:07,556
Maybe two.

796
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,394
White & Blazevich...

797
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:16,774
...and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

798
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,235
Great!

799
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,613
I got a call from a lawyer in D.C...

800
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,116
...who saw something
concerning Rosenberg and Jensen.

801
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,078
He backed out of our meeting.
I never heard from him again.

802
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:33,416
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

803
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,126
How?

804
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:39,880
Long story. If he works at one of these
law firms, he could be our confirmation.

805
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,633
I hope you find him.

806
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,262
Come with me to Washington.

807
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,807
I've had enough.

808
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,562
If you're right about Mattiece,
then there'Il be a cover-up.

809
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,105
It'll probably work.

810
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:57,773
How do you know?

811
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,026
I called the Herald morgue last night.

812
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,405
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

813
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,908
...on "Violations of
Campaign Financing Laws. "

814
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:12,329
He found out that, hidden under
a lot of other names of individuals...

815
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:17,334
...and PAC's and corporations,
Mattiece was the biggest contributor...

816
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:18,836
...by far...

817
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,796
...to the president's campaign.

818
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,800
We ran a picture, with the article,
of the president and Mattiece.

819
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,012
It was taken unbeknownst to either one.

820
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,766
In it, the president and Mattiece are
in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge...

821
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,769
...sipping on some bourbon,
having a good laugh.

822
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,520
The best of pals.

823
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,523
The captions said:
"The President's Most Secret...

824
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,359
...and Generous Contributor. "

825
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:47,615
Now if your brief is right
and it ever reaches the light of day...

826
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,451
...the president loses
any chance of reelection.

827
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:53,370
The men around the president
won't let that happen.

828
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,833
I checked with my sources.
The Bureau, Langley, the White House...

829
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,669
...all said the brief doesn't exist.

830
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:07,343
You may be the only witness to the fact
there is a brief. If you disappear...

831
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,094
...so does justice.

832
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,850
Is that what Callahan would want?

833
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,898
He'd want me to see my 25th birthday.

834
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,235
Darby.

835
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:28,823
If this thing reaches as deep
and goes as high as we think it does...

836
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,492
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

837
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,912
Where can you hide?

838
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,872
Go back to Washington.

839
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:50,427
They're all shook up
about you asking about something.

840
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:51,595
I expected that.

841
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,557
It's like the Gestapo over there.
Coal clears everything.

842
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:57,184
They put me on medical leave
for 90 days.

843
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,645
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

844
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:03,399
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

845
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,568
I'm worried about you, son.

846
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,574
Gray, it's Darby.

847
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,952
When you hear this, I'll be in the air
on my way to nowhere.

848
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,164
Try to understand.

849
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,751
I can't keep you on that story.

850
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,795
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

851
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,964
The Times, the networks...

852
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:30,843
...are there checking out the judge
they're about to nominate.

853
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,011
I need more time.

854
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,596
For what?

855
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:38,767
You lost your White House sources,
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

856
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,769
Not your best week.

857
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,564
You can't take me off this story.

858
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,067
What do you know for fact?

859
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,821
An unidentified guy says
he knows about the assassinations.

860
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:55,618
He works in a law firm, you don't know
which one. He's cut off all contact.

861
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:57,995
That's not very promising.

862
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,915
There's something there, I can smell it.

863
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:06,837
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is
inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

864
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,422
Then there's a girl...

865
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,467
...with her bird brief for which
you can't get confirmation.

866
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,635
Not yet.

867
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:16,764
She also cut off contact, something
that's reaching epidemic proportions.

868
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,849
They're waiting for you upstairs.

869
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:23,479
Everything she said about
the two deaths has been confirmed.

870
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,774
The FBl says Verheek was killed
in some hotel mugging.

871
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,026
- That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

872
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,446
And they said they knew of
no connection with the assassinations.

873
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,616
What else would they say?
I'm interested in what they did say.

874
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,244
Let's look at what I have confirmed.

875
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:43,666
Callahan was killed.
He was a professor. They had an affair.

876
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,961
Give it to the Times-Picayune.
Maybe they want some gossip.

877
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,880
I also found that Callahan clerked
for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

878
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:52,257
Life is filled with odd coincidence.

879
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,134
Not a coincidence if the brief-

880
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,679
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

881
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,223
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan
were friends.

882
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:03,727
They met here a few weeks ago,
when he must have given him the brief.

883
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,480
- Supposition again.
- I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

884
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:10,693
On which she has based her suppositions.
It's all just suppositions.

885
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,529
You know what Mattiece could do?

886
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,698
I know what he has done already.

887
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,574
He has a bizarre history.

888
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,911
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It
doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

889
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,247
But it means it's worth exploring.

890
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:30,087
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours
on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

891
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:35,050
Prove you have a way to revitalize
this story, and I might keep you on it.

892
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,180
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

893
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:50,190
This is the story of
a mystery that may never be solved.

894
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:54,194
The story of a brilliant young lawyer
who loved this land...

895
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,948
...and wanted to fight to preserve it
from the inroads of man...

896
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,783
...until his abrupt death...

897
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,952
...a few months ago.

898
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:07,583
His body was found in a lonely cottage,
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

899
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,085
There was a bullet in his head...

900
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,046
...and a gun beside him.

901
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,841
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

902
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:20,137
But he died sitting at a computer,
surrounded by his notes...

903
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,057
...for what he called
the case he was born to win.

904
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:27,061
His friends and family ask...

905
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:30,147
...would anyone commit suicide
in such a manner...

906
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:31,774
...at such a time?

907
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:36,278
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

908
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,663
Who's there?

909
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,999
It's Darby!

910
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,188
I got your message.

911
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:59,069
If they bugged your phone,
they'd think I'd left the country.

912
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,203
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

913
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,038
Not yet.

914
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,250
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

915
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,962
I could help you find him.

916
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,466
How'd you find me?

917
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:25,512
I called your editor.

918
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:28,724
He told you?

919
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:36,732
I told him I was your sister Mary
from out of town and couldn't find you.

920
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:41,612
How'd you know I had a sister Mary?

921
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,866
You're not the only one doing research.

922
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:15,145
It was a beautiful service.

923
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,106
Thank you, Mr. President.

924
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:32,454
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

925
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:46,009
It was the right thing to do,
no matter where the body was found.

926
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:56,353
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

927
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,772
You said they'd be vetted this weekend.

928
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:00,774
There must be a change in plans.

929
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:02,567
I don't understand.

930
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,820
The Pelican Brief.

931
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,865
What about the Pelican Brief?

932
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:11,827
I thought that was ancient history.

933
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:15,080
We believe that Grantham's
gotten ahold of it.

934
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,792
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

935
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,294
Not if it's true.

936
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,468
You think it's true?

937
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,471
I know what Grantham will write:

938
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,016
"A man who gave
the president millions...

939
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:37,185
...had two Supreme Court Justices killed
so the president...

940
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,063
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

941
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,482
...so his oil could be harvested. "

942
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:47,571
If Voyles says you told him to back off
the case, we face an obstruction charge.

943
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,323
Oh, Jesus!

944
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,661
There's a way to handle this.

945
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,204
Handle it how?

946
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,125
We appoint two nature-lovers
to the court.

947
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:05,047
Good environmentalists
who'd kill Mattiece and his oil field.

948
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:09,134
Meet with Voyles, in the presence
of the Attorney General...

949
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:12,054
...and demand an investigation
into Mattiece.

950
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:15,015
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

951
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,642
Then we ride out the storm.

952
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:22,939
But there has to be some way to keep
this information from coming out.

953
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,524
I'm working on it.

954
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,070
What?
How?

955
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,529
Mr. President...

956
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,406
...you don't want to know.

957
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:44,378
What's this all about?

958
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:46,463
A trip to Mt. Vernon will do you good.

959
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,131
Are you losing it?

960
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,927
First I order you to go to Little Rock,
you refuse to go.

961
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:55,138
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

962
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,307
...your boss, I might add...

963
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,727
...to drop everything
and meet you at George's place.

964
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,688
I thought of making you unemployed...

965
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,982
...but you'd sue me for discrimination.

966
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,442
She's here.

967
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,986
- The bird girl?
- She's here.

968
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,323
- You could've told me.
- Not wise.

969
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:17,077
By the way, refusing to tell me
where you could be reached...

970
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,079
...didn't leave a good impression.

971
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,082
It's too risky to go to my apartment
or to the job.

972
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,751
- Where have you been?
- In a little hotel.

973
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,712
This is a hell of a time
to punch notches in your belt.

974
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:31,258
We're not in the same hotel.
She's helping me find Garcia.

975
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,010
It sounds like she's in control.

976
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:35,595
It's the only way she'd play.

977
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,140
So what if you can't find Garcia?

978
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:40,183
We go to plan B.
What's that?

979
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,520
We attack the lawyers directly.
What if it's another firm?

980
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,105
We go to plan C.
What's that?

981
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,524
We didn't go that far.
What if you do?

982
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:50,444
I must be able to get in touch with you.

983
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:56,658
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.
Don't use my name.

984
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,243
Write it down.

985
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,372
You mind getting off at the next exit?

986
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:03,748
Why?

987
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:07,127
A tan car's been two cars behind us...

988
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,005
...since we got on the parkway.

989
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:31,151
I thought it was following us.

990
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:32,402
Right.

991
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:17,405
Georgetown Law School, please.

992
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,205
Hurry.

993
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,773
Meet me by the stacks.

994
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,623
Someone was in my room.

995
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,627
Did you tell anyone where you were?

996
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,296
Smith Keen, but he'd never repeat it.

997
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,548
Did you tell him by phone?

998
01:33:58,799 --> 01:33:59,924
No.
We were...

999
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,011
We were in his car.

1000
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,430
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

1001
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,557
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

1002
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:11,144
This is Susan Johnson.
I'm a partner with White & Blazevich.

1003
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:15,148
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

1004
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:19,569
May I have the names of your students
that clerked here last summer?

1005
01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:23,406
I'm from White & Blazevich.
You have something for me?

1006
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:28,244
Would you sign this, please?

1007
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:37,462
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
- You're welcome.

1008
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:40,173
I'll call these five and see who's home.

1009
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:44,552
I'll take the two with no phone number
and get their class schedules.

1010
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:51,893
See you later.

1011
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:00,985
I'm from the Washington Herald.
I'm looking for...

1012
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,697
- ... Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.
- Is there a problem?

1013
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,949
No.
Just a few questions I want to ask.

1014
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,493
Are they in class this morning?

1015
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:12,414
One moment, please.

1016
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,630
Excuse me.

1017
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:22,507
Do you have ID?

1018
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:28,012
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor, please?

1019
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,473
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1020
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,268
I'm sorry to bother you.

1021
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:42,485
Akers has Criminal Procedure,
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1022
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:46,573
I'll try to find them. Maylor,
Reinhart and Wilson were all at home.

1023
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:48,324
I can go to Maylor's.

1024
01:35:50,953 --> 01:35:51,995
Excuse me.

1025
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:56,833
- Do you know Laura Kaas?
- She's the girl with the red backpack.

1026
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:06,342
Do you recognize this man?
He's a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1027
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,053
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1028
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,680
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1029
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,057
I'll get his class schedule.

1030
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:15,101
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1031
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,978
It's me again.

1032
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,482
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1033
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:22,358
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1034
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:27,280
A student you talked to called
White & Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1035
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,575
No more class schedules for reporters.

1036
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,129
Mr. Grantham.

1037
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,090
I know Edward.

1038
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:51,095
He's dropped out of school for a while.
Personal problems.

1039
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:52,847
Where is he?

1040
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,850
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

1041
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,603
He's being detoxified.

1042
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:02,982
Look, he's a good guy.

1043
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,486
Parklane Hospital.

1044
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,428
Good afternoon.

1045
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:35,640
May I see Edward Linney?

1046
01:37:36,433 --> 01:37:38,601
- What room is he in?
- What's your name?

1047
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,771
Gray Grantham, Washington Herald.

1048
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,607
The law school said I could see him.

1049
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:46,609
I'm sorry they did.

1050
01:37:48,153 --> 01:37:51,072
We run this hospital
and they run their law school.

1051
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:54,075
May I see your administrator?

1052
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,453
I'll see if I can find him.

1053
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,397
Mr. Grantham.

1054
01:38:24,648 --> 01:38:26,274
Great architecture.

1055
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,818
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1056
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:31,779
Visitation
is only allowed on the weekend...

1057
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,781
...and then only family.

1058
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:36,618
When will he be discharged?

1059
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,329
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1060
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:43,333
Perhaps when his insurance expires?

1061
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:47,503
Do you recognize that man?

1062
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,423
What's his name?

1063
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:54,260
That's the point, I don't know.

1064
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:57,513
What is his name?

1065
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:04,854
He works in the oil and gas section
on the 9th floor.

1066
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,694
Morgan.

1067
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,365
Yes. Morgan.

1068
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:17,992
His first name's something like...

1069
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,495
...Charles, but that's not it.

1070
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:24,040
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

1071
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,836
When you opened the door...

1072
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:32,048
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1073
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,468
I'm sorry.

1074
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,472
I'll take a hallucination like that...

1075
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,391
...anytime.

1076
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,561
Take care of yourself.

1077
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:53,361
Excuse me, miss. What are you doing?

1078
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,697
Visiting my brother.

1079
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:57,323
Who is your brother?

1080
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:58,574
Edward Linney.

1081
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:01,786
This your sister?

1082
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,085
Yes.

1083
01:40:09,878 --> 01:40:11,337
Leave her alone.

1084
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:14,799
Mom will come on the weekend.

1085
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,300
Sis?

1086
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:18,594
Come back soon.

1087
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:20,304
I'll try.

1088
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:25,309
I know you'd agree with me about
the horrendous cost of health care.

1089
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,061
Of course, of course.

1090
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:31,357
We pride ourselves on our
enlightened policy regarding payment.

1091
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:33,526
Thank you very much for your time.

1092
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,616
We'll be happy to have you back
on any of our normal visiting days.

1093
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,832
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1094
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,470
White & Blazevich, please.

1095
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,972
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

1096
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:25,661
May I help you?

1097
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:28,414
Dorothy Blythe, to see Curtis Morgan.

1098
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:33,044
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

1099
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:10,957
- You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan?
- Yes. At 5.

1100
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:13,918
- When was your appointment?
- Two weeks ago.

1101
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,711
May I ask why?

1102
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:18,714
Obviously, I need an oil and gas lawyer.

1103
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,717
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1104
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,388
Why didn't anyone call me?

1105
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:28,599
We have no record of your appointment.

1106
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:30,768
What happened?

1107
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:33,729
He was mugged a week ago.

1108
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,107
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1109
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,192
Do you have some identification?

1110
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:40,695
He's Security.

1111
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:42,488
Security for what?

1112
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,200
Come with us,
you should see someone else.

1113
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:50,830
After this treatment, I have no interest
in talking to anyone in this firm.

1114
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:09,932
They killed him!

1115
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,442
I can't breathe!

1116
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:38,461
It's all right.
Just let it go.

1117
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:39,795
Let it go.

1118
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,177
It's all right.

1119
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:57,188
We ran the story about a week ago.
It's just another mugging.

1120
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:59,899
Didn't make the Metro front page.

1121
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,525
Curtis Morgan...

1122
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:04,320
...225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1123
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,281
225 Willow Road...

1124
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:09,325
...Bethesda.

1125
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:11,202
That's what I wanted.

1126
01:44:11,536 --> 01:44:15,206
Report in before noon tomorrow.
We're nervous over here.

1127
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,291
You know...

1128
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:19,669
...good help is hard to find.

1129
01:44:26,718 --> 01:44:28,344
I'm going with you.

1130
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,183
Look at me.

1131
01:44:43,026 --> 01:44:44,860
I want you to leave.

1132
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:50,700
And if you need confirmation
for your story?

1133
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:52,868
I'm on my own.

1134
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:58,708
What's changed your mind?

1135
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,714
I want you to reach 25.

1136
01:45:11,346 --> 01:45:12,847
I'm coming.

1137
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:42,626
Good evening.

1138
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:45,421
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1139
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:49,925
- Could we see Mrs. Morgan?
- I'm her father. She won't talk.

1140
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:54,013
I respect her privacy.
I know she's been through an ordeal.

1141
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,767
When did you people
ever respect anyone's privacy?

1142
01:45:58,977 --> 01:46:03,272
I feel that way about most reporters.
But her husband called me...

1143
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,983
...3 times before he died.

1144
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,819
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1145
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,407
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

1146
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,204
You change your mind...

1147
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,831
...I'Il be at this number.

1148
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:32,486
Mr. Grantham?
Yes.

1149
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:35,114
This is Mrs. Morgan.

1150
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,201
Do you still want to see me?

1151
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:44,290
Did you know your husband called me?

1152
01:47:48,044 --> 01:47:51,046
No. How would he know
anything about those dead judges?

1153
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:54,008
I have no idea.

1154
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,760
Did he keep any...

1155
01:47:57,053 --> 01:47:59,096
...unusual documents...

1156
01:47:59,389 --> 01:48:00,514
...or papers?

1157
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:05,394
We have a lock box at the bank
for deed and wills.

1158
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:10,774
I looked at it last Thursday.
There was nothing unusual in it.

1159
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:14,570
On Saturday morning...

1160
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:16,906
...I was going through his...

1161
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,826
...desk in the bedroom.

1162
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:24,163
I found something a bit unusual.

1163
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:27,458
A key.

1164
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,836
A key to what?

1165
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:34,465
Another lock box.

1166
01:48:36,426 --> 01:48:37,551
Which bank?

1167
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:40,846
Riggs Bank.

1168
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:46,101
We've never banked there.

1169
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:49,188
And you knew nothing
about this other...

1170
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:51,065
...box?

1171
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,942
Not until Saturday morning.

1172
01:48:53,568 --> 01:48:55,319
I figured...

1173
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:58,489
...I'Il run by when I felt up to it.

1174
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:01,951
Maybe you should check it, Mrs. Morgan.

1175
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:06,580
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1176
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:10,584
Are you saying Curtis was killed...

1177
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,837
...because he knew something
about the assassinations?

1178
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:16,298
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1179
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:22,096
Do you think there
may be papers in the safe-deposit box...

1180
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:25,891
...that may reveal what Curtis knew
about the assassinations?

1181
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:28,352
There could be.

1182
01:49:31,022 --> 01:49:33,315
My child's lost one parent.

1183
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,405
I can't let her lose another.

1184
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:43,492
I'll check it for you.

1185
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:46,328
No one has to know you have the key.

1186
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:53,335
They will only give it to his wife.

1187
01:49:53,628 --> 01:49:56,046
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

1188
01:49:57,841 --> 01:49:59,383
I would have one condition.

1189
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:04,430
If you find something that disparages
my husband in any way, you can't use it.

1190
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,433
You have my word, Mrs. Morgan.

1191
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:44,238
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

1192
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:45,739
Down those steps.

1193
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:09,198
I need access to a box, please.

1194
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,533
- The number, please?
-616.

1195
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:18,582
- This box was rented two weeks ago.
- Yes.

1196
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,752
- I assume you're Mrs. Morgan?
- Sara Ann Morgan.

1197
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:24,838
- The address?
-225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1198
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,760
- Phone number?
-301-555-7128.

1199
01:53:30,553 --> 01:53:32,054
Who rented this box?

1200
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:35,057
- My husband, Curtis D. Morgan.
- And his social security number?

1201
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:43,148
510-96-8686.

1202
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:46,568
Will you sign here, please?

1203
01:53:47,278 --> 01:53:48,362
May I help you?

1204
01:53:48,571 --> 01:53:50,447
I'd like to rent a box.

1205
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:53,742
Will you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.

1206
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:56,620
You have a key?

1207
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:58,247
Yes, I do.

1208
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:01,750
Follow me.

1209
01:55:42,852 --> 01:55:44,853
It's a four-page affidavit...

1210
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:47,689
...signed under oath.

1211
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:51,026
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

1212
01:55:53,863 --> 01:55:58,700
He worked at White & Blazevich
in the oil and gas section for 5 years.

1213
01:55:59,994 --> 01:56:01,119
Listen to this!

1214
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:02,704
During that time...

1215
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:07,542
...he worked for a client who
was engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana.

1216
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,879
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece...

1217
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,714
...who he's never met.

1218
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:17,010
Lots about the lawsuit,
how desperate Mattiece was to win it.

1219
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,887
Just as if you wrote it.

1220
01:56:20,723 --> 01:56:23,725
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

1221
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:28,146
...supervised the case for W & B.
Morgan worked on a peripherated case.

1222
01:56:28,564 --> 01:56:32,109
He took files and documents
that Wakefield left for him...

1223
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:34,027
...not related to the case.

1224
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:38,907
When he got back to his own office, he
found a memo on the bottom of the stack.

1225
01:56:39,117 --> 01:56:42,244
He'd inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk.

1226
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:45,414
A copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit.

1227
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:50,252
He copied the memo and left the memo
under the files on his desk.

1228
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:52,754
Next stop, Washington Herald!

1229
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:57,259
No! Stop!
Get out of the car!

1230
02:00:12,121 --> 02:00:15,874
There was a car explosion
in a garage near the Riggs Bank.

1231
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:19,294
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1232
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:22,631
It was rented yesterday by Grantham.

1233
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:27,135
Have you heard from Grantham?

1234
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:29,971
Not since yesterday.

1235
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:33,642
I should've taken him off that story.

1236
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:35,644
What story?

1237
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:40,815
See what you can find.

1238
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,421
Smith Keen...

1239
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,674
...meet Darby Shaw.

1240
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,636
So, Mr. Grantham...

1241
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:11,680
...what the hell is going on?

1242
02:01:21,857 --> 02:01:24,818
Sweetheart, I'm down here
in the basement.

1243
02:01:26,445 --> 02:01:28,571
It's about two in the morning.

1244
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,450
This is...

1245
02:01:33,327 --> 02:01:34,369
...an affidavit...

1246
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:39,708
...concerning a memo
I found on my desk.

1247
02:01:41,168 --> 02:01:45,005
I'm going to trust you
to do with it what you will.

1248
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:49,384
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

1249
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:55,390
It was dated September 28th...

1250
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:59,519
...addressed to Wakefield and it read:

1251
02:01:59,729 --> 02:02:02,355
"Sims, advise client
research is complete.

1252
02:02:03,065 --> 02:02:06,901
The bench will sit much softer
if the old man is retired.

1253
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:11,281
The second retirement is a bit unusual.
Jensen, of all people.

1254
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:15,744
Advise further that the pelican
should arrive here in 4 years...

1255
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,079
...assuming other factors. "

1256
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,373
There's no signature.

1257
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:24,502
Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen
were killed.

1258
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:30,884
I firmly believe that this is
the work of Mattiece and his associates.

1259
02:02:31,218 --> 02:02:34,012
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,
but it refers to a client.

1260
02:02:34,263 --> 02:02:36,431
Wakefield had no other clients.

1261
02:02:36,807 --> 02:02:39,309
And no client had as much to gain
from the new court.

1262
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:46,232
I thought that I was protecting us
by not revealing what I found.

1263
02:02:47,276 --> 02:02:50,528
You'll only see this if I'm gone,
so I will have failed.

1264
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:54,324
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1265
02:02:59,246 --> 02:03:01,081
I'll always be with you.

1266
02:03:03,334 --> 02:03:04,584
Always.

1267
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:11,341
This is Marty Velmano. What a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

1268
02:03:12,176 --> 02:03:14,969
We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece...

1269
02:03:15,971 --> 02:03:20,100
...and his involvement in the deaths
of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1270
02:03:20,601 --> 02:03:25,188
Great! We'll sue you for the next 20
years. You'll be named as a defendant.

1271
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,565
Oh, this will be great.

1272
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:30,318
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald.

1273
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:34,489
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?
We have a copy of it.

1274
02:03:35,157 --> 02:03:39,077
We also have a copy of a memo
sent by you to Sims Wakefield...

1275
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:43,832
...in which you suggest your client's
position would be greatly improved...

1276
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:48,128
...by the removal of Rosenberg
and Jensen from the court.

1277
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:51,005
I noticed you waited till five.

1278
02:03:51,215 --> 02:03:54,384
An hour earlier, we could've
run to court, stopped this.

1279
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:56,886
You deny you wrote the memo?

1280
02:04:00,307 --> 02:04:02,308
It's a fabrication.

1281
02:04:03,102 --> 02:04:05,395
You have no lawsuit, Mr. Velmano.

1282
02:04:06,188 --> 02:04:07,522
You know it.

1283
02:04:07,898 --> 02:04:09,524
You son of a bitch!

1284
02:04:12,695 --> 02:04:14,154
Mr. Coal?

1285
02:04:14,488 --> 02:04:17,615
Have you read the Pelican Brief?
I have.

1286
02:04:17,908 --> 02:04:22,203
We're running a story which verifies
the facts set forth in that brief.

1287
02:04:22,496 --> 02:04:25,665
We've confirmed Mattiece
contributed over $4 million...

1288
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:27,876
...to the president's last campaign.

1289
02:04:28,169 --> 02:04:30,503
4,200,000, all through legal channels.

1290
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:31,796
That's right.

1291
02:04:31,964 --> 02:04:36,217
We believe the White House tried
to obstruct the FBl investigation...

1292
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:39,179
...and we wonder
if there are any comments.

1293
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:42,640
The White House denies
any direct or indirect involvement...

1294
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:45,185
...in this investigation.

1295
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,229
You've received some bad information.

1296
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:58,281
Mr. Voyles, it's Grantham.

1297
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:02,410
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

1298
02:05:02,661 --> 02:05:04,913
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1299
02:05:05,206 --> 02:05:09,250
We're naming Mattiece, an oil
speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1300
02:05:09,585 --> 02:05:13,463
We believe the FBl knew about Mattiece,
but didn't investigate...

1301
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:17,258
...at the urging of the White House.
Any comments?

1302
02:06:29,456 --> 02:06:32,542
I think we'll have great
success with these people.

1303
02:06:32,835 --> 02:06:35,503
They were really very pleased...

1304
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:38,172
...and genuinely cooperative.

1305
02:06:38,757 --> 02:06:40,008
What's up?

1306
02:07:24,094 --> 02:07:25,303
You know Gray Grantham.

1307
02:07:27,598 --> 02:07:29,515
And this is Darby Shaw.

1308
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:40,818
So you're the little lady
who started this great brouhaha.

1309
02:07:42,363 --> 02:07:45,573
I think you have me confused
with the president's friend.

1310
02:07:46,825 --> 02:07:50,411
I have some comments,
for the record.

1311
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:02,090
First, we got the Pelican Brief
two weeks ago...

1312
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:05,259
...and submitted it to the White House
on the same day.

1313
02:08:05,469 --> 02:08:10,390
It was not considered high priority in
the investigation until Gavin Verheek...

1314
02:08:10,724 --> 02:08:13,768
...Special Counsel to the Director,
was found murdered.

1315
02:08:13,977 --> 02:08:17,105
Did the White House interfere
in the FBl investigation of Mattiece?

1316
02:08:18,607 --> 02:08:20,358
I'll discuss it...

1317
02:08:20,609 --> 02:08:21,901
...off the record.

1318
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:34,455
Last Wednesday the president asked me
to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1319
02:08:34,748 --> 02:08:36,290
In his words...

1320
02:08:36,917 --> 02:08:38,751
...he asked me to "back off. "

1321
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:41,129
I have a tape...

1322
02:08:41,672 --> 02:08:44,132
...which I will allow no one to hear...

1323
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:47,301
...unless the president
first denies this.

1324
02:08:48,137 --> 02:08:49,637
So what do you do now?

1325
02:08:50,889 --> 02:08:54,892
There'll be a grand jury by
noon tomorrow. Quick indictments.

1326
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:58,438
And we'll find Mattiece.

1327
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:03,776
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms. Shaw.

1328
02:09:04,486 --> 02:09:06,279
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

1329
02:09:06,488 --> 02:09:08,406
I'd like Mr. Grantham to stay.

1330
02:09:29,178 --> 02:09:30,720
What's next for you?

1331
02:09:31,805 --> 02:09:34,307
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek?

1332
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:37,310
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1333
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:41,189
Off the record, Khamel was killed
by a contract operative...

1334
02:09:41,482 --> 02:09:43,483
...hired independently by the CIA.

1335
02:09:44,526 --> 02:09:45,568
Rupert?

1336
02:09:45,861 --> 02:09:47,528
He probably has 20 names.

1337
02:09:47,738 --> 02:09:48,988
Why was he following her?

1338
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:54,035
I think the brief initially
scared Giminski more than anyone.

1339
02:09:54,244 --> 02:09:55,745
And he probably...

1340
02:09:56,038 --> 02:09:57,121
...sent Rupert...

1341
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:59,207
...to trail Darby...

1342
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:02,710
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

1343
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:09,217
We can help.
What do you want?

1344
02:10:11,678 --> 02:10:13,554
To leave the country, alone.

1345
02:10:16,725 --> 02:10:17,850
All right.

1346
02:10:18,393 --> 02:10:21,270
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1347
02:10:21,605 --> 02:10:24,190
We'll fly you anywhere you want
and you can disappear.

1348
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:27,068
But you must allow me to contact you...

1349
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:28,903
...through Mr. Grantham...

1350
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:32,698
...if, and only if,
it becomes urgently necessary.

1351
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,202
That's fine.

1352
02:10:38,914 --> 02:10:42,208
I want no one on the plane but me,
Gray and the pilots.

1353
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:46,045
After takeoff, I'll tell the pilot
where to go.

1354
02:10:46,713 --> 02:10:49,924
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

1355
02:10:50,634 --> 02:10:53,052
You're the director of the FBl.

1356
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:55,513
Set it up.

1357
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,459
Our guest today is Gray Grantham...

1358
02:14:53,752 --> 02:14:56,670
...who has, as just about everyone
in America knows...

1359
02:14:57,047 --> 02:15:01,884
...revealed the plot behind the
assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1360
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:05,888
The ripple effects of this story
just don't seem to stop.

1361
02:15:06,181 --> 02:15:10,309
As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,
one of the country's richest men...

1362
02:15:10,519 --> 02:15:13,979
...has been indicted, along with
4 aides and lawyers.

1363
02:15:14,397 --> 02:15:18,526
Fletcher Coal, the president's Chief
of Staff, has resigned.

1364
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:22,363
And we're getting strong indications
that the president himself...

1365
02:15:22,572 --> 02:15:24,031
...will not run again.

1366
02:15:24,699 --> 02:15:27,535
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

1367
02:15:28,912 --> 02:15:33,207
We know the Pelican Brief was written
by a woman named Darby Shaw...

1368
02:15:33,416 --> 02:15:35,709
...but we don't know who that is.

1369
02:15:35,919 --> 02:15:37,920
Who is Darby Shaw?

1370
02:15:40,382 --> 02:15:43,008
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1371
02:15:43,218 --> 02:15:47,847
Next question.
Speaking for many of our colleagues...

1372
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:50,891
...who are in a feeding frenzy to
interview her...

1373
02:15:51,184 --> 02:15:52,935
...where is Darby Shaw?

1374
02:15:53,228 --> 02:15:57,565
That's also a question for Darby Shaw.
But she's not available...

1375
02:15:57,858 --> 02:16:00,401
...to answer questions
until the feeding frenzy stops.

1376
02:16:01,236 --> 02:16:04,196
Does that mean
you don't know where she is?

1377
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:06,532
I didn't say that.

1378
02:16:06,825 --> 02:16:08,117
Then you do know.

1379
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:14,582
I take it this cryptic smile means...

1380
02:16:14,833 --> 02:16:16,417
...you're not answering.

1381
02:16:18,753 --> 02:16:22,047
In view of all this, you know that...

1382
02:16:22,841 --> 02:16:24,258
...there's speculation...

1383
02:16:24,467 --> 02:16:28,095
...that this woman is a figment
of your imagination.

1384
02:16:28,388 --> 02:16:32,099
That you created her
from a lot of different sources.

1385
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:36,353
Just as there are people who believe
there was no Deep Throat...

1386
02:16:36,605 --> 02:16:39,899
...there are those who believe
there is no Darby Shaw.

1387
02:16:40,108 --> 02:16:43,611
In other words,
she's just too good to be true.

1388
02:16:44,863 --> 02:16:46,405
She almost is.
