1
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,802
This is
the third opposition leader

2
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,138
assassinated in Bolivia
in the past month.

3
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,908
The situation down there
has been a mess

4
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,541
since President Carrizales
took over.

5
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,176
So you think
that President Carrizales

6
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,946
is taking out his enemies
to ensure his re-election?

7
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,180
It appears that way.

8
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,548
But many countries
are about to have

9
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,251
a renewed interest in Bolivia,
including the U.S.

10
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,720
- Lithium.
- Exactly.

11
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,522
Turns out that Bolivia sits
on the world's largest deposits.

12
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,991
Every battery needs it.
Every cellphone needs it.

13
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,694
The leader who controls Bolivia
will have the power

14
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,664
to influence the most important
currency in the world... energy.

15
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,666
And we're hoping that leader
will be Javier León.

16
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,070
He's a moderate,
married to a schoolteacher...

17
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,973
brother's a priest,
a man of the people,

18
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,075
and someone we can work with.

19
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,177
Who has a target on his back.

20
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,779
The state department
is quietly sending

21
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,582
the undersecretary of state
to meet with León in two days.

22
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,518
It is imperative
that he remain alive.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,287
I have an asset down there

24
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,022
who can assist your team
when they arrive.

25
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,059
Whoever the killer is,
he's good.

26
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,930
And the president doesn't
want to take any chances.

27
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,271
Not bad. Not bad.

28
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,574
Not bad?
I threaded the needle.

29
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,943
Let me show you how it's done.

30
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,082
Okay, I'm just gonna study
your form.

31
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,059
Boom.
Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,094
Mm, it looks like we have

33
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,662
a bit of a runaway over there
on the left.

34
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,764
Should we put out an A.P.B.?
It might have fled the state.

35
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,201
- You distracted me.
- Mm.

36
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,405
- Jameson.
- Morning.

37
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,742
I haven't seen you down here
in a while.

38
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,011
I guess
he's shooting off memos.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,282
Okay,
Special Agent Chris Jameson,

40
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,750
let's see what you got.

41
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,697
That's how you shoot off
a memo.

42
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,899
No strays.

43
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:29,974
Lillian needs us
at C-Doc.

44
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,609
This is a series of photos

45
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,544
that was taken by an ATM
outside of LA Paz

46
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,214
just moments after the vicente
assassination in the brothel.

47
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,215
I know it's hard
to make him out here.

48
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,050
We don't have
a positive I.D. yet,

49
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:43,454
but we believe that
it's the same man seen here.

50
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,190
Same hat, same jacket.

51
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,660
And this was taken a little
while after the second killing.

52
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,229
If he committed
three assassinations,

53
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,198
we have every reason
to believe that he's the one

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,633
that's now targeting
Javier León.

55
00:03:56,635 --> 00:04:00,003
Gabriel.
Do you recognize him?

56
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,873
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,708
Lieutenant John Norris.

58
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,478
- Lieutenant?
- Delta Force, tier 1.

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,746
Is the chip telling you that?

60
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,582
Don't need the chip.

61
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,518
He was my best friend.

62
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,831
Gabriel Vaughn, one of our nation's
most decorated soldiers.

63
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:33,737
He's a hero, and now our
country's most secret weapon.

64
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,573
Gabriel possesses
a rare genetic mutation

65
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,476
that allowed us to implant
a microchip in his brain.

66
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,079
We connected his mind directly
to the information grid.

67
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,415
It's something the chip does
that nobody expected.

68
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,485
I can create a virtual snapshot
of an event in my mind

69
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,552
and then walk through it.

70
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:51,254
It's like
a virtual evidence wall.

71
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,522
At U.S. Cyber Command,

72
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:55,558
we created a highly
specialized unit around him...

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,726
Satellite in five.

74
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,596
And assigned
an agent to protect him.

75
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,997
Run!

76
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,266
He's the first of his kind...

77
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,669
the next evolution
of intelligence.

78
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:11,477
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

79
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,327
So, how does a... special-forces
soldier like Norris,

80
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,663
that kind of résumé,

81
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,433
become a hired mercenary for a
crazed despot in South America?

82
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:38,571
Combat's addictive.
No other rush like it.

83
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,672
A lot of guys start jonesing

84
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:43,208
the minute they leave
the battlefield.

85
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,545
But to become an assassin?

86
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,515
Were there any warning signs
with Norris?

87
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:53,519
Psychological spikes,
morally questionable behavior?

88
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,192
Morally questionable behavior.

89
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,862
Yeah.

90
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,899
It's called war.

91
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,774
There.
Go, go!

92
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,843
Aah!

93
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,679
Come on. Come on.

94
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,115
Aah!
Ohh.

95
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,185
- Aah!
- You good?

96
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,621
Hang on. Hang on.

97
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,459
My tank's empty, bro.

98
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,995
I counted 15 of them.

99
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,931
I'm out.

100
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,967
I got, uh, five rounds.

101
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,902
You got to keep moving.
I'll dig in here.

102
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,171
Ah, funny guy.

103
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,039
You never were that good
at math, Norris.

104
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,374
Even if you hit them
with all 5 rounds,

105
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,709
that still leaves 10 of them
to kill us.

106
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,145
Oh, they won't kill us.
They'll torture us.

107
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,419
Good. For a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.

108
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,988
All right.

109
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,958
You sit tight.
I'm gonna draw them off.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,827
I'll circle back around
for you.

111
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,096
That's your plan?

112
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,397
What's the first rule of delta?

113
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,533
Everybody goes home. Everybody goes home.
That's right.

114
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,937
All right.
You hang on to this.

115
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,838
Come on.

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,908
What am I gonna do with one bullet?
Just in case.

117
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,744
Don't want to end up on YouTube

118
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,246
with your head chopped off,
do you?

119
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,582
Hey. Johnny.

120
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,918
Thanks, bro.

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,953
Of course.

122
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,878
We're landing.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,414
Gabriel, look.
I know he's your friend.

124
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,082
<i>Was</i> my friend.

125
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,518
What happened between you two?

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,721
He used to say
I was his conscience.

127
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,556
That doesn't sound so bad.

128
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,925
He didn't want a conscience.

129
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,063
So, going up against him...

130
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,732
Not a problem.

131
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,842
Is that our CIA contact?

132
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,678
Agent Dale Cogan.

133
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,248
He set up the meet
with Javier León.

134
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,544
Hello.
I'm Javier León.

135
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,645
This is my wife, Marcela.

136
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:12,316
Agent Vaughn.
This is Agent Jameson.

137
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,551
Agent Neal's keeping
an eye outside.

138
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,986
It's a pleasure to meet you.

139
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,621
The pleasure's ours, sir.

140
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,989
So, how does this work?

141
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,791
I'll bring you
to a secure safe house,

142
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,192
and you'll remain with me there

143
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,928
until the undersecretary and his
team have arrived in country.

144
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,531
Agent Jameson will then take you
to the location of the meeting.

145
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,266
And where will that be?

146
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,234
It's better
if we don't tell you that yet.

147
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:34,171
At this point,
any information is need-to-know.

148
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,306
You don't trust me,
señor Vaughn?

149
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,208
Respectfully, sir,
we don't know your team.

150
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,311
This is my wife's brother,
nestor.

151
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,814
He's the primary reason
we're still alive.

152
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,686
You played two seasons as
a midfielder for Banda Roja.

153
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:52,355
- You follow LA Paz football?
- A little bit.

154
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,858
- Gabriel.
- Mucho gusto.

155
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,695
And what will you be doing,
Agent Vaughn,

156
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,865
while Señor Jameson is
keeping us so safe?

157
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,566
I'm gonna find the man
who wants you dead.

158
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,836
No matter how I feel about
the men who have been killed,

159
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:10,039
assassination is the lowest form
of political protest.

160
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,875
When you find those
who are responsible

161
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,546
for the murder of my opponents,
please bring them to justice.

162
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,081
We'll do our best, sir.

163
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,921
The package is safe
and on its way to the kitchen.

164
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,023
<i>And you're certain nobody</i>
<i>was following you?</i>

165
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,525
As certain as I can be,
given we didn't set up the meet.

166
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,361
Is your guy Cogan reliable?

167
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,129
Of course.

168
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,566
<i>He's also our only covert asset</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

169
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,502
<i>If anyone would have the intel on
Norris, it would be Agent Cogan.</i>

170
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,370
Well, we're about to meet him.

171
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,439
Nice digs.

172
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,808
When you guys say “clandestine”"
you really mean it.

173
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,878
<i>Talk to you crazy kids later.</i>

174
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,881
I don't appreciate his manner.

175
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,084
You'll get used to it.
Sort of.

176
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,595
You sightseeing?

177
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:10,399
It's a secret service tick.

178
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,902
I don't like going into places
where the only exit I know of

179
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,570
is the door we're walking in.

180
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,206
Relax. Uncle Sam pays the rent.
It's all wired.

181
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
There's a security camera
above that door.

182
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,844
I'm looking back at us
right now. Say “cheese”"

183
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:25,047
let's go.

184
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,456
Something's wrong.
Get behind me.

185
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,891
<i>You</i> get behind me.

186
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,526
Riley.
Gabriel.

187
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,662
Together, then.
One, two...

188
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:43,365
Three.

189
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,401
- Is that Cogan?
- It's him.

190
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:52,107
Norris!

191
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:55,410
Norris!

192
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,915
Norris is in the back
of the house.

193
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,516
Gabriel!

194
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,684
You tripped something.

195
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,720
Run!

196
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,799
Are you okay?

197
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,735
Ugh. I think so.

198
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,137
Are you?

199
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,843
That was close.

200
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,184
He's gone.

201
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,522
We lost him.

202
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,541
So, what's our theory on this?

203
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,844
Norris found out
the CIA was tracking him,

204
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,945
so he killed Cogan.

205
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,546
And booby-traps the apartment
to take out

206
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,048
any other spook
who shows up there.

207
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,017
Now that he's seen me,
it just got personal.

208
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,219
And for you, is it personal?

209
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,920
No.

210
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:06,224
He's just a guy we have to
bring down, nothing more.

211
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,992
Who are you calling?

212
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,628
C-doc. We have to tell them
Norris killed Cogan.

213
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,963
I have a better idea.

214
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,832
Let's call Norris.

215
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,767
How do you plan on doing that?

216
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,002
He's got a cellphone on him.

217
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,437
I caught the digits
right before the room blew.

218
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,605
Can you use it to track him?

219
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,007
He's too smart
to use a next-gen phone.

220
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,175
What do you mean?

221
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,510
The older ones don't have GPS...
harder to track.

222
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,613
We'd have to triangulate
off three towers.

223
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,314
And we're in Bolivia.
We're lucky we have one.

224
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,416
So you're just gonna call him?

225
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:34,285
Why not?

226
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:40,357
Yeah?

227
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:44,261
Where are
you running to, Johnny?

228
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,298
Believe me,
I'm as surprised as you are.

229
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,402
The hell are you doing here?

230
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,770
I came to see you.

231
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,874
So what's your game, brah?
Who are you working for?

232
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,210
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

233
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,313
We need to meet.
I want to talk.

234
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,883
No, we don't need to talk.
You need to step off.

235
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,551
Or what, Johnny?

236
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:10,320
You know better
than to ask me that.

237
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,595
Did he threaten you?

238
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,931
It's just the way
he says hello.

239
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:30,374
Don't shoot, bro.
Might need that bullet.

240
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,419
Aah!

241
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:55,298
You said this place was clear.
It is.

242
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Come on. Come on. Get up.

243
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,469
Come on.

244
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,508
Where the hell are they?

245
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,711
Relax.
I got it covered.

246
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:10,146
Come on.

247
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,351
Aah!

248
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,328
Shut up.

249
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,163
Are you out of your mind?

250
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:32,902
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

251
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,672
I won't hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

252
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,709
Shh. Shh.
Great scream.

253
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,631
Why don't you set off a flare
while you're at it?

254
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,213
Where's the father?

255
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,882
Wasn't here.

256
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:48,165
He's probably one of the guys
out there trying to kill us.

257
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,595
No. We're not animals.

258
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,864
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

259
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,811
<i> We could</i>
<i>have tracked that number.</i>

260
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,113
No, we couldn't have, Lillian.

261
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,648
Not out here,
not without a satellite.

262
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,815
Why don't we have a satellite?

263
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,684
The closest one is over Mexico.

264
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:23,653
It'll take hours to get it
in place.

265
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,654
<i>Look, I know this man.</i>
<i>We bled together.</i>

266
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:26,989
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I could talk him down.</i>

267
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,424
<i>I didn't send you there</i>
<i>to talk him down.</i>

268
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,192
<i>I sent you there</i>
<i>to take him out.</i>

269
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:31,694
So, what?
I'm an assassin now?

270
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,329
You press a button,
and I kill a man?

271
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:34,396
Yes, as a matter of fact.

272
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,098
I press a button
and you kill a man.

273
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,867
That's how it works.
Are we clear?

274
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,637
Yeah, we're clear.

275
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,176
You and I might
become friends after all.

276
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,845
Unlikely.

277
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,921
I wish my students
were more like that.

278
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:00,756
Like what?

279
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,892
Straight to the books, no matter
how awful the situation.

280
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,128
And what is so awful?

281
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,332
That we have to be in a place
like this, hiding like cowards.

282
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:14,369
When Cleopatra was at war
with her brother

283
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,004
for the throne of Alexandria,

284
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,107
there was one prize
that she needed first.

285
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,076
Caesar.

286
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,412
If she could seduce Caesar...

287
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,148
Mm... She'd have a
titan for an ally.

288
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,085
And are you prepared to lift
your dress for America?

289
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,687
Okay, your men are outside.

290
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,822
Nestor will remain
in the house with us.

291
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,757
What do you have there?

292
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,593
It's a blueprint. There's
a control room downstairs.

293
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:48,904
The Bolivians officially
ejected the U.S. in '84.

294
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,338
The CIA needed to protect

295
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
their people who were still
in the country,

296
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,209
so they built
these safe houses.

297
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,449
Technology's a little outdated.

298
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,952
It should still work.

299
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,089
Now we have eyes.

300
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:11,059
What about communication?

301
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:14,729
Well, there's no cell tower
in the area.

302
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,598
Fortunately,
we brought our own.

303
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,099
A mobile satellite terminal.

304
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,467
With this puppy,
we'll be able to remain

305
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,970
in direct communication
with our team at all times.

306
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,972
Okay, you two should
get some rest.

307
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,907
The undersecretary will be here
in the morning.

308
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,775
Here?
It's the perfect location.

309
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,879
It's rural, secluded, and
it's completely off the grid.

310
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,348
Sounds like the making
of a ghost story.

311
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,883
Let's hope not.

312
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:38,319
Do you think Cogan
had anything on his computer

313
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,821
that will help us find Norris?

314
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,657
If he did, we'll never know it.
This thing's too far gone.

315
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,059
I can't get anything off it.

316
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,428
You said that you and Norris
were once best friends.

317
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,896
What happened?

318
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,835
Fallujah.

319
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,804
Fubar clusterbang
if I ever saw one.

320
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:00,541
We shouldn't have survived it,
but we did.

321
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,244
After that,
our backs were glued together.

322
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:06,414
Combat changes people.

323
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,082
No.

324
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:10,785
It reveals them.

325
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:15,022
Killing a human being
for the first time

326
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,124
makes a normal person
sick to the stomach.

327
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:18,993
For others, it's an appetizer.

328
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,928
It makes them hungry for more.

329
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,497
And that's Norris.

330
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,967
By the time I left
my last tour,

331
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,737
he wasn't the same guy I knew.

332
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,038
I'd lost him.

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,309
There's just one thing
I can't wrap my head around.

334
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,510
What's that?

335
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,279
Why didn't he kill us?

336
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:39,647
What are you talking about?

337
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:41,515
He set a trap for us
at the apartment.

338
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,716
Almost blew our heads off.

339
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:45,219
That trip laser wasn't meant
for us specifically.

340
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:47,688
Norris got what he needed,

341
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,890
set a trap for whoever else
came in.

342
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,592
It just happened to be us.

343
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:53,027
But when he saw your face,

344
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,562
he could have headed us off
and taken us out, but he didn't.

345
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,602
What are you thinking?

346
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:05,272
You just said Norris
got what he needed from Cogan.

347
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:09,076
The safe house...
Cogan knew the location.

348
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,883
Gabriel. Jameson, he
knows you're there.

349
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,087
Jameson, can you hear me?!
Norris is coming!

350
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,558
He's already here.

351
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:33,333
Why is he just standing there?

352
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:36,770
He knows we're watching.
He's trying to lure us out.

353
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:45,278
No, no, no.

354
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,546
What are they doing?

355
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:49,149
I sent them out there
to kill him.

356
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,254
Okay.

357
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,922
Do you know how to use this?
Of course.

358
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,058
You and Marcela lock yourselves
in here when we leave.

359
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,098
Let's go.

360
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,939
Stand behind me.
No, no.

361
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,107
Of the two of us, Javi,

362
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,376
I'm the only one
who's served in the military.

363
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,778
Give me that gun
before you shoot yourself.

364
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,658
Aah! Ohh!

365
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:50,619
Norris, I know you're in here!

366
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,023
Jameson's down.

367
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,825
I don't know how he got inside.

368
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,329
Looks like the bullet
went through.

369
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,032
Take it easy, nestor.
Is he gone?

370
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:05,567
He went that way.

371
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:06,668
Where's Javier and Marcela?

372
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,136
They're safe.
They're in the control room.

373
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,072
Norris has got to be close.
He doesn't give up.

374
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:11,640
Riley, you stay here
with Jameson.

375
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,475
You don't actually think
you're going after Norris alone?

376
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,510
I know how he thinks.
You gonna be all right?

377
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:16,444
Stellar.

378
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:18,713
Keep pressure on it.
Gabriel.

379
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:21,683
We can't lose Norris, and you can't
let Jameson bleed out. Thanks.

380
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:24,686
What do you suggest?
Be careful.

381
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,412
Can't get away, Johnny!

382
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:54,015
I'm better at this than you!

383
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,951
That's your problem!

384
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:59,087
You always thought
you were better!

385
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,421
You want to hunt a tiger,

386
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,590
you better take him down
in one shot!

387
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,897
Satellite in place?
Yes.

388
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,567
Thermal is detecting gunfire.

389
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:15,470
Can you isolate that?

390
00:24:15,472 --> 00:24:17,071
Gabriel, can you hear me?

391
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,073
Not a great time right now.

392
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:21,309
We just got off with Riley
and heard what happened.

393
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:24,112
Okay, I really got to run.

394
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,723
The satellite is just now
getting into position.

395
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,024
Can you access the feed?

396
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,926
Technically,
that'd be cheating.

397
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:40,428
Excuse me?

398
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,831
Never mind.

399
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,704
Did you lose the connection?

400
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:52,073
He just cut it himself.

401
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,985
There's no place you can go
I can't find you, Norris!

402
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,335
Norris!

403
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,011
Here I am.

404
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:32,880
You got the shot.

405
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:36,083
Question is,
do you got the steel?

406
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:44,224
What a surprise.
He can't do it.

407
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:46,326
I don't have to, Johnny.

408
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,095
Why's that?

409
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:52,399
You're standing in the middle
of a minefield.

410
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,738
Prom-1
anti-personnel mines.

411
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,474
Planted by pinochet
in the '70s.

412
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,743
Hard to see,
but, you know, effective.

413
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,814
You want to survive,
you're gonna need me.

414
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,517
Don't take another step!

415
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,054
There's a nut-cutter three feet,
two inches in front of you.

416
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,922
How the hell do you know that?

417
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:18,425
I got a satellite.
In your brain?

418
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:19,893
Also, the Bolivian military

419
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:21,828
kept detailed maps
of the minefields.

420
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,364
Which you somehow memorized.

421
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,202
Are you insane?!

422
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,638
You're gonna have to trust me
if you want to get out of there!

423
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,940
I know where the mines are,

424
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:38,311
but you're gonna have to follow
my instructions exactly.

425
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:42,382
Turn to me.
Take two steps forward.

426
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,188
Unh-unh-unh!

427
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,622
Simon didn't say.

428
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:52,559
That's not funny, man.

429
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,895
You always were too serious.

430
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,097
Go ahead.

431
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:08,007
All right.
One step to your left.

432
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:14,647
You see that rock?

433
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,150
Stay to the right of that rock.

434
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:29,562
Before you take another step,

435
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,664
we're gonna put our guns away.

436
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,799
You think I would shoot you
after this?

437
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,835
Yeah, Johnny, I do.

438
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,681
One step to your left.

439
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:50,349
Make that log.
You're home free.

440
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,966
Thanks, bro.

441
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,102
Hey, hey!

442
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:14,239
Yeah,
I'll take your weapon now.

443
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:33,741
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey, patrol's here.

444
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:36,044
About 100 yards out,
heading straight toward us.

445
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:37,879
Where's the mom
and the little girl?

446
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,581
Hey, shh, shh, shh!

447
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,683
Shut up.

448
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:44,118
Shh! Shh!

449
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,721
She's gonna get us killed.

450
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:48,022
Hey, shh, shh!

451
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:49,891
Shh.
It's gonna be okay.

452
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:52,086
__

453
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:05,006
Can't let you do that, brah.

454
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:08,142
Oh, you just killed us.

455
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,247
__

456
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,538
__

457
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:33,009
__

458
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,722
You're lucky, boy.

459
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:55,956
You could have gotten killed

460
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,958
for some kid
you're never gonna see again.

461
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,829
They didn't ask for this.
They're innocent.

462
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:04,498
It doesn't matter.
What does matter, Norris?

463
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,135
The first rule of delta...
everybody goes home.

464
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,837
All we have to do
is survive, bro.

465
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,173
First rule of life...

466
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:15,809
remember what
we're surviving for.

467
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,690
I don't get it.

468
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:32,492
Why didn't you let me bite it
out there?

469
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,494
'Cause I'm not an assassin.

470
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,164
What do you call
what you did to Cogan?

471
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,633
What are you talking about?
I never met Cogan.

472
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,135
That's 'cause you killed him first.
What are you trying to pull?

473
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,270
You killed Cogan.
We both know it.

474
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,539
And why would I kill Cogan?

475
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,440
Same reason you killed
the other three Bolivians.

476
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:49,075
Cut the crap, Norris.
I saw you there.

477
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:51,278
I showed up to check in.

478
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,547
10 seconds later, the place blew up.
Check in?

479
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,182
I worked for Cogan.

480
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:59,052
You saying
you work for the CIA?

481
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:01,254
Red op.

482
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,890
Only Cogan knew.

483
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:05,959
Convenient.

484
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,128
Uh, not really.

485
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,230
You assassinated
the other three rebel leaders.

486
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,297
Explain that.

487
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:12,832
Enemies on the battlefield.

488
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,702
Who says so? And don't say us,
'cause I know it wasn't.

489
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:18,271
What do you mean, “us?”

490
00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:21,841
Cyber Com.

491
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,050
How the hell does somebody like
you end up in Cyber Command?

492
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:32,552
You barely know
how to check your e-mail.

493
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:34,554
Remember the time I had to get
the porn off your...

494
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,341
I'm not gonna let you kill
Javier León.

495
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:59,011
Javier León?
He's not my target.

496
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:02,315
What are you talking about?

497
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:07,653
I wasn't sent to kill Javier.
I was sent to protect him.

498
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:09,522
From who?

499
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,857
Seriously?

500
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,793
You can't see it?

501
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:17,997
Marcela, the wife, and
the knuckle-dragging brother.

502
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:24,136
He pulled the fuses.

503
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,137
We should be good now.

504
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:32,011
How are you holding up?
Mm. Well...

505
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,313
I've been in worse spots.

506
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:36,615
I'm glad I wasn't there
for those.

507
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,083
We're gonna get you out
with the undersecretary.

508
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:40,919
Are you okay?
I know you will.

509
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,621
I'll be glad when he's here.

510
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:45,324
He'll have diplomatic security
with them.

511
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,159
Any word from Gabriel yet?

512
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:50,963
Nothing.

513
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,867
I know staying back with me
and letting Gabriel

514
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:57,402
go off alone,
that had to be tough for you.

515
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,639
No.

516
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,942
No, it was the right call.

517
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,345
I just, you know...

518
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:08,347
Sometimes he acts before
he thinks, and I just hope...

519
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,350
you're worried about him.

520
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,887
I'm worried, too.

521
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:19,658
You're telling me Marcela's
gonna kill her own husband?

522
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,728
She worked for the government.
For El Presidente.

523
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,063
Oh, Javier doesn't have a clue.

524
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,731
Carrizales ordered them
to kill him.

525
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:27,899
Why?

526
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,435
'Cause he decided
to deal with the U.S.

527
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,237
It's a red line
for Carrizales' people.

528
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,806
So I got the order to...

529
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:36,808
Make sure Javier was protected
and the last one standing.

530
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,178
And when we realized Marcela
and Bro-zilla were dirty,

531
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,448
they got on the list.

532
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,051
Would you lower
the gun already?

533
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:53,324
We're on the same team, brah.

534
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,360
Just like old times.

535
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,566
If you're telling the truth,
why isn't León dead yet?

536
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:05,203
This whole thing is about the
meeting with the undersecretary.

537
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,405
Marcela wants him dead, too.

538
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:15,213
All right. Fine.
You don't believe me.

539
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:19,784
But, uh, your partner,
the girl...

540
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:21,085
What about her?

541
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,321
Well, if I'm telling the truth

542
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:26,224
and you do nothing,
she's dead, too.

543
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,861
Ready to gamble with her life?

544
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:41,005
Are you okay?

545
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,107
You've been here
for a long time.

546
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:45,176
I'm fine.

547
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:48,779
It's not every day you meet
United States undersecretary.

548
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:56,988
You look beautiful.

549
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:03,227
I'll be right out.
Okay.

550
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,655
Don't make me regret this.

551
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,860
Keep up if you can, old man.

552
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,474
You're nervous?

553
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:52,276
This is an important meeting.

554
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:55,679
And today is for Bolivia.

555
00:35:55,681 --> 00:36:00,484
Yes. It is.

556
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:07,457
He's here.

557
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,727
Can you hold down the fort?

558
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:13,830
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,935
Sir, Riley Neal, Cyber Com.

560
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:55,638
This is señor Javier León.

561
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Señor León, I'm Jim Sutters.

562
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:58,808
I'm the undersecretary of state

563
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,243
in charge
of South American affairs.

564
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:01,444
Mr. undersecretary
of state,

565
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:04,480
allow me to introduce to you
my wife, Marcela.

566
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:07,483
- It's an honor to meet you, señora.
- Likewise.

567
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,753
Gun! Get down!

568
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:14,757
Riley, no!

569
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:18,461
What are you doing?

570
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,496
Marcela! Marcela!

571
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,166
Aah!

572
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:25,568
Marcela!
It's a bomb!

573
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:44,186
Marcela.

574
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,155
I don't understand.

575
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:47,957
You could never see, Javi.

576
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,726
I married you because I thought
we could lead our country.

577
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:54,263
You're like...
you're like them,

578
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:57,066
willing to whore yourself
to the United States.

579
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:01,103
I'd rather die with my feet
in the air

580
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:05,307
than live with my legs open
to these pigs.

581
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:13,148
Aah!

582
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,429
The guy can shoot.
Yeah.

583
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,299
So, are you gonna explain<i> this</i>
to me at some point?

584
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,502
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine. Joy.

585
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,471
Riley, Norris.
Norris, Riley.

586
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:38,707
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh, you shot me.

587
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:41,577
Yeah, well, I'd shake your hand, but
I'd rather just shoot you again.

588
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,011
Nice meeting you, too.

589
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,214
So, you guys are friends now?

590
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:47,382
Besties.

591
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:53,188
Guess we're even.

592
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:01,963
Now we're even.

593
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,502
So, we're good?

594
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,438
Yeah. Guess we are.

595
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,407
You ready to tell me
what's up with you?

596
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:13,975
What are you talking about?

597
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,846
Well, first you somehow found
my burner phone,

598
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,381
and you memorized
the minefield?

599
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,888
Maybe you should start by telling me
how you ended up a paid assassin.

600
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,758
Uh, I'm a soldier.

601
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,426
A soldier.

602
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:34,229
Back in the day, they dropped us
on the battlefield

603
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:36,398
and told us who to point
our guns at.

604
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,867
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm doing the same exact thing.

605
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,771
Your turn.

606
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,906
What's up with you?

607
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,246
At some point,

608
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:52,947
you might want to think
about coming home.

609
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:55,583
They do something to you?

610
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:59,754
No, they did something for me.

611
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:18,206
It isn't how it appears.

612
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,674
You put my asset at risk again.

613
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:22,009
I had no idea Norris was CIA.

614
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:24,112
He had his own handler.

615
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:26,214
Who never told us who he hired.

616
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,483
It was a ghost op.
It's not uncommon.

617
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:30,785
It's how we keep these things
at arm's length.

618
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:33,287
What was the directive
to Cogan?

619
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,260
This is the cable.
Read it yourself.

620
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:41,262
There's one sentence here.

621
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,164
Read it.

622
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,433
“Uncle Sam backs
Javier León.”

623
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,667
he took that mean

624
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,636
we wanted to eliminate
all of the competition.

625
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:52,673
Cogan was old-school.

626
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,643
Old-school?

627
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:04,018
Without trust,
you and I have nothing.

628
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,720
We've shared
a lot of things, Jeff.

629
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:09,123
Trust has never been one
of them.

630
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,441
You're off the clock.

631
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,610
Really? You think so?

632
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,746
I think I got it from here.

633
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,848
I'm never off the clock.

634
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,151
You know the gig.
This is 24/7.

635
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:39,853
And this is your last beer.

636
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:48,996
You sure you're okay?

637
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:53,133
How's Jameson?

638
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,202
He asked out the nurse.

639
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:57,471
She say yes?

640
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,974
What do you think?

641
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,986
Do you want to talk
about Norris?

642
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,487
Not really.

643
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:18,925
You know, at one point,
there was nobody better.
