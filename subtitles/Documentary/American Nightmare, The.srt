    - You want me to starve.    

276
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:18,122
  An old man, like me, who      
  hardly has strength as it is.

472
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,963
             It requires craft,

          And we thought you

Jack, please listen to me.      
It's going to be a disaster!    

557
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,115
        How could it be?
