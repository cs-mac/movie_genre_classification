A SERBIAN FILM

1
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,545
Directed by Srdjan Spasojevic

2
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,752
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

3
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:54,428
Are you insane?

4
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,014
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

5
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,477
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,645
Sorry, but it's
not a big deal.

7
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:08,130
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,401
How are you, kiddo?

9
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,446
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

10
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,825
Maria, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,995
I dug up that DVD because...

12
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:23,373
Laylah called and
wanted to see me today.

13
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,668
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

14
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,463
The jumping bread!

15
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:37,846
Mom, what was dad
doing there?

16
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,599
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

17
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,811
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

18
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,015
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

19
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:57,593
Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

20
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:10,689
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

21
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:12,983
That's why I drink it.

22
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,203
So, how's family life?
- Nice.

23
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:27,623
How are Petar and... Maria?

24
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:30,209
Yes, Maria.
They're fine.

25
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,086
Next year Petar's
starting school.

26
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,174
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

27
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,884
his father's occupation.

28
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,639
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

29
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:48,894
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

30
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:50,229
How much do you have
stashed? 5 or 10 grand?

31
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:59,321
Milos, you were more
than just a porn star

32
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,406
you were an artist.

33
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:04,076
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

34
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:08,205
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

35
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,171
And I'm your guardian angel.
Listen.

36
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:20,467
Something big is about to
happen. Artistic pornography

37
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:24,012
of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

38
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:28,350
In Serbia? -Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,813
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid. If you accept

40
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:37,609
your family will be settled
till the end of Petar's life.

41
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:45,784
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

42
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,162
Be nice to him.

43
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,459
Here's something for the junior.

44
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:01,467
Wow, where's his pussy?

45
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,220
You didn't tell me you brought
your copper bro to the meeting.

46
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:10,642
I came on my own. I knew you'd
be here and couldn't miss

47
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:14,646
a chance to see you.
I'm your great admirer.

48
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,202
You're well preserved.

49
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:31,955
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

50
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:36,668
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

51
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:39,838
Everybody needs it.

52
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,053
These don't

53
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:54,895
So long, fags.
Milos, you heard my advice.

54
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:02,402
A hooker!
- A porn star.

55
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:04,029
Has-been.

56
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:08,992
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

57
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:10,661
I know.

58
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,126
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

59
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,002
A natural talent.

60
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,548
Funny she hasn't
contacted her dealer

61
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,508
in the past few years.

62
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:26,948
Is she off drugs?

63
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:33,225
Doubtful. A new,
rich provider, more likely.

64
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,146
You'll alienate me
from my friends

65
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,897
if you keep checking on them.

66
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,817
Friends, in Serbia?

67
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,862
You can't check them enough.

68
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:49,992
I gotta go.

69
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,912
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

70
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:58,917
I'm paying for the bite.

71
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,464
So long.
- Bye.

72
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,161
Sleeping time, hands up.

73
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,914
Dad?
- Yes?

74
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:39,291
Know that friend of yours

75
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,877
that you were
beating in the video

76
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:47,007
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

77
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,093
I know, but while
I was watching it

78
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,472
I felt something
strange. - What?

79
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,850
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

80
00:08:57,184 --> 00:09:01,522
A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

81
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:05,484
Several of them,
like a family, traveling.

82
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,990
Do they live in me?

83
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:15,327
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

84
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:19,581
Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

85
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,586
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

86
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,714
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

87
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,146
What language is that?

88
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:44,398
I'm translating
for some Swedes.

89
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,025
Swedish? I'm great in it.

90
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,406
That's right.

91
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:55,909
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

92
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:08,297
You would be a mega star.

93
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:24,146
So, you say Laylah is
offering you a serious job?

94
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,691
So she said.
It's strange.

95
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:32,029
Why would anyone
offer me big money

96
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:35,824
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

97
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:44,333
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

98
00:10:57,095 --> 00:11:00,265
Maybe they need
the only porn star

99
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,309
a university diploma.

100
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,944
Do you miss it?

101
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:16,156
What?
- The job.

102
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:20,953
I don't know. No.

103
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,624
I miss the money so we could
escape away from here.

104
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:39,096
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

105
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:45,394
How come you've never
done me like them?

106
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,484
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

107
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:07,332
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

108
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,158
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

109
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:07,244
<i>Nikola Tesla of
world pornography?</i>

110
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:09,663
You must be Vukmir?

111
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,499
<i>Of course. Milos, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

112
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:16,170
<i>right now and provide
your family for good</i>

113
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,923
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

114
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:24,636
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

115
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,682
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

116
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:30,642
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

117
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:56,919
I'm honored to shake hands
to such an artist, I'm Vukmir.

118
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:58,879
I'm Milos, nice to meet you.

119
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:05,260
Right hand is the
sex center in any man,

120
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,641
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

121
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,353
Ever since you childhood.

122
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,898
Your hand is special

123
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:21,360
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

124
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,614
Milos, it's an honor

125
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,826
to shake a hand
to such an artist of fuck.

126
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,335
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

127
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,170
Why not?

128
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:44,258
Because they just want
to jizz into a napkin

129
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,426
what they can't
into a woman.

130
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:50,097
These movies are
mostly made so that

131
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,641
those who can't
get laid can cum.

132
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:58,522
They're made by butchers

133
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,775
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

134
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:06,905
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

135
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:09,533
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

136
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,245
Do you know
what proves that

137
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,747
there is art in pornography?

138
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,541
What?

139
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,836
You, Milos.

140
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,676
You are the proof!

141
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,055
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

142
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,976
of exhausting her,
your talent to humiliate her,

143
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,730
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

144
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:43,233
And your love for it,
that's art.

145
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:51,283
Sadly, this is
no country for real art.

146
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:57,539
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

147
00:16:57,664 --> 00:17:00,626
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

148
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,878
are giving press conferences.

149
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,840
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

150
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,431
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

151
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:16,642
Just for the selected clients.

152
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,852
All right, but what is it?

153
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:23,732
Art, naked art!

154
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,277
Truth.

155
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:32,366
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

156
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,621
minimal editing.

157
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:41,291
There's a serious script.

158
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:45,546
We know it, you don't!

159
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,557
And what am I
supposed to do?

160
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:01,478
The same as always, Milos.
Just stand before the cameras,

161
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:05,774
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

162
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:11,488
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

163
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,117
You're also tired of
humping scum

164
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,328
any time your family
needs money.

165
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:24,084
Kissing some
wretched cunts

166
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,671
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

167
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,642
Thanks, doctor.

168
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,819
What's that?
- The contract.

169
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,450
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

170
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:18,889
Something wrong?

171
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:26,438
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

172
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,483
You're not supposed to know.

173
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,986
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

174
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:31,753
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill</i>

175
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:37,593
<i>A creek was frozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

176
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:44,266
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

177
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:49,938
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

178
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:56,820
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

179
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:04,203
<i>perhaps he' after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

180
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:11,627
Vukmir! Sounds like a name
of one of your guys

181
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,879
at the Hague tribunal.

182
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,465
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

183
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,719
No, he's some kind of
an artist philosopher

184
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:22,846
with a grand plan.

185
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,224
So, is it grand?

186
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:29,394
Dunno, but seems like he
desperately needs me

187
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,857
since he's willing
to offer such cash.

188
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,197
How much?

189
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:43,951
I won't tell you.

190
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,332
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

191
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,376
OK, I'll tell you,
just let go.

192
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,392
Don't tell me you refused?

193
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,477
Of course I did.

194
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:15,357
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

195
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,694
If I were,
I'd have dumped you

196
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:20,988
for your brother long ago.

197
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:30,622
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

198
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:43,051
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

199
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,347
Remember what
you told me

200
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,850
when I asked
if you missed your job?

201
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:55,063
Milos, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

202
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,524
If it's true...

203
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:00,777
If what is true?

204
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:04,698
That you were always
able to have it erected

205
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,284
with no touching
or looking.

206
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:13,540
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

207
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,836
I also know that
you filmed all your scenes

208
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,047
in the first take.

209
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,342
Don't be so modest,

210
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,636
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

211
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,454
How long do you
think it would take?

212
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:17,956
A few days.

213
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,627
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

214
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:35,224
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

215
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:40,187
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

216
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,246
Want one?
- Yes.

217
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,212
No thanks.

218
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,422
You said you would.

219
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:10,134
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

220
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,264
I miss female company.

221
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:19,560
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

222
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:24,022
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

223
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:30,028
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

224
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:35,492
You stopped
hoping too soon.

225
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,619
Women here like
men in uniform.

226
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,122
Especially if
they're not wearing it.

227
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:48,338
Sorry, gotta go
to the bathroom.

228
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:28,605
You know what
they say about rye.

229
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:34,611
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

230
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:38,198
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

231
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,243
Whe, exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

232
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:43,954
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

233
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:47,541
Milos, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

234
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:52,004
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

235
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:55,215
It's a bit absurd.

236
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:58,677
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

237
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:04,933
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

238
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,935
Nothing is left to accident.

239
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:11,064
Milos, that is
a serious organization.

240
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:16,612
My clients know
exactly what they want,

241
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:18,572
and I know
what I'm doing.

242
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,410
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

243
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,996
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

244
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:30,584
relax and react
as Milos would.

245
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:36,173
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

246
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,842
but a live
transmission of sex.

247
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,053
<i>Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

248
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,640
Remember the little wheels?

249
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,246
I do.

250
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:50,395
Do you know how
to make them spin?

251
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:55,651
I do. But you
must do it yourself.

252
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,027
We all do it alone.

253
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,112
Tell me how.

254
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:06,120
When you feel them,
try to follow them

255
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:10,582
It's a family traveling

256
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,547
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

257
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:25,806
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

258
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,770
Put it in your ear.

259
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:41,527
<i>Enter the building,
relaxed.</i>

260
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:59,191
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

261
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:24,800
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

262
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:30,472
Be natural.

263
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,374
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

264
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,376
than giving birth to you!

265
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:45,172
Haven't told you not to let
the villains take you away?

266
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:48,133
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

267
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:50,636
What are you staring at?

268
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:02,022
<i>Bravo.</i>

269
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,074
What was it like?

270
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:16,203
Fine.

271
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:21,917
We were filming at
a Home for orphaned children.

272
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,087
Where?

273
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:27,005
Drag yourself over here!

274
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,883
Look at yourself.
You can't raise a dick,

275
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:32,094
how will you raise a child?

276
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,472
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

277
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,308
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

278
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,438
Let me go, villains!

279
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:46,400
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

280
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,240
<i>Honey?</i>
- Hi.

281
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:22,658
<i>What are you doing?</i>

282
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:25,119
I picked up
Petar from classes.

283
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,372
I'm taking him to a costume
party. Are you coming?

284
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:31,834
No, I'm tired.
Must get some sleep.

285
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,460
<i>Everything all right?</i>

286
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,004
Sure. Just you
enjoy yourselves.

287
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,091
Talk to you later,
must park now. Bye.

288
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:43,178
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

289
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:46,515
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

290
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:52,104
Aren't you in action?
<i>- Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

291
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,482
I'm all dick.

292
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:59,862
<i>I need a detailed check
on my director,</i>

293
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:04,366
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

294
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,829
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

295
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,002
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

296
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,381
Look, it's important
and urgent.

297
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:23,594
Understood.
Everything OK with you?

298
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,555
Yes, so far.
How about you?

299
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,266
Working on it.

300
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,570
<i>Light the candles.</i>

301
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,910
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

302
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,465
Baby, the time is flying
and your animal

303
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:03,175
is snoozing again.

304
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:10,516
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

305
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:16,063
Blow harder.
Bravo!

306
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:22,861
<i>Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.</i>

307
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,115
This is the present
from your uncle.

308
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:28,784
How do you open this?

309
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:39,461
Happy birthday,
my sweet son.

310
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:36,435
What do you think, how does he
manage to be so hard so long?

311
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:41,565
It's not a dick,
it's a police stick!

312
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,486
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

313
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:52,326
The bitches are leaking all over,
he's servicing all three of them.

314
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,080
How come he's not tired?

315
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,418
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

316
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:09,927
You're at it again!

317
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:14,348
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

318
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,811
What was so urgent?

319
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:22,105
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

320
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:27,528
Are those cameramen real cops?
Are they protection? What from?

321
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,323
Cut the crap!

322
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:35,744
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

323
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:38,747
I may be dumb,
but not naive.

324
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:42,918
Vukimr knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

325
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:46,255
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

326
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:50,008
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

327
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:54,555
Don't take it all on me cause
I fuck animals for art's sake,

328
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:58,183
while you can't take
a bit of uncertainty

329
00:42:58,267 --> 00:42:59,977
for some big bucks.

330
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:03,939
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

331
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:06,525
It's not so bad,
trust me.

332
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:10,320
Better than the crap
you've been lately.

333
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:19,413
You know I miss that.
- What?

334
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:21,915
The certainty of that crap.

335
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,334
At least I knew
what I was filming.

336
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:28,213
Do you miss this?

337
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:37,890
You're losing it.

338
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,893
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

339
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:04,416
You're resting
from healthy life.

340
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:08,837
How was the
costume party?

341
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:14,968
Hey, what's that?
- It's a stand up balloon.

342
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,204
Your Raiko was
a war hero.

343
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:48,168
If only he knew about
his wife's whoring!

344
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:57,177
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

345
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:07,915
What the hell
is all this, people?

346
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,751
Hello, I can't work
like this!

347
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:30,521
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

348
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,316
Hit her.

349
00:47:22,614 --> 00:47:25,367
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

350
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,791
Milos?

351
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,217
Milos, what's wrong?

352
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:44,094
I'm not doing this.
I'm not beating women

353
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:45,888
in front of kids or cameras.

354
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:50,142
Milos, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

355
00:47:50,225 --> 00:47:53,520
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

356
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,898
You're like
a Sunday picnic for her.

357
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:57,941
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

358
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,985
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

359
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,820
You're doing against mine.

360
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,364
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

361
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,284
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

362
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:10,454
Did you enjoy less than
a midget woman whom

363
00:48:10,537 --> 00:48:13,791
you locked up in an oven in
Stuttgart and pierced a hole

364
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,168
in it so she could
suck you up for hours?

365
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:24,009
At least your
dick enjoyed it,

366
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,766
and he never lies.

367
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,480
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

368
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:42,402
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

369
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:49,159
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

370
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,870
of the State TV. It's
getting better and better!

371
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,040
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

372
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,963
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

373
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,715
with data from
the State Security.

374
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:08,595
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

375
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:14,143
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

376
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:18,856
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

377
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,778
That's about it.

378
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,157
I don't know
what bothers you.

379
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,785
According to this

380
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,204
you've never worked
with a more educated man.

381
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,665
Who are you gonna trust
if not a child psychologist.

382
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:38,584
who is working
for the Security?

383
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:56,745
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.

384
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,336
Want something to eat?

385
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:48,714
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

386
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:05,105
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

387
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:09,651
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

388
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,000
Today we're shooting
at home again.

389
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,338
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

390
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:21,473
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

391
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:23,100
No.

392
00:53:26,353 --> 00:53:29,273
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

393
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,693
I fully understand you.

394
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,614
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

395
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:41,034
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

396
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,956
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

397
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,295
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

398
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,425
What did you say,
kindergarten?

399
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:00,637
That's a good term.

400
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:06,643
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

401
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:10,856
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

402
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:13,901
Do you know
what it feels like?

403
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:17,446
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

404
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:20,532
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

405
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:24,495
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

406
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,830
drink, bleed, earn money...

407
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:30,876
do whatever it takes
to survive, until you die

408
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:36,965
Would you believe m
if I told you that me and

409
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:41,386
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

410
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:46,433
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

411
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:52,397
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

412
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:57,152
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

413
00:54:58,237 --> 00:55:01,031
and useful for anything.

414
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:08,455
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that

415
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:12,292
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

416
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,515
No, Milos, no, no!

417
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:27,558
Not pornography,
but life itself!

418
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,894
That's life of a victim.

419
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:34,702
Love, art, blood...

420
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:39,444
Flesh and soul of a victim.

421
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:43,761
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

422
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,578
and now is paying
to watch that

423
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:50,902
from the comfort
of an armchair.

424
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,501
I have no doubt
that it sells well

425
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:57,171
based on the sum
you offered me.

426
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:01,029
Victim sells, Milos.

427
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,910
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

428
00:56:08,682 --> 00:56:12,352
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

429
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:15,856
We are victim, Milos.

430
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:19,172
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

431
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,945
We're just too retarded.

432
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:25,365
And I won't be
a victim because of that.

433
00:56:27,326 --> 00:56:28,577
But Milos...

434
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:31,705
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

435
00:56:33,832 --> 00:56:34,917
Is that so?

436
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:42,216
Allow me,
as your shepherd

437
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:44,551
to show you
the power of a real victim.

438
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:13,075
Can it be that you
don't get it?

439
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,328
This is a new genre, Milos!

440
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:20,457
Newborn porn!

441
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,669
Newborn!

442
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:41,687
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

443
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,566
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

444
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,923
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

445
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:08,268
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

446
01:05:24,947 --> 01:05:26,990
If you only
knew how easily

447
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:29,409
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluited in whiskey.

448
01:05:29,535 --> 01:05:32,496
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

449
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,584
Viagra for bulls!

450
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:41,463
A special recipe concocted
by our sexy doctor who is

451
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:44,758
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

452
01:05:45,384 --> 01:05:46,844
Can he follow
my words?

453
01:05:49,263 --> 01:05:50,722
Now, that's our stud!

454
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:53,308
Look at him, look at him!

455
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:55,498
Bravo, bravo!

456
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:46,862
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

457
01:06:46,945 --> 01:06:49,615
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

458
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:53,827
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

459
01:06:53,911 --> 01:06:57,581
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

460
01:07:01,376 --> 01:07:03,587
Yeah, you bitch!

461
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:07,132
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

462
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,510
<i>who conceive
babies in lust</i>

463
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:11,595
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

464
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:13,534
<i>The lustful
brood of wenches</i>

465
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:16,058
<i>with endless
gashes in them.</i>

466
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,403
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

467
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:31,281
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

468
01:07:32,074 --> 01:07:33,867
<i>Imagine that, Milos!</i>

469
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,997
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

470
01:07:58,183 --> 01:08:00,269
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

471
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:04,189
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

472
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:46,059
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

473
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,148
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

474
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,196
<i>What?</i>

475
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:02,201
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.
Don't worry, he will.</i>

476
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:08,665
<i>Fucking hell.
OK, run now.</i>

477
01:11:33,482 --> 01:11:35,651
<i>This one is on me.</i>

478
01:12:11,937 --> 01:12:14,356
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

479
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:16,024
<i>I did what? How?</i>

480
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:19,570
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

481
01:12:19,695 --> 01:12:23,991
<i>You had Milos. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

482
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:27,744
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

483
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:30,497
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

484
01:12:31,123 --> 01:12:34,460
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

485
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:39,381
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

486
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:43,177
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

487
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,888
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

488
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:50,350
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

489
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:53,479
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

490
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:56,482
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

491
01:12:57,566 --> 01:13:00,611
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

492
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,448
<i>What do you
know of ecstasy?</i>

493
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,993
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

494
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:11,997
<i>I'm not working
for you anymore.</i>

495
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:14,875
<i>Nor is Milos.
I'm taking him home.</i>

496
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:45,484
Get away from me!

497
01:15:55,911 --> 01:16:00,707
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

498
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:06,004
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

499
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:10,008
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

500
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:16,682
She was a shame
to our house.

501
01:16:17,474 --> 01:16:23,230
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

502
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:30,821
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

503
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:38,078
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

504
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,924
There's not only house, but a
daughter to take care of, too.

505
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:58,557
Our poor Jeca
became an orphan.

506
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,978
My Alice in Wonderland.

507
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:08,066
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

508
01:17:08,317 --> 01:17:12,446
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

509
01:17:12,571 --> 01:17:16,408
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

510
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:22,581
You'll have the honor
of giving her

511
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:26,794
a virgin's communion.
To make her a woman.

512
01:17:29,004 --> 01:17:33,383
Like my late father
did with me.

513
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:47,940
Come on, come on...

514
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,612
Now!

515
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:09,211
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

516
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:10,963
No, Milos, no...

517
01:18:22,766 --> 01:18:24,476
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

518
01:18:24,726 --> 01:18:26,436
<i>What are you waiting
for? After him!</i>

519
01:21:02,801 --> 01:21:07,264
Marko, it's me. Come for me.
<i>Milos, what's wrong?</i>

520
01:21:07,347 --> 01:21:11,518
<i>Where are you?</i>
I'm in the Celopecka street, no 7.

521
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:13,979
<i>Milos!</i>

522
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,726
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

523
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:56,688
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

524
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:01,777
Be polite,
the girl is underage.

525
01:22:03,237 --> 01:22:05,948
So what if
I am underage?

526
01:22:12,329 --> 01:22:13,997
Look at this jerk!

527
01:22:38,147 --> 01:22:40,607
No, Rasa, don't.

528
01:22:48,323 --> 01:22:51,410
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

529
01:22:51,493 --> 01:22:53,829
<i>into a shed
during summer.</i>

530
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,666
<i>They leave them
for a month</i>

531
01:22:57,749 --> 01:23:00,836
<i>until their balls
are like melons.</i>

532
01:23:01,295 --> 01:23:05,466
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

533
01:23:08,594 --> 01:23:09,678
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

534
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:12,639
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

535
01:23:14,391 --> 01:23:19,188
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

536
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:25,235
<i>You're a he-goat, Milos.
I'm your monk.</i>

537
01:23:26,653 --> 01:23:29,364
Don't worry, my child.

538
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:36,872
My he-goat.

539
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:44,171
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

540
01:26:56,947 --> 01:27:00,826
Welcome to a
warm family home.

541
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:59,922
A real, happy
Serbian family.

542

543
01:30:05,886 --> 01:30:07,304
Art.

544
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,355
That's it, Milos.
That's the cinema.

545
01:32:56,849 --> 01:32:58,976
That's film!

546
01:33:13,323 --> 01:33:14,825
Get away from me!

547
01:37:01,093 --> 01:37:08,433
<i>In a winter night

549
01:39:42,296 --> 01:39:43,922
Come on.

550
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:50,345
Start with the little one.
