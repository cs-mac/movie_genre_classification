It is not about who is right.

00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,446 
Is it? 

34 
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,820 
Watch your hands. 

35 
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,128 
Get out. 

36 
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,459 
No smoking. 

37 
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,340 
Leave me alone. They are not here. 

38 
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,264 
What are you doing? 
-It is always the same, Dylan. 

39 
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,191 
We hear the same crap for months. 

40 
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,064 
Any building with survivors 
has one. 

41 
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:21,070 
Do not you think that somewhere 
a safe place? 

42 
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,153 
How is it that you have so much? 

43 
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:29,573 
You can everything in medicine cabinets 
found. If you are looking for good enough. 

44 
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:35,830 
We are looking for a safe stay. 
We go once the light is. 

45 
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:49,716 
It is good, honey. 
-No. 

46 
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,177 
It is never good. 

47 
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,177 
It is never safe. 

48 
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:05,065 
We do this together, huh? 
-Of course. 

49 
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,279 
Listen to me. 

50 
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:13,282 
Maybe it is not as before, 
but it gets better. 

51 
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,042 
Good? 

52 
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,994 
You have almost six hours sleep. 

53 
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,380 
What is it? 
-We gotta go. 

54 
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:27,305 
The generator takes almost on a 
and we have no food. 

55 
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,840 
We need to look 
how we can get out of here. 

56 
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:34,063 
Come, go we. 

57 
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,896 
Basis, this unit is 12. 

58 
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,037 
Base unit 12 here. Do you hear me? 
Unit 12, we hear you. 

59 
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,366 
We meet at a medical complex. 

60 
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,829 
The aim is tomorrow 
them to be ready. 

61 
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,414 
Understood. I await news. 

62 
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,881 
<i> Over. 
-Close. </ I> 

63 
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,707 
It is in order, they are not infected. 

64 
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:40,382 
It is sick. Two others are deceased 
to pneumonia. 

65 
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,801 
We are looking for drugs. 

66 
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,386 
His only two of you here? 

67 
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,193 
I was co-assistant 
for the quarantine. 

68 
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,481 
Most medicines 
were stolen months ago. 

69 
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,196 
We know these people, Dorothy. 

70 
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,327 
Sorry. 

71 
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,200 
We have three weeks 
no other human beings. 

72 
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,167 
We do not. 

73 
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,422 
It is most secure. 

74 
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,258 
Tentative. 

75 
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,835 
Charlie. 
-I have nothing, Amelia. 

76 
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:17,098 
Jesus. 
-Sorry. 

77 
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:20,104 
We must provide for ourselves, huh? 

78 
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,932 
Which way should we? 

79 
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:25,940 
For the pharmacy? 
-The corridor. 

80 
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,370 
We see each building 
room after room. 

81 
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,131 
Make everything seems dead infected. 
And survival? 

82 
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,220 
If they are strong enough, 
they go with us. 

83 
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,174 
And now? 

84 
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:24,013 
The doors and staircases 
are obstructed. 

85 
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,715 
We need to somehow 
to the pharmacy to find. 

86 
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,514 
Come on. 

87 
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:34,096 
What is this big. 

88 
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,945 
We need an end run 
before we are. 

89 
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:42,355 
We do not know whether medicines. 
-Maybe we should go back. 

90 
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:46,864 
Then we forget the tent. 
-No, that is suicide. 

91 
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,575 
We are not out 
in the dark. Not anymore. 

92 
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:53,458 
About four o'clock the sun already. 

93 
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:22,038 
I'm allergic 
FOR MONDAY 

94 
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,843 
We need to bottom. 

95 
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,688 
The security door is 
is the only way out. 

96 
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:47,019 
But the generator gives up. 
Without electricity, the door is not open. 

97 
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,352 
What do you mean, any way? 

98 
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:55,117 
Near the door, our pick-up. 
Hopefully we can come. 

99 
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:58,371 
Then we can drive to a camp. 

100 
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:01,039 
To a camp? 
-Wait a minute. 

101 
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,784 
Why do you have that 
not previously done? 

102 
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:07,712 
We had dinner here. 
It was warm and dry. 

103 
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:12,096 
We were weeks on the run. 
We had just added. 

104 
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:19,146 
What happens if the generator 
fails to get there? 

105 
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:25,231 
Then the security door is not open 
and we are looking up. 

106 
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:33,412 
We went just that way when we 
you saw. You may blaze. 

107 
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,291 
Tagart, over everything there. 

108 
00:12:55,774 --> 00:13:00,436 
I say this also, but I do not believe 
that there is someone who can help us. 

109 
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,567 
How can you be so sure? 
There were people, hunters. 

110 
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:08,404 
Former soldiers, trained to kill. 
-That is nonsense. 

111 
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,583 
Believe that nonsense 
on short anyway. 

112 
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,954 
If there were people, 
they had already saved us. 

113 
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,424 
As we pray for. 
-No, you pray for. 

114 
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,001 
What is your belief? 
-I am realistic. 

115 
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,637 
Only we keep ourselves alive. 

116 
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,024 
LEAVE ALL HOPE RIVER CRUISING 
Ye who enter here 

117 
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,654 
This was the entrance of the chapel. 

118 
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,162 
What scary. 

119 
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,252 
Jesus. 
-Amelia. 

120 
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:54,673 
What is there now? 

121 
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,254 
Look. I find it scary. 

122 
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:02,842 
It is just ... 
-Hold on, Dylan. 

123 
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,183 
It does not matter whether we name 
use of the Lord in vain. 

124 
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:13,646 
Only we and they are there. 
Nothing or no one. 

125 
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,739 
If we speak of the devil ... 
-What are they? 

126 
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:23,366 
Help Pilletjes. 
Then you feel no pain anymore. 

127 
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:27,956 
And also nothing. 
-Exactly. 

128 
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:33,053 
Do you think we ever get out? 
-Come on. 

129 
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,262 
Cheer up, everybody. 

130 
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:42,562 
We come to that security door 
we all. 

131 
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,191 
Although our death. 

132 
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:50,407 
I'm scared of you. 
-Keep your head just once and follow me. 

133 
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,908 
The stench is worse. 

134 
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,779 
My god. 

135 
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,620 
Come on. 

136 
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,487 
Amelia? 

137 
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,687 
Do not touch it. 

138 
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:55,094 
Is anyone hurt? 

139 
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:58,097 
Ricky? 
-Yes, and you? 

140 
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,531 
God forgive us ALL 

141 
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,739 
What is this? 

142 
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:35,056 
Tagart, ensure that everyone is gone. 
Is that clear? 

143 
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,963 
Cross here. Do you hear me? 

144 
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:42,676 
Again, you hear me? 
-I am a survivor. 

145 
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,429 
I am a survivor. 

146 
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,188 
Have you survived? 
Again, have you survived? 

147 
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:59,025 
If you hear me: you must 
sunrise away from zone 7. 

148 
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:06,704 
It is not good. 
Are you alone? 

149 
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,679 
Where are Morgan and Ricky? 
-We had to wait here. 

150 
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:03,765 
I do not know, though. 

151 
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:07,810 
Everyone was crazy 
for the virus. 

152 
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,861 
Now those things around. 

153 
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,823 
Who knows what still is. 

154 
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:21,662 
When I was very small, 
I was at night scared. 

155 
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:24,328 
Then I went 
to the room of my parents. 

156 
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:28,006 
Then I realized that they 
although they were grown ... 

157 
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,585 
I do not per se 
could protect ... 

158 
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:37,052 
against monsters or demons or something. 
-They are not monsters or demons. 

159 
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,730 
They are just sick. 

160 
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:48,156 
A few days after the virus broke out ... 

161 
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:52,614 
was infected 
my father address. 

162 
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,919 
Now I am sure 
that no one can protect me. 

163 
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,842 
Come with me. 

164 
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,802 
We protect each other, right? 

165 
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:49,219 
We are a team. 
-That will do. 

166 
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:51,690 
What do you mean? 

167 
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,242 
It was Dorothy and me well. 

168 
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,740 
We could survive 
by mutual trust. 

169 
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,707 
Since you are there ... 

170 
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:09,913 
Now it is more likely 
you caught, just yes. 

171 
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:12,377 
I got it. Calm down, man. 

172 
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,171 
We would just like to 
surviving as you. 

173 
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:19,094 
I want it simple and 
to find a safe camp. 

174 
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:23,511 
What is your plan? 
-I have no plan. 

175 
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,431 
That I mean come on. 

176 
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:38,819 
That does not mean that we will soon 
safe to walk around. 

177 
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:40,492 
If that is all going to happen. 

178 
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,240 
If they can uiroeien things ... 

179 
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,464 
Another fine idea. 
-Give the courage not to. 

180 
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,634 
They are also subject 
to the laws of nature. 

181 
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,262 
We know this now. 

182 
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,558 
Yes, they are like us, 
they yearn only to blood. 

183 
00:22:56,935 --> 00:23:00,470 
And they have 
are impaired killing machines. 

184 
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:07,480 
I have brought over victims 
when the attacks started. 

185 
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,695 
You are kidding. 

186 
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,995 
Some injuries were immune ... 

187 
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,006 
and others simply changed. 

188 
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:30,138 
They just changed. 
Everyone thinks that vampires are. 

189 
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,184 
But they are not. 
They are mutants. 

190 
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:43,150 
That may be, 
but where is this myth is based? 

191 
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,611 
Obsessed by flesh and blood. 

192 
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:53,367 
Everything you do, everything you 
to think about blood. 

193 
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:56,034 
You can not own it. 

194 
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:59,629 
You have no feeling. 
Damn, man. 

195 
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,211 
They just want to eat. 

196 
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,659 
Turn that car down there. 

197 
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,755 
No vampires, huh? 
This seems to be otherwise so. 

198 
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,215 
Make sure it never comes out. 
-Let 's go. 

199 
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,260 
Come on. 

200 
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:47,395 
Where were you? 
-Good news. 

201 
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:50,435 
We have some friends 
on this side. 

202 
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,646 
They know that we are here. Come on. 

203 
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:00,155 
We have now gone. 

204 
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:08,082 
Have you seen one? 

205 
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,422 
That would be you can say. 
-How did he look like? 

206 
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,133 
Are they weaker? 
-What? 

207 
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,136 
Great. The pills work. 
He is not cut in his nose while. 

208 
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,469 
There's a canteen. 

209 
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,144 
Maybe we can eat out 
before we go. 

210 
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,649 
Everyone is hungry. 
We must continue. 

211 
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,822 
What do we do if there is such a thing? 

212 
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,158 
Then we make him dead. 

213 
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:38,161 
And if there are multiple? 
-Then they all die. 

214 
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,076 
Come on, let go. 

215 
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:35,475 
How old would be eating? 
-It may be months old. 

216 
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:39,607 
We are always looking for food. 

217 
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,824 
Only the most evil. 
-Put it in your mouth. 

218 
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:48,240 
Be glad it is there. 
-No one else could eat. 

219 
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,910 
Too bad we can not continue. 

220 
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:57,380 
We have three hours to dawn. 
-We may have as long as necessary. 

221 
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,417 
We should find a staircase 
that is not close. 

222 
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:03,885 
Above all we were safe. 

223 
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:07,102 
There was no food 
and the flow was off. 

224 
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:10,021 
We were there 
not have survived. 

225 
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:16,735 
We must remember that we 
only control over ourselves. 

226 
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:18,945 
The rest we did. 

227 
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:21,026 
Morgan. 
-No, Dorothy. 

228 
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:24,369 
I just tell you the truth. 

229 
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:29,412 
We can at car 
and a window broken store. 

230 
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:33,122 
Then we arrive at least. 

231 
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,550 
Question, what do you think? 

232 
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:41,223 
Two hours ago you would not even go. 

233 
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:45,058 
We need the security doors. 
It is as simple as that. 

234 
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:48,557 
Why we ask not for him? 

235 
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,227 
What you say it, Ricky? 

236 
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,900 
It will do. 

237 
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,488 
Blood you? 

238 
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,997 
It's just a slice. 

239 
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:06,379 
I'm sure somewhere on cases. 
It is but a scratch. 

240 
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,789 
Relax. I am not infected or anything. 

241 
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,674 
But you bleed. 

242 
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:13,050 
Blood attracts them, how little, too. 

243 
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:16,673 
You know that, even in this state. 

244 
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,642 
Loser. 

245 
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,312 
So as their genius. 

246 
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,795 
There is the research room. 

247 
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,639 
Maybe there are drugs. 

248 
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,259 
Go ahead. 

249 
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,604 
I bring him inside. 

250 
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:41,114 
Beware. If you hear something ... 
There are many stories. 

251 
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:42,860 
Come on. 

252 
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:59,131 
Not so close, Charlie. 

253 
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:03,513 
I'm just thinking. 

254 
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:08,181 
Where to? 
-The same as always. 

255 
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,141 
What we should do. 

256 
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:26,456 
Suppose that we are about. 
You know what that would mean? 

257 
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,335 
What then? 

258 
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:36,089 
That we are the monsters. 
That this world is not more of us. 

259 
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:52,823 
She is ready. 
I have found penicillin. 

260 
00:30:56,746 --> 00:30:58,371 
What is it? 

261 
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,086 
Help. 

262 
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:14,509 
No. 
-Reverse. 

263 
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,935 
Slow. 

264 
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:23,066 
Reverse. 

265 
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:54,519 
I am so far, sir. 

266 
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:09,914 
Thank you. 

267 
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,794 
What is our status? 

268 
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:21,302 
We have heard that non - 
survivors may be infected.

269 
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,546 
From whom? What do you mean? 

270 
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:27,637 
Colonel, we have had 
teams in those areas. 

271 
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,765 
These are not our teams. 
-No. 

272 
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:34,807 
They are independent citizens' groups. 
They call themselves hunters. 

273 
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,655 
We have helped them. 

274 
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:42,117 
The last message was about 
a group of hunters in Division 7. 

275 
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:45,786 
It may safely be made 
at sunrise. 

276 
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,167 
Sector 7, sunrise? 
This is one of the worst areas. 

277 
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,674 
With all due respect, Mr. Cross ... 

278 
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:58,508 
but otherwise we are going to work 
than you. 

279 
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,307 
Listen, the infected 
go in as the sun rises. 

280 
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:06,598 
That is true right? 
You know what I say. 

281 
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:10,273 
You want to eradicate them. 
Normally I would agree with you. 

282 
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:13,279 
But there is no contact 
with the group on the ground. 

283 
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:17,315 
We know not sure 
that they are on time away. 

284 
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:20,530 
Where are our planes? 
On-deck. 

285 
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:23,541 
Why not in the air? 
-We are waiting for permission. 

286 
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:26,201 
We will make the area safe. 

287 
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,329 
If you have hunters on the ground ... 

288 
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,843 
and you hear them, 
say that they have there. 

289 
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,133 
What a good idea. 
I do not have thought. 

290 
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,144 
Mr. Cross, I have here. 

291 
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:44,229 
And as far as I know, 
I have not retired. 

292 
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,734 
Unless you have a military operation 
want to take ... 

293 
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:51,024 
but I would do exactly 
what I say as I say. 

294 
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,403 
Make these aircraft 
ready for departure. 

295 
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,464 
What is that? 

296 
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:22,340 
I do look. 

297 
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:32,022 
Careful, Ricky. 

298 
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,454 
If it was not so scary, 
I would laugh about. 

299 
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,991 
Open. 
-I can not. 

300 
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:35,889 
And the others? 
-Those are the other way. 

301 
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:54,824 
Open the door. 

302 
00:36:57,835 --> 00:36:59,958 
Come on. Come on. 

303 
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:02,714 
Block. 

304 
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,511 
Where is the rest? 
-No idea. 

305 
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:13,926 
We are lucky that we still live. 

306 
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:15,432 
Where are we? 

307 
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,231 
We are not there. 

308 
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:20,650 
According to Dorothy leyden all courses 
to the same place. 

309 
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,563 
We find them. 

310 
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,147 
They are everywhere. 
-Come on. 

311 
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:28,410 
Morgan is strong. 
They are found in order. 

312 
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,824 
We must. 

313 
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,994 
Come on. We must 
to the security door. 

314 
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:27,014 
Is everyone okay? 

315 
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:04,230 
Here. 

316 
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,816 
I must wash my hands. 

317 
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:11,280 
You are kidding. 
-Leeches. 

318 
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,285 
Dylan, you're just tired. 

319 
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,778 
Perhaps their blood 
on my hands. 

320 
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,243 
Wait here. 

321 
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,466 
Are you infected? 
-What? 

322 
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:35,971 
Are you infected? 

323 
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:40,065 
No. 

324 
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:45,275 
Who are you? 
-I 've hidden. 

325 
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:49,658 
Are you alone? 
-We are only three of his. 

326 
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:51,108 
A good number. 

327 
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:53,830 
In a group you are safer. 

328 
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,369 
Can I come with you? 

329 
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:17,474 
Where did he go? 

330 
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,071 
Dylan? 

331 
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:42,338 
We gotta get outta here. 

332 
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,127 
Did you hear that? 

333 
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:12,831 
What? 
-Listen. 

334 
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:16,418 
It is from there. 

335 
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:21,801 
Stay here. 

336 
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:26,474 
If you hear something, 
then be gone. 

337 
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:31,829 
See if he is bitten. 

338 
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:39,378 
I'm fine. 
Everything in order. I got lucky. 

339 
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:42,971 
The trouble with happiness 
is that it ever stops. 

340 
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,278 
What happened? 

341 
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:04,158 
We fled for what 
what Morgan has caught. 

342 
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:09,044 
He said we had to run 
if something happened. 

343 
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,308 
<i> There is nothing more to see. 
The area is safe. </ I> 

344 
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,524 
Understood. 

345 
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:30,731 
Keep looking. The hunters are there. 

346 
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:34,904 
<i> We continue 
and let us know if we see something. </ i> 

347 
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:45,999 
At school told one of the children 
ever a scary story. 

348 
00:44:46,174 --> 00:44:50,338 
I will never forget. 
It was if I was there myself to. 

349 
00:44:51,346 --> 00:44:54,301 
It was on a plane 
with passengers. 

350 
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:58,308 
The plane crashed. 
I do not know why. 

351 
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,059 
There were a few survivors. 
-This story about cannibalism? 

352 
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:06,486 
The survivors lost 
one by one. 

353 
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:09,194 
Know it? 
-A similar story. 

354 
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:20,485 
Charlie? 

355 
00:47:04,627 --> 00:47:06,288 
There are about seven. 

356 
00:47:06,463 --> 00:47:08,871 
Come on. 
-Place report, soldier. 

357 
00:47:09,049 --> 00:47:13,463 
In these sectors, we 
infections encountered. 

358 
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:14,669 
How much? 

359 
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:18,680 
At each location at least twelve. 

360 
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:21,178 
There are probably hundreds. 

361 
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:25,306 
Suppose that the hunters 
survivors have found. 

362 
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:30,990 
If infection occurs 
would be a disaster. 

363 
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:33,691 
There is no vaccine. 

364 
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:40,706 
The hunters would still 
at sunrise road? 

365 
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:46,789 
Then we make the area safe. 

366 
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:33,133 
Charlie? 

367 
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:44,254 
Have you been bitten? 
Are you infected? 

368 
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:49,796 
Who are you? 

369 
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,265 
My name is Tao. 

370 
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,736 
The sun is low. 
Hopefully we have until then flow. 

371 
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:08,785 
Is it? 
-What happened to Dylan? 

372 
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:12,990 
That is not important anymore. 
Come on. 

373 
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:18,456 
Well. 
-We find the others quickly. 

374 
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:21,132 
And perhaps even Dylan. 

375 
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:26,590 
I try to find the rest. 
Stay here, go nowhere. 

376 
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:08,434 
Calm down. It is so over. 

377 
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:16,441 
We have a young guest. 
My dear daughter, Sophie. 

378 
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,533 
Sophie is really great. 

379 
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:22,278 
After the virus broke out ... 

380 
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:28,710 
everyone fled 
whether they were infected. 

381 
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:30,378 
Whether they died. 

382 
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,880 
It was not long 
for it had spread. 

383 
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,466 
There were only a few ... 

384 
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:41,225 
normal people out there, 
and now here. 

385 
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:45,436 
Some wanted to work together 
and help each other. 

386 
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:51,731 
I had a different way 
to survive. 

387 
00:52:51,908 --> 00:52:55,823 
There she is. 
My dear little Sophie. 

388 
00:52:55,996 --> 00:53:00,908 
Now the princess is awake, 
we can at the table. 

389 
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:02,664 
This way. 

390 
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:17,853 
It ensures 
I do not drink blood ... 

391 
00:53:18,022 --> 00:53:19,932 
I like it would be. 

392 
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:23,359 
I love her. 
It is not meant personally. 

393 
00:53:23,862 --> 00:53:26,401 
She is the next step in evolution. 

394 
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:30,401 
She is infected, 
but can still think. 

395 
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,105 
Ricky? 

396 
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,160 
Where is Amelia? 
-And Charlotte? 

397 
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:13,077 
I thought they were you. 
-Come on. 

398 
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:18,673 
Come on. 

399 
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:37,740 
It was only when I found her. 
She is nice addressed. 

400 
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,110 
Thank God. 

401 
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:46,499 
Is it? 
-How many survivors are there? 

402 
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:48,325 
Six in total. 

403 
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:52,252 
It is true, Amelia. These are hunters. 

404 
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:53,800 
There is a colony. 

405 
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:57,135 
We bring you there. 
The rest, we go. 

406 
00:54:57,305 --> 00:55:00,306 
We were on the road 
to the security doors. 

407 
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:03,011 
The generator takes as it. 

408 
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:07,232 
We need to bottom, 
otherwise we are not gone. 

409 
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,227 
Therefore we must go now. 

410 
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,397 
Morgan? 

411 
00:55:13,491 --> 00:55:15,697 
Everything good? 
-Go. 

412 
00:55:15,868 --> 00:55:17,327 
I send my people. 

413 
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:20,912 
What do you do? 
-I go hunting. 

414 
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,797 
Ricky, are you? 

415 
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:38,059 
How many pills have you taken? 
-No idea. 

416 
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:41,099 
Come on. I know a faster way. 

417 
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:56,034 
Stay with me, okay? 

418 
00:57:03,494 --> 00:57:06,246 
No. Stop. 

419 
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:36,020 
Simple question: 
we follow these people? 

420 
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,154 
They really know the way 
to the security door? 

421 
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:40,953 
I do not know. 

422 
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:43,577 
But we make 
in each case a chance. 

423 
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,391 
<i> Code Black. 
Everyone must leave the building. </ I> 

424

425 
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:14,576 
CODE BLACK 
EMERGENCY BACK-UP Activated 

426 
00:58:22,587 --> 00:58:30,548 
Sorry it took so long. 
I wished that the area was safe. 

427 
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,799 
I care that they are ready. 

428 
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:40,314 
I would love 
that the survivors get ... 

429 
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,143 
but we have our orders. 

430 
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,726 
Is that clear? 
-Yes, sir. 

431 
00:58:59,171 --> 00:59:01,294 
Who are you and what you need? 

432 
00:59:01,465 --> 00:59:06,840 
I call you 
what you've served. 

433 
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:27,693 
Thank you. 
-Get out of here. 

434 
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:08,488 
What flights even point? 

435 
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,108 
Open the door. 

436 
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:18,831 
This nightmare can end. 
Here and now. 

437 
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,795 
One of us is your address. 

438 
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:27,339 
Think. You have already admitted. 

439 
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:32,259 
We think. We talk. We plan. 

440 
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:36,345 
Come closer. 

441 
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:41,141 
I will tell you a secret. 
Come closer. 

442 
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:49,531 
We have developed. 
You mean nothing to us. 

443 
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,031 
Dylan. 

444 
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:25,734 
Thank God. 
-I thought that I would see you. 

445 
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:30,077 
I got half a chance. 
Him. 

446 
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:39,093 
It is worse than we thought. 
Everything has changed. 

447 
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:41,257 
We are the monsters. 

448 
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,925 
There is still hope. 
-What happened? 

449 
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:49,101 
I do not know. 
I was a fool to. 

450 
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:53,436 
He was one of us, 
but that he was not. 

451 
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:58,450 
I have seen. 
People do everything to survive. 

452 
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,250 
Run. 

453 
01:03:29,904 --> 01:03:31,648 
Is it? 

454 
01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:51,804 
Listen to me. 

455 
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:55,258 
We can not buildings 
bombing civilians with it. 

456 
01:03:55,434 --> 01:03:56,679 
What should I do? 

457 
01:03:56,852 --> 01:04:00,020 
You heard him. 
It is a warrant. 

458 
01:04:00,398 --> 01:04:05,310 
Without hunters, we were nowhere. 
We can not let them. 

459 
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:09,700 
There are 
even people who are still alive. 

460

We have a mission. Come on. 

466 
01:04:42,364 --> 01:04:44,855 
Run.

Turn around.

If we do not go 
match us the same. 

473 
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:42,267 
What? 
-Where were you? 

474 
01:05:46,773 --> 01:05:52,859 
I got lucky. 
Good? I got lucky. 

475 
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:02,657 
Note. There are probably more. 

476 
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,586 
I am sure it is safe. 

477 
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:13,008 
We have no time. Do it fast. 

478 
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:15,564 
What is this? 

479 
01:09:41,047 --> 01:09:43,170 
Now you're not a big guy more. 

480 
01:10:01,112 --> 01:10:05,110 
All doors are sealed. 
The rest is barricaded. 

481 
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:08,073 
This lift is our only hope. 

482 
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:09,704 
Wait a minute, boys. 

483 
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,957 
We must think. 
Suppose that a power failure. 

484 
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:16,123 
Then we sit down. 
-Are there safe places? 

485 
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,796 
Yes, 
but we can not go back. 

486 
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,922 
We will try 
get out of it. 

487 
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:26,465 
I want to see daylight again. 
-I want to you. 

488 
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:30,592 
Go us leyden? 
-We should do our work. 

489 
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:35,270 
We hunt and kill. 
Then we go further. 

490 
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,026 
Say which way I should. 

491 
01:10:53,089 --> 01:10:55,794 
Come on. We go. 

492 
01:10:57,344 --> 01:10:59,218 
Come on. 

493 
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:08,347 
Come on, girl. 

494 
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:23,532 
It's too late. She is gone. 
-They guild disagrees. 

495 
01:11:53,827 --> 01:11:54,942 
Oh, no. 

496 
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:58,580 
This can not. 
We need more time. 

497 
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:00,991 
We must find liege. 

498 
01:12:02,712 --> 01:12:04,539 
Tagart, make open. 

499 
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,675 
How many floors? 
-Three. Another to go. 

500 
01:12:15,894 --> 01:12:17,353 
Well. 

501 
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:19,053 
I get it. 

502 
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:22,767 
Here. Those going need you. 

503 
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,404 
I'm immune, remember? 

504 
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:07,953 
They did. 

505 
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:11,617 
It stinks. 

506 
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:19,420 
What is ... 

507 
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,634 
No. Help. 

508 
01:13:21,805 --> 01:13:23,632 
Morgan. 

509 
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:31,644 
Let me go. 

510 
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,813 
Come on. 

511 
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:18,078 
<i> We are ready. 
-Roger. </ I> 

512 
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:24,830 
<i> We are on the way. 
Direction 330, 7 Zulu. </ I> 

513 
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,725 
Come on. 

514 
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:51,323 
It is this way. 

515 
01:14:51,868 --> 01:14:55,569 
How far? 
-I do not know for sure. 

516 
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:59,449 
I do not know where we are, 
but these tunnels leyden all ... 

517 
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:01,086 
to the main door. 

518 
01:15:38,756 --> 01:15:40,500 
Come here, boy. 

519 
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:44,171 
Listen. I give you this. 

520 
01:15:44,346 --> 01:15:48,261 
Take the women 
and the girl back to the top. 

521 
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:52,812 
In the south is a camp. 
Bring everyone to safety. 

522 
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,769 
This is an automatic pistol. 

523 
01:15:55,943 --> 01:15:58,695 
Make sure your bullets 
not a single format. 

524 
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,606 
Bring everyone to safety. 

525 
01:17:01,812 --> 01:17:03,093 
Did you address them? 

526 
01:17:43,778 --> 01:17:45,901 
Charlotte, stay in the neighborhood. 

527 
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:50,992 
Come on. 

528 
01:18:10,225 --> 01:18:11,554 
Come on. 

529 
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,703 
There is no way out.

530 
01:18:42,513 --> 01:18:43,888 
Relax. 

531 
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,649 
I live still. 

532 
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:56,028 
What happened? 

533 
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:10,161 
<i> We are on schedule; 
refueling at 05.00. </ i> 

534 
01:19:12,506 --> 01:19:16,374 
When is the air attack? 
-They will first refuel. 

535 
01:19:16,553 --> 01:19:20,088 
Then they warn us 
if they are near. 

536 
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:24,478 
I know what you think, 
but wait is not an option. 

537 
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:26,021 
It is not practiced. 

538 
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:29,523 
When the sun rises, 
the area safe. 

539 
01:19:29,693 --> 01:19:31,982 
This applies to each building. 

540 
01:19:32,154 --> 01:19:35,109 
Colonel, I want you 
again to remind ... 

541 
01:19:35,283 --> 01:19:37,572 
I think there are survivors. 

542 
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:39,951 
That is listed. 

543 
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:45,829 
Unfortunately, it is important 
that we survive. 

544 
01:19:52,553 --> 01:19:53,585 
Another piece. 

545 
01:19:53,763 --> 01:19:56,005 
We are not lost? 

546 
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:58,970 
No. 
-Where is it? 

547 
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:03,059 
Where are the hunters? Are they dead? 
-Wait a minute. 

548 
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:06,057 
What? 
-What is that? 

549 
01:20:08,322 --> 01:20:10,149 
Maybe we should be there. 

550 
01:20:10,324 --> 01:20:13,160 
Dylan. 
-Someone must have a look. 

551 
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,363 
Do not go too far. 

552 
01:20:58,881 --> 01:21:02,048 
Run. 

553 
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:16,192 
Stop. 

554 
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:53,768 
<i> We are on track. </ i> 

555 
01:22:06,752 --> 01:22:08,246 
Wait. 

556 
01:22:08,963 --> 01:22:10,754 
Did you hear that? 

557 
01:22:11,466 --> 01:22:14,218 
What? 
-Listen. 

558 
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,937 
Do you hear that? 

559 
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:42,574 
It is in order. He is just a child. 
-He may have been infected. 

560 
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:55,016 
It's a boy. 

561 
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:07,398 
He is healthy. 

562 
01:23:08,824 --> 01:23:10,568 
Is it? 

563 
01:23:12,078 --> 01:23:13,703 
He is not infected. 

564 
01:23:28,889 --> 01:23:30,218 
Get her outta here. 

565 
01:23:32,477 --> 01:23:34,221 
Take her away. 

566 
01:23:44,282 --> 01:23:46,026 
Here. 

567 
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:52,785 
We bring 
that you get away, right? 

568 
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:18,737 
Relax. 

569 
01:24:19,907 --> 01:24:24,036 
We must run to the door. 
Good? We can do it. 

570 
01:24:24,204 --> 01:24:26,742 
Good? Are you ready? 

571 
01:24:39,222 --> 01:24:40,965 
Is it? 

572 
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:51,984 
Run. 
-Come on. 

573 
01:25:12,677 --> 01:25:15,133 
Understood. At full speed. 

574 
01:25:57,688 --> 01:25:59,397 
It is not what we thought. 

575 
01:26:10,996 --> 01:26:12,953 
You are not dead. 

576 
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:17,868 
I never 
felt so alive. 

577 
01:26:46,621 --> 01:26:49,112 
Target nearby. Maximum speed. 

578 
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:51,291 
Understood. 

579 
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:56,798 
I give permission for the attack. 

580 
01:27:50,362 --> 01:27:55,321 
After all this you do not go away 
without saying goodbye? 

581 
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:57,531 
You guys are stupid. 

582 
01:27:58,455 --> 01:28:03,995 
You hunt us as pests, 
but you do not belong here anymore. 

583 
01:29:43,995 --> 01:29:48,289 
The observation team has just 
hunters seen. 

584 
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,285 
They have survived. 

585 
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:54,458 
Great. 

586 
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:01,470 
Well done, soldier. 
-Thanks. 

587 
01:30:02,558 --> 01:30:06,603 
Well everyone, 
we go home. 

588 
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
