ARTHUR 3
WAR OF TWO WORLDS
Subtitles: Maver.ikk

2
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,550
"Remember ..."

3
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:57,342
"Arthur was a little boy who wanted to
save his grandparents' home."

4
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:01,508
"He asked the two-millimetre tall Minimoys,
who lived at the bottom of his garden,..."

5
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:05,758
"...to help him find the mysterious
treasure held by the diabolical Maltazard..."

6
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,050
"...and his son Darcos."

7
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:11,758
-Hey, hero, let's go!
"Princess Selenia and her little brother Betameche..."

8
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:14,550
"...joined our
dauntless adventure."

9
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:19,717
"After many brave exploits and close shaves,
they thwarted Maltazard's plan."

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,842
-Father, get me!
"And at last, they recovered the treasure."

11
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:31,550
-Bravo, my boy.
"Ten Months later, Arthur received a S.O.S"

12
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,967
"He made it back to the Minimoys
as fast as he could."

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,133
"With his friend Max and
his flying ladybug..."

14
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:45,675
"Arthur went to the rescue."

15
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:49,508
"After freeing Betameche
from the army of Unicorns..."

16
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,591
"...he finally reached
the Minimoy village."

17
00:01:54,425 --> 00:02:00,300
"Only to discover that the call for help, was a trap
set for him by the loathsome, Malthazard."

18
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:05,300
"Maltazard was determined to take Arthur's place
on the return trip out of the Minimoy's world..."

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,675
"...into the human world."

20
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:21,758
"Now in, bigger and stronger than ever.
How can Arthur, Betameche and Selenia stop him?!"

21
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,591
"At last, you're going to find out."

22
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:24,800
The Liberators
TODAY

23
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,133
They're so excitable today.

24
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:53,216
Strange, Spring's long gone.
Hey, what's going on?!

25
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:56,508
What? That's awful!

26
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:04,466
Hey, Beautiful, we'll finish this off later!
I have to warn the king!

27
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,591
Come on, taxi!

28
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,800
Did you just knock? -Yes, with my head!
-Geez, why can't you use your hand, like everybody else?

29
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:07,133
There's no time to explain,
I need to see the King!

30
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:21,508
Arthur, this can't be a good omen.
Do something to help, will you?.
- I'll try.

31
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,299
Still going, hah?
- Yes.

32
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:34,508
Hi.
-Hi.

33
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,008
Don't you think you should try to come up with a plan first
before charging off to a new adventure?

34
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:42,716
We have to catch Evil M's
before he can do any harm. That's the plan!

35
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:47,049
Evil M is probably seven foot tall by now!
We are two millimeters tall.

36
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,758
Seven feet, two millimeters...
What is the difference?

37
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,591
You don't measure soldiers' bravery
in inches.

38
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:55,383
You are right, it's measured by the number of people
who turn up at his funeral.

39
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:59,674
Selenia, you have no idea what seven foot is.
The power of this sword will be useless.

40
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,466
He'll use it to pick his teeth!
-Maybe he will. Maybe I fail,..

41
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:07,258
...but I'm a princess of royal blood
and I will defend
my kingdom 'till my last breath!

42
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:12,716
Awesome! Great speeches!
Meantime, the sword is a still in the stone.

43
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:17,508
Beta, tell me ... -Yes?
It's been a long time since I beat you up,
hasn't it?

44
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:21,091
No.

45
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,508
Cut it out!

46
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,799
The best plan is definitely not to beat
each other up! - So, what's the best plan,
Mr. Smarty pants!

47
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,966
We have to take a minute and think.
Calmly, ok.

48
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:35,591
M is very tall and we are very small,
but he's a stranger in a world
that I know very well.

49
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:39,133
And he will not take long to
raise an army and invade my country.

50
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:43,466
Now he's so big he can travel faster and farther.
-Now I think that leaves us with only one option!

51
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:47,716
We have to grow too!
-Bravo, Arthur, the perfect solution!

52
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,966
Maybe you can tell us how you plan
on growing us?

53
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,841
Maybe gobble down a ton selenijske soup
to make a quick gain of...

54
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,258
...one millimeter!
No, but there has to be a solution.

55
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,758
He's right! Is written
in the big book. Page 712...

56
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:03,341
...where there is no solution, there's no problem.
-Well, little brother, guess what?

57
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,258
There is a problem, and the solution
cannot be found in any book.

58
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:08,883
In a book! Of course! You're so right!

59
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:12,466
The solution is not in a book?
It's between two books!
-What?

60
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:16,299
Listen to me! In Archibald's study,
I saw a vial between two books.

61
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:20,341
It contained an elixir that makes you go
from Minimoy size to human size!

62
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:25,591
So, we are not human enough for you!
-No, that's not what I ... Selenia, please!

63
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:29,466
This is not a time to pick fights!
Adventure is waiting for us!

64
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:35,549
By the Great Forest! I'll never
get used to that.

65
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,924
Simon, your badge!

66
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:12,633
Your badge should be 4 fingers
over your left pocket, and no place else.

67
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,258
Sorry, Chief.
Thanks for the tip.

68
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:31,383
Martin, that was fast.
-"You holler, we are here." That's our motto.
-Yes I know.

69
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:36,841
And who's that? -He...is my new partner.
Just out of school.

70
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:41,924
I try to teach him the rudiments of the job.
You know, the 'do's' and 'don't's', the 'in's' and 'out's', the 'how's' and...

71
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:48,507
... and 'how not to's'!
-Just one month and he's already crawling.
He's a promising recruit.

72
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,091
Simon!

73
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:58,757
Chief, I lost my badge!
-Find it!!

74
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:09,674
You know it's my son-in-law that insisted
on calling you. I wouldn't disturb you
for anything so minor.

75
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,216
Hello, Martin. -Mrs. Rose, my pleasure.
-You must be dying of thirst from this heat...

76
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:18,882
I'll make you some nice, fresh lemonade.
-That will be great, thank you.

77
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:22,966
What exactly happened?
-Oh, it was nothing, a little too much sun on his head.

78
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:26,424
When the temperature rises,
the heat makes you see things.

79
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,674
Well, let me talk to him.

80
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:39,132
Well, then, sir. What...
exactly did we see today?

81
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:44,382
I saw the devil!
-The devil?

82
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,799
What did this devil look like?

83
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:57,174
Er... about ten feet tall, with a big hat
and... wings on his back.

84
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,632
Interesting. Skin color? White, black, yellow?
-Green.

85
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:07,132
With blue tints.
-Any distinguishing features?

86
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,174
Big nose without nostrils.

87
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:15,257
And holes all over the rest of his body. One
tiny arm, kind of withered,

88
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:20,216
..compared with the other, which was enormous
with this kind of pincers...

89
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:25,632
...he used to pick me up and threw me down!
I was so scared I called for my mother!

90
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,757
Armand?

91
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,132
Hello, Martin.
-Ma'am? -Oh, one more thing!

92
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,716
I think he likes marshmallows.

93
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,716
I think I have all I need.
-Ok.

94
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,466
I'm going to write up my report,
and we will be in touch.

95
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,757
Simon!

96
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,216
Archibald, I don't want to alarm you...

97
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,966
...but, the situation might be worse than you think
-Don't worry about it.

98
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,549
I know him ever since he was this high.
I know how to talk with him.

99
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:02,716
Talking is fine, but in this situation, you may
consider isolating him.

100
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,757
Definitely! Before we can isolate him,
we have to capture him.

101
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,591
We will break the spell and he'll shrink
back to its 3mm height.

102
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:13,882
All it will soon will be back to
normal. Thank you for stopping by.

103
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,716
Chief ...

104
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,924
...I still can't find my badge.

105
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:25,424
First thing first,
let's get out of this mad house!

106
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:44,132
This is so typical of humans!
Just throwing things away without a word of warning!

107
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:49,216
What is this thing? - It's a Police badge. My parents must have
called the police when they saw I disappeared.

108
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:52,924
When I disappear
invite my people over to celebrate!

109
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:56,632
Are you sure that this is the best
way to enter my world?

110
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,674
Watch out! -Yuck, looks like a sward.
-Maybe mud. -Not quite!

111
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:10,299
Where do they come from? -Three days of rain,
it went up with a mud face
of every bug within a ten-mile radius.

112
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:13,132
Looking at a million of anything!
-Or anybody.

113
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:17,090
Look, I think Selenia is right about us as a team.
We'll just end up getting in each other's way?

114
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,799
Hey, I will let you two go ahead.
Good idea, huh?

115
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,174
I have a better one.

116
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,924
Hop on. We'll slide right over them.

117
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,049
All aboard the Bug-Express!

118
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:40,590
How do you steer this thing? -You don't!
You just lean to one side or the other.

119
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:43,007
Sure, but which side? -Right?

120
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,799
Left!

121
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,090
What about braking?
-You just wait for the slugs to flatten out .

122
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,257
Ohhh! They are huge this year!

123
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,007
You gotta wonder whether that new factory
is spewing out some wierd stuff!

124
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:17,590
Hey Chief, in the heat the road
looks like it's warped.

125
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:20,132
It's like in the desert, a mirage.

126
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,924
Pretty soon, you'll be seeing palm trees.

127
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:34,757
You're right, I do see a palm tree right there
in the middle of the road! -It's an optical illusion.

128
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,257
It's really that water tower
about a mile down there.

129
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:43,590
Well, it's a heck of an illusion,
it looks like it's moving.

130
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:47,507
Just wait a couple of seconds
and your palm tree will completely disappear.

131
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:56,299
Chief, that's not a plam tree!
-The devil!

132
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,924
You know him?

133
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:24,590
Evil M has vanished.
-What do you mean 'vanished'?

134
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:28,257
We searched every inch of the forest.
There's no trace of him.

135
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,965
Couldn't have flown away.
His wings haven't been working for ages.

136
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,424
He will come back. We'll hide
and wait for him. -Hide?

137
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:40,965
All 8 feet of him? You don't really think
that nobody is going to noti ...

138
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:55,965
What pipe is right one? -This one is from my room
which is right next to Archibald's study.

139
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,215
Perfect.

140
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,132
We have to climb all the way up.
-Don't worry, we gonna take a bubble?

141
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,049
We would like to take a trip.

142
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,299
Did anybody ever teach you to say 'hello'
when you wake someone up?

143
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:15,632
'Hello', we would like to take a trip.
-I know it's for a trip!

144
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:20,715
What other reasons would anyone wake me up?
For my' pleasant' mood and my 'sparkling' conversation?!

145
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:24,924
Right! At least know where
you're going.

146
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,007
Ya! that pipe there with the red lever.
-Perfect!

147
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,007
Alright! Stay seated, avoid sharp objects
and loud noises.

148
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,965
Got it?! -Ok.
-Flight time is about 5 minutes.

149
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,715
Thank you for using our company
and we hope to see you again...

150
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,007
...in a million years.
-Not exactly great sales strategy.

151
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:48,882
Listen here! If I chose this backwater outpost,
it wasn't to do business...

152
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:52,465
...it was to be left alone, not to be
woken up every 5 minutes ...

153
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,048
Somebody made a trip before us?
-Yes, only a few days ago.

154
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,423
Some poor slober was weeping like a willow.
-What did he look like?

155
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:03,715
Eh... pretty big guy, nasty
arms, nice eyes, but a real blockhead...

156
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,548
Darcos!
-That's the one!

157
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:13,673
No, please! Open up!
-Have a nice trip!
-Open up! We want to get out!

158
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:26,923
Well, here we go. You talk about bad luck
and it comes running
-Beta, don't be so superstitious.

159
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,548
Do you think we're going stay
like this for a long time?

160
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:34,215
Yeah, until someone in this dump
gets the great idea to turn on the water.

161
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:43,632
Douglas, see who's on the list
today. I need 4 volunteers!

162
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:53,548
What happened?
-We saw ...a mirage.

163
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:59,173
And palm trees. -So what?
-Well, it wasn't a mirage.

164
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:03,257
It wasn't a palm tree.
-What was it then?

165
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:07,382
It was the devil.
-What?

166
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,340
On top of that, I lost my badge.

167
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:36,298
Good morning, Mrs.. Springler.
-Good morning, Mrs.. Herman.

168
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:38,173
How are you doing today?
-Very well indeed.

169
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:42,715
Now what can I do for you today?
-I need a new tablecloth.
-Oh, please come in!

170
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,340
Let me show you what we've got.

171
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:50,923
Looking cloth or linen?
Oh, I have got just the thing!

172
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:55,298
Look, this just came in from France?
-Really?

173
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:57,632
Yes, Isn't it beautiful?

174
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:03,965
Good day, Mrs. Springler.

175
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,965
DR Stich
SURGEON

176
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:47,757
If it's a client I will give them
a 50% discount.

177
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:58,423
I am sorry, I was expecting
someone else.

178
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:05,590
How... how can I help you?
I saw your ad.

179
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,465
Nice work.

180
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:15,006
Oh, thanks you... er.

181
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:24,131
How can I help you?
-I want my old face back again.

182
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:27,090
What did you look like before?

183
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:32,423
I was young, good looking,
a proud and wilful warrior.

184
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,631
Determined to conquer
both lands and hearts.

185
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:41,173
Now, look at me! I am nothing
but a ghost of my former self.

186
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:44,173
I have to say you're not exactly...

187
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,048
...easy on the eyes!

188
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,840
Eh, but how did it happen?
-Poisoning.

189
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:56,381
I have seen some horrible cases in my day,
but nothing compared to this.

190
00:19:56,923 --> 00:20:02,465
I mean in terms of decomposition.
-Who poisoned you? -A woman!

191
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:06,673
Oh... women can be terrifyingly
merciless sometimes.

192
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,465
Yes, evil especially?

193
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:13,881
Look, the best thing for you to do
is go home.

194
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,881
Take a few magazines, cut out everything
you like, nose, mouth, ears ...

195
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,881
Then, come back with your clippings
and I'll see what I can do, okay?

196
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,881
I know exactly what I want.

197
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:31,215
I will cancel all my appontments
and see you right now! Just show me what
you want and I'll do it!

198
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:35,673
I don't want to be called evil M anymore!

199
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:41,548
I want to be called M,
'The Magician'!

200
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,548
OK.

201
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:50,798
Doesn't anyone in your family ever wash?
-Of course, usually the first
into the bathroom is my father.

202
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,715
For a quick shave.

203
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,715
After that, when we're at home,
my mother generally takes a bath.

204
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,298
As for grandma,
she likes to water the flowers!

205
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,090
Why is the faucet always
so hard to turn?

206
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:07,006
And if mother doesn't really assist us...
grandma will.

207
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:11,048
Because by this time she is usually in the kitchen
peeling and washing vegetables for lunch.

208
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:14,298
Hello, Mrs. Springler,
I'm so sorry to bother you.

209
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,006
I was wondering if by any chance that
you see my Arthur somewhere in your fields.

210
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:23,423
And if grandma doesn't get us out of here,
grandpa certainly will.

211
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:28,923
So, what you're saying is...
we should get moving ages ago?
-In theory...

212
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:34,090
Yes! -I knew it... fate! We've just pissed
the Goddess of the forest, now she's getting even.

213
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:36,965
Stop complaining, Betameche,
could be worse.

214
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:41,631
Oh, There is worse than being trapped in
bubble in a rotten pipe full of water?

215
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,340
What?

216
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:53,381
With a bit of luck, the current
will keep him away.

217
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,715
Hi!

218
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,423
This time you won't escape me!

219
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:09,590
Selenia, what do we do?
-Absolutely nothing.

220
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:14,173
Look, he's spinning his bubble around
the water. Gradually, he'll drift away.

221
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:17,506
Ya, ya!
-Let's cheer him on!

222
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:22,256
Go, go Darcos! -Come on,
Darcos! Just go!

223
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:27,840
Run faster! Run!
Good boy, Darcos.

224
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:31,465
Try to do better next time!

225
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:44,964
Is he allowed to do that?
Selenia, what do we do?

226
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:49,006
We pray that someone in this
house needs water!

227
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:59,464
If praying doesn't work,
then what shall we do?

228
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:04,548
Then we wait for bells to begin
for the final battle!

229
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:23,006
Hi!

230
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:25,714
Damn!

231
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:30,464
Yes?

232
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:34,089
Sir?

233
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:39,631
Can I help you?
-Yes, indeed.

234
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:44,423
I'm terribly sorry to trouble you
so early in the morning.
- That's not a problem.

235
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:50,339
Are you lost? -Well, yes in a way.
Actually, this is my land a long time ago.

236
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:55,631
So long ago, in fact, I hardly recognize it.
-I see, you lived here as a boy...

237
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:59,131
...you've come back for old time sake?
-Exactly!

238
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:02,631
These vast pastures with
the playground reminds you...

239
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:06,881
It must have seemed less vast,
now that you've grown so tall? -Yes, indeed.

240
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,339
Much smaller.

241
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:13,339
Come in, please. It's already hot outside,
you'll feel much better in the shade.

242
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:18,339
Yes, I do prefer shady places.

243
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,714
Come in, please.

244
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:38,214
Please take a sit.

245
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:42,423
I will bring you a glass of chilled lemonade.
-Don't go to any trouble on my account.

246
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,631
A glass of water will be fine.
-Lemonade is a family tradition.

247
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:51,173
Our grandson loves it.
-Your Grandson? Oh, I adore children.

248
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,673
Where is he?

249
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:58,173
He's eh.. he's in his room.

250
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,089
Give me your hand.

251
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:23,839
This is your bedroom? No, this is just
the bathroom where I get washed every morning.

252
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,631
I'd rather stay dirty.
-You generally do anyway, Beta.

253
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:30,881
Every morning is a battle to get you
under the droplet.
-That's not true!

254
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:33,589
I'm not afraid of a drop of water!

255
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:38,256
Hey, Arthur! Are we going to walk for long?
-No.

256
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:44,798
Oh, my gosh, these cars! Look at this one!
-No. -This is one is great! -No!

257
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:51,131
I love this one! -No!
-What about this one, huh?
-No, I have got about a dozen of that.

258
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:55,798
But this one is my favorite.
-What so special about it?

259
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,589
It goes fast!

260
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,548
Hey, you know where you're going?
-Yes.

261
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:28,589
Now we left the bathroom.
To your left, my desk, to your right, the bed

262
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,131
...and straight ahead, Grand Central Station.

263
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:36,297
Last stop, everybody out!

264
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:51,797
Got any more surprises like that
up your sleeve?

265
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:59,214
Actually, there's one more.
-Better tell me about it now. I hate surprises!

266
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:04,047
Right, ok. I have a friend called Alfred.
He's a dog.

267
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:10,756
What is a dog? -It's like a gamos,
but much, much bigger.

268
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:19,839
Do not worry, he wouldn't
hurt a fly.

269
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:27,339
Go on Alfred! Scram!
Leave her alone! Move!

270
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:46,297
Arthur, you're not going to kill the
poor animal, are you? -No, silly.

271
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:49,214
Just give him something to chase!

272
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:15,297
Sir, won't be a minute.
The Ice cubes won't come out of the tray.

273
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:17,964
Hmmm... funny! -Indeed.

274
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:25,006
Why did you invite that stranger into the house?
-I don't know. The 'voice' probably.

275
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:29,922
Seem to recognize it, but his face...
- Not a face you can easily forget.

276
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:34,672
I must be losing my memory with age.
I just can't put a face to that voice.

277
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:42,172
Dad, Why doesn't the faucet open
when I'm using it? -Because you're turning it
the wrong way, honey? Remember...

278
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:44,922
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

279
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,964
Put your hands around this pitcher.
-Oh... much better!

280
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:52,714
Rose, we have a guest in the living room.
Will do me a favor and bring in
the lemonade. I'll get the glass.

281
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,547
Honey, our guest looks a little strange.
Try not to stare.

282
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:04,172
Oh, you can count on me, Dad. Remember
every Saturday I work as volunteer at the hospital.

283
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,214
That's good.

284
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:13,672
A nice refreshing lemonade?

285
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:23,131
Rose? -What was that
horrible scream?

286
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:26,672
Oh, nothing, it's just my mother.
-Rose!

287
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:39,922
Honey, honey, it's me!
I'm here! Say something!

288
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,589
I will get a cold cloth.

289
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:48,047
Is it serious, doctor?
I think she will survive.

290
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,255
Darling, darling,
wake up, we love you!

291
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,339
Come back to us, come back to us!

292
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,755
If the princess would kindly step aboard.

293
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,672
Whatever.

294
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:14,797
Stand clear off the track,
the train is about to depart.

295
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:12,547
I love the train? -Isn't it
a great way to travel?
-It's a little bit old-fashion.

296
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:16,130
but at least we have the time
to admire the view.

297
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:19,339
Ku-ku.

298
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:20,839
Arthur!

299
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:38,005
Ku-ku, again!

300
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,797
Now that hurts!
-Let's get out of here?

301
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:53,422
Let me deal with this.
-Yes, let's make a deal!

302
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:58,297
Arthur!

303
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:08,005
Arthur?

304
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:11,672
Help me! -Careful! move to your right!

305
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,172
Hasta la vista, baby!

306
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,880
Hey, Darcose, let's make peace.
-Sure!

307
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:40,839
No, Arthur!

308
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,964
Be careful!

309
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,130
Arthur, watch out!

310
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,505
Beta, do something!
Arthur!

311
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:03,505
Well done! Arthur, come on!

312
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:09,422
Don't move, stay here.

313
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:16,755
Selenia!
-Arthur!

314
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:25,255
Artur, we do not have the time for this.
-Yes! I mean no!

315
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,172
Let me deal with this!

316
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:48,005
Arthur!

317
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:52,838
Be careful!

318
00:33:55,255 --> 00:34:00,172
"Twinkle, twinkle little fish,
I will have you in my..." -Stop!

319
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:06,713
Selenia! -Arthur!
-... I'll eat you whole! -No!

320
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,130
Guys, we really don't have time for this.

321
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,672
Let's split up!

322
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:03,172
Darcos, you should turn around.
-Ya, ya, I know that trick!

323
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:06,838
Darcos there's a tunnel!
-Really? -Trust me.

324
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:37,505
Another piece! You have to be careful
of glass. They're everywhere.

325
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,963
I made you some coffee.

326
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:44,422
Lemonade would have been more refreshing,
but ... That's all we've got.

327
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:48,338
I'll put it over here, on the mantle.
-You are most kind.

328
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:58,547
May I use the bathroom? -Yes, of course.
It's just past the stairs on the right.

329
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,505
Thank you.

330
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:10,172
Are you OK? -I am fine, I'm fine!!
-Nothing is broken?

331
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,797
There's nothing left to break!
-Wait, don't move.

332
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,713
There's a shard of glass in your skin.

333
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:25,713
This must be getting in your way.
Let me remove it.

334
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:29,213
Enough!

335
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:38,630
The devil!

336
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:56,171
Maltazard.
-At your service!

337
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,296
I know that I have heard that voice
somewhere before!

338
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:02,421
Am I a master of disguise, or what?

339
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,921
You have me fooled. Compared
to others I've seen ...

340
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:12,088
Amateur! Grab him!

341
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:59,130
Ah... now where were we?

342
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:03,880
You're destroying everything in your
path, as usual! -Eh, that's right.

343
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,421
That little "dust-up" has created a certain amount of chaos.
Please forgive me, Daisy.

344
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:12,171
How did you know my name?

345
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,171
In another life I had
the privilege of watching you cook?

346
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:19,380
I must admit, I was very impressed. I can't
judge the quality of the meals you'd prepared...

347
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:24,213
...because my tongue is
completely insensitive.

348
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:33,921
But the determination and dedication
you'd employed on certain dishes...

349
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:38,380
...was a source of wonder to me.
That famous chocolate pie come to mind...

350
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:43,171
...you started over a hundred times until
you wished yours were perfect.

351
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:47,838
You have been spying on me?
-No, I was just a simple admirer.

352
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:51,421
Observing you from my
three-millimetre high vantage point.

353
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:54,046
But things have changed.

354
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,713
I've grown!

355
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:04,921
Alright, Beta,you stay here
and cover us.

356
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,630
If anything happens, whistle, ok!
-No problemo!

357
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:11,046
Oh, you know how to whistle now?
-Of course!

358
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:14,671
Just one whistle will do.

359
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:17,046
"You know how to whistle now?"

360
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:21,130
Follow me.

361
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:34,588
Arth ... ur!
Se ... Lenia! Phoo... phooo...

362
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,755
Come on, Selenia!
-I'm coming, I'm coming!

363
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,130
No, too big!

364
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,255
No, too loud!
Too complicated!

365
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,171
Perfect!

366
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,838
Hi!

367
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,963
This way!

368
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,754
Thank God, it's still here.
We are safe!

369
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:41,129
Ah, so this is your den.
Your palace. -My God!

370
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:45,171
It's just like you. Old and dusty
and full of things that have no use.

371
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:48,046
Daddy, Daddy, it's me!
-On the contrary!...

372
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:52,379
All these objects are very useful,
my dear Maltazard. -Oh, yeah? -Yes!

373
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:56,754
The book, for example, is very useful
for feeding your souls.

374
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,504
If you have one.

375
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:04,004
Daddy, that's me, Daddy!
-Archibald...

376
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:08,254
..can you hear some kind of noise?
Like a tiny voice.

377
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:12,254
No.

378
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:17,171
Hurry, Arthur, they're coming!
-I'm doing the best I can, Selenia!

379
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:20,129
Oh, no!

380
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:30,088
After this you came, right?
-Yeah!

381
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:33,921
Promise you will? Now
leave this house.

382
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:37,129
How can I be sure you're not playing
a trick on me?

383
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:40,629
Have I ever gone back on my word?
-No, you haven't.

384
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:43,879
So, try keeping yours for once.

385
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,421
Oh no, it's a catastrophe!

386
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:03,129
You scared me? -Would you have
preferred me to whistle to warn you?
-Very funny.

387
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:06,004
It's not my fault. With emotion,
I couldn't whistle anymore.

388
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:09,629
Of course you wouldn't know anything
about emotions. -Thoughts? You think you little boys
have monopoly of emotions?

389
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:13,254
No, it's for anybody who has a heart!  -If I didn't
have a heart, I would have drowned long ago!

390
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:16,421
And I would have been bigger,
I would have shut your mouth long time ago!

391
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:20,879
And if Maltazard drink of the content from the vial,
he'll crush us all. Don't you get it?

392
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:27,421
It's Darcos. We have to get him out of there.
-So that he can massacre us even sooner? -No!

393
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:31,213
So that he can help us find his father.
Come on, help me.

394
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:36,754
It's too heavy.
What the heck is it?

395
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:39,921
Tolstoyesky. Forget it,
it's too heavy. -Wait!

396
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:42,629
Let me try something.

397
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,546
My friends!

398
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:51,588
Oops! -Beta! -Sorry!

399
00:42:55,254 --> 00:42:58,463
Sorry about that, Darcos.

400
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:03,713
Thank you my friends, thank you.
-No problem.

401
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,129
Selenia ...

402
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:16,004
I know you hate me
and you have every reason to.

403
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:19,713
My whole life I have tried
to massacre your people.

404
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:23,713
Now you go and save me.

405
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:29,213
My whole life I've gone after my father,
and now he abandoned me... again.

406
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:36,463
Darcos, I think he just didn't see you.
We're tiny you know? -Ya, ya we know!

407
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:41,212
What's the difference? Big or small,
he never loved me.

408
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:57,254
You know, it's not always
been easy for me with my dad.

409
00:43:57,337 --> 00:44:01,462
I always feel like he never understands me.
But I think he loves me.

410
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:05,587
Maybe not how I liked him to, but in
his own way, I'm sure he does.

411
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:08,129
Really?

412
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:14,837
Arthur? My God, where is my son?
-Don't worry, I'll take care of him!

413
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:24,962
Now that you've got what you want?
I'm gonna ask you to leave this house.
- I will!

414
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:28,129
On one condition.
-Now, that's a surprise.

415
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:33,046
In a few days I would have gathered
enough slaves to build a magnificent palace.

416
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:39,129
Every Sunday I want Daisy to bring
me one of her famous chocolate pies.

417
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:43,254
I thought you have no sense of taste.
And all your senses are rotten. -True.

418
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:46,546
But I still have my imagination.

419
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:49,671
Well? -I'll do it.

420
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:53,504
I will be outside your palace every
Sunday with a chocolate pie. I give you my word.

421
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,337
I can't wait for Sunday!

422
00:44:56,421 --> 00:45:00,629
We have to catch up with them before
he disappears again. -Why does he
always want to be bigger...

423
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:04,379
...when he's already a hundred times
bigger than a nutball field?
-He didn't take the vial for his own use.

424
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,712
It must be to build an army!
-Army?

425
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,629
How do we fight them when they grow that big?
-I have no idea!

426
00:45:09,754 --> 00:45:12,212
For now, let's try to keep him
in our sight.

427
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:23,879
Arthur, you know how to fly these things?
-No, but it can't be any more complicated than
flying a ladybug.

428
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:29,171
Wait, wait friends!

429
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:35,421
I want to go with you! I know my father,
I could be very useful to you.

430
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:40,462
I'm afraid you'll take us over the weight limit.
-Don't leave me here, I don't want to be alone!

431
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:46,171
I'll curl up real small. -Darcos, wait here for us.
I give you my word, we'll come back for you.

432
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:52,254
Really?
My word of honor as a Princess.

433
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:54,712
Oh, all right!

434
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:17,087
No, I don't want to wait here for you!
I want to fight too! I am a warrior!

435
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:24,587
It can't be more complicated
than driving a mosquito.

436
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:33,171
I bet that's the last we see of him.
-I hope!

437
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:35,837
But where is Arthur?

438
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:52,046
He heading for the forest? -What?
-All we have to do now is follow.

439
00:46:57,212 --> 00:47:00,212
Ah! It just know when to stop. No?

440
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:49,587
Ah... my brave and proud warriors!

441
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:53,170
I am here, as promised!

442
00:47:54,712 --> 00:47:58,045
I knew I could count
on you, my loyal soldiers!

443
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,379
The time has come for us
to take revenge!

444
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:06,837
Place your trust in me
and I'll repay that trust!

445
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:12,712
Hey, What's he saying?
-Nothing special! The usual "blah, blah,
thank you for coming...

446
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:16,420
...I am proud of you ... "
-I am proud of you!

447
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,962
But that's enough talk! It's time for
action! Let's get this party started!

448
00:48:32,587 --> 00:48:38,045
Selenia, can you just explain your plan to me?
-There's one person who can produce a similar potion.

449
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:42,545
Powerful enough to break the spell and
bring you back to original size. -That's wonderful...

450
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:46,087
...but where does this person live?
-On the other side of the forest.

451
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:50,045
Alright! so, let's find some transportation.
-Duh... what do you think I'm doing?

452
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:53,837
Selenia, the only thing you'll attract
with a couple of petals is...

453
00:48:57,629 --> 00:49:00,295
A Bee?
-Yes!

454
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,587
Excuse me.
-Oh, no. -O yes!

455
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:16,754
Beta, we are not going to fly on a bee.
-Not comfortable enough for you, sir? -It is not that!

456
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:21,795
You'll see. It's more fun than an airplane!
-It's just that ... I am allergic...

457
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:27,629
...to bee stings.
-Arthur, hurry! Jump!

458
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:30,295
Come on, Jump!
-Oh, boy!

459
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:44,045
Let's see. We have augured
another big one! You can take these as well.

460
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,254
This should be good
right on it!

461
00:49:47,545 --> 00:49:51,754
Thank you, miss. The ambulance will be here
about twenty minutes.

462
00:49:56,837 --> 00:50:00,129
Have I been asleep long?

463
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:07,295
Let get some fresh air.
-Ok.

464
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,379
Oh, not that!

465
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:25,545
I think we've been spotted!
-About time too!

466
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:32,129
Ok, let's go.

467
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:40,878
My humble respect, Your Majesty.
-Save your breath, she doesn't understand.

468
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:43,795
Beta, go get the interpreter.
-On the way, boss.

469
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:52,462
Betameche, what's got into you
waking people up like that?
-We need you to translate.

470
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:56,670
Oh, I asked for a quiet job, not while I'm
constantly being pestered! -Ya, ya.

471
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,920
Really? You've lots of visitors?
-Nope, you are the first. I hope the last.

472
00:51:01,003 --> 00:51:04,837
Just translate what I have to say and we'll
be out of here before you know it? -It's a deal.

473
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,503
I'm Selenia of Metrodoy, 16th of the
name, and I bow down before your majesty.

474
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:17,212
She thanks you and asks by what right you
entered the palace without invitations.

475
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:20,170
The evil M has escaped!

476
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:24,420
If we do not stop him,
our world will become his.

477
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:27,587
Our life will become a nightmare.
We must join forces...

478
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,462
...and stop him before it is too late!
-Ya! Well said!

479
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:38,128
The Queen asks what are you going to bring to the
party of 500 bees armed with poison stingers?

480
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:41,795
She has a point, you know. Just one sting
and we're dead.

481
00:51:43,003 --> 00:51:48,045
The Queen asks what your tragedy is?
-My tragedy? What tragedy?

482
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:56,628
Oh, your strategy? My mistake. The Queen
has slightly expiate anybody pointing it out.

483
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:00,837
Our strategy is simple.
We have here our best knight!

484
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,545
His name is Arthur. He knows
the human world because it is his own!

485
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,003
Step back.

486
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:22,753
What did he say?
-The young bee says she recognizes Arthur.

487
00:52:22,837 --> 00:52:27,587
He saved her life one day after she was caught in a trap.
The young Prince eased her legs out of the trap one by one.

488
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:32,503
Blew unto her 'till she can breathe again
and then fly away!

489
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:39,295
Thank you, thank you.
It was the least I could do.

490
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:49,503
The Queen asks how she can
reward the young hero.

491
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:52,753
By giving him the elixir of life!

492
00:52:54,962 --> 00:53:00,670
What's going on? -Know that the elixir of life is
made in the fall, if he makes it now,
then they won't have any for winter.

493
00:53:00,753 --> 00:53:03,753
The people must decide.

494
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,212
She agrees!

495
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:12,587
We are saved!

496
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,920
We are doomed! I'm telling you there're
thousands of them and much bigger than last year.

497
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:21,253
Francis, right now
I have a maniac on the loose.

498
00:53:21,337 --> 00:53:26,253
Bugs are not high on the priority list
of things to do. So, go home!

499
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,712
Chief!
-What now?

500
00:53:29,795 --> 00:53:33,962
I think you should see this.

501
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,628
What?!

502
00:53:44,712 --> 00:53:48,795
Oh, my God!
-I told you!

503
00:53:49,253 --> 00:53:51,628
Call for reinforcements!

504
00:54:07,587 --> 00:54:12,670
Hey there. Didn't we say noon?
Noon... right on the dot!

505
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:16,836
Actually, we sent for a doctor or an ambulance.
-Pardon me? Are we too late?

506
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:20,586
The boy was being stung?
-No, Why would you think he's been stung?

507
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,420
I called them so there's
no chance of getting stung.

508
00:54:24,503 --> 00:54:28,211
Come on, guys, get the
ladder out! -Alright, Chief!

509
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,670
Every animal  has a role to play
in the chain of life.

510
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:35,045
Like spokes on a bicycle wheel.

511
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:40,920
Take one out and you can find yourself
flat on your face.
-Archibald, Arthur is allergic to bees!

512
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,920
One little sting could be fatal.
I know haven't been the world's best father...

513
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:50,295
But all of this has opened my eyes.
I love my son.

514
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,628
From now on, I'm taking personal
Responsibility? The hive is toast!

515
00:54:55,753 --> 00:55:00,045
Captain, this way. It's bit of a march
to the forest, so chup, chup!

516
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:03,211
Let's go, let's go!
-This way!

517
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:11,420
Will she be much longer?
-No, look, the drop's starting to appear!

518
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:17,545
Amazing!
-She did it!

519
00:55:21,128 --> 00:55:24,586
What was that?
-That is not a good sign!

520
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:27,545
Alright, let's do this carefully.

521
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:39,670
Don't you think we should look for Arthur
before we take care of these poor little insects?

522
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:44,128
No, no, no. Let me remind you that if these 'poor'
little insects attack Arthur, he won't survive!

523
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:47,378
I know, but we don't even
know where he is.

524
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:56,170
Oh no, it's my father! He's coming with the firefighters!
-Wow! That's cool!

525
00:55:56,503 --> 00:56:00,920
What is a firefighter? Usually, they put out
fire, but today I think they're going to start one.

526
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:04,461
Why would they want to burn the hive?
This is the bees' home as much as theirs.

527
00:56:04,545 --> 00:56:08,920
My father must be doing it to protect me.
-To protect you, he's happy to terminate the whole family?

528
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:11,753
I know it's not right,
but he is worried about me.

529
00:56:11,878 --> 00:56:14,170
I'm allergic to bee sting.
Just one sting could kill me.

530
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:17,753
So, he thought ... -Hold on!,
You mean you're surrounded by hundreds of bees...

531
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:21,545
...when a single sting might have killed you?
-We didn't have much choice.

532
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,420
Wow! That's what I call a hero!
-Thanks.

533
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:28,878
That's what I call an 'idiot'!
A selfish idiot! What would become
of me if I lost now?

534
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:32,920
I suppose that's your way of
saying you care about me.
-Of course I care about you!

535
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:35,586
I don't want to finish this adventure
on my own, ok!

536
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,461
Now hurry up and warn your parents
not to massacre us all!

537
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:43,086
I'll go tell the Queen, "Arthur" is allergic
to her entire family.

538
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:48,878
Wait, I have an idea! We could
all call out together, "Dad!"

539
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:53,045
No, no, they won't hear us over
the noise of the bees.
-Yeah, you're right.

540
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,836
They can't hear us,
but maybe they'll see us.

541
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,253
The equipment is brand new,
never been used before.

542
00:57:07,378 --> 00:57:11,253
Well, I'm delighted to attend the
grand premiere.
-Here, Chief.

543
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:14,253
Everything secured?!
-Yes, Sir!!

544
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:22,503
You OK, Chief?
-Yeah... you holding on good?!

545
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:26,086
Not to worry, not to worry.
They're highly trained professionals.

546
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:31,461
I think I'll help out.
Let me lend a hand!

547
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:35,836
Thanks, sir.
-He has climbed a ladder before. hasn't he?

548
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,461
No! -You're there yet, Chief?!
-Almost!

549
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:45,336
You guys holding on?
-We got it!

550
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,169
Honey?

551
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:55,544
Hurry up, hurry up!

552
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:03,003
MOM

553
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:06,044
Your glasses, mom,
your glasses!

554
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:16,544
IT'S ME

555
00:58:17,669 --> 00:58:19,628
Oh, yes!

556
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:26,878
Arthur? Arthure, where are you?
-Rose, calm down!

557
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,628
Arthur, Where are you?

558
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:37,003
Oh, 'IN THE HIVE'!

559
00:58:41,086 --> 00:58:42,753
Oh, no!

560
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:45,044
Honey?

561
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:53,878
It worked!

562
00:58:56,919 --> 00:59:00,294
Honey, I'm here, wake up!

563
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:05,128
Arthur is here!
-Honey, calm down!

564
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:08,419
He's right here, I'm telling you!
-Ok, ok... where?

565
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:13,919
In the bee hive! -Yes, right, of course,
in the the bee hive. -Yes!

566
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:18,294
The bees told me!
-Did they? You speak bee now!

567
00:59:18,419 --> 00:59:24,711
No, no I can't speak it!
But I can read it!

568
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:32,336
Honey, what are you talking about?
-Armand, I don't know how or why...

569
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:37,711
But I assure you that our son is in that hive
you're about to destroy!

570
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:41,003
Do something before
you make a tragic mistake!

571
00:59:41,086 --> 00:59:46,419
You understand me?!
-Yeah, I understand!

572
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:54,253
Second attempt!

573
00:59:55,419 --> 01:00:00,753
Captain? -Yes?
-Perhaps your failure on the first attempt...

574
01:00:00,836 --> 01:00:07,836
...is a sign!  A sign we should let nature
take its course! After all, nature is like...

575
01:00:08,669 --> 01:00:14,086
a big wheel, isn't it! You take one spoke out
and the whole thing can come crashing down!

576
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:17,753
I'm not here to interfere with
the order of the universe...

577
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:21,003
...simply to fulfil a mission
I was given!

578
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:24,836
Do you read me? -Yes!
-Captain Bowery?
-Here Chief, it's for you.

579
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:30,669
Captain Bowery here, Commander.
-Abandon the operation and get back to town!

580
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:34,294
Affirmative, commander.
Unit we're withdrawing!

581
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:36,336
Yes, sir!

582
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:39,878
What about the bees, sir?
-We will be back later.

583
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:42,919
Don't worry, don't come back.
-Thank you.

584
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:49,086
Captain, captain what happened?

585
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:53,211
Nothing! We had to go away
before we can take care of the hive.

586
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:55,878
They need reinforcement in town.

587
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:13,002
Selenia are you sure you don't
want to come with me? Nobody is as good with
the sword as you are.

588
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,836
My father is getting old. Somebody has to
take care of our kingdom.

589
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:20,419
And I promised Darcos
that I wouldn't abandon him.
-Oh, yeah, that's true.

590
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:25,086
Each to his own world, is that it?
-Yes, but our two worlds need each other.

591
01:01:25,169 --> 01:01:28,419
They are inseparable.
-Just like us?

592
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:31,669
Like us.
Now go on, beat it!

593
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:45,502
So, what does it taste like, huh?
-Honey. -Is that all?

594
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:49,002
Take care of yourself, Arthur.
The battle you will be facing will be a hard one.

595
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:53,169
The hardest thing will be to wait
ten months to see you again, Selenia!

596
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:58,461
I'll count every minute that we are apart.
-And I'll count every second.

597
01:02:07,544 --> 01:02:09,377
Arthur?

598
01:02:14,294 --> 01:02:16,627
Arthur!

599
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,627
Arthur, are you okay?

600
01:02:30,711 --> 01:02:36,211
Crazy how good looking he is as a Minimoy,
and how ugly he is as a human.

601
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:13,961
Honey?

602
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:19,711
I think it wouldn't be a good idea if
talk to people about your visions.

603
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:23,044
What visions?
-Ah, what visions? I don't know!

604
01:03:23,086 --> 01:03:27,169
Arthur living in a hive, surrounded by
bees that can read and write.

605
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:32,419
A giant ant.

606
01:03:33,044 --> 01:03:38,169
With blue spots I suppose?
-No. It has got a pink one on his head.

607
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:43,086
I'll make you some chamomile tea.
That will soothe your nerves.
-Right.

608
01:03:52,377 --> 01:03:54,252
Hi!

609
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:59,211
Have we met?
Go away

610
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,669
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

611
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:06,586
That was very clumsy of me.

612
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:17,461
There! Now we're even.

613
01:04:19,211 --> 01:04:21,669
No hard feelings.

614
01:04:28,627 --> 01:04:30,586
Hi!

615
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:43,252
Something tells me
it's right under my nose.

616
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:01,210
Hello, Darcos.
-Hello!

617
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,252
Oh, no!

618
01:05:17,752 --> 01:05:21,252
Don't worry, I'm not
going to hurt you.

619
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:25,960
I just want to know
where Arthur is. Is he ok?

620
01:05:27,044 --> 01:05:29,544
Now speak up a bit,
I can't hear you now.

621
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,169
He is OK!

622
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,460
Sorry, I can't hear a thing
you're saying? Don't move!

623
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,710
Move closer.

624
01:05:52,502 --> 01:05:54,627
Hello!

625
01:05:55,544 --> 01:05:58,210
Can you hear me?!
-Yes, I can hear you.

626
01:05:58,294 --> 01:06:02,502
It's me, Darcos!
-I know it's you! -Archie?

627
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:09,335
What's happening? -Eh... nothing, I was just scanning
the radio for news about Arthur.

628
01:06:09,419 --> 01:06:13,544
Let me know if you hear anything?
-You will be the first to know.

629
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:25,419
Darcos, We're running out of time.
You have to tell me all you know.

630
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:27,960
OK!

631
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:35,877
Wonderful! Wonderful!

632
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:41,252
Wonderful!

633
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:46,460
You were lucky. I had a client with a
car just like this but he got hit from behind.

634
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,294
So, I stole a couple of pieces.

635
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,252
Wonderful! -It's for you!
-Just ..

636
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,627
Wonderful!

637
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:59,544
Do you take cheques? -Sure, cheques, credit cards,
cash. You name it, I'll take it.

638
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:01,085
Of course!

639
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:19,419
This can't be more complicated
than driving a beetle.

640
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:27,169
Oh, I know that sound anywhere.
Music to my ears. -It's a magnificent motor.

641
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:32,460
Check out the vibrato, like a Mozart
symphony. -Yes, it's a real pleasure to drive.

642
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,252
My thought exactly!

643
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,335
Hey, buddy!

644
01:07:38,419 --> 01:07:42,502
Arthur, son! You're safe and sound!

645
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:54,252
Archibald, let me help. I know my father.
I know his strengths and weaknesses.

646
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:58,002
Help me into your world and together
we'll take him down! -Ah, don't worry.

647
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:01,294
Arthur is probably on his tail
and I'll be there to lend a hand.

648
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:05,752
Archie, with every beat my father probably
has already raised a human-sized army...

649
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:11,668
...and is ready to invade the world. Do you
want us to think a boy and his grandfather
are enough to stop him?

650
01:08:15,793 --> 01:08:18,877
You're probably right.

651
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:27,168
But if I bring you into our world,
what proof do I have that you won't side
with your father again?

652
01:08:27,293 --> 01:08:29,752
And help him terrorize us?

653
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:33,377
I did not want to terrorize anyone.
I just wanted to be normal.

654
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,835
To do normal things,
have a normal life.

655
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,627
All I wanted to do is hang out with my friends.
You know, go to the park, play ball.

656
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,752
Careful!

657
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,502
Archie, I have to convince my father
for his sake and for mine.

658
01:08:56,585 --> 01:09:02,710
The chaos and destructions are self-defeating.
You can't cure pain with more pain.

659
01:09:19,418 --> 01:09:23,752
You, you kept all the bottles hidden?
-I know your dad.

660
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:29,752
From animals,
From animals to plants...

661
01:09:29,835 --> 01:09:33,877
For plants to Minimoy.
From Minimoja to. .. Bingo!

662
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:40,335
You sure this is the right one?
-Only one way to find out.

663
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:50,877
Oh, oh, looks like Darcos
is in a tight squeeze.

664
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:03,877
And I have a feeling that
Archibald is making a mistake!

665
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:17,043
Big mistake!

666
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,835
Show time!

667
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:28,960
My God!
-Never seen anything like this?

668
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:36,335
What are they?! -They're giant mosquitoes!
-Giant mosquitoes!

669
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,668
I've never seen anything like it.

670
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:56,960
Douglas? -Yes, Chief? -You're from New York...
think...what creatures are they?

671
01:10:57,043 --> 01:11:00,543
They are not from New York, Sir!

672
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,460
Careful the boy!

673
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:16,377
Get out of there!
It's going to blow!

674
01:11:17,002 --> 01:11:20,460
Take cover!
Let's get out of here!

675
01:11:39,043 --> 01:11:41,960
Go ahead, tell me, I want
to know how things work here.

676
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,251
Who is corrupt?
Who can be trusted?

677
01:11:44,335 --> 01:11:47,126
Above all, who
controls the reins of business?

678
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:51,210
That's me. I'm the mayor
this wonderful town.

679
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:54,960
Population 1,500.

680
01:11:55,085 --> 01:11:58,918
You know, we're not really
about business.

681
01:11:59,043 --> 01:12:03,085
Our comfort and security
are what matter most.

682
01:12:03,626 --> 01:12:06,835
Well ... that's about to change.

683
01:12:16,126 --> 01:12:18,460
Chief look out!

684
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:23,168
It's going to explode!
Go! Go!

685
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:52,835
Hi.
-Hello.

686
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:58,210
I love your hair.
-Really? Thanks.

687
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:05,043
Honey, is everything okay?
-I am fine! -Glad to hear it!

688
01:13:05,876 --> 01:13:07,876
Perfect!
-Come with me!

689
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,793
Coming Archie! Bye!

690
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:14,626
I will let you drive.
I forgot my glasses.

691
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:18,876
You think you'll be ok? -It can't be
more complicated than flying a mosquito, Archie.

692
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:21,460
Maybe.

693
01:13:33,293 --> 01:13:35,585
Let's go!

694
01:13:45,918 --> 01:13:50,043
Tell me when you see the vial
that turns Minimoy into Hercules.

695
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:52,668
This is the one we want.

696
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:56,001
Baby, fill her up!

697
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:06,793
Oh, oh don't die on me now!
-This is the insurance company...

698
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:10,960
...that only opens once a week.
Although I think it could be a little busier now.

699
01:14:11,418 --> 01:14:15,001
And this is the new restaurant
that has just opened.

700
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:20,126
M for Maltazard?
-Yes, of course!

701
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:29,085
My goodness!

702
01:14:29,126 --> 01:14:30,543
Oh, no!

703
01:14:38,585 --> 01:14:40,793
Sorry!

704
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:53,085
Get him!

705
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,043
Here, let's go!

706
01:16:06,209 --> 01:16:08,043
Put it back!

707
01:16:18,334 --> 01:16:23,251
Chief, the hole is too small. We will
never make it through! -He's right, Chief!
-Go around you idiots!

708
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:35,793
Arthur?
-At your service!

709
01:16:39,626 --> 01:16:41,668
Grab him!

710
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:57,418
Oh, God, if you want to help me,
it's NOW!

711
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:06,751
Grab him!

712
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:34,918
You are doing just fine. -Thanks.
-Try not to be so tense. Just relax.
-OK.

713
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:36,876
Good.

714
01:17:40,084 --> 01:17:42,334
That's much better!

715
01:17:54,751 --> 01:17:56,959
Archie ... Archie ...

716
01:18:44,876 --> 01:18:48,959
From now on, if you don't mind,
I will run the show.

717
01:18:49,084 --> 01:18:51,376
Grab him!

718
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:59,084
I hope we're not too late.
-We'll find out in five minutes! Hurry!

719
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:30,084
Mine, what a sorry sight.
Darcos, we have to do something.

720
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:32,834
Yeah, ok. How about
we kill 'em all.

721
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:37,417
I'm thinking of something a little less
radical. -Oh, Yeah, ok, I'm sorry.

722
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:41,251
Thank you, thank you.

723
01:19:41,626 --> 01:19:46,876
Now that our message has been
fully understood, it's pay-back time!

724
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:50,501
This traitor will be the first
to pay!

725
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:54,084
His punishment
must be exemplary.

726
01:19:54,167 --> 01:20:00,126
Proportionate to his insolence!
Without compassion and without pity!

727
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:04,334
Release him!

728
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:15,001
Release him "immediately"!

729
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:19,417
Come on, let me go.
You heard him! -Listen to your Master...

730
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:22,876
...if you don't want him to crush you
into dust like you did this city!

731
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:26,959
Arthur! -Grandpa! -My boy,
I'm so happy to see you again!

732
01:20:27,084 --> 01:20:29,501
You arrived just at
the right time.

733
01:20:31,001 --> 01:20:36,167
Ah, Darcos, how painful it is to be
overwhelmed by both sadness and joy.

734
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:40,417
The joy of seeing you again alive and
well after so long.

735
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:45,001
And there is the pain. For what is worse,
than to be misunderstood by his own child.

736
01:20:45,084 --> 01:20:48,376
The child that you abandoned!
Oh, no, Darcos...

737
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:52,167
...have never abandoned you.
I looked everywhere for you.

738
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:57,209
Under every rock, every shattered
building in our ruin of a kingdom!

739
01:20:57,251 --> 01:21:01,417
The shame that I carried was I
left my son a tragedy to inherit...

740
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:05,459
...instead of a triumph. My son should
have grandeur and power?

741
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:09,001
I worked constantly to rebuild
our empire.

742
01:21:09,084 --> 01:21:12,376
In a secret hope that we will
be reunited one day!

743
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:16,084
And being able to hand it over to you!

744
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:22,292
To... to me? -I know that you have
suffered greatly but one cuts an
empire out of stone.

745
01:21:23,001 --> 01:21:26,334
Not the wood of a weeping willow.

746
01:21:26,376 --> 01:21:30,792
Your suffering in the past
is your strength in the future.

747
01:21:32,126 --> 01:21:34,709
Really?
-Of course! Look!

748
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:39,959
My valiant warriors, allow me to
introduce to you he who, better than I, will...

749
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:46,251
...lead you to victory. He has youth,
He has strength. A modern leader for the modern world!

750
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:51,667
Please, give a triumphant welcome
to your new supreme commander!

751
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,542
Poor fool!

752
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:14,709
I don't get it. Who is the master?
The one before or the one who just fell?

753
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:17,584
Just keep your mouth shut
if you want to get paid.

754
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:27,625
Oh, no! You think Maltazard
did all this? -It's his style.

755
01:22:31,584 --> 01:22:35,917
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Ah... my friends...

756
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,959
I must confess, you were
worthy opponents...

757
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,709
...but the hour of your defeat has come!
That's life.

758
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:49,542
Arthur, the knives at my shins.
Take them now.
-I dreamed of a whole deeper wonderful...

759
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:53,959
Arthur, you know what you're doing? -Yes.
-... but you're brave. Your tenace...

760
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:59,875
...deserves respect and encourage a more
sober approach and so, you'll die without pain.

761
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:06,834
Great news.
-I will even show you my heartfelt admiration
by according you a last wish.

762
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:10,959
Which of you wishes to die first?
-Me!

763
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:15,959
I prefer to save the best for last.
-Bring me that one!

764
01:23:17,584 --> 01:23:19,750
Arthur!

765
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,542
Beta, hurry! Quick!
-OK!

766
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,709
Do you have anything to say, young Arthur,
before we go our separate ways?

767
01:23:32,792 --> 01:23:37,375
I shall be seeing you in the depths of hell.
-Be my guest!

768
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:39,459
Faster, Beta! Go!

769
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,125
Now!

770
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:52,042
Ready to fire!

771
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,667
And fire!

772
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:06,584
What's happening to me? I'm shrinking, Archie!
What's going on?

773
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:11,584
You're not much joy. You'll just
have to forget your dreams of greatness.

774
01:24:15,959 --> 01:24:19,834
Go back to where you belong!
-No! I don't want to be small again!

775
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:22,042
Archibald, I beg you!

776
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:27,667
Men, come to me!

777
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,917
Wow, our liberator.

778
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:58,792
Maltazard, don't go! You will be crushed!
-Death is no concern to me! I am a soldier!

779
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,834
Go, go back, stay!
I will take care of this! Go!

780
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,834
Take cover, sir!
-Maltazard?

781
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:19,500
Maltazard, stop!

782
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:35,292
You'll never capture me!
I'm the Evil M!

783
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:39,708
Lord of necropolis!
Emperor of the seven Kingdoms?

784
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,708
Welcome to your new home!

785
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:50,667
Good. Good job.

786
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:55,333
Connolly, round up the wounded.
Organize first aid!

787
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:05,042
Grandpa!

788
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,417
Grandfather, Darcos?
-Yes?

789
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:18,583
Darcose, are you alright?

790
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,542
I have seen better days.

791
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:27,333
You can't stay here,
follow me. -Oh yeah, ok.

792
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Come on.
Close the door.

793
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,792
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry!

794
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,792
Come on! -Sorry... oops!

795
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,542
Calm down!

796
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:51,917
You have to lie low for a while,
while I convince them that you're
really a good guy.

797
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,542
Do you really think that?
-Of course.

798
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:58,292
You were wonderful!

799
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:01,583
And I'm really proud to count you
as my friend.

800
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,000
Ouch!!! -Oops, Sorry! I did not
mean to hurt you!

801
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:11,375
Are you okay? I'm sorry!
-It's OK.

802
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:14,917
Put this cape on.
You're not exactly easy on the eyes.

803
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:24,417
Maybe you should put a mask on.
I'll find you a helmet.

804
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:33,500
This one!

805
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,583
Wow, so cool!

806
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:45,958
Keep quiet.
I'll be right back.

807
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:53,125
Sorry.-Quiet!

808
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:13,250
Is anyone there?

809
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,458
Hi.

810
01:28:22,167 --> 01:28:26,083
Sorry to bother you, sir
but I'm with the Press.

811
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:30,500
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. May I?

812
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:38,625
Some town people claimed that they
saw the devil in the middle of the town square.

813
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:43,917
And suddenly he started to shrink and
until he just vanished. Can you confirm this?

814
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:51,000
Do you mind if I film this?
It's a perfect shot!

815
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,167
Terrific! Did you know him?
Yes, my father!

816
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:22,000
Arthur? -Daddy!
-Arthur?

817
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:27,333
I'll go on and look.
-My son?

818
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:30,833
You're safe and sound!
I'm so happy!

819
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:33,416
I really hate myself for being
so tough on you.

820
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,083
I never listen to you.
I never pay any attention to you!

821
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:41,750
But it won't happen again, I promise.
-It's okay! -No, no I promise!

822
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:45,791
I'll try to prove that I'm worthy.
...of a son like you.

823
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:48,708
I am so happy
to see you, Dad.

824
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,541
Archibald!

825
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:59,541
This warms the old man's heart.

826
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,708
Thank you.

827
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:04,250
Dad.

828
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:16,166
Isn't it wonderful to see a
family reunited at last? -Ah, Yes.

829
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,833
Soon, we will be
reunited with ours.

830
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:21,625
See you soon, my PRINCE.

831
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:27,791
What a story!

832
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:32,541
I can't believe it!
Arthur, look at that!

833
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:36,291
It cost me a fortune to have it repair,
and now I just have to start over!

834
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:39,041
I suppose you think that cars
grow on trees! -Armand...

835
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:44,250
...It is just a car! -Just a car?!
This is a Dodge V8! -It's nothing but a pile of junk!

836
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,583
It's my car!

837
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:55,083
A toast!
-A toast!

838
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:58,083
Sorry.

839
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,083
Could you pass my badge?
-Simon!

840
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:04,666
Thank you very much. Sorry, Chief.
-And now, dear friends...

841
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:08,125
Daisy's famous
chocolate pie.

842
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,500
I'll cut it!

843
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:22,250
Darling, don't! -I think It is probably wise
to leave it to your husband. -Archie!

844
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:27,666
Let Rose cut the cake.
She's not clumsier than anybody else.

845
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:32,083
She just needs our
encouragement and support.

846
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:35,500
Isn't that what this adventure
been about, really?

847
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:39,291
About trust and helping
each other.

848
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,666
Rosie, you cut the pie!

849
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:52,416
Thanks, Mom. -Darling, that knife
is very sharp. -Daddy, sit down.

850
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,500
Last piece is for you mom.

851
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:24,500
Well done, Mom.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

852
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:37,624
I gave you my word I'll bring you
a chocolate pie every Sunday.

853
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:40,874
It's Sunday. Here it is.

854
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:11,208
Hi, kids.
It's me, Darcos!

855
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:19,374
THE END
