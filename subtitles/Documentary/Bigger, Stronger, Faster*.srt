3
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,937
Turn around.

4
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,014
I'll bite your head off.

5
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,985
I'll see you out there. Yeah.

6
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,255
- Yeah, motherfuckers.
- We'll fuck your ass up, man.

7
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:16,596
In The Prophet, Kahlil
Gibran writes about good and evil.

8
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,930
"Of the good in you, I can speak,

9
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,099
but not of the evil."

10
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:27,503
You are only good
when you are at one with yourself.

11
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,213
What you went through in here
I wouldn't wish on any man.

12
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,850
But you survived.

13
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,856
You didn't ask for trouble.

14
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,663
But you didn't back down
from it either.

15
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,829
It was as if you were born
to the darkness in this place.

16
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,540
I hope to God

17
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:03,875
that this day,
you put that darkness behind you.

18
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,851
I want you to know
there is help on the outside.

19
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,656
So if you get to thinking it's too much
and you can't handle the pressure,

20
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,527
please call one of these numbers.

21
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,902
Do you have any questions?

22
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,671
Where's the exit?

23
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,295
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Hey!

24
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,595
Hey, what the hell?

25
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,735
May I help you?

26
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,573
Sir? Sir?

27
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,520
Now, that happens, we'll be...

28
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,230
Jesus.

29
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,119
How's it going, man?

30
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,522
You know how it is.
One day good, the next not so good.

31
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,964
Just have to go with the flow,
you know?

32
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,301
So, uh...

33
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,667
You don't trust me.

34
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,708
All right.

35
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,649
Man, what did I tell you
about that hairy change?

36
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,388
Okay, if you don't want my
business, I'll take it elsewhere.

37
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,890
It's your jones, holmes.

38
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,725
Wait a minute. Please.

39
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,230
I'm sorry. I was just
messing with you, okay?

40
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,364
It's me. You know me.

41
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,867
Please.

42
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,683
Okay, okay.

43
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
Oh, no.

44
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,831
Hey.

45
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,769
Will you look at that?

46
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,205
Looks like somebody got lost.

47
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,622
What do we got?

48
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,293
Wha...? What do we got?

49
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,693
- Yeah, I caught the case.
- No, you didn't.

50
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,699
Yeah.
You couldn't have.

51
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,430
Why is that?

52
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,973
Because Mallory would
never put you on my case.

53
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,644
I don't like this
any more than you do.

54
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,939
I'm weeks away from retirement,
got paperwork up my ass.

55
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,585
So when the supervising sergeant
tells me to jump,

56
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,946
I just go with the flow, baby.

57
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,321
You can't smoke in here.
Sorry.

58
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,396
Get me a good tight
shot of that exit wound.

59
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,666
It is being
reported that a gunman entered

60
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,533
a downtown Bakersfield building
this afternoon and opened fire,

61
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,698
killing an employee.
The suspect remains at large.

62
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,210
Stop!
He is described as a male in his 30s,

63
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,247
approximately 6"3" tall
with closely cropped hair.

64
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,919
Police have not yet released
the name of the victim.

65
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,602
The gunman was described
as armed and extremely dangerous.

66
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,132
Let me call you right back.

67
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,812
Well, well.

68
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,574
You've been a bad boy.

69
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,044
It's a nice set of wheels
I got you out there.

70
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,724
You got my money?

71
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,099
Hm.

72
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,298
Now, how'd you smuggle
that much money out of prison?

73
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,906
You don't wanna know.

74
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,774
I want the other names.

75
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,310
The price just went up.

76
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,476
It took me 10 years
to track down these people for you.

77
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,349
And it cost a lot of money.

78
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,150
And now I wants to re-negotiate.

79
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,455
Okay.

80
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,190
That's what I thought.
You're playing ball now.

81
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,198
The price just went down.

82
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,333
Kenny?

83
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:28,965
Kenny.

84
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,775
This here is
my Samoan friend.

85
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,347
Ultimate Fighting champion
over in Guam.

86
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,576
You don't know half the sick shit
they do over there just to win a title.

87
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,733
I know what that is.

88
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,269
I know who you are.
Who is he?

89
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,872
Brother,
I ain't got no beef with you.

90
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,373
Do what I pay you to do.

91
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,841
What are you doing?
This dude's a ghost.

92
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,143
I can't mess with no ghost.
You better get back.

93
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,514
I ain't messing with a ghost.
Bald-headed Precious. Get your...

94
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,648
Here, I owe you a refund.
Here you go.

95
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,595
He looks so familiar.

96
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,231
I have seen him somewhere,
I know it.

97
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,567
Really?

98
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,998
All right, here it comes.

99
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,409
Look at his face.

100
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,741
He knew
his number was up.

101
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,876
Wait a minute.

102
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,189
That's not just fear,
that's recognition.

103
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,918
He can't see where the gun is.

104
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,255
It's blocked by the partition.

105
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,896
He knew him.

106
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,197
Maybe.

107
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,129
Hello?
Marina.

108
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,270
Hey, it's me.
Do you know what time it is?

109
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,462
Yes, I know it's late, I'm sorry.

110
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,800
Call me right...
Okay, okay.

111
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,342
You"re taking him to the game.
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.

112
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,073
I'll pick him up tomorrow.
Yes, I'll be on time.

113
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,151
Don"t let him down. Promise.
Yes, I promise.

114
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,978
But listen... Listen.

115
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,786
Morning.

116
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,256
I did a sequence
of poses this morning

117
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,919
that only 10 people
on the planet can do.

118
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,394
Ending with the corpse pose.

119
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,624
But you know what,
I'm done with yoga.

120
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,267
I beat it.

121
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,634
You beat yoga?
Yeah.

122
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,772
It's time to move on.

123
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,072
To what?

124
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,476
I don't know.

125
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,076
Something more ultimate.

126
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,985
I worry that a real corpse pose is the
only thing that's gonna satisfy you.

127
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,061
No, come on, not death.

128
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,825
Life.

129
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,864
Oh, I've never felt so alive.

130
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,729
Really?
Yeah.

131
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,019
Got a new client for you.
I know you like a challenge.

132
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,195
We"re gathering information
on locations.

133
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,333
I"ll send you the target spec now.

134
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,130
The client thinks
the target"s coming after him.

135
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,171
He needs the job done fast.
Okay.

136
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,173
Who's he?

137
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,547
It's not a question I ever ask.

138
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,527
Sure you don't wanna stay a while?
Hold that thought.

139
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,615
It"s my work.

140
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,792
It's getting harder and harder
to go on these jobs.

141
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,462
You mentioned
this before at our last session.

142
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,259
- Can you take some time off?
- No, no, that's not an option.

143
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,434
My business is important.

144
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,070
You haven"t told me
what it is you do now.

145
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm a surgeon. I remove cancer.

146
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,433
Well, I'll have to take you
at your word.

147
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,478
You know, I have other patients
in the medical field.

148
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,447
They find it hard to handle
the stress associated with their jobs.

149
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,155
There"s a lot of pressure when you
have someone"s life in your hands.

150
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,961
Morning, Detective Cicero.

151
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,290
Sergeant Mallory.

152
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,531
Don't be mad.

153
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,296
You should've told me.

154
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,063
You're right, you should've
heard it from me. I'm sorry.

155
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,604
I should've told you.

156
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,078
Let him help you
with the case though.

157
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,645
So, what do we got?

158
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,080
You play fast and loose
with that "we" shit, cowboy.

159
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,320
We got our shooter.

160
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,858
We?

161
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,923
I got a call from the warden
at Murdoch.

162
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,001
He recognized our guy in the news.

163
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,934
Apparently, he made a lot of money
running contraband in prison.

164
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,269
Any gang affiliations?
Nope, did his whole 10.

165
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,470
No protection. A walk-alone.
They kept coming after him.

166
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,547
He kept knocking them down.

167
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,149
I see he kept score.

168
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,946
All he had to do was flash that
and no one would screw with him.

169
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,949
He got popped for a bank job.
Ten years ago, Bakersfield First.

170
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,964
Don't be a hero, you got me?
Stay down.

171
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,827
Shooter was a bank robber...
He was the driver.

172
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,963
- Go, go.
- Get in.

173
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,112
Go, go, go!

174
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,188
Look out.

175
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,763
What are you doing?

176
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,397
You're gonna get us killed.
He knows what he's doing.

177
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,840
Do your thing, little brother.

178
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,501
Go, go, go.

179
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,055
Damn it, what's he doing?

180
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,359
Where you going?

181
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,789
They passed. They passed. Do it.

182
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,069
- I don't see anyone. Think we're clear.
- Slow down.

183
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,864
Slow down!

184
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,579
Turn it around.
Turn it around. You son of a...

185
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,177
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

186
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,287
- Cops, man!
- They're right there!

187
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,756
You're good. Go.
Cops, cops.

188
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,103
You're good, you're good.

189
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,465
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rip it. Rip it.

190
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,116
Now, he made a clean getaway.
So who collared him?

191
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,955
Good, this is where
it gets really interesting.

192
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,155
I wanna show you something.

193
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,401
Check this out.

194
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,301
Oh, my.

195
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,438
This is such a big help.

196
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,130
It takes me a long time
to get up those stairs.

197
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,469
You can put the things anywhere.
Okay.

198
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,542
You okay?
Yes.

199
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,274
Thank you for your concern.

200
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,183
You're very kind to help an old man.
Sure.

201
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,553
I'm gonna go.
Can I offer you something to drink?

202
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,126
I should be going.
No, let me get you something.

203
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,025
Please,
it's the least I can do.

204
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,498
Be nice to have a little
company for a change.

205
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,671
You see,
I changed careers because l...

206
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,366
Well, I had some issues
I needed to resolve.

207
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,281
You know, I needed to test myself.

208
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:24,547
Mentally and physically.
Really re-create myself.

209
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,791
And now it"s all become too easy.

210
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,518
Yes. Yes.

211
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,028
I'm bored, but I mean,
that's only part of it.

212
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,693
I mean, it's Lily.

213
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,233
She's a distraction.

214
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,836
Distractions can be a problem
in my work.

215
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,422
You were going to talk to her
about marriage and having a family.

216
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,261
Is that still something you want?

217
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,066
You know what? You're right.

218
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,137
I mean, she's the woman I wanna
spend the rest of my life with.

219
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,042
Are you gonna ask her
to marry you?

220
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,477
That's what I'll do.

221
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,242
I'll pop the question. Heh, heh.

222
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,154
Are you off your meds?
Yes.

223
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,120
As your therapist,
I have to advise against that.

224
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,656
Gotta go.

225
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,672
All right, look, there"s two cars.

226
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,171
Quiet.

227
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,804
All right, you"re good.

228
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,071
All right, you guys. Here we go.

229
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,238
Be quiet.

230
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,616
Back, back, back!

231
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,980
Hands up!

232
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,520
Back up.
Tell me what"s going on here?

233
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,387
After the bank job, they got
ambushed by another crew.

234
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,425
Somebody set him up.

235
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,257
And somebody taped it?

236
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,956
Sick bastard made
his own personal snuff film.

237
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,795
- Where"s the money?
- Tell them.

238
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,335
I knew I remembered
this guy from somewhere.

239
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,130
Where did you get this?

240
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,935
First week I made detective,
Vice busted this porn operation.

241
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,841
I walked into the bullpen,
they were watching this.

242
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,675
I pretended I got a phone call,
had to walk out.

243
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,545
Didn't have the stomach for it.

244
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,775
Bank robbers, huh?

245
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,787
- Tough guys.
- Don"t tell them.

246
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,959
I flipped it to Homicide,
but never went anywhere.

247
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,324
Why is that?
Never see the killers' faces, not once.

248
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,557
Where"s the money?
Don"t tell, bro.

249
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,200
- Brothers?
- Your brother?

250
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,529
- I don"t see the resemblance.
- Yeah.

251
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,162
You want me to shoot him, huh?
Like the others?

252
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,234
He"s not gonna kill me,
he"s bluffing.

253
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,011
Bluffing?
Two down and I'm bluffing?

254
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,580
- You want me to shoot him?
- Think twice.

255
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,775
You want me to shoot him, huh?
Like the others?

256
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,318
- Don"t tell him.
- Don"t shoot him.

257
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,219
He"s not gonna shoot.
Let"s tell him where it is.

258
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,292
But it"s our only leverage.

259
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,124
I'm sorry I got you into this, bro.

260
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,356
Just tell me where the money is.

261
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,558
I bet you're a good student.

262
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,998
Yeah.

263
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,736
Thanks for the drink.
Sure.

264
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,875
I should get going.

265
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,054
Sorry I got you into this, bro.

266
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,594
Sorry I dragged you into this.

267
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,259
- Last chance.
- Don"t tell him, bro.

268
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,297
- Please, don"t shoot him.
- Don"t do it.

269
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,838
It"s up to you.

270
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,873
Don"t you tell him, bro. Don"t tell him.

271
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,312
Under the floorboards
in the kitchen.

272
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,948
There you go.

273
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,935
- Gary, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

274
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,166
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay, bro.

275
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,803
It's gonna be okay.

276
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,245
No!

277
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,782
Oh, Jesus, man, no.

278
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,078
No!

279
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,986
Gotta get that money.
Jesus, man.

280
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,837
Gary!

281
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,301
Told you wouldn't shoot him.

282
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,070
- Watch him.
- Okay.

283
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,146
See if he's lying.

284
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,507
I got it.

285
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,722
Lift this up in the bag.

286
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,181
Hey. Hey.

287
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,630
Smile for the camera.

288
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,969
Smile for the camera.

289
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,486
I didn't know.

290
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,055
I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

291
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,265
Don't, please.
He made us do it.

292
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,459
Please don't hurt me.

293
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,387
I'm not gonna hurt you.

294
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,022
Smile for the camera.

295
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,391
I'm gonna kill you all.

296
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,664
They killed him.

297
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,570
What do you mean they killed him?
He was dead.

298
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,869
At least for a little while anyway.
The hospital pronounced him DO A.

299
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,518
Can you hear me?

300
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,052
Bullet hit, ricocheted around
his skull, came out his cheek.

301
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,249
He's got a plate holding
the back of his head together.

302
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,360
I mean, this guy refused to die.

303
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,525
And now, he must be going after
everyone in that video.

304
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,075
You said you wouldn't be late.
Where have you been?

305
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,272
I caught a case.

306
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,180
You're supposed to take Tommy to his game.
You made me late for my class.

307
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,550
I'm sorry, it's a big deal,
this case.

308
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,120
I saw it on TV.
I do not wanna hear about it.

309
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,263
You want me to have full custody?
I will take custody.

310
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,525
You know I don't want that.

311
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,136
Then take him to his baseball game.
Okay. All right.

312
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,430
What's up, champ?

313
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,368
What position they got you playing?
Don't play much.

314
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,313
Well, you got an arm
like a cannon.

315
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,575
I don't know why
they wouldn't let you.

316
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,378
I know.

317
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,282
Maybe I should have a talk
with that coach.

318
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,255
Maybe pinch-hit or something.
What do you say?

319
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,590
- Hello?
- Hey, it"s Cicero.

320
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,635
There"s been another shooting.
This could be our guy.

321
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,828
Yeah.

322
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,905
Mallory wants you
down at the scene.

323
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:14,977
Okay, I'll be there in a little bit.
4045 Danson Road. Got it?

324
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,238
I'll be there in an hour.

325
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,953
Hey, you know what,
I'm not gonna make it in today.

326
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,390
I'm taking my son to a baseball game.
It's really important that I be there.

327
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,160
Well, you know what?
That's just too bad.

328
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,094
All right, bye.

329
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,135
Good grief.
Can you imagine that?

330
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,604
I already told them I had
a ball game to go to today.

331
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:54,617
Incredible.
You're a full two hours late.

332
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,980
John, did you...?
So, what do we got?

333
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,485
What do you got?

334
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,883
Guy did the world
a favor on this one.

335
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,959
Found out
who shot our snuff films.

336
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,528
Excuse me.

337
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,189
So we got a telemarketer, a sex offender.
What's next, a lawyer?

338
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,359
Whole shebang
just got a lot weirder.

339
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,335
Witnesses placed a
second shooter at the scene.

340
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,633
After our suspect
whacked Mr. Rogers,

341
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,368
he had a little shootout
in the hall.

342
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,137
Maybe an armed neighbor.
Uh-uh.

343
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,975
No one recognized
this dude.

344
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,847
They exchanged gunfire then disappeared.
Both of them.

345
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,516
The second shooter,
any description?

346
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,487
The word "beautiful" came up.

347
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,991
Beautiful?
Like a movie star.

348
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,824
He punked me.

349
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,424
He's really that good?

350
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,363
Good"s not even the right word.

351
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,402
I mean, you know,
the dude's completely artless.

352
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,668
I mean, there's no sophistication
to him whatsoever.

353
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,867
But he's pure, you know?

354
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,209
No fear, no hesitation.
There's nothing.

355
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,747
He as fast as you?
No, he's faster.

356
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,922
You'll get him.

357
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,257
How can you be so sure, hey?

358
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,690
Because you always do.

359
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,793
Baby.
Yeah?

360
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,131
Marry me.

361
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,457
Hey, mister.

362
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,166
Goddamn it. Shit.

363
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,942
Is that what I think it is?

364
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,150
Oh, the tattoo?

365
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,283
Yeah. Tattoo.

366
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,221
Yeah, I was in the L.A. Crash Unit
before I got transferred up here.

367
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,996
Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops
with porno mustaches?

368
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,193
That Crash?

369
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,702
Yeah, is it so hard
for you to believe?

370
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,405
Yeah.

371
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,038
Can I get in there?

372
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,909
That's where I met Marina,
actually. She was my CI.

373
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,547
You married your snitch?

374
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,149
Dude, that is wrong
on so many levels.

375
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,585
Well, she was in really bad shape.

376
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,386
Got in rehab and we fell in love
and there you go.

377
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,997
Was she the only one in rehab?

378
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,529
That's ancient history.

379
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,567
You sure about that, Hoss?

380
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,895
Listen, I got 10 days
to retirement.

381
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:40,271
Full benefits for me and my family,
so why would I screw that up?

382
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,411
It's all I got.

383
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,080
All right. Let's go.

384
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,716
How long you been clean?

385
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,785
Since my son was born.

386
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,450
Good for you.

387
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,810
David, come on.

388
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,983
David, did you forget something?

389
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,914
- You forgot my hug.
- Love you, Mommy.

390
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,347
Good job.

391
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,676
Oh, my God.

392
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,783
You can't do this.

393
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,798
Why did you come?

394
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,667
There's nothing for you here.

395
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,704
Why did you make me stop
coming to see you in prison?

396
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,883
I didn't see any sense
of three wasted lives.

397
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,780
Three?

398
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,582
Was that him?

399
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,390
The boy?

400
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,326
David?

401
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,295
You shouldn't think...

402
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,296
You did a dime.

403
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,798
David's 8. Do the math.

404
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,943
When you cut me off,
I gave the baby up.

405
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,911
Did you find a good family?

406
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,016
I had an abortion.

407
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,459
I'm sorry.

408
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,853
All right.

409
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:22,288
They know what you're doing.
I saw it on TV.

410
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,129
I hope you kill them all.

411
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,887
Shall we begin?

412
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,258
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

413
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,440
Let's start a family.

414
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,447
Family?
Yeah.

415
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,907
What's gotten into you?

416
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,716
We'll sell the house by the lake,

417
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,650
and we'll get a Craftsman
in Pasadena.

418
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,483
Fresh start.

419
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,324
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

420
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,130
Yes.

421
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,670
And what about your work?

422
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,702
Oh, um...

423
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,141
Well, what about it?

424
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,804
Would you quit before this job?
Absolutely.

425
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,083
I will quit absolutely.

426
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,843
Just like that?

427
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,655
Just like that.

428
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,263
Marina.

429
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,270
Let me in for a second,
I need to talk.

430
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,271
I'm gonna stand here all day,
so you may as well.

431
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,501
Marina.

432
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,716
- Killed, the first
victim was gunned down less than an hour

433
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,785
after the suspected gunman
was released from prison.

434
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,012
While the second victim
was shot...

435
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,657
What are you doing here?

436
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,725
Thought you didn't care
about my case.

437
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,555
- To a bank robbery
at Bakersfield 10 years ago.

438
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,696
Look, I do not need you coming here
and dragging us down again.

439
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,765
Marina, if you just...
No.

440
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,870
I am getting
my associate's degree.

441
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,303
I am trying to make something
better for Tommy and me.

442
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,237
Please take me back.

443
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,741
It'll be okay.

444
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,506
It's not okay.
Marina, I'm begging you.

445
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:55,048
I'm begging you, please.
God. Get off your knees.

446
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,552
Marina, please. Just please...
Don't touch me.

447
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,553
Do not touch me.

448
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,917
Give me the dope.
I don't have any dope.

449
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,097
Give it to me.

450
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:11,290
Okay. Here.

451
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,828
It's all I got.

452
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,271
Look, I'll go to rehab.
I swear to God I will.

453
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,169
Let's go. Let's go right now.

454
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,607
After the case, I gotta finish the case.
Well, I can't just walk out on that.

455
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,907
I just wanna be with you
for one night.

456
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,278
I mean, you know,
with Tommy and...

457
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:29,844
Please.

458
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,782
Just one night.

459
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,972
- Radio...
- Twenty-five dollar gift cert...

460
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,669
Brother, put down that bottle.

461
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,440
Put down that cocaine,
that methamphetamine.

462
00:46:56,613 --> 00:47:01,983
Put down that.45,
that.38 and that.357 Magnum.

463
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,320
So precious to each one of us.

464
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,358
Why?

465
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,228
The night is far gone,

466
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,731
the day is at hand.

467
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,402
Those that live by the sword
will die by the sword,

468
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,968
unless they learn to forgive.

469
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:31,973
God made life so fragile
and so precious for each one of us.

470
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:39,248
You will never truly be free
unless you learn to...

471
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,354
Yo, I gotta take a leak.
I'll be right back.

472
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,404
Hold up, big man,
I gotta check you. Arms up.

473
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,086
Got any weapons on
you besides these guns here?

474
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,286
I'm only kidding, man.
Go on, have a good time.

475
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,293
Welcome to the gentlemen's club.

476
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,559
It's a two-drink minimum
tonight, baby.

477
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,704
My man.

478
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,371
Hey, what's up, big dog?

479
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,114
I'm great.

480
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,183
Right.

481
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,754
Wake up, Joe.
Huh?

482
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,941
I've been expecting you.

483
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,339
Joe.

484
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,340
Joe.
Huh?

485
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,981
Oh, Shelly.

486
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,986
Go outside and watch the door.

487
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,560
Only one of us
is gonna make it out of here.

488
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:03,627
No matter who it is, Joe,
you didn't see a damn thing.

489
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,665
Go on.

490
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,162
All right, then.

491
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,052
I got a son.

492
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,930
Tell him I said I'm sorry.

493
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,437
I'm begging you.

494
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,309
He's speed dial number three.

495
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,447
I'm sorry.
He made us take you down.

496
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,647
Hello? Hello?

497
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,285
Your father's sorry.

498
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,945
Who is this? Is he okay?

499
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,052
Did something happen?

500
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,023
Yeah.

501
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,922
Something happened.

502
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,502
I thought you said
you were done.

503
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,538
I have to finish this one first.

504
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,735
You promised me you were quitting.
And I will. I will quit.

505
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,306
But after this one.

506
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,216
No, this isn't fair.

507
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,246
I didn't ask you to marry me.

508
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,618
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

509
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,259
Mm-hm.

510
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,223
What if I told you you had to choose?
Don't.

511
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,958
You used to be attracted
to what I do.

512
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,431
I'm your wife now.

513
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,940
What if he kills you?
Lily.

514
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,656
Daddy?

515
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,326
Yeah?

516
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:05,067
I know I suck at baseball.
You don't have to pretend like I'm good.

517
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,673
You'll get better.

518
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,139
You just need to practice.

519
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:18,035
Maybe you and I can throw the
ball around one day. How's that?

520
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,876
Okay.
I gotta tell you a secret first, though.

521
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,615
What, Daddy?
I suck at baseball too.

522
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:36,125
You go to sleep, okay?
I'll be back.

523
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,168
Jesus Christ.

524
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,336
Oh, Jesus.

525
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:50,172
Are you okay? Look at me, look at me.
Why did you do this?

526
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,837
I'm afraid.

527
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,083
What are you afraid of,
honey?

528
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,687
We're going to hell for what we did.

529
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,056
Do you know what hell is?

530
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,622
It's not fire and devils.

531
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,155
All that stuff they taught you
when you was little.

532
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:15,467
We make our heaven
and our hell while we're alive,

533
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,370
Every time we cause pain,

534
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:26,180
every time we cause suffering.

535
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,483
Cicero.
Hey, it's me. Did I wake you up?

536
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,713
No.

537
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,915
You said on your message
to give you a call, so...

538
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,753
Okay, here's the deal.

539
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:48,125
Both of our victims
were informants.

540
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,790
- Could be something there, right?
- Yeah, could be.

541
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,396
Nice work.

542
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,162
Okay, I need you to follow up on it.

543
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,637
I gotta be in court,
but I really think we're getting close.

544
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,244
It"s gotta have something to do
with how they got set up.

545
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,881
Did you hear about that stabbing
in Henderson?

546
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,816
Yeah, yeah, what about it?
I got a hunch it might be our guy.

547
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,955
It's not his m.o.
Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber.

548
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,990
Like I said, I got a hunch.
Yeah, so did Quasimodo.

549
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,357
Look where it got him.
I'm gonna go ask a few questions.

550
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,395
After you do the follow-up, right?

551
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:26,023
Got it cleared with the Henderson IC.
I'm headed up there now.

552
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:30,536
I have to be in court all day.
I am asking you to do this. It's my case.

553
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,285
- Bring us nothing
but the same politics as usual.

554
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,920
I have fought
to keep government honest,

555
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,353
save you money
and to lower your taxes.

556
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,085
Above all,
I will be someone who listens to you.

557
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,422
The choice is simple,
vote Margie Pageant.

558
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,827
In local news, a Henderson
man is fighting for his life

559
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,936
after being brutally attacked
at a gentlemen"s club.

560
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,334
The man is suffering
from stab wounds.

561
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,942
Doctors describe his condition
as critical.

562
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,737
Hello?

563
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,584
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

564
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,859
We think he"ll
be heading back. Your position?

565
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,939
Tehachapi.
Try the hospital in Clark County.

566
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,344
His third victim survived the hit.
He"ll be wanting to finish the job.

567
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,988
Where are you?

568
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,951
Good night.

569
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,829
Doctor.

570
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:25,873
What the hell is that?

571
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:34,212
Back in the room, back in the room.
Police officer, get back.

572
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,319
- Police.
- He went that way.

573
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:43,195
I'm a cop. Where'd he go?
He went downstairs, officer.

574
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,752
How do you have my dad"s phone?

575
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,354
He asked me to call you.

576
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,755
Are you the one who killed him?

577
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,219
Yes.

578
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,558
I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna kill you.

579
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,164
Do what you need to do.

580
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,872
But you better be sure,

581
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,170
because it's a long, dark road
you're headed down.

582
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,189
I lost him.

583
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,800
Client wants to pull the job.

584
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,528
No. No way.
You tell him to back off.

585
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:52,707
I've got this under control. All right?
You"re running out of time.

586
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,548
Where's the old man?

587
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,880
Dead.

588
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,546
Don't lie to me.
I'll show you the damn grave.

589
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,118
How long ago?
I don't know.

590
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,829
Three or four years.

591
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,067
Hold still.

592
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,741
Okay.

593
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,598
How long you been out?

594
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,266
Couple of days.

595
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,467
And why are you here?

596
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,673
Came here to kill the old man.

597
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,434
Why?

598
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,304
Because he set us up.

599
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,583
What makes you think that?

600
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:46,744
Gary went to him for advice on the
bank job and he wanted full share.

601
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,446
Gary wouldn't give it to him.

602
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:54,186
So do you think the old man was
capable of murdering his own son?

603
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,327
Yeah.
No.

604
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,130
Mm-mm.

605
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,100
Nope.

606
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,168
He couldn't have.

607
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,604
What makes you so sure?

608
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,507
I just... I just know.

609
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,777
Tell me.

610
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,619
Say it.

611
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,292
Mom.

612
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,526
Because...

613
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,957
he loved your brother too much.

614
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,468
I'm sorry.

615
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,500
And that's the truth
and that's not your fault.

616
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,169
It wasn't like
I could pretend you were his.

617
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:50,350
He was reminded of that
every time he looked at you.

618
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,388
You never stood a chance.

619
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,191
Sorry that I couldn't...

620
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:07,495
That I didn't protect you.

621
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,363
The beatings and...

622
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,713
Gary was the only one
who ever cared for me.

623
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,644
Why'd he pull you in on that job?

624
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,580
You were never a part
of what they did.

625
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,913
When his driver fell out,
I volunteered.

626
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,282
Why?

627
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,887
He owed the wrong people
a lot of money.

628
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,428
And he needed me.

629
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:52,080
If it wasn't the old man,
then who set us up?

630
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,628
Driven by his passions and desires.

631
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:55,573
You will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive.

632
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,269
Hate is like a chain
around your neck

633
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,712
that leads you to places
you don"t wanna go.

634
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:05,376
It"ll lead you into darkness
and desolation.

635
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,953
You become a slave
to that hatred,

636
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,990
and it"ll only lead
to your own destruction.

637
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,185
You must break free.

638
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:29,500
Hey, cowboy.
You okay, man?

639
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,737
- Yeah.
- You laid eyes on him at least.

640
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,541
Hey, well done.
Thanks, man.

641
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:34,977
I gotta call you back.

642
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,209
- Still in one piece.
- Good job.

643
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,048
Good lead, cowboy.
You almost got him.

644
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,519
We got close.
Yeah.

645
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,068
It was a good hunch.

646
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,171
Well, even Quasimodo
has his day.

647
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:02,277
And don't ever hang up on me again.
Roger that.

648
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,512
I hate to spoil your moment.
Got something I wanna show you.

649
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:12,415
I think we may have caught a break.
You said "we" again.

650
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,379
I did.

651
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,551
Our latest victim was a CI too.

652
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,787
So all three are informants.

653
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,092
Mm-hm. All got records,
armed robbery, rape, assault.

654
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,167
But none did any serious time.

655
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,600
They all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over.

656
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,468
What are the odds of that?
Slim and none.

657
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,234
I'm waiting on
the informant logs now.

658
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,404
Who are these?
Former accomplices of the victims.

659
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,448
Let's split them up, check them out.
I'll take these.

660
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:47,555
And I know there"s not
a man, woman or child in this church today

661
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,715
that has not sinned.

662
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:55,920
But God did not bring you down
on this Earth to be perfect. No.

663
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,759
God wants you down here
to be saved.

664
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:05,968
And when you"re down with God,
God is eternally down with you.

665
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:27,457
When Jesus knew his
time was near, when he knew he was gonna die,

666
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,156
when he knew they would not take
that cup from his lips,

667
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,029
his thoughts were not
upon his own.

668
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,932
His thoughts were for those
that he loved.

669
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,800
- Amen.
- That"s right.

670
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,137
His thoughts were for those
that he loved, preparing them.

671
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,304
Why is that?
He used the example of his birth.

672
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,508
That's right. Here it is.
Jesus told them how a woman

673
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:53,314
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth.

674
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:58,016
But then as soon as she has delivered,
there is no more anguish.

675
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,157
After all the screaming,
after all the pushing,

676
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,168
after all the blood and the tears,

677
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,169
there's only joy that a new child
has been born.

678
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,864
Hallelujah!

679
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,977
- And I'll tell you my...
- Amen! Amen!

680
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,346
Amen.

681
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:29,983
Amen. Amen. Amen.

682
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,531
Hallelujah!
Amen!

683
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,100
Amen!
Sing me a song!

684
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,759
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

685
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,735
You've been the subject of many of
my sermons these past few days.

686
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:17,869
I heard.

687
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:23,843
You heard.
But did you listen?

688
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,448
Everything okay,
baby?

689
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,819
Everything's just fine,
honey.

690
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,718
I was just catching up with

691
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,051
an old acquaintance.

692
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,459
You go on home now.

693
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,077
Let's take a walk.

694
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,131
Was that your son?
Adopted.

695
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,203
One of five.

696
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,768
Wayward boys.

697
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,936
Not unlike me or you
at that age.

698
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,181
You turned your life around.

699
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,152
Doesn't change
what you did.

700
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,186
I wouldn't want it to.

701
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,324
I know it sounds cold,

702
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,553
but every good I've done
hinged on the evil I did.

703
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,994
Who set us up?
I don't know.

704
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,533
I never did find out how they
knew about your safe house.

705
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:58,536
When I got the call,
"Easy money," they said.

706
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:03,940
All I had to do was guard
the door, be the lookout.

707
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,141
I was in a dark place
in my life.

708
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:12,013
Numb to the chaos and...
Right here.

709
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,482
But when they cut
that boy's throat...

710
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,093
Oh, Jesus, man. No.

711
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:30,062
That boy they killed was my brother.

712
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,372
I can't bring him back.

713
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,180
And in my heart I'm sorry.

714
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:46,187
I still took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.

715
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,356
Ended up in prison.

716
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:54,387
But it was there
that I found my calling.

717
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,931
To save and help boys like me.

718
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,434
And like you.

719
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:04,867
It was there
that I gave my life to God.

720
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,401
God can't save you from me.

721
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:14,609
But maybe he could save you
from yourself.

722
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,215
I know there's good...
You don't know me.

723
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,752
I know the devil
got your heart twisted

724
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,151
with vengeance and hate.

725
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:27,589
The Lord is merciful.
He sees in your soul.

726
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,262
Fragile, ain't it?

727
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:43,907
That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.

728
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,543
Sermon's over.

729
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:56,183
Can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?

730
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,088
I can't.

731
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,936
That's all right.

732
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,205
That's all right.

733
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,344
Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.

734
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:58,347
Lord, see into this man's heart.
He's good inside.

735
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,579
Oh, Lord, save this man's soul.

736
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,655
I know you see his heart.

737
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,363
Release him from the bondage
of hatred and vengeance, Lord.

738
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,159
Go back to your family.

739
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,163
That's one hell of a peashooter
you got there.

740
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,005
How's the recoil?

741
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,136
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

742
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:38,403
Inyo County at the reservoir.
They're here. Both of them.

743
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,310
What? Did you call for backup?

744
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,144
There's no time for that.
Okay, don't do this.

745
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,411
I'm sorry
I keep stepping on your case.

746
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:49,580
I don"t care about that.
Want you to do me a favor.

747
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,918
If I don't make it out of this,

748
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,857
tell my son that
his daddy went out like a man.

749
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,863
I am on my way.
Please, just wait for me.

750
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,728
I'm just going with the flow.

751
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:02,496
Damn.

752
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,507
Aren't you gonna
reach for it?

753
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,344
Come on.

754
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:18,814
Sporting chance.

755
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,314
I've got nothing against you.

756
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:28,019
I've been trying to kill you for days
and you've got nothing against me?

757
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,556
I'm starting to think you don't
take me very seriously, friend.

758
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,261
What do you want from me?

759
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,930
How about a little respect? Hey?

760
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,599
A little professional courtesy
from a peer.

761
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,074
Some acknowledgment
of my skills.

762
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,580
You've got issues.

763
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,714
Screw you.

764
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,399
I win.

765
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,611
You think you're done?

766
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,755
You can't put it together, can you?

767
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,587
There must be one more.

768
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,100
The one who hired me.

769
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,003
He's still alive.

770
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,842
I'm gonna kill you all.

771
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:58,944
Drop the gun.

772
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,550
Don't move.

773
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:02,985
Slowly.

774
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,189
Put the gun down.

775
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,129
No.
Put the goddamn gun down.

776
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,491
No! This is my job!

777
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,793
I finish my job.

778
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,563
How you gonna finish this
when you're dead?

779
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,216
So you're the guy that hired me.

780
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:18,390
You shouldn't
have done that.

781
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,558
I had to finish what I started.

782
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,794
Why'd you hire me then?

783
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,932
I didn't think I was up to it.

784
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:31,476
After you missed him,
I figured I should get involved

785
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:34,410
before he came gunning for me.

786
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,887
He didn't even know about you.

787
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:43,516
I figured that out when he didn't
finish me off at the hospital.

788
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:49,319
His brother's girlfriend
was my informant down in L.A.

789
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,421
She told me about the job.

790
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,332
Hired some more of my informants
down there.

791
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,833
They helped me take down
their score.

792
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:03,808
So, what now?

793
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:05,740
Now?

794
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,948
I ride off into the sunset.

795
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,056
Hey.

796
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,295
I forgot to pay you.

797
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,494
You know,
I don't get you.

798
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:31,332
Why do you put yourself through all
this shit for one lousy dollar?

799
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:34,475
It's my price.
Call it a hobby.

800
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,471
You know what, keep it.

801
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:39,703
I didn't earn it.

802
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,441
Don't contact me again,
I'm done.

803
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,420
Yeah, me too.

804
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,346
Detective Cicero?

805
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:49,683
Yeah, I can't reach him.

806
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:51,654
Okay, hopefully he"ll turn up.

807
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:54,487
We've got units en route,
we'll see you shortly.

808
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,224
Wait a minute.

809
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,565
You didn't flip him this case,
did you?

810
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:06,704
I didn't flip him the case.

811
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,341
Is that what you thought?

812
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:09,908
He asked for it, right?

813
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,372
He begged for it.

814
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,479
And I felt sorry for him, so I caved.

815
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,118
Is there a reason why we're
talking about this right now?

816
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:21,750
No. No reason.
Okay, I'll see you shortly.

817
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,354
"Go with the flow," my ass.

818
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:33,765
Marina? Hey, it's me, honey.
Well, I got him, I closed the case.

819
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,493
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

820
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:39,731
As a matter of fact, I feel perfect.

821
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,102
- Better than I ever have.
- Yeah?

822
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,837
Yeah, and I'm gonna
get rid of the other stuff too.

823
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,413
Don't you worry, I promise.

824
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,516
I'll be home in a couple hours.

825
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:55,417
Listen, you're not gonna
believe this.

826
01:29:56,524 --> 01:30:00,255
I've been reading up on women,
and I think I got you figured out.

827
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,588
We're gonna be fine.

828
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,157
Yeah, honey, it's over.

829
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,596
I wanna start brand-new, honey.

830
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:38,226
How?

831
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:43,937
Metal plate.

832
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,342
I can't feel anything.

833
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,456
I created my own hell.

834
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:12,291
And I'm the demon
who crawled up out of it.

835
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,856
Hello?

836
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,057
Baby.

837
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:50,363
- Where are you?
- I'm coming home.

838
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:23,895
Today, I wanna talk to you
about forgiveness.
