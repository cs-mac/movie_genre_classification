1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:05,439
- Did I miss breakfast?
- Sorry, I just switched over to lunch.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,664
Could I have breakfast anyway?

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,980
No. If I start serving
breakfast at lunch time,

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,427
- it could lead to...
- Brunch?

5
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:16,092
- Fine. I will get you a breakfast menu.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:19,869
Miss brekky, huh?
Got to sleep in?

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,709
No, I just had to go pray.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,990
Oh! Pray-time. Right, yeah.
Pray-time instead of playtime.

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,510
Yup. Guilty as charged.

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,933
Five times a day.
Like clockwork.

11
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,422
Certainly keeps you types busy.

12
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,199
Well, it's an important
part of our faith, except...

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,854
Can't eat pork.
No booze.

14
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,507
You sure got a lot of rules.

15
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:38,156
Well, they're not rules as much as...

16
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:40,419
Plus you gotta wear the babushka
thing on your noggin there.

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,034
- It's another one...
- Hijab.

18
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,717
Call it whatever you want
you still gotta wear it. Right?

19
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,368
I don't know how you keep
your hijabs from your jihads.

20
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,504
Hey, did I miss anything?

21
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,057
Yes. You missed me missing breakfast.

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,590
Rayyan and I were just talking about
all the rules you people gotta go through.

23
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,811
Yeah, it's terrible.
Like we have to pray five times a day,

24
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:59,996
and I have to wear a
babushka, apparently.

25
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,486
Yeah, not to mention we gotta
brush our teeth three times a day.

26
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,057
And we have to drink
eight glasses of water.

27
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:08,472
- That's true.
- Those are Muslim rules too?

28
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,720
Yeah, that's right, Fred.
We gotta brush our teeth...

29
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,496
- facing Mecca.
- Really?

30
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,352
And we have to eat
5 to 9 pieces of fruit a day.

31
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:20,143
- Facing Damascus.
- You learn something new every day. Huh?

32
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:22,273
Anyhoo, have a good one, huh?

33
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,709
Damascus?

34
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:29,029
You don't think he believed us, do you?

35
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,282
Nnnnoooo!?

36
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,776
Everyone has to to eat
5 to 9 pieces of fruit a day.

37
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,010
That's what it says in the book.

00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,297
{\pos(200,200)}- Salaam alaikum.
- Walaikum assalaam. Brother.

41
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,877
- What's up?
- Just working. Busy.

42
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:24,611
- You know, time is money.
- If that were true, I'd be rich.

43
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,644
But I'm not.

45

Well, don't let me keep you.

46
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,159
{\pos(200,190)}Yo, it's okay.
I'm just headed to the post office to

47
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,745
{\pos(200,190)}mail some things before
the postage goes up.

48
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,349
{\pos(200,200)}- Two cents, per item.
- That's um...

49
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,969
- really interesting?
- Every little bit counts.

50
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,296
{\pos(200,200)}The imam business is not a lucrative one.

51
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,869
It's like no business I know.

52
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,193
- Isn't that show business?
- I don't know show business.

53
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,876
Just a shot in the dark,
but, um,

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,462
- are you short on cash?
- Oh, perpetually.

55
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:55,724
- I don't have much on me, but I...
- No, Yasir,

56
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,672
you're a good friend to say that,
but I don't want a loan,

57
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,379
- I want to vent.
- Ah.

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,250
Yeah...
Vent.

59
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:04,064
Venting.

60
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:07,128
- Because I'd rather give you a loan.
- Not necessary.

61
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,895
You know what bugs me about
being short on cash is that it...

62
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:13,420
distracts me from spiritual matters.

63
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,995
I was walking by the town hall
yesterday and uh...

64
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,610
I noticed a really interesting thing
about Mercy, I actually never notice...

65
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:24,598
- So, stockin' up on fruit, huh?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,873
Takin' the old Muslim fruit train,
to vitamin station.

67
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,848
Fred, you know the thing we said
before about Muslims and fruit...

68
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,140
it's not a real rule, right?
We were just joking.

69
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,703
- Sure, sure. I know you're just joking.
- Good.

70
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,410
Just like I know you guys
don't have secret rules

71
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,190
you don't want the rest
of us to find out about, uh?

72
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,933
And when those real rules do slip out,

73
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,715
and now you guys wouldn't
say you were just joking

74
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:46,608
- to try to make me look stupid.
- Nobody's trying to make you look stupid.

75
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,261
- It's just sort of happening.
- Sure, sure, sure.

76
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,636
Anyhoo, you better pick up
some gooseberries

77
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,528
before some other Muslims
swamp in and grab 'em all.

78
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,572
- Ohhh... no gooseberries.
- What?

79
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,104
Now what's the matter?
What? They forbidden?

80
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,957
Yes. Gooseberries are forbidden.

81
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,368
If it were raining,
we could have them, but,

82
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,530
we can't have them now
because it's not raining.

83
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,440
Until we're married.

84
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:09,111
Yes! At which point we could have them...

85
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,988
- unless it were raining.
- And then we eat raisins.

86
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,991
- Yes!
- Huh. Interesting.

87
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:18,201
I knew you guys had some wacky rituals,
but these, I had no idea.

88
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:22,189
- Fred! It's a joke.
- Rrrrright.

89
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,607
You sound like you don't believe us.

90
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,568
Well, maybe I just sound that way
because I'm joking.

91
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:32,583
[ They laugh uncertainly ]

92
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:36,499
- Are you?
- More gooseberries for me.

93
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,391
Suckers!

94
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:41,930
That guy took my gooseberries.

95
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,605
- Good riddance.
- What?

96
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,257
I don't like gooseberries.

97
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,511
<i>Yasir:</i> I wasted the whole day today.

98
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:49,934
I'm sorry to hear that, darling.

99
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,928
Amaar was in my office all day
complaining about money.

100
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,282
- What money? He doesn't make any.
- That was the complaint.

101
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,766
Complain, complain, complain.
I couldn't get a thing done.

102
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,373
I can't imagine what that must be like.

103
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:00,667
And here's the worst thing...

104
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,656
He didn't want any advice.

105
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:05,133
No. He just wanted to complain.

106
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,440
- Well, you know what you need to do...
- I couldn't even get a word in edgewise.

107
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,672
It was terrible.

108
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:10,809
Darling, do you want advice,
or are you just complaining?

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,163
I'd hope to just complain.

110
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:14,540
If he needs money,
why don't you give him a job?

111
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,837
- Yeah, good one, mom.
- Now, that's funny.

112
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,773
You always know what to say
to lighten the mood.

113
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:24,124
I was being serious.
He could do construction.

114
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,498
- Classic.
- You know why that's funny?

115
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,425
Because she plays it small.

116
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,610
You are joking, right, mom?

117
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,002
Well, he's short on cash,

118
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,231
and you're short-staffed
on that deck you're building. So?

119
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:41,623
I don't know if Amaar has what
we contractors call "it".

120
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,870
He's building a deck. He's not becoming
an astronaut. Anyone can do it.

121
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,755
- Hey, that's what I do for a living.
- And you do it very well.

122
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,346
I just don't think it's a good idea.

123
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:55,041
- He'd probably work for cheap.
- Then again, I might give him a chance.

124
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,746
He could have what it
takes to be a carpenter.

125
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,783
Well, his sermons are certainly wooden.

126
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,911
[ Laughs ]

127
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,705
She should played it big that time.
Didn't work.

128
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,305
Yeah!

129
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:09,610
Just come on, please.

130
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,964
No, I have been too lenient,
too many times.

131
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:15,938
- It is eleven o'clock!
- My stomach doesn't care what time it is.

132
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,305
- It just want some pancakes.
- There are three meals in a day,

133
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:20,817
- and brunch is not one of them.
- You're being unreasonable.

134
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:22,628
I do not believe in brunch.

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,123
- Whoa.
- Hi.

136
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,819
No brunch for you folks either, huh?
The list goes on.

137
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,427
- We have to do something about Fred.
- Why? What happened?

138
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,382
- I told him I don't eat gooseberries.
- You don't.

139
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:43,494
You see, we might have given Fred the wrong
impression about some of the rules of Islam.

140
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,003
He might think we eat 5 to 9 fruits a day.

141
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,574
Well, that's not such a bad rule.

142
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,656
- And we brush our teeth...
- I hope you brush your teeth.

143
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,102
- Facing Mecca.
- Okay, that one's a little bit weird.

144
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:56,471
You can't engage Fred
when he's being paranoid.

145
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:58,719
It's better just to let
this sort itself out.

146
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,608
Better how?

147
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,909
This way he just goes on the radio and
says bad things about Muslims all the time.

148
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,262
- Okay, not better. Just easier.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,832
Look, I know I'm not from here...

150
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,682
but maybe that gives me a perspective
on things that you two lack.

151

00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,069
We may have misspoke.

302
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,471
- Ahem.
- Okay.

303
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,608
There may have been
a misunderstanding.

304
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:52,557
- Okay. We were joking.
- You see? It has all been a mistake.

305
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:54,850
And I promise you she
is very, very sorry.

306
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:59,566
Huh! No, no, no!
I didn't get out of bed yesterday.

307
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:02,850
- You didn't?
- Or off the boat, however that go.

308
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:07,445
Nice try toots, but you gotta get up
pretty early to be up earlier than me.

309
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,946
Look. If you don't believe me,
just go online. Type in "Muslim".

310
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:15,687
You won't find anything about
socks or teeth or gloves.

311
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:16,964
If I type in the word "Muslim",

312
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,254
what I'll find is my name on
a government watch list.

313
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,516
Okay, this is getting out of hand.

314
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:29,297
A woman at the store today
called me a "glove hater".

315
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:32,279
Fred's really got a hold of
something this time.

316
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,007
After all the things he's said,

317
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,325
you'd think these little things
wouldn't bother people so much.

318
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,663
Oh, people take the little things seriously.
It's the little things that count.

319
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,723
That's why they say:
"Sweat the small stuff".

320
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,333
No, they say:
"Don't sweat the small stuff".

321
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,792
Left out one little word, darling,
don't sweat it.

322
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,437
This is all my fault.

323
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:51,303
If I hadn't wound Fred up,
he wouldn't be saying these things.

324
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,916
I misrepresented my faith.

325
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:56,150
I have to set it right.
But how do I do that?

326
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,666
- Talk to him.
- I tried that. It didn't work.

327
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,288
It just made things worse.
I even took Baber with me.

328
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,101
- Well that's your trouble.
- What?

329
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:05,215
Well, Baber is a guy
who no one listens to,

330
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,794
and Fred is a guy that
doesn't listen to anyone.

331
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,602
I thought those two things would
cancel each other out.

332
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:11,035
No. It will all blow over, darling.

333
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,604
It's true.
People are smart.

334
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,658
I mean no matter how many lies Fred tells,
eventually the truth will win out.

335
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:19,501
Maybe you're right.
Thanks, guys.

336
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:22,169
Truth and honesty,
always good!

337
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,390
Can you help me think of a way out
to trick Amaar into quitting?

338
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:29,516
- Yasir, sorry I'm late.
- Are you late?

339
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:32,374
- Well, it's almost noon.
- Oh! So it is!

340
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,681
We've gotten so much done,
with so little injury.

341
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:37,540
I would have been here sooner,
but I thought you were gonna me up.

342
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,092
Ah! I must have forgot.
It's completely my fault.

343
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,360
That's strange, because...

344
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:45,236
I got a message from you
telling me to keep waiting.

345
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,256
Well, that must be an old message.

346
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,035
My cell phone has been acting strangely.

347
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,159
Accidents can happen.

348
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:53,100
- There's been another accident?!
- No, no. It's all fine.

349
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:55,550
Anyway, where do you want me?
Cos'...

350
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,785
- I don't want to waste any more time.
- Of course. Lunch!

351
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,625
Let's go to Fatima's.
I'll drive.

352
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,728
- As long as you promise to bring me back.
- Oh! Ah, ah, ah!

353
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,493
- Hamoudi!
- Excuse me.

354
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:05,502
Hello, my friends.

355
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:06,920
- Careful.
- Yeah.

356
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,676
Well, We've been doing
some soul searching.

357
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:12,565
Ah! Excellent!
It's always in the last place you look.

358
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,886
You know, we appreciate all
the work you've done, uh...

359
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,332
- up to this point.
- Excellent.

360
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,848
If there's no "but" in that sentence,
I'll get back to work.

361
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,463
But... we're moving in
another direction with the deck.

362
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:27,849
Oh, you're not changing the plans again.

363
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,638
- No, we're keeping the plans.
- Good!

364
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,575
- We're changing the contractor.
- Oh.

365
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,212
Raisins for crying,
them Muslims.

366
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,611
And that's when it rains.

367
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,160
<i>Fred:</i> You should hear what
they do on a clear day...

368
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,645
<i>Fred:</i> Everyday, if you can say that...

369
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,650
Sarah. I was just listening to Fred's show.

370
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,257
I know. He's crazy.

371
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:49,258
He really is. Certifiable.
A wacko.

372
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:54,147
- What's this?
- Our new ad campaign.

373
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,904
We have a new ad campaign?

374
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:58,676
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- I want to surprise you.

375
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,152
You know, I haven't always
supported your Muslim ways.

376
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:02,818
But things have gotten out of hand.

377
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,167
And I will not let people bad mouth you.

378
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,194
Wow. Thank you.
I think.

379
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,981
So you can't wear gloves.

380
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,580
And you can only eat
raisins on a rainy day,

381
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:14,044
and during a full moon you
believe a half man - half wolf

382
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,463
- is going to steal your children.
- Okay, that's new.

383
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,514
No matter what you believe,
we have all got to get along.

384
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,928
And I think the best way to stem
these "anti-Muslim" thoughts

385
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,729
is to head them off at the pass.

386
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,892
- So...
- Oh boy!

387
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:32,760
- "Brushing Apart, Smiling Together".
- What do you think?

388
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,663
I think this is out of control.

389
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,800
- We have a contract.
- A contract, yes.

390
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,791
- A deck, not so much.
- Excuse me.

391
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:48,462
If I may.
Mr and Mrs Wispinski. Hi.

392
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:52,121
Of course, this deck is important to you.
It's a part of your home.

393
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,226
- It's for your family.
- Please don't tell us how to use our deck.

394
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:58,056
My point is, you've made a lot of
last-minute changes. And...

395
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,898
Yasir's had to roll with that.

396
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:03,186
Well, I'm not going to apologize for
wanting the deck that I want.

397
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,173
- Good for you, honey.
- Oh shut up, George.

398
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:07,976
Yasir has shown flexibility
on his side of the bargain.

399
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:09,620
Maybe you could do the same?

400
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:11,660
No!

401
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,971
Well, if you terminate now,
Mr. Hamoudi could argue

402
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:17,778
that you violated the agreement
when you changed the construction plans.

403
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,937
You forfeit any rights to
further work on the deck,

404
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:22,002
but you still would have to
pay for it in full.

405
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,573
That's black letter law.

406
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:26,379
You know, maybe this guy's a...

407
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,820
you better keep talking.

408
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,552
I'm sure we can all agree on a
reasonable cooling off period

409
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:33,270
and then Yasir can redouble his efforts
to complete the construction.

410
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,167
- Yasir?
- Yeah. Certainly.

411
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,895
I can finish this deck in two days.

412
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,586
- Yasir.
- Three days.

413
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,282
If not, we revisit the
question of who's at fault.

414
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,206
All right. That seems...

415
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,733
reasonable.

416
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,780
You're lucky you've got
this guy on your crew.

417
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,222
Talks like a lawyer.

418
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:56,387
- I am a lawyer.
- Ha, ha, ha. Good one!

419
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,611
- He plays it small.
- Yeah. Okay, that's enough, George, c'mon.

Darling, I wanted to hear

- What are we going to do?
- Listen, people are smart.

431
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:36,986
- They will see through this.
- Yeah. Tried that.

432

- Have you tried talking to him?
- Several times. That doesn't work.

It only makes things worse.

434
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:44,098
- I'll go and see him.
- Are you sure?

435
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,497
But I'm on a roll.
I just talked Yasir's crazy clients down.

436
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,363
He was amazing.
He got me four extra days to finish.

- Three.

You know what?

440
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,256
We just have to connect
with Fred on his level.

441
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,848
<i>Fred:</i> "Islam for Dummies"?
I love these books.
