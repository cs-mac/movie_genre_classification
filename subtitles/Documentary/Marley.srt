00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,901
- Jah Rastafari!

00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,163

3
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,915

4
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:42,582
(vocalizing)

5
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:47,587
Movement of Jah people yeah

6
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:56,596
Jah come to break the oppression

7
00:01:56,764 --> 00:02:00,349
Rule equality
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

8
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:02,518
Wipe away transgression

9
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,063
Set your captives free

10
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:09,650
Jah

11
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,321

12
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:16,280
Jah

13
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,743
Rastafari

14
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:27,916
(fades)

15
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:41,179
(woman): He used to love singing.

16
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,806
I used to teach him little jingles,

17
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:46,017
and he used to love them.

18
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,686
And the chief one that he used
to know was...

19
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:53,441
I had a little donkey that's grey

20
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:57,486
I feed him in a barn every day

21
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:03,533
And when he hears me whistle
he knows I have a thistle

22
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,954
He'd rather eat a thistle than hay

23
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,499
Hee-haw hee-haw

24
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:14,919
Hee-haw hee-haw

25
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,963
And that is all my donkey can say

26
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,426
And then you would see him,
you know, keeping time.

27
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:27,347
And you would see
that he was enjoying it.

28
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:29,767
(man): How did it all start?

29
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:33,311
Had music always been a part of your life
from when you were a little boy?

30
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:43,153
(man chuckles):
What part of Jamaica?

31
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,865
- Yeah?

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,251
(man): Well, you see,
Bob Marley is my cousin, you know?

33
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:38,372
- Bob liked to ride the donkey
and, you know,

34
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,876
go to the field with his grandfather
and things like that.

35
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:45,128
Because he's a country boy, you know.

36
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,298
(man): Nine Mile was a place that...

37
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,134
there wasn't a lot of civilized activity.

38
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,473
Electricity was not available
in those areas,

39
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:02,060
so you see a lot of "peeny wallies"...
you know, those little fireflies.

40
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:05,063
And that's the only light at night...

41
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,982
other than the moon
and the stars, you know.

42
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:10,026
So, as a youth
coming out of Kingston...

43
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:13,780
that was accustomed
to jukebox and sound system,

44
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,407
it was really something
to get accustomed to.

45
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,872
(man): And do you remember
when you first met Robert?

46
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,083
- Yes. First time I saw him,
I saw this little youth...

47
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,710
cutting up this big chunk of wood

48
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,714
and putting it on his head bit by bit
and taking it away...

49
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:34,048
I say, that's...
You know, and then...

50
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:37,093
He was the only little,
what you call it,

51
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:39,846
red "pickney" in the place,

52
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,015
because everybody else
was black people.

53
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,518
(man): Who was Bob's dad?

54
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:49,022
(Sledgo speaking)

55
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,366
(Cedella): He liked
when you call him "Captain."

56
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:05,661
Yes, but his...
his name is Norval.

57
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,332
I met him right there in Nine Mile,

58
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,459
and then as a white man in the district,

59
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,629
you know, always ride
his horse and things like that.

60
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:17,172
He and my father
becomes good friends.

61
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,053
Then at that time he see this little girl
and I guess he liked her, and, um,

62
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,848
we finally get together
and that's how it...

63
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,267
that's how it happened.

64
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:32,395
(man): How old was your sister
when she met the Captain?

65
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:35,230
- She was, what, 16.

66
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:40,444
Captain was...
He was about in his 60s.

67
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:43,113
- So he was an old man?
- Yes.

68
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,966
- My name is Peter Marley.
Bob Marley is my second cousin.

69
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,260
(man): What did you know about
Bob Marley's father?

70
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,514
(Peter): He rode a horse most of the time.

71
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:12,015
He was in the British army.

72
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,850
I think he was stationed somewhere
in India in World War II...

73
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,229
when he got shell shock.

74
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,609
I understand he drank
and that he lived a...

75
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,569
What should I say?

76
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,406
A full life.

77
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:59,309
(man): Did he get teased
for being mixed?

78
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:02,812
Yeah, sure.
Worse than teased.

79
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,357
Teased is not the word
You call it rejected.

80
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:10,194
He did everything that
his bigger uncles should be doing...

81
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,573
because it was
their duty to move horses...

82
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,242
and to make sure
that the pigs were fed,

83
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,327
and they left
all of that work for Robert.

84
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:24,041
He had to earn his every meal.

85
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,294
(Bob speaking)

86
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:50,190
(Bunny):
We went to the same school.

87
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,151
And he had me teaching me the stuff...

88
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,070
of what takes place in the country...
how to ride a donkey, how to ride a horse.

89
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,906
How to do all of this kind of stuff.

90
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,283
And I taught him about music,
'cause...

91
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,328
that was what I was exposed
to prior coming to Saint Ann.

92
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:07,831
(mento)

93
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,796
(Bunny): I was accustomed to
building bamboo guitars...

94
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:15,338
and sardine tin guitars.

95
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:18,008
Cutting the wire...
the electric wire...

96
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:22,178
opening it up, taking out those little
fine wires and making our strings.

97
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,891
(Sledgo speaking)

98
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:12,016
(woman):
In a little district on a little island

99
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,978
Where men and pretty gal run wild

100
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,813
Well there's one old crazy
who went much wider

101
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,483
So they call her rider
Rough rider

102
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,404
- Outta that, Robert Marley saw...

103
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,239
a way out.

104
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,118
His guitar.

105
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:35,913
(Bob Marley):
In high seas or in low seas

106
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:40,877
I'm gonna be your friend

107
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:46,132
I'm gonna be your friend

108
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:56,391
I heard her praying praying praying

109
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,730
I said I heard my mother

110
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:07,568
She was praying in the night

111
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:14,533
And the words that she said
The words that she said

112
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:18,912
They still lingers in my head
Lingers in my head

113
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,583
She said a child is born in this world

114
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:26,878
He needs protection

115
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,255
Whoa mmm

116
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,010
God guide and protect us

117
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:38,472
("Trenchtown Rock")

118
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,353
(Bob Marley):
One good thing about music

119
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,939
When it hits
You feel no pain

120
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,983
I say one good thing about music

121
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,070
When it hits
You feel no pain

122
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,697
Hit me with music

123
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,033
Hit me with music now

124
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,118
This is
Trenchtown rock

125
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,745
Don't what's that

126
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:07,624
(man): We grew up in Trench Town.
We were exposed to everything.

127
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,334
'Cause you have the bad guys there

128
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,544
who eventually turn out
to be the con men.

129
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:15,924
You have the musicians.
And you have the sportsmen.

130
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,595
Everybody lived just like a block away
from each other.

131
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:21,762
It's like a melting pot.

132
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,475
- Well, living in Trench Town,
you know, um,

133
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,728
as a young man, surviving was easy.

134
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,940
The only thing that you have to really
look out for was the police, you know,

135
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,900
'cause the police can just get ya,
frame ya.

136
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,527
You go to prison and...

137
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,738
"Look, I come from Trench Town."
Trench Town's that...

138
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:42,448
Find them say, "Where you from?"

139
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,867
You say, "Trench Town."
You're gone.

140
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,327
You know what I mean?

141
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:49,122
- No, it was tough.
All of Kingston is like that, you know?

142
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,625
Everybody.
A lot of people don't know, but Bob, me,

143
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:55,294
all of we, went to bed hungry a lot.

144
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,670
I mean real hungry.

145
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,672
I don't mean like, "Oh, he had some,
a little piece of this."

146
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,340
Nothing.
One of the famous lines was,

147
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,635
"Drink some water and go to bed."
You know?

148
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:07,139
In those days you never have...
You might have one pair of shoes.

149
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,308
One suit of clothes.
So you walk bare feet all the time.

150
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,727
Bob too, you know?
A lot of people don't know that.

151
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,605
That kind of sufferation and struggle...

152
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:20,358
can make you either go bad or good.

153
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,068
And I guess
that's what he did, you know?

154
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,321
He figured the music would get him out,

155
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:26,906
so he stuck to it and focused,
you know?

156
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:35,832
(McDonald): You know, as an individual
they're forced to be creative.

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,584
Because that's where
your reggae music born, Trench Town.

158
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,628
("Natty Dread")

159
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,640
Dread natty dread now

Natty dread

161
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:59,520
Dreadlock Congo bongo I

162
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,564
Natty dread

163
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:03,857
Natty dreadlock

164
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,609
(McDonald): In Trench Town
we have First Street.

165
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,235
All the way up to 13th Street.

166
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:08,695
First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,

167
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,447
and so on and so forth.

168
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,449
Him sing about it in "Natty Dread."

169
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,827
Then I walk up the First Street

170
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,037
Natty dread

171
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:22,166
And then I walk up
the Second Street to see

172
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,584
Natty dread

173
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,337
(Bob speaking)

174
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,766
- He was different, mon.
He was different.

175
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,727
He just loved music.

176
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,439
Music and cricket and football.

177
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,899
Natty Congo I

178
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,401
Natty dread

179
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:51,652
Oh

180
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,573
- One day he just come home
and give me the books and say,

181
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,325
"I'm not going back to school."

182
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:03,079
And, um, him say have a friend
that he can give these books to.

183
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,791
And he did that,
and then he turned to his music.

184
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,459
(Bob Marley):
I'm a rebel

185
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:13,214
Soul rebel

186
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,592
I'm a capturer

187
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,803
That's right

188
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,639
Soul adventurer

189
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:23,849
Yeah mon

190
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,226
I'm a rebel

191
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,271
Soul rebel

192
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,526
(Bunny): Robert keep pounding,
keep pounding, keep pounding.

193
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:37,904
Telling me that
this is what it should be and, uh...

194
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,905
And I'm saying, "No,
I'm gonna get ready to go to college.

195
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,283
I can't be no music."
He say, "No, it's music."

196
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,244
(man): When did you begin
to get involved in music?

197
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,829
- Well, I was always interested
in music,

198
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,372
but at that time I was learning
a trade, you know,

199
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,418
and meet up
some guys who can sing.

200
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,086
One named Desmond Dekker.

201
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:01,009
- Desmond Dekker and Bob
used to work as welders...

202
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,301
at the same place.

203
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:06,556
Desmond Dekker came down,
and I auditioned him.

204
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:09,266
And we recorded his song.

205
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:14,354
(Bunny): And after he did that song,
Robert wanted now to record.

206
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:16,064
So Desmond take him Beverley's.

207
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,441
And he went away
and recorded a song...

208
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:23,237
to prove to me that if he
could record a song, I could.

209
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:28,201
(Bob Marley): Don't you look at me
so smug now

210
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:31,746
And say I'm going bad

211
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:36,666
Who are you to judge me

212
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:40,045
And the life that I live

213
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:43,381
- I noticed his use of words
in the songs.

214
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:47,259
"Judge Not"...
it was a revolutionary song...

215
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:50,846
defending his rights as an individual.

216
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:55,809
It occurred to me,
"Wow, this guy's really a good poet."

217
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,269
Judge not

218
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,648
Before you judge yourself

219
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,566
- After the recording,

220
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,817
Leslie Kong wanted
to change Bob's name,

221
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:08,821
because Robert Marley
didn't sound so catchy and easy.

222
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:12,450
So he wanted to call Bob "Adam."

223
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:14,869
Adam Marley.
(chuckles)

224
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:16,913
Bob wouldn't have it.

225
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,003
(Bunny): He realizes that a group
would be maybe the appropriate thing,

226
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:28,423
other than being individual,
solo artists.

227
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:31,927
We used to listen to groups
like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers,

228
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,680
The Drifters, The Platters.

229
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,474
So there was a recruitment
process taking place.

230
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:42,895
Myself and Robert started
to put the group together.

231
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,648
And then here comes this tall, dark,

232
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,318
as they would say,
handsome dude named Peter,

233
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,736
and he has
this guitar knowledge.

234
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,115
And from Robert, you hear Robert say,
"Play guitar? You serious?"

235
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,992
So he goes give him
the guitar right away.

236
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,621
So it's four-string steel,
but Peter tune the four-string,

237
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,164
and he's just like that.

238
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,252
(McDonald): On First Street
is a music street.

239
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,297
We had three or four places
on First Street that we rehearse,

240
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,132
and they were rehearsing
like every day.

241
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,010
At the time,
it was Bob, Peter, Bunny.

242
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:21,390
(Bunny): We used to call ourselves
"Juveniles." "Brothers in the Ghetto."

243
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,725
Where we used to go to rehearse,
they'd say,

244
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:27,103
"You come from a wailing environment
where people always bawling.

245
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,397
And, well,
you should be named the Wailers."

246
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:33,526
This train it is bound to glory

247
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,612
This train

248
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:43,410
This train is bound to glory

249
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:46,455
This train

250
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:54,295
This train is bound to glory

251
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:56,464
This train don't carry

252
00:18:56,632 --> 00:19:02,010
- As far as the Wailers' harmony,
and the building of the Wailers musically,

253
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:05,931
Joe Higgs is the responsible person.

254
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,516
Having his own career,

255
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:11,811
he decided to take the group up
as a project.

256
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:46,260
His policy was that great stars
sometimes get messed up...

257
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:49,847
when they get afraid, you know,
when they get nervous on stage.

258
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,765
So he said that...

259
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,894
if we went to the cemetery
at, say, 2:00 in the morning...

260
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,271
and sang for those people,

261
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:01,650
then we can't be afraid
when we hit the stage.

262
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:05,779
And we went with Joe,
sat on the graves, played.

263
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:10,157
Several times we do it until he thought
we were brave enough now.

264
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,327
(chuckling)

265
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:20,417
Gather together
Be brothers and sisters

266
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:23,628
We're independent
We're independent

267
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:26,423
(man): Just about the time
of the independence,

268
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,259
the Jamaican musicians
wanted to have a music...

269
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,553
that they can call Jamaican music.

270
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,972
- Well, Jamaica came up
with a unique rhythm.

271
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,932
I didn't think it was deliberately done.

272
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,144
I think it was an attempt to play
something, and it came out that way.

273
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:43,147
It became known as reggae,
but it started off as ska,

274
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,774
which was putting all the accent...

275
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,861
on a different beat than what is normally
where the accent is.

276
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,780
It would be on the off beat
instead of the on beat.

277
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:55,283
(ska)

278
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:59,454
(Cliff): Ska developed out of American
music that we were exposed to...

279
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,540
on top of our Jamaican
indigenous music,

280
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,377
such as mento, calypso, Kumina.

281
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,379
Simmer down

282
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,339
You lickin' too hot

283
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,760
So simmer down
Soon you'll get dropped

284
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,512
- We were at a bar one evening.

285
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,266
And one of the guys, them says to us,
"Listen to this group."

286
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,060
And they punched the jukebox.

287
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:27,980
And the song was called "Simmer Down."

288
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:30,982
And no more other tune
play on that box...

289
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,486
the whole time we were there
but "Simmer Down," I tell you.

290
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:38,574
Oh simmer down
Oh control your temper

291
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:41,910
Simmer down
For the battle will be hotter

292
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:45,288
- "Simmer Down" went straight
into the number-one position,

293
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:48,416
and the Wailers were launched.

294
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:51,711
...that I'm leaving you today
Simmer down

295
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,341
- What was it like working at Studio 1,
where you started, in those days?

296
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:00,469
(Bob): Yeah, it was good,
you know, 'cause, you know,

297
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:01,887
first experience within music.

298
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,429
Working with some good musician

299
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:06,724
and trying to get the harmonies
and everything. It was great.

300
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,685
(man): I heard you actually...
you personally lived in the studio.

301
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,063
(Bob): Sometime.

302
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,523
(man): You had Coxsone made you
a room out the back.

303
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,899
(Bob chuckling): Yes.

304
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,861
(McDonald): Well, Coxsone was,
um, a smart guy,

305
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:21,363
in that he has an ear
for music, good music.

306
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,324
- He might not have been
an instrument player.

307
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,742
He might not even know
if the guitar is tuned,

308
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,079
but he knows when the sound is right.

309
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,456
- He has his own program on the radio.

310
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:33,083
Has his own record shop.

311
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,961
Has his own sound system.
Has his own studio.

312
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,503
So he's obviously a leader.

313
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:41,090
- Coxsone was like a father to us,
you know, to be honest with you.

314
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,550
Coxsone was like a father to us.

315
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,718
He cared for us.

316
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:52,934
Coxsone gave Robbie a little room
round the back of the premises.

317
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:54,978
I didn't have anywhere
to live neither.

318
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,856
So Robbie and me lived there.
Both of us lived there.

319
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,566
So we became intimate good friends.

320
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,363
He gave Robbie a record player
and a lot of foreign records.

321
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,491
Robbie was a fanatic
in listening to these people...

322
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,911
because he was a serious,
focused man.

323
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:13,954
Even as a youth.

324
00:23:14,122 --> 00:23:20,042
- Jamaican music developed from
what we call "do overs,"

325
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,880
a version of somebody's song
in America.

326
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,886
Each night
I ask the stars up above

327
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:35,975
Why must I be a teenager in love

328
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,020
Put me in your milling machine

329
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:43,773
I never thought you could act so mean

330
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,861
Now I'm wondering what to do

331
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,865
To see if you could love me too

332
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:55,076
(McDonald): Bob had a good sound
'cause he's singing lead.

333
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:56,703
And the harmony was tight.

334
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:00,372
- The harmony Bunny carried,
and Peter was fantastic.

335
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:08,047
Why must I be a teenager in love

336
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:13,801
(Rita): Peter and Bunny was
the most vocal one to say hi,

337
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:18,097
but Bob was very reserved
and just look.

338
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:20,308
As he would say, just "cotch and look."

339
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,812
- As much as there was this obvious
love and admiration...

340
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,940
for each other and of each other,

341
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:30,901
there was always
a deep underlying tension...

342
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,321
that none would be
a "yes man" to the other.

343
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:39,826
I think the music was the glue
that held them together.

344
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:42,578
Feel them spirit

345
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,165
Feel them spirit

346
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:50,377
Feel them spirit

347
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,922
Lord, I thank you

348
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:57,718
Lord, I thank you

349
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,471
I'm gonna put it on

350
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:04,682
I'm gonna put it on

351
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,734
- By then he was admiring me.

352
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:21,573
I got a letter from Bunny,
bringing a letter.

353
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,326
It was him sending his letter
through his friend. Not by himself.

354
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:29,122
And to say yes, he likes me
and want to talk to me.

355
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,332
I say, "Come over and talk."

356
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,293
And he would stay
on the other side of the road and...

357
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:38,046
He was very shy. He was very shy.
He was a shy guy.

358
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:43,802
I'll play your favorite song darling

359
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,304
He had a seriousness,
and he was one

360
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:49,016
that you could say
was reaching out for love.

361
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,942
- I didn't think,
I liked brown-skin men.

362
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,864
I always dream of a guy...
tall, black, handsome.

363
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:08,367
Every young girl's dream in Jamaica
is to have a tall, black boyfriend.

364
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,287
They would call Bob an outcast...

365
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:14,998
because he really don't belong to no...
you're in-between.

366
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,876
You're black and white, so they're...
"You're not even black."

367
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:22,172
(man): I think he always felt
like an outsider...

368
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,466
because he was a half breed.

369
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,385
And when Mortimer Planno took him in,

370
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,763
well, that automatically
gave him acceptance.

371
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:36,810
(Sibley): Mortimer Planno was
a Rasta spiritual leader who taught Bob.

372
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:41,522
- He was like a preacher.
He preached Rastafarianism,

373
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:43,232
and he had a following.

374
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,735
(singing)

375
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:51,616
(Sims): He hooked up
with Bob as a young boy.

376
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:54,076
I think that they gelled together.

377
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,787
(man): Bob looked up to him?
- Oh, yes.

378
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:00,373
(Sibley speaking)

379
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:30,985
(man): Rastafarian were
the only true Afrocentric black people.

380
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:34,572
Who preached self-reliance,
who preached self-confidence.

381
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:38,534
(McDonald): But we interpret
the Bible a different way.

382
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:42,246
Most of these places that they're telling
you about in the Bible is in Africa.

383
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,998
The Garden of Eden is in Africa.

384
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,210
The teaching that we get
from the elders then...

385
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:51,797
is that we always have to look upon
a black man as God.

386
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:55,676
For we, somebody
that we can identify with.

387
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,264
(Bob speaking)

388
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,408
(McDonald): Emperor Haile Selassie I
is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.

389
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,868
He's our God. Rasta God.

390
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,998
Rasta said the purpose of life
is to be happy.

391
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,792
Everybody's supposed to be happy...

392
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,586
and live in peace, love and unity.

393
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,129
Yeah, mon.

394
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,551
I think when him start take it serious
now as a Rastaman...

395
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,304
was when him start growing dreadlocks.

396
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:48,808
- Locks meant that you were a Rastafarian
and you've taken a vow...

397
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:52,352
Nazarite vow not to cut or comb
your hair for a certain length of time,

398
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,814
and it has a significance
and is not to be taken lightly.

399
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,066
- How important are the dreadlocks?

400
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:01,778
- This? This is my identity, mon.
- Is that part of being a Rasta?

401
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:03,362
- Yeah, this is my identity.

402
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:07,826
- Then you go through
all the various rules...

403
00:29:07,994 --> 00:29:09,994
for living as set out by the Bible.

404
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,873
How you eat, how you live,
how you treat other people.

405
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,416
And he believed that, um,

406
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,960
if you practice these things,
well, life will be better.

407
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,838
Not only for you,
but for everyone else.

408
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:24,050
Got to have kaya now

409
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:29,304
Got to have kaya now

410
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,434
Got to have kaya now

411
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:37,478
For the rain is falling

412
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:39,940
(man): Marijuana's illegal in Jamaica,

413
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:44,235
but the Rastas say they smoke it
because the Bible tells them to.

414
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:48,781
The Book of Revelations
says to "partake of the herb."

415
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:51,824
- The herb was like
a sacramental food to us.

416
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:55,746
We take it for reasons,
not just to get high.

417
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,040
It put us in a holy, peaceful,

418
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,376
happy, inspirational mood.

419
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:05,129
(man): Were you born as a Rasta?

420
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:07,923
When I was born, you know,
and growing,

421
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:12,220
there was a certain amount
of consciousness...

422
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,179
in the higher self...

423
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,974
that, you know,

424
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:18,641
it was always a lonely world,

425
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:23,854
not finding people who might
think like me, you know?

426
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,731
So off I'm going on, and going on

427
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:28,985
and I come to Kingston,
meet some more people.

428
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,695
Them people is Rasta.

429
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,781
It's after that I find out
it's the same thing I have inside.

430
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,200
It's the same thing.

431
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,076
- How old were you
when this started to happen?

432
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:41,496
- This is about 17, 18, you know?
- Ah.

433
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,876
- I think in the belief or knowledge...

434
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:52,007
of Haile Selassie,
Bob found his real father,

435
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,176
which he'd never really knew.

436
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:57,386
- I think he saw himself now.

437
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,471
This is where he found himself, yes.

438
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,266
No more about being
half white or half black.

439
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:05,060
It's just one... one love.

440
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:08,646
One love
One heart

441
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:12,525
Let's join together
and I'll feel all right

442
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:17,488
One love
One heart

443
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:20,908
Let's join together
and I will feel all right

444
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:24,329
(man): Undaunted by the driving rain,
a sea of faces awaited...

445
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:27,457
at the Palisadoes Airport
the arrival of a living legend.

446
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:30,083
For some,
he was the King of Kings.

447
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,002
The Lion of Judah...

448
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,086
even a god.

449
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:36,173
Members of a local cult,
the Rastafarians,

450
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:39,968
who worship this figure as a deity,
were present in full force.

451
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:46,557
His Imperial Majesty,
Haile Selassie I,

452
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:48,976
Emperor of Ethiopia, arrived.

453
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:53,855
(man): When the plane landed,
thousands ran out and surrounded the plane.

454
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:57,693
Some of them smoking.
Our police were powerless.

455
00:31:57,861 --> 00:32:01,738
And Selassie came to the door
of the plane, I remember,

456
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:06,034
and after about 20 minutes
and he just looked and went back in.

457
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,745
It took a long time
to get him off the plane.

458
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:13,708
(Rita): So he came off the plane
and he greet, and I say...

459
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:15,668
I say, "Wait, but this is a little man.

460
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:18,087
There is this little man they say is God.
Them crazy."

461
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:23,467
- I sit there on my bicycle,
waiting on him.

462
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:26,177
And when him come up,
he look right in my face.

463
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,390
It was like him look
into everybody face.

464
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,058
But he look upon everyone.

465
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,685
I remember, I see that.

466
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,563
(Rita): And he just
turn his head around...

467
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:39,482
and he was looking straight at me.

468
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,192
And he did like this.

469
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:43,985
And I look and I look,

470
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:48,073
and I saw his hand,
and I saw a mark in his hand.

471
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:52,827
And believe you, my brother,
when I saw that I went crazy.

472
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:55,747
I run all the way back
to Trench Town.

473
00:32:56,081 --> 00:33:05,381
Take your troubles to Selassie

474
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:19,727
He is the only King of Kings

475
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:24,441
King of Kings

476
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:28,652
King of Kings Selassie

477
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:35,284
(Chin): The deeper Bob got
into the faith... the Rastafarian faith...

478
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:39,745
the more his music
became entwined.

479
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:45,419
- He was very into the social
commentary side of the music.

480
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:48,629
Mr. Dodd didn't like that because
it wasn't commercial enough.

481
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:52,007
So he was a little frustrated
because he couldn't do the music...

482
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:54,302
the way he really wanted it to be done.

483
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:59,682
(Bunny): And also at that time,
money was a problem.

484
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,352
Coxsone wasn't the kind of person
at the time to argue money with,

485
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,479
unless you were willing
to go to war.

486
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,441
(McDonald): When you go
and ask him for your money,

487
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:12,527
he usually like to bring off
some bad boy style.

488
00:34:12,695 --> 00:34:15,070
'Cause he has his thugs around him.

489
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,990
You know what I mean?
Enforcer type of guys.

490
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:21,202
- It was traditional in those days...

491
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,122
that artists who recorded
never made money...

492
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,957
because the record company
who collected the money...

493
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,667
never gave the artist any money.

494
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,128
- Yeah, we got paid
like minimum wage.

495
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:35,339
Three pounds a week, that's it.
Each.

496
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:37,342
- You couldn't live off it.

497
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,511
(man): Could Bob live off it?
- Nah, mon.

498
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,056
That's why Bob had to leave
and start doing his own thing.

499
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,100
(Bunny): So Robert left the group
to go to Delaware,

500
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,268
to the United States.

501
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:49,769
To migrate.

502
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,607
(man speaking)

503
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,115
Gotta hold on to
this feeling we got

504
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,243
We gonna blow blow blow

505
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,246
'Cause we love love love you now

506
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:12,707
- Yeah, well that was a marriage
that I wasn't invited to, nor Peter.

507
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:16,586
But because he's our brother
we lived with it.

508
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:20,924
(Rita): We got married, like,
on the 11th.

509
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:24,177
And he left on the 12th of February.

510
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,722
(vocalizing)

511
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:33,310
Run for cover

512
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,312
Run for cover

513
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,897
Rain is taking over

514
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,566
(barking)

515
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,568
Taking over

516
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,278
(woman): He came here...
his mother wants him here.

517
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,405
Bob loved his mother.

518
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,784
(Rita): He got a job at the du Pont Hotel
vacuuming the floor.

519
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:53,580
Then he got a job at Chrysler.

520
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:56,499
- When he was working there,
he used to...

521
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,751
I think he used to drive
one of the forklift.

522
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,631
I think he have a song out
of that driving the forklift all night.

523
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:07,551
I'm working all night

524
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,927
Got to be all right

525
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:13,139
See I work for my bread

526
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:14,849
All right

527
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:16,809
Night and day
All night

528
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,436
Work for my pay

529
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:20,855
All right
Night and day

530
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:24,733
No no no no no no

531
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:28,613
No no no no no no

532
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:34,159
Can you feel it
No no no no no no

533
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,786
- Well, he was just very humble,
very loving,

534
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:39,121
and he was very quiet, really.

535
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,791
(man): Was he smoking
a lot of ganja then?

536
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:45,628
- Yeah, he was growing it too,
man, in his backyard,

537
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:48,881
and he had a row of herb plants,

538
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,884
I mean towering in the air,
and I couldn't believe it.

539
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:54,053
'Cause at that time
in Wilmington, Delaware,

540
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,013
man, they were kicking
people's doors in for a little joint.

541
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,266
- I used to go up to his house
and we'd go in the basement.

542
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:03,227
He'd play his guitar, and I would play
my congas. I played congas.

543
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,479
And we would just jam.

544
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,981
And I didn't really realize
he was such a great musician.

545
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,276
(Rita): But he never gave up music,

546
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,988
'cause his mummy,
she would write me to say,

547
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:17,574
"All Nesta does
is stay in the basement...

548
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,451
and play his guitar."

549
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:24,539
(Bob): Well, I couldn't stand it.
I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.

550
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:28,001
So I went back to Jamaica,
where I must get more freedom.

551
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:31,003
Bend down low

552
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:35,758
Let me tell you what I know yeah

553
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:40,095
Bend down low

554
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,891
(Bunny): When Robbie came back
from the U.S.,

555
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:50,522
we decided to start our own independent
label, "Wail'n Soul'm."

556
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,233
So we went in and did
"Bend Down Low."

557
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:57,403
"Bend Down Low" was a number one.

558
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,198
We started to build our own economy.

559
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:04,034
We used to ride with our bicycles
and distribute the records to jukeboxes,

560
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:07,913
sound systems, record stores,
with our bicycles.

561
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:10,581
- The Wailers' music
dominated the dance halls.

562
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:15,461
But it was hardly played
on our Jamaican radio stations.

563
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,590
(man): In the music business,
they were just prejudiced.

564
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,926
The first problem is being a Rasta.

565
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,471
And the next problem is that
you're not with the big companies.

566
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,515
So that's a...
that's a heavy load to carry.

567
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,893
(Cole): These disc jockeys,
when they went on air,

568
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,227
they had their own program sometime.

569
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:35,063
They had their own
sorts of records from these...

570
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,899
these different companies
that they would have to play.

571
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:41,778
Sometimes we were not included.
So to be included in that,

572
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,071
we had to get real tough sometimes.

573
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,074
- I used to drive Bob with "Skill" Cole...

574
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,367
- Yeah.

575
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,119
- And Frowser and Tek-Life.

576
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,621
Do you remember them,
these two little gangsters?

577
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,998
- Yeah. Right.

578
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,958
(chuckling)
Yeah.

579
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,918
- I used to drive to the radio
station, right? - Right.

580
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,838
- And they'd leave me in the car.
Right?

581
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,007
And they'd go in.
Skill Cole had a baseball bat.

582
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,800
You know they don't play baseball
in Jamaica.

583
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,761
I don't know where
he got a baseball bat.

584
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:09,970
And Skill Cole was big... A big guy.
- Yeah.

585
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,432
- Right?
They'd go in the radio station.

586
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,518
They'd have me listen
to the radio...

587
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,812
to make sure that they're really

588
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,522
playing the record.
- Right.

589
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:26,487
(Bunny):
And then Coxsone, Studio 1,

590
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:30,656
Dualcreed, Trojan
and Prince Buster...

591
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:34,118
decide to form an organization
called "The Big Tree."

592
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,038
Then the Wailers pulled the ax.

593
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:41,501
If you are a big tree

594
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:45,921
We are the small ax

595
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:49,216
Sharpened to cut you down

596
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,842
Well sharp

597
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,469
To cut you down

598
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,834
(Bunny): Lee Perry used to work
with Coxsone.

599
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:32,005
So when he started doing
his independent business,

600
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:36,260
we admired him, because he follow
our footstep out of Coxsone.

601
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,182
(man): My experience of "Scratch" is that,

602
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,561
number one,
he's a very innovative producer.

603
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:48,521
Very creative.

604
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:51,399
I mean, to the point
that it became an excitement...

605
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:55,319
to see him come into the studio
with a half flask of white rum...

606
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,489
and sprinkle the four corners
of the studio with it.

607
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,866
Flash.

608
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:02,325
And then he would go into his little...

609
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:05,078
You know, he would, like, dance.

610
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:07,747
He didn't write music scores.
He would say, you know,

611
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,291
"Snap, I want you to play this,"
you know?

612
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,792
And he would just hop
through the music, you know?

613
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,544
And they...
they would follow him.

614
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:17,757
I would believe that his early
recordings with the Wailers

615
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,134
were the best to my knowledge.

616
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:23,596
Perry had a lot of influence
on Bob's, uh, career.

617
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:36,691
These are the words of my master

618
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:41,321
(Perry speaking)

619
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,623
(man): Why do people like his music
so much though?

620
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,208
(Perry speaking)

621
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,540
- It is mentioned often in the Bible...

622
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,919
that there shall be a music
that all people of all global concerns...

623
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:45,422
shall play and dance
and sing this music.

624
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,257
It's in the Revelation.

625
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:49,134
What other music could that be?

626
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:52,178
Reggae.

627
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,891
- What really changed it to reggae...

628
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,434
was the riff actually with the guitar.

629
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,104
It just basically a rhythm change...

630
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,481
in terms of what the guitar...

631
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:07,025
the guitar used to play
like cha, cha, cha.

632
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,778
And then it start playing
chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka.

633
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:23,874
Yes my friend

634
00:43:25,877 --> 00:43:29,838
We're in the streets again

635
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:33,508
Sometimes some of these things happen
out of just maybe an accident.

636
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:36,886
Somebody was doing something
and the producer went, "Hey, I like that."

637
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:40,056
Can set me free again

638
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:44,936
(man): Coxsone had bought a piece
of equipment from the United States.

639
00:43:45,104 --> 00:43:47,521
And it was in the studio for a long time
and no one knew what to do with it.

640
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:50,108
They decided to hook it up.

641
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:53,526
And when it was hooked up,
they realized it was a tape delay.

642
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:55,194
So when you make one strum,

643
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:57,740
it comes back at you
at the same time. "Chicka."

644
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:02,118
And the other studios heard "Chicka"...

645
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,162
and thought it was a guitar
making more sounds.

646
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:07,873
So reggae, to my mind, actually
developed out of an illusion.

647
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:12,753
So if you a bullbucka

648
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,921
Let me tell you this

649
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm a duppy conqueror

650
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:21,803
Conqueror

651
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:24,139
(Bunny): The beats are
bam, bam, bam, bam.

652
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:27,141
With reggae you got three beats
out of four beats,

653
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:28,851
and you imagine the next beat.

654
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:31,313
Feel the next beat.
That's reggae.

655
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:33,647
Feel. Heartbeat. Feel.

656
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:36,400
(rhythmic vocalizing)

657
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:39,779
(rhythmic vocalizing)

658
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,492
Yeah.

659
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,243
Heartbeats.

660
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:49,829
Real deal.

661
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:54,250
- The basic parts of the music
were the drum and the bass.

662
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,048
Because, you know, drums are
the first instruments in music.

663
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:07,429
So the drum is the heartbeat,

664
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:10,057
and the bass, it is the backbone.

665
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:13,018
(man): Well, I think
the drum and bass...

666
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:15,269
play a very important part
in Bob's music.

667
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:18,273
It was, you know, "Family Man"
and Carlton... two brothers.

668
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,608
They have their own style.

669
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:22,610
Stir it up

670
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,780
Little darlin'

671
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:28,240
Stir it up

672
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:31,701
Come on baby

673
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,289
(Barrett): Reggae is a concept
of all different type of music.

674
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:40,168
You got funk.
You got rhythm and blues.

675
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,670
You got soul.

676
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:46,006
And then very jazzy when it's ready.

677
00:45:46,174 --> 00:45:48,552
It's been a long long time

678
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:53,680
Since I've got you on my mind

679
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,018
Whoa whoa whoo yeah

680
00:45:58,186 --> 00:46:01,063
And now you are here

681
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:04,941
I say it's so clear

682
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:08,528
To see what we could do baby

683
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:10,697
Just me and you

684
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,031
Come on and stir it up

685
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:19,371
Little darlin'
Stir it up

686
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,332
Come on baby

687
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:26,545
Come on and stir it up

688
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:32,800
Little darlin'
Stir it up

689
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:40,515
- I was working with a company
called National Dry Cleaners.

690
00:46:40,684 --> 00:46:43,102
And I was in charge of a branch.

691
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,063
And Rita came in one day
with some clothes to,

692
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,940
you know, to be dry-cleaned.

693
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,651
She gave out the clothes
and she said, "Rita Marley."

694
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:53,820
So I was quite surprised,

695
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,948
because, I mean, the only Marley I know
was the white Marleys.

696
00:46:57,116 --> 00:46:59,034
I call them the white Marleys.

697
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:02,287
And, uh, so I said, "Who is Marley?"

698
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:04,705
She said, "Well, that's my husband."

699
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:06,665
And I said, "Who is his father?"

700
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:10,502
She said she don't know much about him,
but she know they call him Captain Marley.

701
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,462
And then I said, "That's my father."

702
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,759
My mother used to work
in a boardinghouse,

703
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,678
and my dad would stay there
when he comes from...

704
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:24,933
from sea or wherever he goes,
and that's how she met him.

705
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:27,894
(man): And did they have a long
relationship or was it very brief?

706
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:29,896
- I think it was very brief.

707
00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:34,191
My mother didn't really know
what happened to him.

708
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,988
(McDonald): In Jamaica,
used to have a big company.

709
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:42,740
Established company
named Marley and Plant.

710
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:45,076
They did construction,
Marley and Plant.

711
00:47:45,245 --> 00:47:48,914
Most of the construction jobs
in and around the country.

712
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:51,916
That was the company who did it.

713
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:54,502
And he always said
those were his family.

714
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,712
- Yeah, I remember one time, I think,

715
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,091
him go to them to try borrow
some money to buy a car,

716
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:04,427
you know, so they can
deliver the records.

717
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:06,805
And the story goes,
when he walked in the office,

718
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:10,642
like the whole staff turned around
'cause he looked so much like them.

719
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,560
(laughs)

720
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,062
- They told us to go away.

721
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,774
They know nothing
about Norval having a baby.

722
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:22,569
- Knowing my father, as I do, um,

723
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:25,239
I don't know how strong
the word rejected is.

724
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:29,243
But he might have
been rejected, for sure,

725
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,622
because, um, a different era
and my father was a disciplinarian,

726
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,333
and he was quite
a stern man in his own way.

727
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,546
In those days Rastafarians weren't
as socially accepted as they are now.

728
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,969
- He said to me, "When all this happened,
it gave me more strength...

729
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:50,096
because I went to write a song."

730
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:52,514
You know, write a song.
I said "What song?"

731
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:55,099
He said, "Try to pick it up."
He said, "The stone the builder refuse.

732
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:57,102
I'm the stone. I'm the one."

733
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:01,772
(man): I just wanted to play you a song...
which we were told, Bob,

734
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,443
after he went to see your father
and he felt rejected,

735
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,778
he wrote this song
about that experience.

736
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,031
I'm just very curious to know
what you think of it.

737
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:14,118
- Oh, really? I'd be interested.
I'd be interested to hear it.

738
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,246
(reggae)

739
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:30,050
The stone that the builder refused

740
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:33,677
Will always be the head cornerstone

741
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,888
Sing it brother

742
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,731
- Nice song.

743
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:49,360
You're a builder baby

744
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:52,653
Here I am a stone

745
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:58,785
Don't you pick and refuse me

746
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,662
'Cause the things people refuse

747
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,206
Are the things they should use

748
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:06,541
Do you hear me

749
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:09,336
Hear what I say

750
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:13,839
- I've heard this song before,
but I never placed any significance in it.

751
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:18,303
But I can see where
what you're saying could be so.

752
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,721
Mm-hmm.

753
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:23,724
- Am I allowed to talk?
- Mm-hmm.

754
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:27,061
- Yeah, how true that is.

755
00:50:27,229 --> 00:50:32,650
'Cause Bob put the Marley name
in the world, you know?

756
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:37,695
He filled the world with the Marleys
by all his music and his children's.

757
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:42,366
And he now becomes the Marley.

758
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:44,911
You know what I mean?
He now becomes the Marley,

759
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:48,831
and nobody knows what happened
to the rest that used to be so...

760
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,960
adored and wonderful.

761
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:55,754
They're in the background now,
and he's in the forefront.

762
00:50:55,922 --> 00:51:00,425
Isn't that amazing?
Yes. Yes. Truly.

763
00:51:02,344 --> 00:51:06,223
The stone that the builder refused

764
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:10,643
Will always be the head cornerstone

765
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:14,563
- I think what happened to him...
that rejection...

766
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,941
that is why he was able
to reach the world.

767
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:21,361
And I think there are so many people
out there that are hurting.

768
00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:24,614
So many people out there that have felt
what I have been through,

769
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:30,454
and I have a message that can bring change
and transformation.

770
00:51:41,089 --> 00:51:44,216
No woman no cry

771
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:49,012
No woman no cry

772
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:53,975
No woman no cry

773
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:58,897
No woman no cry

774
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:00,773
'Cause 'cause

775
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:04,568
'Cause I remember
when we used to sit

776
00:52:05,778 --> 00:52:08,655
In the government yard
in Trench Town

777
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:15,204
Oba observing
the hypocrites yeah

778
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:19,917
Mingle with the good people
we meet yeah

779
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:25,171
Good friends we have
Oh good friends we've lost

780
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:29,550
Along the way yeah

781
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:34,514
In this great future
you can't forget your past

782
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,183
So dry your tears I say

783
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:39,518
Yeah

784
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:42,354
Everything's gonna be all right

785
00:52:42,522 --> 00:52:44,396
Everything's gonna be all right

786
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:46,733
Everything's gonna be all right

787
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:49,193
Everything's gonna be all right

788
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:51,654
Everything's gonna be all right

789
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:53,781
Everything's gonna be all right

790
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,742
Everything's gonna be all right

791
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,453
Everything's gonna be all right

792
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:01,580
Everything's gonna be all right

793
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,831
Everything's gonna be all right

794
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:06,460
Everything's gonna be all right

795
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:08,836
Everything's gonna be all right

796
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:12,006
Everything's gonna be all right

797
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:17,679
(audience cheering)

798
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:20,848
(intro)

799
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,267
(Blackwell): Somebody rang me and said,
"Oh, by the way,

800
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:26,937
Bob Marley and the Wailers are in London.
Would you like to meet them?"

801
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:29,397
I was intrigued to meet them
because, you know,

802
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,692
you'd heard a lot about them by now.

803
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,156
When they came in the office,
they were just really impressive.

804
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,242
Very charismatic.

805
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,997
I just said to go make an album
and asked them how much they thought.

806
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:48,707
They told me, and I gave them
the money to do that.

807
00:53:51,752 --> 00:53:54,421
We took 4,000 pounds and
did the Catch a Fire album.

808
00:53:56,506 --> 00:53:58,717
(Blackwell): I was trying to get across
that this is a black rock act.

809
00:53:58,884 --> 00:54:01,094
That's how I wanted it
to be perceived.

810
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,470
Get up stand up

811
00:54:03,638 --> 00:54:06,473
Stand up for your rights

812
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:09,602
Get up stand up

813
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:12,313
Stand up for your rights

814
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,648
Get up stand up

815
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:17,692
And don't give up the fight

816
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:25,783
My sense is that Bob
was ready to give it a try,

817
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:27,243
and that the others weren't that keen.

818
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,542
(Cole): The frame of mind that Bob was in,
he didn't mind it.

819
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,002
He said, "I had to start somewhere."

820
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,295
He always said it.

821
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:40,505
"If you don't start somewhere,
you're not gonna get nowhere."

822
00:54:40,673 --> 00:54:43,049
Get up stand up

823
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,344
Stand up for your rights

824
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:48,262
Get up stand up

825
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,517
(Chin): Bob wanted it to reach
not just the Jamaicans...

826
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:55,394
Bob wanted it to reach
the American market.

827
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:57,813
He wanted it to reach
the European market.

828
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:00,649
And in order to do that,
you had to flavor it that way.

829
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,651
Stand up for your rights

830
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,739
Get up stand up

831
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,532
And don't give up the fight

832
00:55:15,372 --> 00:55:17,164
Ital.

833
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:18,791
Irie.

834
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,629
(Blackwell): The first record
is easily the most,

835
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,339
for want of a better word, pasteurized.

836
00:55:26,508 --> 00:55:28,801
I added sort of different things into it.

837
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:32,513
- All those guitars and the keyboards
are all overdubs.

838
00:55:42,815 --> 00:55:47,818
No sun will shine in my day today

839
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:51,279
No sun will shine

840
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,661
The high yellow moon
won't come out to play

841
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:01,081
Won't come out to play

842
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:06,002
I said darkness
has covered my light

843
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,841
And has changed my day
into night yeah

844
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:17,679
Where is the love to be found

845
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,474
Won't someone tell me

846
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:23,768
(Blackwell): I had no doubt
that it would succeed.

847
00:56:23,937 --> 00:56:25,812
I had no doubt.

848
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,148
The only thing that
could stop it succeeding...

849
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,191
is if I couldn't get them to tour.

850
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:31,776
That was my only fear.

851
00:56:31,944 --> 00:56:33,694
Concrete jungle

852
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:37,781
I say where the living is hardest

853
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:39,241
(Cole): They went on this famous tour,

854
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,326
and things went wrong.

855
00:56:41,494 --> 00:56:43,078
Things went sour.

856
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:47,081
- We did a tour of England
of the Catch a Fire album,

857
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,668
but no one told us that
it was a promotional tour,

858
00:56:50,837 --> 00:56:53,755
so we wouldn't be getting any money.

859
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:55,882
(Cole): You're top group in Jamaica now,

860
00:56:56,049 --> 00:57:00,428
and you probably think that going
to England is going to be the same.

861
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:02,096
Bob was more real.

862
00:57:02,264 --> 00:57:05,183
'Cause he said to me,
"Eh, nobody know the Wailers."

863
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,518
- I think Bob recognized he needed
to get out there and do it,

864
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:10,604
and I think the others were not sure.

865
00:57:10,772 --> 00:57:12,898
It's like grassroots, you know?

866
00:57:13,065 --> 00:57:16,610
You're on a bus all night,
schlepping up and down the motorway,

867
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:18,652
eating terrible food.

868
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,821
You know, it's rough.

869
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:24,910
In the case of Bunny, I think he just
didn't want to be in the cold and the snow.

870
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:27,495
He just... it just wasn't worth it to him.

871
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,876
(Sims): Bob wanted success.

872
00:57:34,044 --> 00:57:36,294
Bunny and Peter were more militant.

873
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:38,922
People wanted to separate them...

874
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:43,301
because they didn't want
to deal with Bunny and Peter.

875
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:45,720
- When you say people,
do you mean Island Records?

876
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:47,222
- Of course.

877
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:49,890
- The American leg was next.

878
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:53,435
So I said, "Are we going to get
some money out of this leg?"

879
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:58,648
Chris Blackwell said, no, because
you're gonna be doing freak clubs.

880
00:57:58,816 --> 00:58:03,195
You know, a place where
all kinds of immoral, mix-up things.

881
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:06,697
I say, "Chris
you know that we are Rastas.

882
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:10,117
Why are you exposing us
to them kind of situations there?"

883
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:13,663
"Well, if the Wailers don't do those clubs,
they're nobody."

884
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,124
So I said, "Yeah?
So I'm not going on this tour.

885
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:21,211
This leg, I'm coming off."

886
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:23,421
And my brothers, I thought,
would have done the same...

887
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,715
as the conversation affected them both.

888
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:31,596
But I was left to look as if
I was the only cold front.

889
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:35,891
So I hold my position anyway,
and still holds my position.

890
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:39,937
(Bunny speaking)

891
00:58:49,823 --> 00:58:54,158
Stop that train I'm leaving

892
00:58:55,786 --> 00:59:00,456
Stop that train I'm leaving

893
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:04,335
(McDonald): Peter was
a militant type of guy.

894
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:07,547
And I think he didn't like
Chris Blackwell too much.

895
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:10,883
He figured Chris Blackwell
was ripping them off.

896
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:14,720
- Well, the time came about '74...

897
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:17,722
when we did two L.P.'s
with Chris "Whitewell."

898
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,850
And the way he intend to handle us...

899
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:24,729
was like we were unprofessional,
or we were just beginners,

900
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:27,064
which I did not appreciate.

901
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:31,402
But after 12 years of being
a background vocalist with the Wailers,

902
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,904
I didn't get much access of saying,

903
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:36,615
or materializing what was in me.

904
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,075
And that was totally
depreciating my ability.

905
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,579
So I left because I need recognition

906
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,663
and respect.

907
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,892
(Ziggy): For us as his children
he wasn't like a lovey-dovey daddy.

908
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,811
Uh, you know,
a daddy who would, you know...

909
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:11,064
"Oh, be careful, Son."

910
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:15,067
Him was a rough man.

911
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:17,570
Him was rough, you know?
Rough, rough, rough.

912
01:00:19,531 --> 01:00:21,199
(Bob speaking)

913
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:30,457
(woman): We were always active.
You know, like, we're on the beach.

914
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,460
We're running.
We're racing each other.

915
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:36,087
It was always about racing
to see who could beat him.

916
01:00:37,048 --> 01:00:38,757
(Ziggy): I mean, there was
no let-up in him.

917
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:41,968
There was no, like, "It's children.
Let me run slow."

918
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:45,221
(whistles, laughs)

919
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:48,599
The fastest he could run
against us he would.

920
01:00:49,016 --> 01:00:52,602
- And then he would find it hilarious,
and we didn't find it so funny.

921
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:56,982
Yeah, nobody wanted
their children around...

922
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:58,566
...us.

923
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:04,030
"Nasty. Drug heads.

924
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:08,575
All your parents do
is smoke weed and play music.

925
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:10,869
And therefore
my kid cannot play with you."

926
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:13,956
So it wasn't a positive thing.

927
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,709
I would have friends who, like,
basically if they want to sleep over,

928
01:01:17,876 --> 01:01:20,170
they would have to tell their parents
they were sleeping somewhere else.

929
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:23,841
He said, "You don't need friends.

930
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:26,050
You have your brothers and your sisters.

931
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:28,261
And that's all you need.

932
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,806
Don't ever think
you'd need friends."

933
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:37,310
- I feel Bob worked through
so many different experiences in life...

934
01:01:37,478 --> 01:01:40,605
that I don't think him
trust people so easy.

935
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:45,652
So it's like, "Who really love me?"

936
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:50,574
Play I some music

937
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,867
Reggae music

938
01:01:53,994 --> 01:01:59,040
Play I some music
Dis a reggae music

939
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,627
Roots rock reggae

940
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:06,129
Dis a reggae music

941
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,008
Roots rock reggae

942
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,844
Dis a reggae music

943
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:17,849
- Well, the harmony didn't change because
then Bob took hold of The I-Threes.

944
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:20,726
Because he still wanted
to maintain that sound.

945
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:25,230
I can't refuse it

946
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:29,610
- And Bob invited us
to do the Natty Dread tour.

947
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:31,694
Feel like dancing

948
01:02:31,863 --> 01:02:33,947
- From the very first show
it was just...

949
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:36,324
(sucks teeth)

950
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:37,700
dynamite.

951
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:42,705
I

952
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:45,625
Rebel music

953
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:48,419
- We sold out everything.
We're just doing clubs.

954
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,672
But like the Paul's Mall in Boston...

955
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,757
we did like something
like six nights straight.

956
01:02:55,635 --> 01:02:57,385
Rebel music

957
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:07,604
It's that experience in a 400-seater,
500-seater at the Roxy.

958
01:03:07,772 --> 01:03:10,773
The Quiet Knight in Chicago,
another 500.

959
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:12,942
That was the time to see Bob Marley,

960
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,321
'cause you were as close to him
as I am to you now.

961
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:20,491
(man): All the way from
Trench Town, Jamaica,

962
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:21,950
Bob Marley and the Wailers.

963
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:24,327
Come on!
(audience cheering)

964
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:33,294
(Blackwell): This concert they did
in London in 1975... the Lyceum...

965
01:03:33,462 --> 01:03:35,213
that was the tipping point.

966
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:38,216
After that, everybody knew his name.

967
01:03:38,509 --> 01:03:42,678
There was that sense
that he's about to be massive.

968
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,353
Firstly, it was packed.
Over packed.

969
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:56,691
When you're at a concert
and you've managed to get in,

970
01:03:56,859 --> 01:03:59,484
and there are X hundred people
outside who can't get in,

971
01:03:59,653 --> 01:04:00,820
you already feel great.

972
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:02,821
And that energy you have

973
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:04,990
spreads to the band
when they come on stage.

974
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:07,659
And so they feel something.
And it was one of those things.

975
01:04:07,827 --> 01:04:10,829
It was just... just explosive.

976
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:14,875
- When he walked on stage and he felt
the crowd moving the theater,

977
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:17,543
it was like, "Yes."
You know, finally.

978
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:21,423
No woman no cry

979
01:04:24,509 --> 01:04:27,219
No woman no cry

980
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:33,851
No woman no cry

981
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:39,523
No woman no cry

982
01:04:41,192 --> 01:04:43,359
Said said

983
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:47,488
Said I remember
when we used to sit

984
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:53,035
In the government yard
in Trench Town

985
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:59,875
Oba observing the hypocrites

986
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:02,878
- This was owned by Chris Blackwell.

987
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:04,546
It was called Island House.

988
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:08,591
And he had several of his friends
and associates who really lived here.

989
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:11,595
Not like an apartment building,
but people who knew each other.

990
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:15,013
You know, they're occupied
downstairs and upstairs.

991
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:18,768
Chris made this available
for Bob to rehearse.

992
01:05:18,936 --> 01:05:21,145
And eventually, over time,

993
01:05:21,312 --> 01:05:23,438
Bob bought it from Chris.

994
01:05:23,606 --> 01:05:26,441
- Well, Rastas weren't allowed uptown,

995
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:31,111
and, until Bob moved in,
there were no dreadlocks there.

996
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,905
- A woman said to Bob,

997
01:05:33,074 --> 01:05:35,575
"How come you live at 56 Hope Road,

998
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:40,163
which is two doors up from King's House
where the governor lives,

999
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:44,458
and three doors up from Jamaica House
where the prime minister lives?"

1000
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:49,087
And Bob just said,
"Sister, I bring the ghetto uptown."

1001
01:05:54,426 --> 01:05:59,597
One of the people who live here
prior to Bob was Cindy Breakspeare.

1002
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:03,183
And she lived there
with her brother Reds.

1003
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:07,438
- I loved the accommodation because I loved
the old house with the wooden floors,

1004
01:06:07,606 --> 01:06:09,398
and, you know, it was just lovely.

1005
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,651
Cool and breezy, and it was great.

1006
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,700
There's always a stream
of people up and down,

1007
01:06:20,867 --> 01:06:25,330
and shouting and laughter
and just general carrying on.

1008
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,499
You were right in the mix.

1009
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:32,295
The most important thing culturally that
was happening in Jamaica at that time...

1010
01:06:32,462 --> 01:06:33,962
was happening right there.

1011
01:06:35,256 --> 01:06:38,383
That was the headquarters.
That was the center of it all.

1012
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:41,178
Bob never left 56 Hope Road.

1013
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:45,348
People come from
all over the world to see him.

1014
01:06:45,516 --> 01:06:48,183
(man): Did you live at Hope Road
with your dad?

1015
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,520
No, we lived probably a couple
of miles from Hope Road.

1016
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:53,105
- Right.
- 'Cause Hope Road was really...

1017
01:06:54,899 --> 01:06:56,817
I don't know. It was a spot.

1018
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,612
(Garrick): Rasta is an open-door thing.

1019
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:03,157
Nobody not checking your credentials.

1020
01:07:03,325 --> 01:07:05,409
So all kinds of people
come in to Hope Road.

1021
01:07:05,576 --> 01:07:07,618
Good, bad and indifferent.

1022
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:11,331
(Mowatt): Every time you go to
56 Hope Road,

1023
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:14,167
you would see a lot of people
gather with Bob... reasoning,

1024
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:16,169
talking about politics,

1025
01:07:16,337 --> 01:07:17,837
talking about God,

1026
01:07:18,005 --> 01:07:20,422
talking about history.

1027
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,132
You know, talking about everything.

1028
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:26,845
- Bob was very strict.
Him run this thing like an army.

1029
01:07:27,013 --> 01:07:29,014
We call him "Skipper."

1030
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:33,268
You see, the thing is, we had
certain strict rules at that time.

1031
01:07:33,436 --> 01:07:37,022
Woman supposed to wear dress,
not pants.

1032
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,356
So you had those kind...

1033
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:40,692
Don't come in with
what we call war paint.

1034
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:44,737
Lipstick and eye shadow.
And this is a roots saying kinda,

1035
01:07:44,905 --> 01:07:46,364
if you wanna come round Rasta,

1036
01:07:46,531 --> 01:07:49,324
then you have to throw away
those Babylonian things.

1037
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:53,412
(Breakspeare): It was a camp
with rules and doctrines...

1038
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,624
and tenets to live by,
and it was serious.

1039
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:01,794
(Garrick): Bob was very, like,
health conscious with him foods.

1040
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:06,383
(Mowatt): The blender would always be
going with excellent juices.

1041
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,135
Irish moss on the fire.
Fish tea going.

1042
01:08:09,303 --> 01:08:11,762
You know, everything
to make you strong.

1043
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,560
- When I met him,
we started a routine.

1044
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,814
My routine was getting up
in the mornings, training,

1045
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:25,066
do a lot of running,
exercise, go to the beach.

1046
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,819
So it became an integral part
of our lifestyle.

1047
01:08:27,986 --> 01:08:31,572
- The whole Rasta thing
is based on eternal life

1048
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,408
and taking care of your body.

1049
01:08:33,575 --> 01:08:35,076
It's the temple of the Lord.

1050
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:38,162
And we'd run on the beach
and then up this mountain

1051
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,582
to a place called Cane River Falls.
Incredible waterfalls.

1052
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:43,334
I shot some video up there.

1053
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:47,921
'Cause every day we pay the price
with a little sacrifice

1054
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:50,297
Jammin' till the jam is through

1055
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:53,509
We're jammin'

1056
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,764
(Garrick): Cane River,
we went up there, really,

1057
01:08:57,931 --> 01:09:01,434
to get the waterfall
beat on your back.

1058
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:04,186
It was like the best massage
you can get.

1059
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:11,025
This spot we're standing on now
was a stadium.

1060
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:12,610
This was a football field.

1061
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,993
So we had like two goal posts.

1062
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:22,161
You know, like small scrimmage.

1063
01:09:22,328 --> 01:09:24,706
The most we ever played
was five-a-side scrimmage.

1064
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:26,165
So you had one there.

1065
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,459
Then we had one down the back here.

1066
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:29,793
So, I'd say maybe...

1067
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:32,713
"Wow, that's a small field
when you look at it."

1068
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:34,631
Probably was what, 40 yards?

1069
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,679
In everything that Bob does,
very competitive.

1070
01:09:41,847 --> 01:09:45,766
So, you know, everything
he really gave it 110%.

1071
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,566
- He had a passion.

1072
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:57,360
Everything I did with a ball,
he would try to do it.

1073
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:02,407
(Smith): He just didn't play
for the fun of it.

1074
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,576
This was always part
of the process, you know?

1075
01:10:04,744 --> 01:10:07,036
Before he writes a song
he'd burn a spliff.

1076
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:10,706
Then you go run,
so you can lively up yourself.

1077
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,834
And then you get more inspired
so the lyrics can come out.

1078
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:21,216
(Bob): I play everywhere.

1079
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,218
Anywhere it is possible, you know?

1080
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,178
(chuckling)

1081
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,940
(Breakspeare): He began to come and visit.

1082
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,943
You just hear these footsteps come
running up the steps in the evening,

1083
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:44,780
always when the football was over
and place kind of quiet down, you know?

1084
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:47,699
And there's nobody to really see
the little moves that you're making.

1085
01:10:47,867 --> 01:10:49,868
'Cause in the day the place
is teeming with people,

1086
01:10:50,036 --> 01:10:53,579
so you can't be too overt
because you'd be outed instantly.

1087
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,834
(man speaking)

1088
01:10:58,002 --> 01:11:00,211
(Bob speaking)

1089
01:11:15,142 --> 01:11:17,852
(reggae intro)

1090
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:22,523
I went downtown
I went downtown

1091
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:25,776
I saw Miss Brown
Said I saw Miss Brown

1092
01:11:25,944 --> 01:11:29,280
She had brown sugar
Had brown sugar

1093
01:11:29,447 --> 01:11:32,741
All over her booga-wooga
Over her booga-wooga

1094
01:11:32,909 --> 01:11:36,203
Think I might join the fun
Think I might join the fun

1095
01:11:36,371 --> 01:11:39,248
But I had to hit and run
But I had to hit and run

1096
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:42,625
See I just can't settle down

1097
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:45,295
In a kinky part of town

1098
01:11:45,462 --> 01:11:46,629
Ride on

1099
01:11:46,797 --> 01:11:48,089
(man): When did you first meet Bob?

1100
01:11:48,257 --> 01:11:49,548
- I see Bob every day.

1101
01:11:49,716 --> 01:11:52,385
Bob live on Second Street.
I live on First Street.

1102
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:55,430
Ride on
See I just won't settle down

1103
01:11:55,598 --> 01:11:57,307
Ride on
Everybody

1104
01:11:57,473 --> 01:11:59,933
(Williams):
I would take no notice of him...

1105
01:12:00,101 --> 01:12:03,687
because he would bother me,
and I would go and tell my mother.

1106
01:12:03,854 --> 01:12:06,189
(man): How old were you?
- Sixteen.

1107
01:12:06,357 --> 01:12:08,191
Take me away

1108
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:10,484
Kinky reggae now

1109
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:12,653
(man): What did he do
when he paid you attention?

1110
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:16,866
(Williams): Like stuff like,
"Don't give it away. I'm growing you."

1111
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:18,325
"Remember, don't have
any boyfriend before me."

1112
01:12:18,492 --> 01:12:20,911
Stuff like that.

1113
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:23,455
(man): Was he charming?
- Oh, yes.

1114
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:29,919
(vocalizing)

1115
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,838
- Why were so many girls attracted to him?

1116
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:34,924
- Oh, my God.
(laughs)

1117
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:36,425
You don't know Bob.

1118
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,303
That's a handsome guy.

1119
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:43,349
I went down to Piccadilly Circus

1120
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:47,770
- People have visions of women
beating down the door to get at Bob Marley.

1121
01:12:47,937 --> 01:12:50,688
- Je... (laughing)
- Grabbing clothes.

1122
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:53,733
- Is it like that?
- No.

1123
01:12:53,901 --> 01:12:56,737
(interviewer): Why was he so successful
with women?

1124
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:58,905
- Because he was shy.

1125
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:02,367
Bob is not the womanizer...

1126
01:13:02,534 --> 01:13:05,370
that people make him out to be.

1127
01:13:05,746 --> 01:13:07,955
I think more, the women came at him.

1128
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:10,708
That why they say
Nice one

1129
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:12,710
Was he faithful?
(woman): To whom? God?

1130
01:13:12,877 --> 01:13:15,212
To Jah? Yes, he was faithful to Jah.

1131
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:18,340
Faithful to any one woman?
No.

1132
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:20,801
Why? Somebody own him?

1133
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:24,929
What is fidelity?
Western ideology, you know.

1134
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:27,224
A ring on your finger,
a ring through your nose?

1135
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,975
That's for Western men, man.

1136
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:31,894
They can only handle
one woman at a time.

1137
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:33,562
Bob could handle more.

1138
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:41,362
(Williams): One day a lady
came to me and she said,

1139
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,655
"Didn't anyone tell you
that Bob was married?"

1140
01:13:43,823 --> 01:13:45,865
And I didn't know.

1141
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:48,493
- For a time there I never knew
that he was legally married.

1142
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:52,706
I did come to know.
Eventually, his mom told me.

1143
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:54,873
(interviewer): Did he see Rita
at all at that time?

1144
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,335
- Sure. I mean,
they worked together, you know.

1145
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,170
Toured the world together.

1146
01:14:00,463 --> 01:14:03,757
- When we were on tour,
Rita had her own room.

1147
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:06,050
She was not with Bob.

1148
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,554
She would see everything that goes on.

1149
01:14:08,722 --> 01:14:12,974
But she had maximum respect
for the work.

1150
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:17,562
- How did you cope
through all the years

1151
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,188
that you were married together,

1152
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,399
and Bob was having these relationships
with other women?

1153
01:14:22,568 --> 01:14:25,527
(chuckles)
- I became his... his guardian angel.

1154
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,738
(laughing)
And then by that time,

1155
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:30,866
I was past the surface
of being just a wife.

1156
01:14:31,784 --> 01:14:35,829
Because of the importance
of who I knew Bob is.

1157
01:14:37,165 --> 01:14:39,665
I didn't see it as a fun trip.
We were on a mission.

1158
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:43,127
It was like an evangelist campaign...

1159
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:45,379
to bring people closer to Jah.

1160
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,717
(Cedella): They had this...
this bond, you know?

1161
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:54,429
I wouldn't...
I mean, you know,

1162
01:14:54,597 --> 01:14:56,306
if that was my husband,
I wouldn't.

1163
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:02,270
(Rita): We never fought about women.
We would never get into that.

1164
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:04,814
He would come and say to me,

1165
01:15:04,982 --> 01:15:07,692
"Rita, I did this,"
or "This is what happened."

1166
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:12,029
I was the one that he would call
to get women out of his dressing room...

1167
01:15:12,197 --> 01:15:13,864
when it get to that stage.

1168
01:15:14,032 --> 01:15:17,451
"Come up for my room.
Come and get these people out for me."

1169
01:15:17,619 --> 01:15:19,619
And I would do that gracefully.

1170
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,496
"Come on, ladies. It's bedtime.

1171
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,582
We have a show tomorrow, so..."

1172
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:27,127
- She wouldn't get upset, you know,

1173
01:15:27,295 --> 01:15:28,336
but...

1174
01:15:30,088 --> 01:15:32,215
there were times when, you know,

1175
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:34,007
you knew she was hurting.

1176
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,427
Hurt all of us.

1177
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,889
And that's what he didn't like.

1178
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:43,351
He didn't like it when, like,
we knew that she was hurt,

1179
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:45,769
and it showed on us.

1180
01:15:45,937 --> 01:15:47,813
That's when, "Okay,
we're going for ice cream.

1181
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,314
We're going for burgers.
What do you want?"

1182
01:15:50,733 --> 01:15:53,151
(interviewer): Do you think
that he was being selfish?

1183
01:15:53,318 --> 01:15:56,529
- Yes. It's not fair to no woman.

1184
01:15:57,657 --> 01:15:59,407
That is not fair at all,

1185
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:02,952
but we still couldn't hate him for it.

1186
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:04,119
(laughs)

1187
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:11,000
(audience applauding)

1188
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:24,054
(man reporting): In the capital of Kingston
there are rival shantytown ghettos...

1189
01:16:24,222 --> 01:16:27,724
where whole communities
are divided along sectarian lines.

1190
01:16:27,892 --> 01:16:29,309
These zones are controlled

1191
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:32,062
by the prime minister's
People's National Party,

1192
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,481
who are accused
of being communists,

1193
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:36,566
or by the opposition
Jamaica Labour Party,

1194
01:16:36,733 --> 01:16:38,776
who are accused of being fascists.

1195
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:42,781
- Politics in Jamaica at that time...

1196
01:16:42,948 --> 01:16:47,577
was like an East-West confrontation,
which was scary.

1197
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:52,706
You have one side which is kind
of more ultra-conservative, right wing,

1198
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,666
which is Seaga,

1199
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:57,253
who was like Reagan's man
in the Caribbean.

1200
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,714
And then Manley
was trying to work a system...

1201
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,633
called democratic socialism,

1202
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,426
which other parties say,

1203
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:08,430
"That's just a disguise for
saying you are a communist."

1204
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:11,765
(reporter): Sometimes it's only insults
or stones and bottles...

1205
01:17:11,933 --> 01:17:13,434
thrown from one side to the other.

1206
01:17:13,602 --> 01:17:15,686
But often it's bombs and bullets,

1207
01:17:15,854 --> 01:17:18,814
and almost every day the newspapers
carry fresh reports...

1208
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:21,482
of the previous day's killings in Kingston.

1209
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:25,571
(Rita): The whole thing became
like a gangster thing.

1210
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:27,615
Political gangster.

1211
01:17:27,782 --> 01:17:30,450
- These were the guys
who kept things in line

1212
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:32,744
for the M.P.s, you know.

1213
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:38,583
So you find that in some areas,
the real power is enforcers.

1214
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:41,418
- You like this girl...
that's both of us.

1215
01:17:41,586 --> 01:17:44,087
You like her, and I like her.
We start to fight over her.

1216
01:17:44,255 --> 01:17:48,842
It's like that.
He like P.N.P. You like J.L.P.

1217
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,551
You wanna fight for your P.N.P.

1218
01:17:52,262 --> 01:17:54,723
- Bob was friends
with all of those guys.

1219
01:17:54,891 --> 01:17:58,768
All of the bad guys from
the Labour Party was Bob friend.

1220
01:17:58,936 --> 01:18:01,812
Likewise, all the bad guys
from the P.N.P.

1221
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:04,690
(Smith): These are guys
that come from...

1222
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:07,068
the same neighborhood
he grew up with.

1223
01:18:07,235 --> 01:18:09,778
These are really bad guys.
(laughing)

1224
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,613
'Cause you might see some guys, yeah,

1225
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:15,700
and then tomorrow you'd take up
the Jamaican paper,

1226
01:18:15,869 --> 01:18:17,452
you'd see the 10-most-wanted list...

1227
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,205
four of the guys that were on it
are already dead.

1228
01:18:20,373 --> 01:18:21,706
There are now five.
(laughing)

1229
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,584
Some of them actually
love the music, you know,

1230
01:18:25,752 --> 01:18:28,338
but their main thing is, you know...
(laughing)

1231
01:18:28,506 --> 01:18:31,090
warfare and badness, you know.

1232
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:35,052
(Bob speaking)

1233
01:18:47,982 --> 01:18:53,820
- Bob did a concert
with Stevie Wonder in Jamaica,

1234
01:18:53,988 --> 01:18:57,948
and they actually performed
two songs together.

1235
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,826
I think very "Superstitious,"
which Bob knew,

1236
01:19:00,994 --> 01:19:03,787
and "I Shot the Sheriff."

1237
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:07,791
(Wonder):
I shot the sheriff

1238
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:13,422
But I did not shoot the deputy

1239
01:19:15,049 --> 01:19:17,717
(Garrick): Stevie made a gesture
by giving, I think,

1240
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:19,885
half of his pay for the show...

1241
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:23,222
to the Salvation Army
blind school in Jamaica,

1242
01:19:23,389 --> 01:19:26,725
and I think Bob
was moved by that.
