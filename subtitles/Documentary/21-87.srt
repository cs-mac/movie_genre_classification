1
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,036
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:49,830
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,126
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

4
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

5
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:05,010
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,707
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:12,302
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,399
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

9
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,896
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,492
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,786
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

12
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,983
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:31,178
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:34,474
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,771
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,568
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,866
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:42,963
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,158
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

20
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:51,752
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

21
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,645
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

22
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,442
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

23
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,539
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

24
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,637
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

25
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

26
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,429
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

27
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,322
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

28
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,619
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

29
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:31,002
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

30
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:44,085
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

31
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:08,702
Premed.

32
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,199
4.0 GPA.

33
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,396
44 MCATs.

34
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,292
<i>President, American Legion Math League.</i>

35
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,789
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

36
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,085
<i>Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.</i>

37
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,281
<i>And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,</i>

38
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,277
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

39
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:29,376
Thank you.

40
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:32,662
<i>The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.</i>

41
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:36,247
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

42
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,242
Absolutely.

43
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:42,420
<i>We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship</i>

44
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:46,204
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

45
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:48,296
Right.

46
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,985
Professor Phillips?

47
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:55,166
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

48
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:59,249
<i>You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.</i>

49
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:04,726
<i>I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.</i>

50
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:11,398
<i>And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.</i>

51
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,584
Which I don't really have.

52
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:20,559
<i>So, what I'm trying to say</i>

53
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,940
<i>is that I really, really need this scholarship.</i>

54
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,421
Did you rehearse that?

55
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,807
<i>Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.</i>

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,885
<i>Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.</i>

57
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:43,063
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

58
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:45,851
dazzles.

59
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:50,432
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

60
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,311
<i>Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.</i>

61
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,203
We're building a robotic wheel

62
00:06:57,303 --> 00:07:01,485
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

63
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,667
<i>Well, I'm designing the system. So...</i>

64
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,862
Right.

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,745
<i>Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,</i>

66
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:13,833
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

67
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,015
<i>Well, I have both my legs.</i>

68
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:21,201
<i>Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?</i>

69
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,089
That was a joke.

70
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,977
<i>Ben, it's all about the essay.</i>

71
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:30,063
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

72
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:33,609
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

73
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:36,244
Life experience.

74
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,081
<i>What can you tell me, Ben,</i>

75
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:41,818
that's going to dazzle me?

76
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,066
I'm so sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:11,411
<i>- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.</i>

78
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:15,161
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

79
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,708
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

80
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,329
Eight dollars?

81
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:25,802
<i>Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

82
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,724
<i>You slept with him, didn't you?</i>

83
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,723
<i>- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.</i>

84
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:35,522
<i>I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.</i>

85
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:38,723
<i>So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,</i>

86
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes</i>

87
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,722
<i>"to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?</i>

88
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:48,821
<i>So then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"</i>

89
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:54,021
<i>And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,</i>

90
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:57,320
"You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

91
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,319
<i>Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

92
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,119
<i>Oh, nothing.</i>

93
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:09,718
<i>I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.</i>

94
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:14,918
<i>I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.</i>

95
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:20,117
<i>And the reason that I have nothing
is'cause, well, I've done nothing.</i>

96
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:22,917
<i>- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?</i>

97
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,717
You have everything.

98
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:29,617
<i>You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?</i>

99
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:30,916
<i>Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.</i>

100
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:33,316
<i>Hey. It dazzles me, mister.</i>

101
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:36,416
<i>You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.</i>

102
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,815
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

103
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:42,815
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

104
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,915
<i>Man, I gave up everything.</i>

105
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,715
<i>You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.</i>

106
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,415
I don't think you gave up sex.

107
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,814
<i>- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.</i>

108
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,614
<i>All right, all right. Not sex, but...</i>

109
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,714
It just annoys me that the one thing

110
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:58,713
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

111
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:03,013
<i>You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.</i>

112
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,913
<i>$300,000.</i>

113
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:09,412
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

114
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:13,412
<i>You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.</i>

115
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,911
<i>Well, look at the bright side,</i>

116
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:21,611
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

117
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,010
Thank you.

118
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,909
<i>- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.</i>

119
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,309
<i>Thank you, love. Kisses.</i>

120
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,609
Make a wish.

121
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,009
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

122
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,408
Bravo.

123
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,808
<i>Congratulations, Benjamin.</i>

124
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,708
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

125
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:53,007
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

126
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:56,107
<i>Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.</i>

127
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:57,706
<i>Cam, you owe another six bucks.</i>

128
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,406
<i>No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.</i>

129
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:02,006
<i>Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.</i>

130
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,406
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

131
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:07,506
<i>I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.</i>

132
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:10,805
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

133
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,905
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

134
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,304
<i>So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,</i>

135
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,804
after 19 cups of coffee.

136
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,904
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

137
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:26,203
<i>This is good. Miles, this is good.</i>

138
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:31,503
<i>Yeah, well, it better be'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.</i>

139
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,003
This is called destiny.

140
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:34,902
<i>You know, there is the... Thank you.</i>

141
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:38,603
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

142
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:42,102
<i>Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!</i>

143
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,502
<i>Look, guys,</i>

144
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:51,301
<i>we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.</i>

145
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:56,000
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

146
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,399
<i>If we can't even win that, what's the point?</i>

147
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,899
<i>Hey, hey. Look at this!</i>

148
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,099
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

149
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,399
We suck.

150
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:22,997
<i>Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.</i>

151
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:25,797
Yeah.

152
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:30,196
Do you remember anything about him?

153
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,996
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

154
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,195
<i>Yeah, I think I watched him shave.</i>

155
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:43,195
<i>So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?</i>

156
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,994
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

157
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:49,095
<i>Ben, you're working too hard.</i>

158
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:53,894
<i>Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.</i>

159
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:57,793
<i>You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.</i>

160
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:01,993
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

161
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:04,293
Okay. All right.

162
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,293
<i>- Good night.
- All right, good night.</i>

163
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:10,192
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

164
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,292
All right.

165
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:20,991
<i>Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?</i>

166
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:24,991
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

167
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,290
<i>That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,</i>

168
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,890
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

169
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,289
<i>All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.</i>

170
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,489
Anyone?

171
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,188
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

172
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,389
Newton stole it.

173
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,488
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

174
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:52,787
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

175
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:57,786
<i>And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.</i>

176
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:01,686
<i>- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.</i>

177
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:02,886
Ben.

178
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:05,786
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

179
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,586
was the original author of this method.

180
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,785
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?</i>

181
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.</i>

182
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,585
<i>And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson</i>

183
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:21,284
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

184
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:24,583
<i>All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?</i>

185
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:29,083
<i>We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?</i>

186
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,183
<i>Ben, suppose you're on a game show.</i>

187
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,783
<i>And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?</i>

188
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:39,883
<i>Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.</i>

189
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:42,382
<i>Which door would you choose, Ben?</i>

190
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,782
Door number one?

191
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,681
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

192
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,781
<i>All right, now, the game show host,</i>

193
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:50,881
<i>who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,</i>

194
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:55,181
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

195
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:59,180
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

196
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,080
<i>Ben, game show host comes up to you.</i>

197
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,579
<i>He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one</i>

198
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,979
"or go with door number two?"

199
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,579
<i>Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?</i>

200
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,779
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, wait.</i>

201
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,979
<i>Remember, the host knows where the car is</i>

202
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,578
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

203
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:18,478
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

204
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:22,877
<i>Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.</i>

205
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,878
Based on variable change.

206
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,477
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

207
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,777
<i>Yeah, which changed everything.</i>

208
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,477
Enlighten us.

209
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:35,776
<i>Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,</i>

210
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,375
I had a 33.3º/º chance of choosing right.

211
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:43,575
<i>But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,</i>

212
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:47,875
it's now 66.7º/º if I choose to switch.

213
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:53,674
<i>So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3º/º.</i>

214
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,473
Exactly.

215
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,773
<i>People, remember,</i>

216
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:03,073
<i>if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.</i>

217
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,273
<i>Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch</i>

218
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,872
<i>out of paranoia, fear, emotions.</i>

219
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,872
<i>But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside</i>

220
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:18,772
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

221
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,171
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

222
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,371
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

223
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:24,871
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

224
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,571
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

225
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:29,171
You can pick them up on your way out.

226
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,269
I am invincible.

227
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,668
<i>Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.</i>

228
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,266
Man. That's brutal.

229
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>You know,
you should just ask her out, man.</i>

230
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,965
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

231
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,665
<i>Oh, wait, she is.</i>

232
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:18,865
<i>Well, why don't you ask her?</i>

233
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:22,664
Because I'm already dating someone.

234
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,564
<i>Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.</i>

235
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:28,963
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

236
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:34,663
<i>Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.</i>

237
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,163
<i>Yeah, that's funny.</i>

238
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:43,062
<i>You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?</i>

239
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,761
<i>Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.</i>

240
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,761
Cam!

241
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,458
Boy genius.

242
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
You have to follow me now.

243
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,458
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

244
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,658
Come on.

245
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,057
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

246
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,955
Our honored guest.

247
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,754
<i>- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.</i>

248
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,654
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:58,753
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

250
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,353
<i>- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.</i>

251
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:07,552
<i>- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.</i>

252
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,552
Is there a problem with my paper?

253
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:13,851
<i>Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton</i>

254
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,552
<i>and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.</i>

255
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:22,651
<i>Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.</i>

256
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,151
<i>So, is this some kind of a math club?</i>

257
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,051
<i>Don't be rude, people.</i>

258
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,750
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

259
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,449
- Choi.
- Jill.

260
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:40,449
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

261
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,949
<i>No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.</i>

262
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,148
You play against the dealer.

263
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,448
You're given two cards.

264
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,748
Face cards are worth 10 points.

265
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,948
The closest to 21 wins.

266
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:55,948
<i>If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.</i>

267
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,246
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

268
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,546
It's a game with memory.

269
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,346
<i>Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.</i>

270
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:07,246
<i>And the best part, it's beatable.</i>

271
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,745
Are you talking about counting cards?

272
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:16,445
<i>No. I'm talking about getting very very rich.</i>

273
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:22,044
<i>You count cards, right? All of you?</i>

274
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,644
<i>As a team, yes.</i>

275
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:27,444
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

276
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,043
<i>- Where?
- Vegas, baby.</i>

277
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:34,842
<i>So, why are you telling me?</i>

278
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:38,742
<i>Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.</i>

279
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:39,943
How?

280
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,642
Jimmy got a job at Google.

281
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,142
<i>- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.</i>

282
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:49,141
<i>Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?</i>

283
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,541
<i>Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.</i>

284
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,641
Yeah... This is crazy.

285
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,441
<i>No, Ben. This is profitable.</i>

286
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,940
<i>Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.</i>

287
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,940
<i>- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.</i>

288
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,639
<i>No, it's not that. It's...</i>

289
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:13,738
<i>I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.</i>

290
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,238
We pay better.

291
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,738
<i>Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.</i>

292
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:22,437
<i>Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.</i>

293
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,738
<i>I mean, what do you have to worry about?</i>

294
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:28,836
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

295
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:34,536
<i>Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.</i>

296
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,136
<i>You know, the 2.09 Competition?</i>

297
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:41,336
<i>Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.</i>

298
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:44,236
<i>Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,</i>

299
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:46,335
so it's kind of important.

300
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:50,335
<i>Ben, let the car drive by itself.</i>

301
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:58,533
<i>Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.</i>

302
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,233
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

303
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:07,532
<i>Ben, you were born for this.</i>

304
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:10,732
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

305
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,232
It's perfect.

306
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:17,931
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

307
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,431
So I'm sorry.

308
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,430
Ben.

309
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,230
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

310
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,030
<i>- No, of...
- No.</i>

311
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,229
<i>You're one of my favorite new students,</i>

312
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,629
<i>and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.</i>

313
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,528
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- Ýt's boring.

314
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:51,428
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

315
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:53,727
<i>So, how much is this thing gonna run me?</i>

316
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:59,027
<i>Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15º/º.</i>

317
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,827
The jacket's $589.99.

318
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,526
<i>The pants, $285.99, minus 10º/º for both.</i>

319
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:09,826
<i>Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5º/º from the $69.99.</i>

320
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,125
<i>The shoes were just marked down
from $155,</i>

321
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:17,725
<i>so you're looking at $1,042.68.</i>

322
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,224
I'm pretty good with numbers.

323
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,524
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

324
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,024
<i>Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.</i>

325
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,023
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

326
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:31,023
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:37,323
Hey.

328
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,123
Hey.

329
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:45,221
<i>- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.</i>

330
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,422
I'm looking for a tie.

331
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:52,921
<i>Oh, well, we're having a 15º/º sale
on the ties.</i>

332
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,621
<i>And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10º/º</i>

333
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:59,720
with my employee discount.

334
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,420
<i>- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

335
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,119
<i>This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,</i>

336
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:14,219
<i>you know, to repel liquids and stains.</i>

337
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,918
<i>- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.</i>

338
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:21,518
Face me. Stay still.

339
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:26,917
<i>Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,</i>

340
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:32,617
<i>I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.</i>

341
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:36,816
I came to see you.

342
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:39,316
You did?

343
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,916
Blackjack's a great game.

344
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,615
<i>No, look, it's easy to learn</i>

345
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,515
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

346
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:50,714
<i>I grew up on it, actually.</i>

347
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:54,315
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:58,613
<i>Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.</i>

349
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:02,313
<i>I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.</i>

350
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,913
<i>If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.</i>

351
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,913
And what if he won?

352
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:11,512
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

353
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:15,012
<i>Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.</i>

354
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:20,411
<i>Ben, you should feel the thrill</i>

355
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:24,611
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

356
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,810
I think you should come to Vegas.

357
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,309
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

358
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,309
I can't.

359
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,508
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,008
I just can't.

361
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:54,608
<i>Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.</i>

362
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:56,407
Yeah.

363
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,107
You're welcome any time.

364
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,906
<i>You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas</i>

365
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,106
is you can become anyone you want.

366
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:40,803
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

367
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:41,902
- No.
- Plus 11.

368
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,002
No.

369
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,102
<i>- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."</i>

370
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:47,701
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

371
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,901
<i>People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.</i>

372
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,201
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

373
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:55,400
<i>Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,</i>

374
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,201
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

375
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,900
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

376
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
The count. It's plus 13.

377
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,499
Yes.

378
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,299
Pull up a chair.

379
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:21,098
Stop.

380
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:24,598
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

381
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:26,697
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

382
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,097
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

383
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:30,297
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

384
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:31,297
Cat.

385
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,196
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

386
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:36,496
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

387
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:40,696
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

388
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,296
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

389
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:45,695
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

390
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:49,494
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

391
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:54,095
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

392
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:57,194
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

393
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,993
<i>The team had a system.</i>

394
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,793
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

395
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:09,193
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

396
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:10,893
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

397
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:11,993
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

398
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,892
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

399
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,492
Plus 12.

400
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,691
Is this chemistry review?

401
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:24,091
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

402
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,390
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

403
00:28:25,491 --> 00:28:26,890
Use it in a sentence.

404
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:29,190
<i>Man, that sugar's sweet.</i>

405
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,389
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

406
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,090
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

407
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,890
You're doing great.

408
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,889
<i>Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,</i>

409
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,088
<i>which is $300,000.</i>

410
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:49,788
<i>I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.</i>

411
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:53,388
<i>Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if," it's "when."</i>

412
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:56,088
<i>And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.</i>

413
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:58,887
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

414
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,287
<i>Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,</i>

415
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:05,686
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

416
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,587
What if we get caught?

417
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,686
<i>Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.</i>

418
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,486
<i>Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.</i>

419
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,885
<i>- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.</i>

420
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:25,084
You think you can beat the system?

421
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:29,883
<i>This is the system, beating you back.</i>

422
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,783
<i>You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.</i>

423
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:40,182
<i>- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.</i>

424
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,883
Count to five.

425
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,682
- Count to five!
- What?

426
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:49,382
<i>Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.</i>

427
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:50,681
Start with one.

428
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,381
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

429
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:57,681
<i>Good. Now, stop counting.</i>

430
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,580
Let's go.

431
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,679
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

432
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,879
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

433
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:12,479
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

434
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,279
<i>Look, you're choosing to play two hands</i>

435
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,879
<i>against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?</i>

436
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:19,078
<i>Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.</i>

437
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:21,178
<i>Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.</i>

438
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,978
<i>Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?</i>

439
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:26,377
<i>Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?</i>

440
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:27,777
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

441
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:31,377
<i>So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,</i>

442
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,177
<i>spotters and big players, right?</i>

443
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:36,776
<i>So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,</i>

444
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,676
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

445
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:43,576
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

446
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,975
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

447
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:50,075
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

448
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:52,975
<i>That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.</i>

449
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:56,074
<i>Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,</i>

450
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:58,774
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

451
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:00,574
<i>Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,</i>

452
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:03,174
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

453
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,774
<i>This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.</i>

454
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,873
<i>Well, I'm always the mustard, so...</i>

455
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:12,173
<i>When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,</i>

456
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:16,172
<i>or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.</i>

457
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:18,971
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

458
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:21,272
<i>When the deck cools, he cashes in.</i>

459
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:22,871
It's not as easy as it sounds.

460
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,471
<i>Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,</i>

461
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:27,171
<i>because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,</i>

462
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:30,071
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

463
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:32,771
<i>- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.</i>

464
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,070
Show us.

465
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,570
<i>Okay, what's this?</i>

466
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,070
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

467
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,069
We need to talk.

468
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,769
The deck's cooling.

469
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,968
And get out. Get out now.

470
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:51,868
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

471
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,768
There's a trial run?

472
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:58,167
- Where?
- You'll find out.

473
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:50,361
Hey.

474
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,859
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

475
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,459
Follow me.

476
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,058
This way.

477
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,657
<i>Go, go. You go.</i>

478
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,656
No more bet. No more bet.

479
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:54,654
<i>Come on, money.</i>

480
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:56,554
<i>Today, 14.</i>

481
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,454
Whose side are you on?

482
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:08,053
Sixteen.

483
00:34:08,153 --> 00:34:10,253
<i>Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.</i>

484
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,952
<i>So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?</i>

485
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:28,451
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

486
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:29,851
$300.

487
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,249
$300.

488
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,049
<i>You bet, sir?</i>

489
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:47,148
Thanks.

490
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:08,947
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.</i>

491
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:13,046
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.</i>

492
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,345
Nice.

493
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:23,845
<i>Can I get another drink, please?</i>

494
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:25,445
Thank you.

495
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:30,044
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:33,244
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

497
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,943
<i>Get off, I haven't done anything!</i>

498
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:38,743
Please. Please let go.

499
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:40,643
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

500
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:43,143
<i>- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!</i>

501
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,743
What's the count?

502
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:48,841
Plus 18.

503
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:55,741
<i>Oh, you've gotta be kidding.</i>

504
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:56,941
<i>Congratulations, Ben.</i>

505
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,340
<i>Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.</i>

506
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,141
Welcome to the team.

507
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,840
We didn't mean it.

508
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,939
<i>It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.</i>

509
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,538
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

510
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:20,939
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

511
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,439
I've never done this.

512
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:24,738
I know that and I understand.

513
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:28,038
<i>But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.</i>

514
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:30,237
<i>Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,</i>

515
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:32,137
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

516
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,537
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

517
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:37,137
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

518
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,037
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

519
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:42,436
You in?

520
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:47,135
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.</i>

521
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:51,235
<i>There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.</i>

522
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,835
<i>We're counting cards, we're not gambling.</i>

523
00:36:57,034 --> 00:37:00,134
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

524
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,234
Right.

525
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,334
<i>I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,</i>

526
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:06,333
<i>and sometimes, people lose control.</i>

527
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,933
They give in to their emotions.

528
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,633
You will not.

529
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,433
You understand?

530
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:16,632
Yeah.

531
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:19,532
Get some rest.

532
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:22,132
<i>- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.</i>

533
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:25,931
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

534
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:28,431
<i>- No, you don't.
- I don't?</i>

535
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:30,430
<i>No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.</i>

536
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,731
<i>I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,</i>

537
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:35,431
<i>and he understood, so he gave you an A.</i>

538
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,130
<i>You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.</i>

539
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,829
You'll get a call about details later.

540
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,029
<i>So did the girls go on ahead, huh?</i>

541
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,429
<i>Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?</i>

542
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:50,629
Okay.

543
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:53,628
<i>Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.</i>

544
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:54,827
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

545
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:57,228
<i>No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.</i>

546
00:37:57,328 --> 00:38:00,227
<i>- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.</i>

547
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,126
<i>Honestly, I really don't have to go.</i>

548
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:07,627
<i>- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...</i>

549
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:08,727
Please just shut up.

550
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,126
<i>Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...</i>

551
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:13,326
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

552
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,625
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

553
00:38:16,825 --> 00:38:19,026
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

554
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,725
Don't ask questions.

555
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,625
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

556
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:30,024
<i>You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.</i>

557
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:34,923
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

558
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,124
<i>And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.</i>

559
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:38,923
<i>$250,000?</i>

560
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:43,023
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

561
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,322
You really suck at not asking questions.

562
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,322
What's a donkey boy?

563
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,221
<i>- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.</i>

564
00:38:57,721 --> 00:39:00,420
<i>- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.</i>

565
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,121
<i>Act casual, think casual, be casual.</i>

566
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,020
<i>Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.</i>

567
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,420
Thank you.

568
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,019
<i>If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.</i>

569
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,119
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,415
Your boarding pass.

571
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:00,514
Sir?

572
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:14,813
You forgot your bag.

573
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:18,612
Thanks.

574
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,898
<i>Nice going, Campbell.</i>

575
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:24,599
<i>Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.</i>

576
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:39,897
<i>Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,</i>

577
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:43,196
<i>Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.</i>

578
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:45,296
So glad you could make it.

579
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,396
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

580
00:42:47,496 --> 00:42:49,795
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

581
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:50,995
<i>You live in Washington, D.C.</i>

582
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:54,895
<i>Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.</i>

583
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:57,294
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

584
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:00,494
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?

585
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:02,794
<i>Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.</i>

586
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:06,093
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

587
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:09,393
<i>You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?</i>

588
00:43:09,493 --> 00:43:11,693
<i>Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.</i>

589
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:14,493
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

590
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,892
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

591
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:20,992
<i>Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.</i>

592
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:22,791
Like I'm not going already.

593
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,991
<i>Yeah. All right. Now, listen.</i>

594
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:27,091
<i>Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.</i>

595
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:28,491
They're called "eyes in the sky."

596
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:31,591
<i>For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,</i>

597
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,091
<i>and at all times, you don't know each other.</i>

598
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,590
<i>Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.</i>

599
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,889
And what's our motto?

600
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,890
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

601
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,689
Thank you very much.

602
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,389
How come you don't play?

603
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:50,689
<i>Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.</i>

604
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:53,688
<i>Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.</i>

605
00:43:53,788 --> 00:43:55,388
Welcome to Vegas.

606
00:44:05,587 --> 00:44:06,787
No more bets.

607
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,687
<i>All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.</i>

608
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,886
<i>Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?</i>

609
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:14,686
<i>Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.</i>

610
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,986
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

611
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:19,685
Here to double my family's inheritance.

612
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:22,986
I don't know.

613
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,183
<i>$10,000.</i>

614
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,083
<i>Changing $10,000.</i>

615
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,082
Sweet. Too sweet.

616
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,379
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

617
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,979
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

618
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,879
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

619
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:21,879
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

620
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:25,478
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,077
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

622
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:33,478
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

623
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:34,777
Can I split those?

624
00:45:34,878 --> 00:45:37,876
<i>- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.</i>

625
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,676
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

626
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:53,375
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

627
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:02,474
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

628
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:10,974
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

629
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:14,073
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

630
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:15,873
<i>Blackjack.</i>

631
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,067
Monkey! Monkey!

632
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,067
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

633
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,567
<i>All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.</i>

634
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,266
Monkey!

635
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,066
<i>Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!</i>

636
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,366
<i>Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.</i>

637
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:19,966
Monkey! Monkey!

638
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:25,165
<i>All right, all right.</i>

639
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:30,864
<i>Oh, God.</i>

640
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:33,564
I need to quit.

641
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:40,463
<i>Could I color up, please?</i>

642
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,758
Nice undies.

643
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:33,358
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

644
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,257
We split it five ways.

645
00:48:40,556 --> 00:48:42,257
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

646
00:48:42,357 --> 00:48:43,957
<i>Yeah, it was fun.</i>

647
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:45,856
- You were good.
- Really?

648
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,355
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

649
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:53,455
<i>You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.</i>

650
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,755
And you made more money than Fisher.

651
00:48:58,055 --> 00:49:00,555
<i>I was pretty nervous, actually.</i>

652
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:04,653
<i>You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.</i>

653
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:07,954
Not for everyone.

654
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,253
<i>Yeah, it's just simple math.</i>

655
00:49:10,854 --> 00:49:13,753
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

656
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:21,452
Here's the thing I told Micky.

657
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:26,052
<i>You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.</i>

658
00:49:26,152 --> 00:49:28,852
<i>You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.</i>

659
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:33,451
That's what they all say.

660
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,851
<i>No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.</i>

661
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,450
It's just a means to an end for me.

662
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,850
I believe you.

663
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,350
Good.

664
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:58,647
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

665
00:50:00,448 --> 00:50:01,447
Team meeting.

666
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:03,148
Hello?

667
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:04,547
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:06,347
Where's everybody else?

669
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:09,247
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

670
00:50:13,246 --> 00:50:15,346
<i>Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.</i>

671
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:20,146
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

672
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:24,345
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

673
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:29,245
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

674
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:31,745
Where's Kianna?

675
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:33,245
Slots.

676
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:38,743
<i>- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.</i>

677
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:41,743
I've been busy this morning.

678
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,542
<i>All right, guys, let's get something clear.</i>

679
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,942
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

680
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:51,442
<i>This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.</i>

681
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,542
<i>Kianna, slots are for losers.</i>

682
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:55,742
<i>Fisher, peelers are stealers.</i>

683
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,142
Choi?

684
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:01,641
<i>You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens</i>

685
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:05,540
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

686
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,640
<i>But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?</i>

687
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
What?

688
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,140
<i>Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,</i>

689
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,440
but you kept on anyway.

690
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,139
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

691
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,239
<i>In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.</i>

692
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:21,239
<i>Jill, nice disguise last night.</i>

693
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:25,939
<i>And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.</i>

694
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:28,038
Beginner's luck.

695
00:51:28,138 --> 00:51:31,138
<i>Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.</i>

696
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,737
<i>Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.</i>

697
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:35,237
You know what's worse than a loser?

698
00:51:35,337 --> 00:51:38,537
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

699
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,537
Take it up with Ida.

700
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:42,936
Who's Ida?

701
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:45,436
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

702
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,536
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

703
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:16,432
There goes that paycheck.

704
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,332
<i>- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.</i>

705
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,531
How's she doing?

706
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,230
<i>Oh, that doesn't matter, man.</i>

707
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,230
<i>The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.</i>

708
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:40,130
<i>It's all what you do in the moment, baby.</i>

709
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:54,329
Just lost another property.

710
00:52:55,428 --> 00:52:58,828
<i>- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.</i>

711
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,427
That was a 14-year account.

712
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:06,727
<i>- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.</i>

713
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:12,327
<i>Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.</i>

714
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:15,227
<i>Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.</i>

715
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:18,826
<i>By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?</i>

716
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:23,325
<i>There's no smoking in here, you know that.</i>

717
00:53:29,524 --> 00:53:31,024
I appreciate it.

718
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:39,624
<i>End of an era, my friend.</i>

719
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:50,722
Ben. Time for school.

720
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,721
I seem to keep waking up to you.

721
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:58,522
Don't get used to it.

722
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,019
I'm glad you came over this morning.

723
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,119
<i>- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

724
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:28,618
I want you to have this.

725
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:30,518
What's this?

726
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:38,017
That's a lot of money.

727
00:54:38,517 --> 00:54:42,117
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

728
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:46,616
<i>I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.</i>

729
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,715
<i>Ma, I can't take this.</i>

730
00:54:51,216 --> 00:54:53,415
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

731
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:58,314
<i>For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.</i>

732
00:55:04,415 --> 00:55:06,314
<i>Well, you know what? You don't have to.</i>

733
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:09,913
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

734
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:13,113
<i>Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.</i>

735
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:17,512
<i>- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.</i>

736
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:19,813
<i>And actually, I just found out today.</i>

737
00:55:19,913 --> 00:55:23,112
<i>I can't believe it! Oh, my God!</i>

738
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:26,611
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

739
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:34,611
<i>- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

740
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:39,211
<i>So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.</i>

741
00:56:18,306 --> 00:56:20,006
What are you doing?

742
00:56:21,106 --> 00:56:25,005
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

743
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:31,104
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

744
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:33,704
<i>- No. Not really, never.
- No.</i>

745
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:35,805
Right.

746
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,203
All right.

747
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:42,803
<i>So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.</i>

748
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:46,503
<i>Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire</i>

749
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,102
to help my cousin move.

750
00:56:49,202 --> 00:56:51,103
You didn't bring your cell phone?

751
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:53,902
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

752
00:56:54,002 --> 00:56:59,301
<i>No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.</i>

753
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:01,801
<i>Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.</i>

754
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,101
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

755
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:05,500
We almost had a girl there.

756
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,000
- Republik?
- Yes.

757
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,500
Let's do it!

758
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:23,398
She is an eight.

759
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,199
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

760
00:57:28,299 --> 00:57:31,298
<i>Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.</i>

761
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:32,898
That's right.

762
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:37,697
<i>But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.</i>

763
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,796
<i>Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.</i>

764
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:58,195
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

765
00:58:00,095 --> 00:58:02,895
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

766
00:58:07,194 --> 00:58:09,693
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

767
00:58:10,093 --> 00:58:11,193
Hey.

768
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,893
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

769
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,493
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

770
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:21,692
Thank you.

771
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:30,291
Are those your friends over there?

772
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:37,990
<i>No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.</i>

773
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:42,190
Could you just excuse me for one second?

774
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:47,489
<i>Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.</i>

775
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,689
<i>Yeah, we know.</i>

776
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:49,789
<i>Yeah, well, can you not?</i>

777
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:51,689
<i>I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?</i>

778
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:55,389
<i>Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.</i>

779
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:57,189
So how do you know her?

780
00:58:57,288 --> 00:59:00,788
<i>Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?</i>

781
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:02,888
What?

782
00:59:03,488 --> 00:59:06,987
<i>- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.</i>

783
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:10,287
<i>- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.</i>

784
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:13,487
<i>There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.</i>

785
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:15,187
It's getting ridiculous.

786
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:18,886
<i>He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.</i>

787
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:20,385
<i>- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.</i>

788
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:22,486
<i>They let him, and he does.</i>

789
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:26,185
<i>He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.</i>

790
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:29,285
The dealer turns over a 17.

791
00:59:29,384 --> 00:59:31,185
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

792
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:33,584
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

793
00:59:33,784 --> 00:59:36,584
<i>- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.</i>

794
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:40,184
Not a great Christmas that year.

795
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:46,183
<i>So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?</i>

796
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,882
<i>Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.</i>

797
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:53,282
<i>My dad's gone, too.</i>

798
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:10,580
<i>So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,</i>

799
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,080
was that because...

800
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,680
What?

801
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,279
<i>Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?</i>

802
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:24,579
<i>Look, we've had three classes together.</i>

803
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:28,578
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

804
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:30,478
that nobody understood.

805
01:00:31,578 --> 01:00:35,778
<i>You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.</i>

806
01:00:35,878 --> 01:00:40,077
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

807
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:43,277
<i>No, no, not so much...</i>

808
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:46,177
<i>- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.</i>

809
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,776
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

810
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:50,076
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

811
01:00:50,176 --> 01:00:52,776
<i>Yes. Shit, this is my stop.</i>

812
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:55,276
<i>- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.</i>

813
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:58,075
<i>But, really, don't worry about it.</i>

814
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:01,875
<i>I don't know,
it's just'cause we've been drinking, and...</i>

815
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:04,475
<i>It's just we're on a team, we work together.</i>

816
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:07,074
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

817
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:09,673
Okay. Sure. Bye.

818
01:01:29,772 --> 01:01:33,571
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

819
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:37,871
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

820
01:01:38,971 --> 01:01:41,070
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

821
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:46,170
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

822
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:58,369
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

823
01:01:58,469 --> 01:02:00,668
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

824
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:03,468
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

825
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:06,767
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

826
01:02:06,968 --> 01:02:09,567
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

827
01:02:10,067 --> 01:02:11,867
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

828
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:17,367
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

829
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:22,266
<i>In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.</i>

830
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:26,965
<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

831
01:02:27,065 --> 01:02:29,364
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

832
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:32,765
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

833
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:36,064
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

834
01:02:36,164 --> 01:02:39,364
<i>Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,</i>

835
01:02:39,763 --> 01:02:43,364
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

836
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,263
I may not be alone.

837
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:48,963
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

838
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:50,963
There it is.

839
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:54,562
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner!</i>

840
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:00,862
<i>No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.</i>

841
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,962
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

842
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:09,161
<i>It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.</i>

843
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,661
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

844
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:14,060
<i>Yeah, room service.</i>

845
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,660
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

846
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,359
<i>What do you mean,
you don't do room service?</i>

847
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:20,859
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

848
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:35,558
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

849
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:44,457
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

850
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:57,355
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

851
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:00,055
<i>And he was right.</i>

852
01:04:04,055 --> 01:04:06,154
<i>- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.</i>

853
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:07,954
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

854
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:12,054
<i>There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.</i>

855
01:04:13,154 --> 01:04:16,053
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

856
01:04:26,352 --> 01:04:29,452
Clark? I think I got something over here.

857
01:04:30,152 --> 01:04:31,851
Take a look at this.

858
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:36,851
That guy? He's a kid.

859
01:04:36,951 --> 01:04:40,750
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

860
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:43,150
<i>Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.</i>

861
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,950
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

862
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,349
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

863
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:51,750
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

864
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,849
He's not running a progressive system.

865
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:57,149
<i>He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.</i>

866
01:04:57,248 --> 01:04:59,848
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

867
01:04:59,948 --> 01:05:01,148
You...

868
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:06,247
<i>Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,</i>

869
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:08,147
why are you still consulting for us?

870
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:09,748
I've been asking myself the same thing.

871
01:05:09,848 --> 01:05:13,247
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

872
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:16,646
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

873
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:22,646
<i>So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work</i>

874
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:25,845
to that biometric facial recognition software.

875
01:05:27,345 --> 01:05:30,945
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

876
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:36,244
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

877
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:38,245
Here he is.

878
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,643
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

879
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:45,143
So do I.

880
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:54,542
<i>Hey, Fisher.</i>

881
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:56,742
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

882
01:05:56,842 --> 01:05:59,342
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

883
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:02,342
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

884
01:06:11,241 --> 01:06:13,240
- Hey.
- What's going on?

885
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,040
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

886
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,839
<i>- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?</i>

887
01:06:19,939 --> 01:06:21,840
<i>I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.</i>

888
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,039
At least I thought I was.

889
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:26,739
<i>Are you on drugs, Ben?</i>

890
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:28,738
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

891
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:30,839
<i>No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?</i>

892
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:33,637
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

893
01:06:34,238 --> 01:06:37,038
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

894
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:39,938
I don't know.

895
01:06:40,337 --> 01:06:42,637
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

896
01:06:44,737 --> 01:06:46,437
What about Harvard?

897
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:50,536
It'll find a way of working itself out.

898
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:53,836
<i>Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.</i>

899
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:10,234
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

900
01:07:14,434 --> 01:07:18,533
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

901
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:21,332
<i>Here you go, sir.</i>

902
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:23,032
<i>And I liked it.</i>

903
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:25,232
That's for you.

904
01:07:27,432 --> 01:07:31,831
<i>We just made $210,000.</i>

905
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:32,931
Yes.

906
01:07:33,031 --> 01:07:35,531
<i>Now, Ben, this is how we play!</i>

907
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:40,630
<i>And play we did.</i>

908
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,929
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

909
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,629
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

910
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:58,129
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

911
01:07:58,229 --> 01:08:00,829
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

912
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:06,628
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

913
01:08:08,328 --> 01:08:10,827
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

914
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:15,927
<i>No, no!</i>

915
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:23,626
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

916
01:08:24,526 --> 01:08:28,425
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

917
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:26,019
<i>- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.</i>

918
01:09:27,318 --> 01:09:31,218
<i>- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.</i>

919
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,818
<i>What line of work you in, mister?</i>

920
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:38,318
I count things.

921
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,017
My name's Sierra.

922
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:47,816
<i>Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.</i>

923
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:52,616
<i>Would you like a private dance, Salvador?</i>

924
01:09:54,215 --> 01:09:58,115
<i>Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.</i>

925
01:10:00,615 --> 01:10:03,214
<i>$20 a song, 30-song minimum.</i>

926
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:06,715
Sounds expensive.

927
01:10:25,812 --> 01:10:30,211
<i>- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.</i>

928
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:32,811
<i>Jeffrey, you're taking my money.</i>

929
01:10:33,912 --> 01:10:35,911
You are so lucky you're cute.

930
01:10:36,011 --> 01:10:38,711
<i>'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?</i>

931
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:42,411
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

932
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,011
How you doing? You good?

933
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:47,410
<i>I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?</i>

934
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,609
<i>- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.</i>

935
01:10:53,509 --> 01:10:55,409
<i>Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.</i>

936
01:10:55,509 --> 01:10:57,409
<i>Oh, please.</i>

937
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:07,507
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

938
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:09,508
<i>$100,000 going out.</i>

939
01:11:11,907 --> 01:11:13,507
<i>Thank you, Jeffrey.</i>

940
01:11:20,806 --> 01:11:22,807
Cole. Your boy's back.

941
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:28,405
<i>- That's him, right?
- There he is.</i>

942
01:11:28,505 --> 01:11:31,505
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

943
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:41,204
<i>That is a hell of a suit, by the way.</i>

944
01:11:56,802 --> 01:12:01,102
<i>- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.</i>

945
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:09,401
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

946
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:14,201
<i>Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.</i>

947
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,200
<i>We don't use "tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.</i>

948
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,799
<i>Never mind. Terry, rewind it.</i>

949
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:28,199
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

950
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:30,599
She's playing the table minimum.

951
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:32,898
<i>Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.</i>

952
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:36,898
<i>She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.</i>

953
01:12:37,998 --> 01:12:40,998
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

954
01:12:41,098 --> 01:12:44,397
<i>He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.</i>

955
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:45,597
Nice.

956
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:49,797
Show me a computer that can do that.

957
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:56,296
You look familiar.

958
01:12:57,596 --> 01:12:59,395
<i>I know you, don't I?</i>

959
01:13:00,995 --> 01:13:02,795
- I don't think so.
- No?

960
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:07,594
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

961
01:13:09,894 --> 01:13:12,794
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.</i>

962
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,594
<i>Oh, yeah? No.</i>

963
01:13:15,694 --> 01:13:19,293
<i>The other one, the... What's his... The retard.</i>

964
01:13:20,293 --> 01:13:25,592
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

965
01:13:26,492 --> 01:13:28,492
You look just like that.

966
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:39,190
<i>What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,</i>

967
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:41,790
could win so much.

968
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,690
<i>Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,</i>

969
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,489
how did that retard win so much?

970
01:13:49,589 --> 01:13:52,589
<i>- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.</i>

971
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,889
<i>Oh, I didn't mean it.</i>

972
01:14:29,086 --> 01:14:32,285
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

973
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:44,883
<i>- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!</i>

974
01:14:44,983 --> 01:14:46,884
<i>- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!</i>

975
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:50,383
<i>Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!</i>

976
01:14:50,483 --> 01:14:51,883
<i>I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...</i>

977
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,782
This is not the time. Okay?

978
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:56,682
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

979
01:14:56,782 --> 01:14:58,182
Now go home.

980
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:06,581
- What?
- You're off the team.

981
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:07,682
No.

982
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:12,080
<i>- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.</i>

983
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,680
I'm not leaving.

984
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,280
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

985
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:20,280
<i>What are you gonna do about it, huh?</i>

986
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,979
<i>You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.</i>

987
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,178
<i>So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,</i>

988
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:35,378
<i>because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,</i>

989
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,278
don't you?

990
01:15:54,476 --> 01:15:55,475
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

991
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:59,176
<i>Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.</i>

992
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:02,075
<i>That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,</i>

993
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,474
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

994
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,775
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

995
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:10,775
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

996
01:16:10,874 --> 01:16:13,074
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

997
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:15,174
Are you deliberately slow?

998
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:17,573
What about them?

999
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:20,473
What about them?

1000
01:16:20,673 --> 01:16:24,972
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1001
01:16:32,372 --> 01:16:33,772
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1002
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:35,971
<i>- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.</i>

1003
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:39,072
<i>- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.</i>

1004
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,770
<i>I love a parade, don't you?</i>

1005
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:50,769
<i>You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,</i>

1006
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,570
"Genius."

1007
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:24,067
<i>Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.</i>

1008
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:26,066
<i>Thanks, baby, here.</i>

1009
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,666
<i>Oh, no problem. Anytime.</i>

1010
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:30,665
<i>- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.</i>

1011
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:31,766
Watch.

1012
01:17:31,865 --> 01:17:35,565
<i>No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.</i>

1013
01:17:57,762 --> 01:17:59,262
- Hi.
- Hey.

1014
01:18:00,662 --> 01:18:03,062
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1015
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:06,262
<i>That's cool, that's great.</i>

1016
01:18:09,361 --> 01:18:11,061
You wanna see it?

1017
01:19:13,454 --> 01:19:16,053
<i>All right, take care, Bobby. All right?</i>

1018
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:38,051
<i>God, it's cold.</i>

1019
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:40,451
<i>Hey, what time is it?</i>

1020
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:44,550
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1021
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,051
<i>Oh, look. Here he comes.</i>

1022
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,850
<i>Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

1023
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,149
<i>Hey, Ben.</i>

1024
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,250
<i>You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.</i>

1025
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,549
<i>Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.</i>

1026
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:57,949
<i>Yeah, funny.</i>

1027
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:02,949
<i>- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.</i>

1028
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,949
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1029
01:20:06,049 --> 01:20:07,248
than the parameters suggest?

1030
01:20:07,348 --> 01:20:09,348
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1031
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:11,447
Let's fire this mother up.

1032
01:20:11,647 --> 01:20:12,847
Beautiful.

1033
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:22,946
Okay.

1034
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:24,546
Okay.

1035
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:29,645
What's happening?

1036
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:35,545
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1037
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:36,944
No. What?

1038
01:20:37,945 --> 01:20:41,244
<i>- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.</i>

1039
01:20:42,944 --> 01:20:44,844
<i>Yeah, we needed 16K!</i>

1040
01:20:46,344 --> 01:20:50,143
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1041
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:51,843
<i>- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.</i>

1042
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:56,143
<i>No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.</i>

1043
01:20:56,642 --> 01:20:57,942
<i>Damn it, Ben.</i>

1044
01:20:58,042 --> 01:21:01,243
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1045
01:21:01,342 --> 01:21:04,742
<i>And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.</i>

1046
01:21:04,842 --> 01:21:08,341
<i>Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.</i>

1047
01:21:10,941 --> 01:21:12,241
What?

1048
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,340
<i>You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.</i>

1049
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,139
You're gonna what?

1050
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:28,639
<i>No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.</i>

1051
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,339
We've been working on this for over a year.

1052
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,938
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1053
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:42,338
Are you serious?

1054
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:50,037
Fine.

1055
01:21:51,936 --> 01:21:52,936
Fine.

1056
01:21:54,436 --> 01:21:58,636
<i>You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.</i>

1057
01:21:58,736 --> 01:21:59,936
You know why?

1058
01:22:00,036 --> 01:22:04,435
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1059
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:07,435
<i>You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head</i>

1060
01:22:07,535 --> 01:22:09,534
to make yourselves feel important.

1061
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:11,534
You guys are pathetic.

1062
01:22:11,634 --> 01:22:12,734
Thanks.

1063
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,133
<i>Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.</i>

1064
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:25,032
<i>- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.</i>

1065
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:31,632
<i>Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.</i>

1066
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:33,232
Nice to see you.

1067
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:36,032
<i>Anything I can do for you, let me know.</i>

1068
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:54,929
Double down.

1069
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:33,625
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.

1070
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:36,125
Right?

1071
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:42,624
<i>Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!</i>

1072
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:45,524
<i>Honey, we're actually playing a game here.</i>

1073
01:23:46,023 --> 01:23:47,124
Yeah.

1074
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,324
<i>Yeah, so you know what?</i>

1075
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:53,423
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1076
01:23:56,023 --> 01:23:57,922
All right. Let's go.

1077
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,022
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

1078
01:24:05,722 --> 01:24:08,321
I've got the worst headache right now.

1079
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,120
<i>- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.</i>

1080
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,620
<i>- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.</i>

1081
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,819
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1082
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:31,519
Twenty-one.

1083
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:39,917
<i>Pete, you're killing us.</i>

1084
01:24:53,216 --> 01:24:55,217
I guess it's not my night.

1085
01:25:20,113 --> 01:25:22,214
Are you out of your mind?

1086
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:25,613
I don't know what happened.

1087
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:28,513
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1088
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:30,912
<i>Oh, you're sorry.</i>

1089
01:25:31,013 --> 01:25:34,612
<i>Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.</i>

1090
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:39,311
<i>I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!</i>

1091
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:43,511
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1092
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:46,111
<i>Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.</i>

1093
01:25:46,211 --> 01:25:47,611
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1094
01:25:47,711 --> 01:25:49,310
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1095
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,810
<i>Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.</i>

1096
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:56,710
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1097
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:00,509
<i>Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!</i>

1098
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:03,608
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1099
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,009
<i>You are only as good to me
as the money you make,</i>

1100
01:26:06,108 --> 01:26:07,808
<i>and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!</i>

1101
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,708
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1102
01:26:09,808 --> 01:26:12,507
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1103
01:26:12,607 --> 01:26:14,508
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1104
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,507
<i>It doesn't matter, Ben.</i>

1105
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:19,707
<i>You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.</i>

1106
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:23,807
<i>You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!</i>

1107
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,205
<i>Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?</i>

1108
01:26:29,806 --> 01:26:34,505
<i>I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.</i>

1109
01:26:39,205 --> 01:26:41,104
<i>This isn't about me,</i>

1110
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:45,604
you arrogant little infant.

1111
01:26:58,603 --> 01:27:01,203
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1112
01:27:01,302 --> 01:27:05,402
<i>And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.</i>

1113
01:27:05,502 --> 01:27:07,502
And you damn well know it.

1114
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:19,001
I need a drink.

1115
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,299
Anybody else?

1116
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,100
<i>Yeah, well, we don't need him.</i>

1117
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,899
<i>- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.</i>

1118
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,599
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1119
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:35,998
<i>You know, his cut was 50º/º,
and he doesn't even play!</i>

1120
01:27:36,598 --> 01:27:37,698
Why do we need him?

1121
01:27:37,798 --> 01:27:38,898
<i>Hey, you know what I think?</i>

1122
01:27:38,998 --> 01:27:42,398
<i>I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.</i>

1123
01:27:42,497 --> 01:27:43,897
<i>No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.</i>

1124
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:46,198
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1125
01:27:46,297 --> 01:27:48,097
<i>Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?</i>

1126
01:27:48,197 --> 01:27:51,297
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1127
01:27:51,397 --> 01:27:53,397
And then he drove us apart.

1128
01:27:53,597 --> 01:27:56,596
<i>I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.</i>

1129
01:27:57,496 --> 01:28:01,196
<i>Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?</i>

1130
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:04,295
- Kind of.
- Really?

1131
01:28:05,095 --> 01:28:08,395
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1132
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:11,595
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1133
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:15,494
<i>If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.</i>

1134
01:28:16,594 --> 01:28:17,894
All of it.

1135
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:26,292
Okay.

1136
01:28:30,692 --> 01:28:31,692
Yeah.

1137
01:28:32,192 --> 01:28:34,192
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1138
01:28:35,992 --> 01:28:37,192
Choi?

1139
01:28:38,592 --> 01:28:39,792
I'm in.

1140
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,391
Now I need a drink.

1141
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,090
- What are you doing?
- What?

1142
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,189
What are you doing?

1143
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:55,390
<i>Well, we're printing money.</i>

1144
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:58,489
<i>What, you think just'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?</i>

1145
01:28:58,589 --> 01:29:01,389
<i>No, I could do this. I can lead this team.</i>

1146
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:05,088
<i>You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.</i>

1147
01:29:05,489 --> 01:29:07,788
<i>- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

1148
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:10,888
<i>You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be</i>

1149
01:29:10,988 --> 01:29:13,987
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1150
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:20,887
<i>What happened to "$300,000 and I'm out"?</i>

1151
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:24,586
What happened to "a means to an end"?

1152
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:28,286
- How much do you have?
- What?

1153
01:29:28,386 --> 01:29:30,585
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1154
01:29:30,685 --> 01:29:32,985
<i>Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?</i>

1155
01:29:33,085 --> 01:29:35,585
<i>I've got 315 grand, all right?</i>

1156
01:29:35,985 --> 01:29:38,285
Then why are you still here?

1157
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:43,584
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1158
01:29:43,984 --> 01:29:45,884
So does everybody else.

1159
01:29:46,284 --> 01:29:48,984
<i>So come on, Jill. Are you in?</i>

1160
01:29:54,883 --> 01:29:57,582
<i>You are the big player, Ben.</i>

1161
01:29:57,682 --> 01:29:59,082
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1162
01:30:01,482 --> 01:30:03,382
<i>Yeah, can I get a drink?</i>

1163
01:30:31,379 --> 01:30:33,279
<i>Rose, I wanna thank you.</i>

1164
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:36,679
You have been most accommodating.

1165
01:30:37,278 --> 01:30:39,178
<i>All right, that's for you.</i>

1166
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:41,778
<i>Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.</i>

1167
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,377
<i>Hey, how we doing here, people?</i>

1168
01:31:02,676 --> 01:31:06,075
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.</i>

1169
01:31:09,675 --> 01:31:11,875
Just got an interesting call.

1170
01:31:13,974 --> 01:31:17,974
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1171
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:22,373
I don't know about that.

1172
01:31:27,973 --> 01:31:29,473
This is Cole.

1173
01:31:40,172 --> 01:31:42,971
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1174
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:45,171
You're doing good.

1175
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:47,171
You're a real winner.

1176
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,670
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1177
01:31:55,769 --> 01:31:57,970
<i>Now, why don't I believe that?</i>

1178
01:32:00,069 --> 01:32:02,169
<i>Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?</i>

1179
01:32:02,269 --> 01:32:04,868
<i>Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.</i>

1180
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:08,768
<i>Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?</i>

1181
01:32:10,468 --> 01:32:11,868
I'd split them.

1182
01:32:11,968 --> 01:32:16,367
<i>Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.</i>

1183
01:32:23,267 --> 01:32:25,266
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1184
01:32:25,466 --> 01:32:26,866
<i>- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

1185
01:32:26,966 --> 01:32:30,066
<i>Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.</i>

1186
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:31,865
I think we need
to call security or something.

1187
01:32:31,965 --> 01:32:35,565
<i>Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.</i>

1188
01:32:40,165 --> 01:32:42,164
<i>Let's take a walk, huh?</i>

1189
01:32:42,865 --> 01:32:46,664
<i>Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.</i>

1190
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:54,463
It's called Biometrics.

1191
01:32:54,564 --> 01:32:58,762
Biometrics.
It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.

1192
01:33:01,462 --> 01:33:06,662
<i>See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...</i>

1193
01:33:06,762 --> 01:33:08,262
Biometric profile.

1194
01:33:08,362 --> 01:33:10,062
<i>...biometric profile of your face,</i>

1195
01:33:10,162 --> 01:33:13,261
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1196
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:21,561
<i>Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.</i>

1197
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,060
All right.

1198
01:33:31,659 --> 01:33:34,459
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1199
01:33:34,858 --> 01:33:36,258
Smart boy.

1200
01:33:37,758 --> 01:33:39,659
My name is Cole Williams.

1201
01:33:40,258 --> 01:33:43,558
<i>And if I ever see you in this town again,</i>

1202
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:47,657
<i>I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,</i>

1203
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:50,957
and then I will kill you.

1204
01:33:55,556 --> 01:33:59,156
Please. Please just take the money.

1205
01:34:00,455 --> 01:34:01,955
You can take it.

1206
01:34:04,655 --> 01:34:05,955
<i>Tell me,</i>

1207
01:34:06,556 --> 01:34:11,255
<i>how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?</i>

1208
01:34:12,955 --> 01:34:17,554
<i>Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.</i>

1209
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:21,654
<i>I spent years, chased him all over this town.</i>

1210
01:34:22,054 --> 01:34:27,053
<i>Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.</i>

1211
01:34:27,153 --> 01:34:29,153
He was very persistent.

1212
01:34:30,052 --> 01:34:33,352
<i>And then, one September night,</i>

1213
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:36,752
<i>when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,</i>

1214
01:34:37,652 --> 01:34:41,052
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1215
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,452
Can you imagine that?

1216
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,851
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1217
01:34:45,951 --> 01:34:50,550
<i>'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.</i>

1218
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,950
<i>Funny thing, though.</i>

1219
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:57,950
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1220
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:00,249
Never.

1221
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:29,040
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1222
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:33,239
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1223
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:35,639
And was concerned with developing

1224
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:40,538
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1225
01:36:41,938 --> 01:36:43,438
Any questions?

1226
01:36:43,838 --> 01:36:45,938
<i>No? All right, moving on.</i>

1227
01:36:47,038 --> 01:36:50,937
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?

1228
01:36:55,937 --> 01:36:59,736
<i>Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?</i>

1229
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:05,336
<i>They say he used his students
for their brilliance,</i>

1230
01:37:06,436 --> 01:37:10,734
<i>then discredited them
and stole their equations,</i>

1231
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:14,634
stole their hard work.

1232
01:37:17,334 --> 01:37:20,034
<i>Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.</i>

1233
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:24,833
<i>I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?</i>

1234
01:37:24,933 --> 01:37:27,933
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1235
01:37:28,033 --> 01:37:31,332
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1236
01:37:31,432 --> 01:37:33,932
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1237
01:37:35,732 --> 01:37:37,432
<i>Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.</i>

1238
01:37:37,532 --> 01:37:41,531
<i>They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.</i>

1239
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:43,631
<i>And, you know, it's a real shame,</i>

1240
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:47,930
<i>because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,</i>

1241
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,731
<i>this was the dispute,</i>

1242
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:56,830
<i>if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,</i>

1243
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:00,630
<i>I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,</i>

1244
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:03,729
and they could have
done great things together.

1245
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:08,229
<i>But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.</i>

1246
01:38:09,928 --> 01:38:11,528
You should get that eye looked at.

1247
01:38:48,724 --> 01:38:50,124
You okay?

1248
01:38:53,124 --> 01:38:54,724
Everything's gone.

1249
01:38:56,523 --> 01:38:59,123
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1250
01:38:59,223 --> 01:39:03,523
<i>He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.</i>

1251
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,422
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.</i>

1252
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:10,022
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1253
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:12,821
Are you insane?

1254
01:39:13,421 --> 01:39:16,921
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1255
01:39:17,021 --> 01:39:21,020
<i>Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!</i>

1256
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:23,220
<i>Look, please...</i>

1257
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:27,320
<i>I don't want to lose you, too.</i>

1258
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,919
<i>Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.</i>

1259
01:39:34,618 --> 01:39:38,918
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1260
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:40,919
I know.

1261
01:39:41,818 --> 01:39:43,018
I know.

1262
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:53,117
<i>You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.</i>

1263
01:39:54,917 --> 01:39:56,317
I'm sorry.

1264
01:39:59,216 --> 01:40:03,716
<i>In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.</i>

1265
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,516
<i>Look, you know me.</i>

1266
01:40:07,215 --> 01:40:09,116
You know what I'm like.

1267
01:40:10,915 --> 01:40:12,415
You know me.

1268
01:40:18,814 --> 01:40:20,714
I need you to trust me.

1269
01:40:22,014 --> 01:40:25,413
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1270
01:40:25,513 --> 01:40:31,813
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1271
01:41:09,109 --> 01:41:12,109
That's it. That's the story.

1272
01:41:14,608 --> 01:41:16,808
Jill Taylor. Really?

1273
01:41:17,707 --> 01:41:21,108
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.</i>

1274
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:25,506
<i>Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.</i>

1275
01:41:25,607 --> 01:41:30,307
<i>Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.</i>

1276
01:41:34,706 --> 01:41:36,706
<i>I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.</i>

1277
01:41:36,805 --> 01:41:40,705
<i>You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.</i>

1278
01:41:41,605 --> 01:41:44,704
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1279
01:41:46,505 --> 01:41:51,004
<i>And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.</i>

1280
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:54,903
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1281
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:59,503
So let me get this straight.

1282
01:42:00,203 --> 01:42:03,403
<i>Money, girls,</i>

1283
01:42:04,503 --> 01:42:08,901
<i>high-roller suites, clubs vEgas.</i>

1284
01:42:10,102 --> 01:42:15,202
<i>Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.</i>

1285
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:20,101
So we cool?

1286
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:23,300
<i>Yeah, we're cool.</i>

1287
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,500
<i>But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.</i>

1288
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,900
All right.

1289
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,299
<i>So, what are you gonna do now?</i>

1290
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:23,894
<i>What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.</i>

1291
01:43:23,994 --> 01:43:26,393
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1292
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:28,893
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1293
01:43:35,092 --> 01:43:36,093
What?

1294
01:43:36,193 --> 01:43:40,291
<i>Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.</i>

1295
01:43:42,192 --> 01:43:43,692
I want back in.

1296
01:43:44,691 --> 01:43:48,491
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1297
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:53,590
<i>All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very very good.</i>

1298
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:57,890
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1299
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:01,690
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1300
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:06,189
<i>Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.</i>

1301
01:44:07,188 --> 01:44:09,189
<i>With this facial recognition software,</i>

1302
01:44:09,289 --> 01:44:12,488
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1303
01:44:12,988 --> 01:44:16,688
<i>Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.</i>

1304
01:44:16,788 --> 01:44:21,887
<i>Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.</i>

1305
01:44:23,387 --> 01:44:28,687
<i>Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.</i>

1306
01:44:30,087 --> 01:44:33,486
<i>You know, two big players playing big?</i>

1307
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:37,986
<i>Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.</i>

1308
01:44:42,385 --> 01:44:43,985
But Fisher's out.

1309
01:44:44,885 --> 01:44:49,285
<i>No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?</i>

1310
01:44:52,484 --> 01:44:55,884
<i>And if we do well, if we do really well,</i>

1311
01:44:56,683 --> 01:44:59,784
<i>then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,</i>

1312
01:45:00,783 --> 01:45:03,383
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1313
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:08,783
<i>Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?</i>

1314
01:45:10,782 --> 01:45:13,482
Just went back to the head of the class.

1315
01:45:14,782 --> 01:45:16,581
I gotta go be social.

1316
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,281
<i>All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.</i>

1317
01:45:25,381 --> 01:45:28,280
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1318
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:31,880
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1319
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,579
<i>Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.</i>

1320
01:45:36,779 --> 01:45:38,779
And we can't mess around.

1321
01:45:39,179 --> 01:45:40,579
<i>I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.</i>

1322
01:45:40,779 --> 01:45:42,678
<i>Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town</i>

1323
01:45:42,778 --> 01:45:46,177
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1324
01:45:47,078 --> 01:45:50,978
<i>But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,</i>

1325
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:54,177
and tonight we forget about the past.

1326
01:45:54,377 --> 01:45:56,277
We just focus on the future.

1327
01:45:56,377 --> 01:45:59,676
Right. This is our last time.

1328
01:46:00,077 --> 01:46:03,076
<i>Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.</i>

1329
01:46:03,176 --> 01:46:05,575
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1330
01:46:08,976 --> 01:46:10,875
Let's go make a killing.

1331
01:46:11,475 --> 01:46:12,775
All right.

1332
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:37,373
Let's see what we can do with this.

1333
01:46:46,472 --> 01:46:50,570
<i>Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?</i>

1334
01:46:52,271 --> 01:46:54,370
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1335
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:58,970
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1336
01:47:10,569 --> 01:47:12,768
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.</i>

1337
01:47:12,868 --> 01:47:16,268
<i>Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.</i>

1338
01:47:17,068 --> 01:47:20,367
<i>And, Jim, I might even love you.</i>

1339
01:47:30,267 --> 01:47:32,466
<i>Hey, you mind if I sit down?</i>

1340
01:47:46,465 --> 01:47:47,464
What's your name?

1341
01:47:47,564 --> 01:47:50,765
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1342
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,064
<i>There you go, give me it all.</i>

1343
01:48:03,163 --> 01:48:04,363
There you go.

1344
01:48:07,062 --> 01:48:08,862
Thank you. Thank you.

1345
01:48:13,562 --> 01:48:15,861
<i>Such a shame, Shane!</i>

1346
01:48:16,761 --> 01:48:18,861
<i>Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?</i>

1347
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:23,260
<i>- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.</i>

1348
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,461
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

1349
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:40,359
<i>What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?</i>

1350
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:43,159
<i>This never happens, this never happens.</i>

1351
01:48:56,157 --> 01:48:57,956
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1352
01:48:58,057 --> 01:48:59,657
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1353
01:48:59,757 --> 01:49:00,656
- Split tens!
- Again!

1354
01:49:00,657 --> 01:49:01,556
- Split tens!
- Again!

1355
01:49:24,554 --> 01:49:27,453
<i>- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.</i>

1356
01:49:28,753 --> 01:49:30,553
<i>Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.</i>

1357
01:49:30,653 --> 01:49:33,553
<i>Come on, just give me the chips!</i>

1358
01:49:33,653 --> 01:49:37,852
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1359
01:49:37,952 --> 01:49:40,452
<i>- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.</i>

1360
01:49:40,652 --> 01:49:43,652
<i>Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.</i>

1361
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:50,551
This way!

1362
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,850
Go.

1363
01:50:17,148 --> 01:50:18,548
This way!

1364
01:50:24,447 --> 01:50:26,446
<i>Come on, Jill. Come on!</i>

1365
01:50:36,346 --> 01:50:38,946
<i>Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.</i>

1366
01:50:39,046 --> 01:50:41,945
<i>Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.</i>

1367
01:50:48,045 --> 01:50:49,544
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

1368
01:51:00,543 --> 01:51:02,243
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

1369
01:51:05,342 --> 01:51:06,842
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

1370
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:12,342
Come on.

1371
01:51:13,442 --> 01:51:15,042
<i>Go, go, this way.</i>

1372
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,840
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

1373
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,439
<i>Go, go, go, go! Airport!</i>

1374
01:51:58,037 --> 01:51:59,637
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1375
01:52:04,736 --> 01:52:05,936
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1376
01:52:07,036 --> 01:52:09,335
But I think I wanna see him now.

1377
01:52:10,436 --> 01:52:12,836
And I want you to make that happen.

1378
01:52:17,134 --> 01:52:19,534
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1379
01:52:22,634 --> 01:52:24,034
<i>Come on, kid.</i>

1380
01:52:25,834 --> 01:52:29,634
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1381
01:52:30,633 --> 01:52:32,633
But I will give you one night.

1382
01:52:32,733 --> 01:52:35,733
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1383
01:52:36,632 --> 01:52:40,432
<i>You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.</i>

1384
01:52:43,532 --> 01:52:44,732
Listen.

1385
01:52:46,232 --> 01:52:47,732
My name's Cole.

1386
01:52:49,331 --> 01:52:50,831
Cole Williams.

1387
01:52:52,731 --> 01:52:55,131
<i>You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.</i>

1388
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:57,430
I'll take care of the rest.

1389
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:02,930
Son of a bitch.

1390
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:47,325
Who the hell are you?

1391
01:54:10,222 --> 01:54:13,422
Ben. Good job.

1392
01:54:14,422 --> 01:54:19,521
<i>You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?</i>

1393
01:54:19,721 --> 01:54:21,821
It's gonna work out for you.

1394
01:54:23,421 --> 01:54:24,921
So that's it?

1395
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:29,120
- That's it.
- All right.

1396
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,820
<i>Oh, Dr. Campbell?</i>

1397
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:36,119
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1398
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:38,419
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1399
01:54:38,519 --> 01:54:42,418
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1400
01:54:43,618 --> 01:54:45,919
I'm looking at some retirement.

1401
01:54:47,818 --> 01:54:49,218
Leave the bag.

1402
01:54:51,317 --> 01:54:53,618
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

1403
01:54:53,718 --> 01:54:58,217
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1404
01:54:58,317 --> 01:55:03,316
<i>I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,</i>

1405
01:55:03,416 --> 01:55:05,116
'cause you're smart.

1406
01:55:06,716 --> 01:55:11,216
<i>So, you're gonna leave the bag.</i>

1407
01:55:16,315 --> 01:55:20,914
<i>Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.</i>

1408
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:31,513
I knew you were smart.

1409
01:55:50,411 --> 01:55:53,110
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1410
01:55:53,211 --> 01:55:55,311
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1411
01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:58,910
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1412
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:01,510
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1413
01:56:03,409 --> 01:56:04,509
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1414
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:08,110
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1415
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:11,809
<i>"Always account for variable change."</i>

1416
01:56:13,608 --> 01:56:15,208
<i>Hello, Micky.</i>

1417
01:56:16,908 --> 01:56:18,708
<i>Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.</i>

1418
01:56:18,808 --> 01:56:20,808
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1419
01:56:21,008 --> 01:56:24,007
<i>I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.</i>

1420
01:56:29,807 --> 01:56:32,607
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1421
01:56:33,006 --> 01:56:37,106
<i>He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.</i>

1422
01:56:45,905 --> 01:56:48,005
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1423
01:56:48,705 --> 01:56:53,604
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1424
01:57:19,401 --> 01:57:22,001
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1425
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,100
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1426
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,400
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1427
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:36,499
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1428
01:57:39,799 --> 01:57:42,599
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1429
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:46,798
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1430
01:58:03,296 --> 01:58:06,597
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1431
01:58:06,996 --> 01:58:09,195
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1432
01:58:09,395 --> 01:58:12,395
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1433
01:58:14,595 --> 01:58:18,095
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1434
01:58:19,195 --> 01:58:21,695
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1435
01:58:22,694 --> 01:58:23,794
Twice.

1436
01:58:25,094 --> 01:58:29,194
<i>How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?</i>

1437
01:58:30,393 --> 01:58:32,893
Did I jump off the page?
