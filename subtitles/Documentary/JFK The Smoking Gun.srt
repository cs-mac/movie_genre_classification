1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,900
Right, let's sort the buyers from the spyers,
the needy from the greedy

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Because if you can't see value here today,

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
You see these goods?
You've never seen daylight, moonlight,

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,000
Israelites,
Fanny by the gaslight.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,300
Take a bag, come on, take a bag.
I took a bag home last night -

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
it cost me a lot more than ten pound,
I can tell you.

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,800
Anyone like jewellery?
Look at that one there.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Hand-made in ltaly,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,300
It's as long as my arm,
I wish it was as long as something else.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,300
Don't think 'cos these boxes
are sealed up, they're empty.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,700
The only man who sells empty
boxes is the undertaker.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,000
And by the look of some of you lot here today
I’d make more money with my measuring tape.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,800
Here, one price, ten pound.

16
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,000
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,400
That's a bargain. I'll take one.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,400
Squeeze in if you can. Left leg,
right leg, your body will follow.
They call it walking.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,900
Do you want one as well darlin’?
You do, that’s it, they're waking up.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,400
Treat the wife -
treat somebody else's wife.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,600
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,700
Hold on, you want one as well?
OK, darlin', show me a bit of life, then.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,000
It's no good standing out there
like one o'clock half struck.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,800
My own you’d better buy'em,
these are not stolen -

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,800
they just haven’t been paid for, and we
can’t get them again,
they’ve changed the bloody locks

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,300
Here, one for you. No good coming back
later when I've sold out.
- Nice bit of stuff.

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,800
- "Too late, too late "

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
will be the cry when the man with
the bargains has passed you by.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
If you've got no money on you now,

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100
you'll crying tears as big
as October cabbages.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Bacon, cozzers!

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
# So I said I'm on the roam
So I need a car

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,900
# And I know
that I'm getting alive

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,100
# And I say I got faith
in a season ##

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
'Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
'But his real talent
lies in cards -

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
'and gambling with cards.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,300
'Bacon could see that his days

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,200
'of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered.'

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,700
'lt's time to move on
and he knows it.'

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,700
What you talking about?
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,600
Yeah, yeah, 'course you are. All right ?

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,300
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure.
Tom, what have you been eatin'?
- I've been tellin' him...

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
- Enough, already !

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,900
You two, join me in my office.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
So how much is it then, Tom?

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,300
You know how much is, Nick.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
- And that includes the amp, yeah?
- No.

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
That does not include the amp.

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Shit, Tom. I thought
it included the amp.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, it doesn't. I'll throw in one
of these telephones if you like,

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
but it does not include the amp.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Very nice.

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
I hope it includes the speakers.

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,300
It doesn't include the speakers
it doesn't include the amp.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
And it's not supposed to include me getting
the hump with your stupid questions.

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,400
Now you want it, Nick, you buy it.

58
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
What else do I get with it?

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,400
You get a gold-plated Rolls Royce,
as long as you pay for it.

60
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Seems... well, this seems
to be a waste of my time.

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
That is 900 nicker in any shop
you're lucky enough to find one in

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
and you're complaining
about 200?

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
What school of finance
did you study?

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
It's a deal, it's a steal.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,100
It's the sale
of the fucking century.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,600
In fact, fucking, Nick, I think
I'll keep it.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
All right, all right, keep your alans on.

69
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Here's a ton.

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,100
Jesus Christ!

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,600
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,000
and you're haggling over 100 pound.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
What d'you do when you're
not buying stereos, Nick,

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,300
finance revolutions?

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,800
£100 is still £100.

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,300
Not when the price is £200, it's not.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,500
And certainly not when you've got
Liberia's deficit in your sky rocket.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,700
Tighter than a duck's butt you are!

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,700
Now come on, let me feel
the fibre of your fabric.

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,900
'The skinny one is Tom.'

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,300
'And he's the entrepreneur
of the bunch.'

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
'He's got a couple of
dirty little fingers'

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
'in a couple of dirty little pies.'

84
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
'Nick, here, however,
has made it his business'

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,800
'to have all 20 fat
little fingers and toes'

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,100
'in every dirty, bent
and stolen pie in London.'

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
'Between the two of them, there ain't
much you can't get hold of.'

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
That's my 25 grand.

89
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,900
It's all there, it took me a long time
to earn that, so you treat it with respect.

90
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,300
What about the chef?

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
What've you come as?

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,100
Cupid, stupid.

93
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,500
That's the last time I'm getting anymore
fruit off of you, Tom.

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
You call that fresh ? There was more small
hairy armoured things in your fruit than it was fruit.

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,300
You should open a butchers,
not a grocers.

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Well if you will order stuff
from Kathmandu,

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,100
don't be surprised if it picks up
a few tourists on route.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Anyway, enough about that.
Where's the money?

99
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,300
Oi! Keep your fingers
out of my soup!

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
'Soap is called Soap

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,500
'because he likes to keep his hands
clean of any unlawful behaviour.'

102
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
'He's proud of his job
and even more proud that it's legal.'

103
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,600
'He represents the more
sensible side of the four.'

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
Are you sure you can afford 25?

105
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
It depends on
how you look at it.

106
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,300
I can afford it as long as I see it again,
if that's what you mean.

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Got the rest from
the fat man and Bacon?

108
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
Fat man, Bacon
and myself.

109
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Looks like it's time
to make that call to Harry.

110
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,800
Who's this fat man, then, ey ?

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Ey ?

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
D'you want a sandwich, Bacon?

113
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,800
'lt's not easy to take
a seat at this card table.'

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,900
'The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards'

115
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
'and there's no shortage
of punters.'

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
'The man who decides whether
you can play or not is this man -'

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,500
'Harry, or as some,
including himself like to call him,

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,200
'Hatchet Harry.'

119
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,200
You got it all?

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
100 grand.

121
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Well, If you got it, you got it.
Now, if you don't mind...

122
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,700
- What's this Eddie like then?
- He's a fucking thief!

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,300
'Harry has a colleague,
a monster of a man,'

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,700
'Barry the Baptist.'

125
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,700
'The Baptist got his name
by drowning people for Hatchet.'

126
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,800
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- Yeah, I'll pay !

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- I'll pay, yeah! Yes, I'll pay !

128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
'Barry makes sure

129
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,600
'the administrative side of the
business runs harmoniously.'

130
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
The boy's got a rare ability.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
He seems to make cards
transparent. He's got...

132
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,500
All right, all right,
so we can say he's good.

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,900
Oh no, he's better than good.
He's a fucking liability.

134
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Yeah, hold on, what
do you think of these?

135
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,000
- We're selling hundreds.
- Very nice, Harry.

136
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
What's it for?

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, don't play innocent with me,
Bazza. Spanking!

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
There's 25 from me,
Tom, Soap and yourself.

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,300
It's a 100 grand to the pound. So why the fuck
are you counting it?

140
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,200
Because I like to.

141
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,200
So a reasonable return should be
in the reason of 120 grand.

142
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
As for 25 grand invested,
going on previous experience.

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,500
Going on optimism.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Whatever it's going on - it should be enough
to send you on a cooking course.

145
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,100
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat -

146
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,500
and look as though you
should be, but you're not.

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Fat! Who you calling...
Jesus!

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
It's good in here, innit?
Handy for the tube,

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
great electrics - I can
see why you moved in.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't knock it, it's "CHEEP",
like the budgie.

151
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,400
And nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

152
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
- Anti-social to say the least.
- What d'you mean?

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,900
He means they're
thieving bastards.

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,000
I mean when they're not picking
peanuts out of poop,

155
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their own earned drugs.

156
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,700
Ssh. Not exactly thick,
these walls.

157
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

158
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,100
Is that it?

159
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,300
How many times must
I tell you, Plank?

160
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,900
You'll find a job worth doing, you'll
find your share improving.

161
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,700
Have you got a problem
with that?

162
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,200
# Police and thieves
in the street

163
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,200
# Fighting the nation
with their... ##

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,200
You know, Charles, this gear
is getting heavier.

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,500
I've a strong suspicion we should've
been rocket scientists or...

166
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Nobel Peace Prize winners...
something....

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Peace Prize?

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Be lucky to find your penis for a piss
if you keep smoking.

169
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
Who the hell's that?

170
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,000
All right, Willie?

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,700
Does it look like I am all right ?
Take this.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,900
I'm in danger of breaking
sweat at any second.

173
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,900
Charles,
why've we got that cage?

174
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,900
Security.

175
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,900
That's right.
That's right. Security.

176
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
So what's the point in having it
if we're not gonna fucking use it?

177
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Well, I would've used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

178
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,700
- And Willie lives here.
- Yes, Charles.

179
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,500
But you didn't know it was Willie
until you opened the door, did you?

180
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Chill, Winston. It's me.

181
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,200
Charlie knows it's me,
what's the problem?

182
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,200
The problem is, Willie,
that Charles and yourself

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times.

184
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,400
So do as I say and keep
the fucking cage LOCKED!

185
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
- What is that?
- That's Gloria.

186
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Yes, I know that's Gloria.
What's THAT?

187
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Err...fertiliser.

188
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,000
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter.

189
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
And you come back with
a semi-conscious Gloria

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
and a bag of fertiliser ?

191
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,900
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

192
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
We need fertiliser, Winston.

193
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,600
We also need a money counter.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
This money's gotta
be out by Thursday.

195
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm buggered
if I'm gonna count it.

196
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,600
Oh, and, if you do have to buy
sodding fertiliser,

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,300
could you just be
a little more subtle?

198
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
What do you mean?

199
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,100
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

200
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah.

201
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,600
And you're carrying a wasted
girl and a bag of fertiliser.

202
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,300
You don't look your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

203
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,900
That's what I mean, Willie.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,900
# "The Boss" #
by James Brown

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,300
# Paid the cost to be the boss

206
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,300
# Paid the cost to be the boss

207
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,000
# I paid the cost
to be the boss ##

208
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,400
- How long's he been in there, son ?
- About...20 minutes.

209
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,900
- Is he on his own?
- Yeah, just carrying a bag.

210
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's pay him a little visit then,
shall we?

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
'Big Chris settles debts
for Harry.'

212
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,300
'The only thing he cares
more about than an unsettled debts'

213
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,000
'is his son and heir,
Little Chris.'

214
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,600
# Look at me

215
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
# Know what you see

216
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
# See a bad mother ##

217
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,100
This is one of them...
high-powered jobs, innit?

218
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Aaagh!

219
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,800
I've got some bad news
for you, John.

220
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,500
What the fuck!

221
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Mind your language
in front of the boy.

222
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Jesus Christ!

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,800
That includes blasphemy as well.
Now tell me, John,

224
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,900
how can you be concentratin'
on improving this lovely tan -

225
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,600
and it is a lovely tan by the way-

226
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
when you've got more pressing
priorities at hand?

227
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Tell Harry...l mean Mr Harry,

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
I've been busy,
I'm nearly there.

229
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,600
Check his locker, son.

230
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:11,300
I don't suppose there's any chance of you
lifting this sunbeam up, Chris, isn't it ?

231
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,500
He's not poor! He's got over a monkey,
and that's just in his wallet!

232
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,200
Fuckin' hell, John, you always walk round
with that in your pocket?

233
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,700
Oi! Use language like that again, sun,
you'll wish you hadn't!

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,300
Sorry, Dad.

235
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

236
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,400
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight, John.

237
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,100
You owe what you owe.

238
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,000
And by the time this tan's faded
you wanna have paid.

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,900
- You never would've paid.
- Who would pay for shit?

240
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Exactly. I mean we just had to...

241
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,300
What the hell
are you doing here?

242
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,300
What's up?

243
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,900
Let me guess,
my foot in your arse.

244
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Game o'cards - Hatchet Harry?

245
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,200
You're supposed to be
getting your rest in, boy.

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,500
You playing cards
tonight, son?

247
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
With Harry?

248
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,200
Don't be silly, Dad. I wouldn't
have anything to do with that.

249
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,300
Where did
he get a hundred grand?

250
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,000
He's got adhesive mates -
I mean they're Iike brothers.

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,900
They've tossed up
between 'em.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
And JD is his dad,
and owns the whole property?

253
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
No mortgage, no debts.

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,400
Lock, stock - the fucking lot.

255
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Don't you worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

256
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,400
Good. You can get this
under contol now.

257
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,900
It seems that Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money.

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
and these little beauties
are up for auction.

259
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,300
But I'm not paying a quarter
of a million quid for 'em.

260
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,500
If you know what I mean,
Barry.

261
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,000
Make sure we get everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

262
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,800
I don't want to know who you use,

263
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,100
as long as they're not
complete muppets.

264
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
And don't tell 'em
what they're worth, Barry.

265
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,100
# "Spooky" #

# ln the cool of the evening

267
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,400
# When everything
is getting kinda groovy #

268
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,100
Right, where was we?

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,100
Shotguns. What, like guns that fire shots?

270
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Oh, you must be the brains, then.

271
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
That's right,
guns that fire shots.

272
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,100
Make sure you bring everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

273
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,100
There'll be a load of old guns.
That's all I want.

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Everything else outside the cabinet,
you can keep, it's yours.

275
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Oh, thank you very much.

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,700
There'd better
be something there for us.

277
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,700
It's a fucking
stately home,

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
of course there'll
be something there.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,500
- Like what?
- Like fucking antiques.

280
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,600
Antiques! What the fuck
do we know about antiques?

281
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,800
- We rob post offices.
- We steal cars.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

283
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,200
If it looks old,
it's worth money - simple.

284
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,100
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

285
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,100
So who's the guv?
Who are we doing this for?

286
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,800
You're doing it for me -
is all you need to know.

287
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,300
You know
because you need to know.

288
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,000
I see. One of those on a
"need to know basis" things, is it ?

289
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,400
Like one of those
James Bond films.

290
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Careful, remember who's giving
you this job.

291
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,000
Right, I'm off.
Call me when you're done.

292
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Ta-ra.

293
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,400
Fucking northern monkeys.

294
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I hate these fucking
southern fairies.

295

'Ed has been playing cards
since he could lift 'em up.'

296
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,800
'And he soon discovered
that he had a big advantage.'

297
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,400
'lt's not that he's good with cards,'

298
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
'or even good at counting them.'

299

'lt's that he's good
with reading people's reactions'

300

'no matter how subtle.'

301

'And everybody has reactions.'

302
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
'Especially when
it comes to money.'

303
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,500
# Love is kind of crazy

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
# With a spooky
little boy like you ##

305
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
- Invitations.
- Invitations?

306
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, invitations, you know, four pretty
white pieces of paper with your names on.

307
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
We got 100,000 bits of paper
with the Queen's head on.

308
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,300
Will that do?

309
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,800
Just you. The others, they can wait
next door in Samoan Jo's.

310
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Samoan Jo's?
You mean the pub? Hold on...

311
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,500
Hold on to your fuckin' tongue
and I'll hold on to my patience, OK, sonny ?

312
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,400
No one in here tonight but card players
and I do mean: no one.

313
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Evening, Fraser. Don, Phil.

314
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,300
It's a bit dramatic, innit?

315
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,100
Is it supposed to be symbolic?

316
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Apparently it's for security.

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah? I'd have brought my gloves
if I'd have known.

318
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,200
You must be Eddy, JD's son.

319
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,600
You must be Harry.
Sorry, didn't know your father.

320
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,100
Never mind, son, you just might meet him
if you carry on like that.

321
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,300
Evening, Tanya. Been a while.

322
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,000
All right, Ed.

323
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,500
Right, we call each other Kenny,
OK, Gary?

324
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
All right, Kenny.

325
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
You gonna put your stocking on, or what?

326
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,500
I spent 120 quid on my hair -

327
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,100
If you think I'm pulling a stocking over,
you're very much mistaken.

328
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,200
You're gonna have to put something on.

329
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,800
This is three card brag, gentlemen.

330
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,700
That means three 3s are the highest,
then three aces,

331
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,300
then running down accordingly.

332
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Then it's a running flush,
a run, a flush and then a pair.

333
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,500
An open man can't
see a blind man.

334
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,900
And it will cost twice the ante
to see your opponent.

335
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Now don't fuck around, fellas.

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,100
You know the rules.
And you know I won't stand for it.

337
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
What are you doing?
Put that back.

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
We're here to rob the guns.

339
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Put it back - it's crap anyway.

340
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
Come on.

341
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,400
What sort of pub is this here ?

342
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,200
It's a Samoan pub.

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
What's that?

344
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a cocktail -
you asked for a cocktail.

345
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
No, I asked you to give me
a refreshing drink.

346
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,300
I wasn't expecting
a fucking rainforest.

347
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,100
You could fall in love
with an orangutang in that.

348
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,600
You want a pint, go to the pub.

349
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
I thought this was a pub.

350
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,900
It's a Samoan pub.

351
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,900
Then whatever it is, can you get your man
to turn the TV down?

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,900
You can ask him if you like.
If I was you I'd leave him well alone.

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,300
Yeah. Get rid of that.
Bring us a Diet Coke.

354
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,800
'Scuse me, can you
turn that TV down?

355
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
No.

356
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,500
Oooh!

357
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,100
Whoa, whoa, Kenny.

358
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,900
What are you doing?

359
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,200
I am trying to find out
where they keep their money!

360
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,400
You twat. Can't you see
these people have got no money.

361
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,600
They can't even afford
new furniture.

362
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,100
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you ?

363
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,500
Every time we do a job,
you have to go burn people's feet.

364
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
What's wrong with you?

365
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,200
You wanna be more careful, old fella.

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,700
You very nearly took my man's
head clean off with that.

367
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,900
You all right, Kenny?

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
Kenny?

369
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Ten grand, blind.

370
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
Twenty grand, open.

371
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Deep end, eh?

372
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Fold.

373
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,000
Gotcha!

374
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Twenty grand, open.

375
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,700
I fold.

376
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't go spending that
all at once, boy.

377
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Bloody 'ell!

378
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
What?

379
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,200
I thought you said there'd
be no staff, Barry.

380
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,100
Did you get those guns?

381
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,200
You wanna see
what they did to poor Gary!

382
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
Gary, Gary.

383
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,800
I said, did you get those guns?

384
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,800
Yes, we got them!

385
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,000
Good. I'll speak to you later.

386
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,800
Gary, if you can hear me,

387
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,500
get back in the car now, mate, it's OK.

388
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,100
Barry... Barry!

389
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,100
Fucking, sodding,
shandy-drinking bastard!

390
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
Gary !

391
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,700
# "Liar Liar" #
by The Castaways

392
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,600
# Liar liar, pants on fire

393
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,500
# Your nose is longer
than a telephone wire

394

# Ask me, baby, why I'm sad

395

Know you've been bad

396

# Don't tell me different
I know it's a lie

397
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,600
# Come to me, honey
See how I cry

398
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,300
# Why must you hurt me?
Do what you do?

399
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,600
# Listen here, girl
Can't you see I love you?

400
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,700
# Make a little effort
Try to be true

401
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,000
# I will be happy
Not so blue

402
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,200

# Your nose is longer

404
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
# You keep on
telling me those lies

405
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
# Still going out
with other guys ##

406
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,200
Give me my money!

407
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Give me back my money!
You fucking slags!

408
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,400
Give me my money !

409
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
Give me back my money!

410
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
Give it back!

411
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Wankers! Wankers!

412
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,300
Come on, you. Not now, please.

413
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Not now, oh you fucking bastard!

414
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,700
Fuck...you bastard.

415
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,700
Oh, my good God!

416
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
We'll take you to the cleaners!

417
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Twenty grand open.

418
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
Thirty thousand.

419
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
Back to you already, Eddie.

420
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,400
Fifty grand.

421
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Eighty grand.

422
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
One hundred grand.

423
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,600
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Look, fellas, I know...

424
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
I know you're not in,

425
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,800
which means no one cares
what you know.

426
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,200
Two hundred and fifty.

427
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
That's quite a raise.

428
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,200
That's one hundred and fifty
on my one hundred.

429
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah, and is there anything else
you want to say?

430
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,500
As you know, this puts us
in an awkward position.

431
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,800
I don't have enough
to continue.

432
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,800
We will have to see both your cards
if no one loans Eddie the money to continue.

433
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
It's a loan
or we see both your cards.

434
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I will.

435
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,200
You will what?

436
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,300
I will loan you the money.

437
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
No, I think I'd rather
just turn 'em over.

438
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,100
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

439
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
I wanna keep going.

440
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I'm also offering you the money.

441
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,100
So we don't have to turn 'em over
because you can borrow.

442
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,700
I need two hundred
and fifty grand.

443
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,500
No, you need five hundred
grand to see me.

444
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,000
That's if I wanna see you.

445
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,500
Well, you're gonna have a problem
carrying on, ain't ya?

446
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll see you.

447
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,900
OK, before I loan you this,
I expect -

448
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
- if you lose, of course -

449
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,800
my money back within a week.

450
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

451
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Is that it?

452
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,800
Now let's see his fucking cards.

453
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,500
# "l Wanna Be Your Dog" #
by The Stooges

454
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,100
# So messed up I want you here

455
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,000
# ln my room I want you here

456
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,100
# Now we're gonna be
face to face

457
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,800
# And I'll lay right down
in my favourite place

458
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,400
# And now I wanna be your dog

459
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,200
# And now I wanna be your dog

460
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,700
# And now I wanna be your dog #

461
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,800
# Well, come on! ##

462
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

463
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,900
I know your friends

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,600
are responsible
for most of the cash...

465
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,700
so I'm gonna give you
one week to find it.

466
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,500
Otherwise I will take a finger

467
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
of each of you
and your friends' hands

468
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,000
for every day that passes
without payment.

469
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
And then when you've
run out of digits -

470
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,100
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

471
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,900
All right, my son?

472
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,100
# "Why Did You Do lt?" #
by Stretch

473
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,000
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

474
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,600
# The damage is much deeper
than you'll ever see

475
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,500
# Hit me like a hammer
to my head ##

476
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,300
This doesn't look good.

477
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,900
'He then proceeded to explain the unfortunate
position they were in.'

478
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,300
'Harry was going to start sizing up
all their fingers in a week.

479
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,900
'Because he knew there was no way Ed
could settle that debt on his own.'

480
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
'Harry saw it
as their money on the table,'

481
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,500
'so it was also their debt
off the table.'

482
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,300
'Ed would hate to admit it, but he could've
kissed the old bastard for that.'

483
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
'lf he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own,'

484
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
'it would have been a lie.'

485
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,200
I wish to Christ he would've
let me settle the debt on my own.

486
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Stop fucking about, Tom.

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,700
Now think about what
we're gonna do. Now sit down.

488
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
What's all the fuss
about Harry?

489
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
Why don't we just
boycott the payment?

490
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,100
Let me tell you
about Hatchet Harry.

491
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,300
Once was this geezer, called Smithy
Robinson, who worked for Harry.

492
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,600
But it was rumoured
that he was on the take.

493
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Harry's invited Smithy round
for an explanation.

494
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,200
Smithy didn't
do a very good job.

495
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,600
Within a minute...

496
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,300
Harry's lost his rag.

497
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,900
Reached out for the nearest
thing at hand -

498
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,800
which happened to be
a 15-inch black rubber cock.

499
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,700
He's then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

500
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
Now that was seen as
a pleasant way to go.

501
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Hence Hatchet Harry
is a man you pay if you owe.

502
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,700
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

503
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,400
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

504
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,300
# lmages much deeper
than you'll ever see

505
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,500
# Hit me like
a hammer to my head

506
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,500
# I wonder were you pushed
or were you led?

507
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,700
# Why did you do it?

508
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
# Why did you do
that thing to me? ##

509
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,600
Golf - the best way
to spoil a good walk.

510
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Winston Churchill said that.

511
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,800
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world.

512
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,200
And I got
bigger teeth than you two.

513
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,600
I think our friend is trying
to tell us something.

514
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
Perhaps not. Perhaps I should take
another swing just to make sure?

515
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,700
Give me a five iron, John.

516
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,300
Certainly, Dog.

517
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,300
Now, keep still.

518
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,800
Yes, Gordon, is there something
you'd like to tell us?

519
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,700
- It's in the fireplace.
- Shut it, you idiot, he'll kill...

520
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Yes, Gordon, you were saying?

521
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,500
It's in the fireplace.
Just pull it out. It's in the bottom.

522
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
It's in the fireplace, Frank.
Just pull it out.

523
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
It's in the bottom.

524
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh, Dog, I think you might wanna
have a look at this!

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,300
You gonna let me down now?

526
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,400
No, I'm not
finished with you yet.

527
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,000
Steel.

528
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,000
Help! Help!

529
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, Dog.

530
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,800
Who the hell's that?
It's only 12 o'clock.

531
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,500
Use the cage,
that's what it's there for.

532
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,500
Who is it?

533
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,500
We have got security
for a reason, Willie.

534
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,100
Chill, Winston. It's only Plank.

535
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,300
This weed's getting quite a rep, 
you know, fellas, all right ?

536
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Easy.

537
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,300
Jesus!

538
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,600
Never saw you there.

539
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Hello, love,
enjoying yourself?

540
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
Is she compos?

541
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,600
What do you think?

542
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,900
Boo!

543
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Fuck me!

544
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,800
Clean that up, Charles.

545
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,500
Sod you, you clean it up.

546
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,300
Sorry, fellas, but that stupid cow
scared the fucking life out of me!

547
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,200
Never mind. Can you just
sit down, stay out the way?

548
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,300
Look, how much is it you want?

549
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm...after an half weight.

550
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,600
Right. Well, that's 1,500 then.
Pass the scales, Willie.

551
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
Give us some gear, J.

552
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,800
Any chance of actually
seeing the...money?

553
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
The odds are 100-1.

554
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,900
All is we need is five grand.

555
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rockin' horse.

556
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,700
The odds are 100-1 for a good
reason, Bacon - it won't win!

557
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,900
- Where's Eddie?
- Where do you think?

558
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,100
The bottom of a bottle,
and has been for two days.

559
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,400
- It's hit him hard.
- Yeah, it's hit us all hard!

560
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,500
Yeah, but he's got to tell his dad
he's about to lose his bar.

561
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,700
Listen to this one.

562
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,500
You open up a company, called
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club"

563
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,500
- You what?
- You take out an advert in the back
page of some gay mag,

564
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,700
advertising the latest
in arse-intruding dildos.

565
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,500
You sell it with...I dunno....

566
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,900
"Does what no other
dildo can do until now"

567
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,100
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology"

568
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,000
"Guaranteed results or money back",
all that bollocks."

569
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Now, these dilds cost 25 quid a pop -

570
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,600
that's a snip for the amount of pleasure
they're gonna give the recipients.

571
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,200
They send their cheques
to the other company name.

572
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,800
Nothing offensive, "Bobby's Bits"
or something, for 25 quid.

573
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
You take that 25 quid,
you stick it in the bank until it clears.

574
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Now this is the smart bit.

575
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,400
You send back the cheque
for 25 pound

576
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,200
from the other company name -

577
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,200
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club" -
saying "We're sorry,"

578
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,700
we couldn't get the supplies from
America - because they ran out of stock.

579
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,200
Now you see, how many people
cash that cheque.

580
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,700
Not a single soul.

581
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Because who wants their bank manager
to know they tickle arse when he is
not paying in cheques!

582
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,500
So how long do you have to wait
till you see a return?

583
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,500
Probably
no more than four weeks.

584
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:58,800
A month ? So what fucking good is that
if we need it in six - no, five days?

585
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,800
Well, it's still a good idea.

586
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,900
He may know we smoke a lot, burn a bit
of profit, but he can't have any idea

587
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

588
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,300
I don't know. Do you know?

589
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,300
We can just...slice it
off the top.

590
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,400
You guys have got
to realise who this chap is.

591
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,700
He might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

592
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,100
If he gets the slightest inkling we're not
throwing straight dice,

593
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
you and me are gonna know

594
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,900
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

595
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,800
So you know these geezers well?

596
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Well enough -

597
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,100
I've been buying gear off one
of 'em for a coupla years.

598
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
- So what they like, then?
- Poofs! Nothing heavy.

599
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,700
Four public school boys,
soft as shite.

600
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,800
They ponce around in funny hippy clothes
all day talking bollocks

601
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,900
they're just good at growing weed, that's all.

602
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,500
Business has got bigger
than what they could handle.

603
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,300
They can't all be stupid, can they ?

604
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,600
Think about it, they got a container
load of cash in shoe boxes,

605
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,200
they're selling class A gear -

606
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,800
can't you figure out
there's someone sensible involved ?

607
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,200
What about security?

608
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,700
There's one steel gate as you go in,
but they never lock it.

609
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,700
What d'you mean they never lock it?
Why've they got it for there, then?

610
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,000
I must've been there 50 times -
it's never locked.

611
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,200
They're not suspicious. Everyone
that goes there's a toff.

612
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,800
They're all into that karma crap -

613
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,400
"If l don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

614
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,500
No way they can get back to you?

615
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Even if they could, they'd be too shit scared -
I'm a geezer.

616
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,200
They got no muscle - gutless faggots.

617
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,700
Fancy one?

618
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,900
What's all the flapping about?
You told the old man yet?

619
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Hoping I won't need to.

620
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,700
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

621
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
- Hello, boys.
- Harry.

622
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Do you want a drink?

623
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,200
Hello, my son.
D'you want a lolly?

624
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,100
Piss off, you nonce.

625
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,100
Oi, watch it!

626
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,800
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

627
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,900
Nice shooter.

628
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, one of a pair -
Holland and Holland.

629
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
D'you wanna hold it?

630
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
No, not my thing, thanks, Harry.

631
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

632
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
Four young fellas got in deeper
than they could handle.

633
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,800
They owe me
half a million pound.

634
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,800
- How much?
- Half a million.

635
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm game.

636
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,000
Me too.

637
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
Oh, God!

638
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,900
Right. We hit 'em
as soon as they come back.

639
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,800
We'll be prepared. Waiting.

640
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
And they're armed.

641
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
What was that? Armed?

642
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,200
What d'you mean armed?
Armed with what?

643
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Bad breath, colourful language,
feather duster?

644
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,100
What do you think
they're gonna be armed with?
Guns, you tit!

645
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,100
Guns ?

646
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,700
You never said
anything about guns.

647
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,100
A minute ago this was
the safest job in the world.

648
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,500
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia!

649
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,100
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

650
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,100
- I've thought about that and...
- And what exactly?

651
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,300
And... all we have to do is find out
who's carrying 'em.

652
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,200
Carying them ?
Well, they could all be carrying 'em
for what we know.

653
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,200
No. Only one of 'em carries
them going to the job.

654
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,500
So I assume the same one will be carry 'em
when they come back from the job.

655
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,300
Oh - you assume, dear?

656
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,300
And what did I say about assumption -
being the brother of all fuck-ups?

657
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,200
It's the mother of all fuck-ups,
you stupid!

658
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,500
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker.

659
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,500
It don't make any difference.

660
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,000
They're still fucking guns and
they still fire fucking bullets!

661
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,100
Soap, if you have a better idea
how to get £500,000

662
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,300
in the next few days,
let us know.

663
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,800
In the meantime, Tom,

664
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,100
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

665
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,500
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

666
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,200
It's some fucked-up skunk, Class A,

667
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,600
"l can't think
let alone move" shit.

668
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,100
Doesn't sound
very good to me.

669
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,800
Oh, neither me - it depends
what flicks your switch.

670
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,700
And the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

671
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,900
Anyway, do you know anyone?

672
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,300
I know a man, yes.

673
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,900
Rory Breaker.

674
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,200
Not that madman with an afro?

675
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
I don't want anything
to do with him.

676
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

677
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,100
No can do.

678
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,100
What's that -
a place near Kathmandu?

679
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,700
Meet me half-way, mate.

680
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,600
It's all completely
chicken soup.

681
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,100
- It's what?
- It's kosher...as Christmas.

682
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Jews don't
celebrate Christmas, Tom.

683
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,500
No, I never mind that.
I'm gonna need some artillery, too.

684
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,200
Coupla sawn-off shotguns.

685
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,800
This is a bit heavy. This is London,
not the Lebanon.

686
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,600
Who d'you think I am?

687
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,500
I think you're Nick the Greek.

688
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,000
Hold those two.

689
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,100
I don't normally have
anything to do with weed, Nick.

690
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,300
But if it is
what he says it is,

691
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,100
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

692
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,500
That is if it is what he says it is.

693
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,600
I don't want to see it
after a sample,

694
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,900
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

695
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,200
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

696
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,700
He'll sort out the details.

697
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,000
But just let me tell you
one thing...

698
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,800
If the milk turns out
to be sour,

699
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,100
I ain't the kind
of pussy to drink it.

700
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,700
D'you know what I mean?

701
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
- Rory Breaker.
- Rory ?

702
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,300
You don't know Rory. He's not
to be underestimated.

703
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,200
He's a funny-looking
fucker, I know.

704
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,000
But you've got to look past the hair
and the cute cuddly thing.

705
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,700
It's all a deceptive façade.

706
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,900
A few nights ago
Rory's roger iron busted.

707
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,800
So he's gone down the battle cruiser
to watch the end of the football game.

708
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,300
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel over.

709
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
A fat geezer's north opens.

710
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,800
And he wanders up
and turns the lizar over.

711
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,900
"Now fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

712
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,000
Rory knows claret is imminent,

713
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,800
but he doesn't want to miss
the end of the game.

714
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,300
So calm as a coma, picks up
the fire extinguisher,

715
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,400
walks straight past the jam rolls
who were ready for action

716
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,600
and plonks it outside
the entrance.

717
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,700
He then orders an aristotle
of the most ping-pong tiddly

718
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,400
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer.

719
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,200
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

720
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory.

721
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,800
And he gobs out a mouthful of booze,
covering Fatty.

722
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,200
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest

723
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

724
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,500
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

725
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,900
His team's won, too. Four nil.

726
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,900
Oi! ls your hair supposed
to look like that?

727
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,600
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

728
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,100
Listen, the next time we do a job like this
we're gonna want more money, Barry.

729
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,100
Or we're going back
to post offices and cars. Fuck that!

730
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,100
Where's the others?

731
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,100
There was no others.

732
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,900
Stop fucking around.
The others - the old ones.

733
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,100
I don't know what you mean.

734
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,500
There were two old guns there.
Where are they now?

735
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Not in the cabinet, there wasn't.

736
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,900
Oh, there was a couple of old hammer-lock
muskets the butler was carrying.

737
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,100
- But they were ours. We sold them.
- Well you better un-sell 'em, sharpish !

738
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,500
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

739
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,900
I am not fucking interested.

740
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,700
If you don't wanna be counting
the fingers you haven't got,

741
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,500
I suggest you get those guns.
Quick!

742
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,600
Jesus! lf I pick 'em up,
will they stay in one piece?

743
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,300
Where'd you get them?

744
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,200
I got contacts. Listen, Tom -

745
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,100
you point them at me, I'll shit
myself or do whatever you say to do.

746
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,900
Either way you get
the desired effect.

747
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
Oh, they look very nice, I agree, but -

748
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,100
well, they're lacking in criminal
credibility, ain't they?

749
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,500
I might get laughed at.

750
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,100
How much d'you want
for these muskets?

751
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,500
700 each.

752
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,000
And what's that - a pound for every year
they been about?

753
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,800
I know they're antiques, but I ain't
paying antique prices.

754
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
They're a bit long, ain't they?

755
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
Sawn-offs are out.

756
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,000
People want a bit
more range these days.

757
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,100
Range ? I don't wanna blow the arse
out of this country grounded,

758
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,800
but I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry either.

759
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,500
I want to look...fucking mean.

760
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,500
Of course you'll look mean.

761
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,300
You'll look really scary.

762
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,300
Enough about that. What about
this geezer who sells drugs?

763
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Rory Breaker's standing by.

764
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,500
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy?

765
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,000
I understand if this has come
as a bit of a shock.

766
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,900
But let me tell you
how this can be resolved

767
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
by you, the good father.

768
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,300
Go on.

769
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,700
- He likes your bar.
- Yes.

770
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
He wants your bar.

771
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,800
And?

772
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,300
D'you want me
to draw you a picture?

773
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,900
Look, that boy doesn't know
his arsehole from his earhole.

774
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,300
This is my bar. It's got
nothing to do with him.

775
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,500
What, and I care?

776
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,700
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage

777
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,900
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

778
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,900
And you do have a reputation -

779
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,400
so I'll choose my words
very carefully.

780
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,600
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

781
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,800
Now...

782
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,300
I'll put that down to shock.

783
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,800
Only once.

784
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,100
Only once can l, or shall l,
let you get away with that.

785
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,200
Your son's got three days
to find half a mill.

786
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,500
But make up your mind
which you prefer -

787
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,900
your bar...or your son.

788
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,700
Plank goes in first.

789
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,700
There's a cage, but it's never
locked, is it, Plank?

790
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,800
- Never.
- You don't wanna be ....

791
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,200
All right, once he's got himself set,
he gets the rest of us in.

792
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,400
Now we'll get nasty with a couple of'em,
shit 'em up, ok, or whatever.

793
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,900
Now these wankers shouldn't
give us any problems.

794
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,200
Like any cowboys - there'll
be a few tools lying around.

795
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,200
When the job's done, we come
straight back here and unload.

796
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,800
And Robert's
your father's brother.

797
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,000
Everyone savvy?

798
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Sweet.

799
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,400
Have a look at these.

800
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
And what are we supposed
to do with these?

801
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
Put them on your head, stupid.

802
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
Christ!

803
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,600
If you think I'm gonna
turn up there clean-shaven,

804
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,500
and greet them with a grin on my face,
you've got another think coming.

805
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,600
Now these fellas - they're your neighbours.

806
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,700
I thought it might be a good
idea to disguise ourselves a little.

807
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,900
Right...er, yeah, good thinking,
Soap. Well done.

808
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,300
I brought weapons as well.

809
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,700
Weapons?
What do you mean weapons?

810
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,200
These.

811
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,600
Jesus!

812
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,200
Let's keep 'em covered up.

813
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,800
Couldn't you get
anything a bit bigger?

814
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,700
What, like that?

815
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,400
What d'you think?

816
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,500
I think you need help.

817
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,500
Bar steward, can we have
a coupla drinks, please.

818
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,500
Have you seen your dad?

819
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,200
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

820
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,300
Oh, shit. When?

821
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,200
Crazy.

822
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,800
Where'd you get these,
a fucking museum?

823
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,200
Nick the Greek.

824
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,100
How much did you part with?

825
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,700
700 for the pair.

826
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,600
Drachmas, I hope.

827
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,500
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

828
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,500
These are gonna do
more harm than good.

829
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,000
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

830
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,800
I don't know. Look nice though, don't they ?
I rather like 'em.

831
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh, that's top of the list of priorities,
is that it?

832
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,300
Ladies, back to more important
issues, if you don't mind.

833
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,600
We've only got two real guns -
apparently that's what they are.

834
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,900
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

835
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,100
We wait till it sounds out the right
time, then we, jack-in-the-box,

836
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,900
Iook nasty and stuff, cocoon 'em
in gaffer tape, nick their van,

837
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,700
swap the gear into the new van
and bring it all back here.

838
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,400
As long as we're all out
of our hiding places quickly,

839
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,400
it's the last thing
they're gonna expect.

840
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,100
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else for that matter 
feels like giving 'em a bit of a kicking,

841
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,300
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

842
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,100
Yeah, little bit of pain
never hurt anybody.

843
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
If you know what I mean.

844
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,100
Also, I think knives
are a good idea.

845
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,000
Big, fuck-off shiny ones.

846
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,100
Ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

847
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,100
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise.

848
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,700
And the less noise they make, the
more likely we are to use 'em.

849
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,300
Shit 'em right up.

850
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,800
Makes it look
like we're serious.

851
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,700
Guns for show,
knives for a pro.

852
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,800
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

853
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,100
I'm not sure what's more
worrying, the job or your past?

854
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,100
Come on, girls.

855
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,700
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

856
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,000
I thought this was meant
to be a robbery.

857
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,600
Where'd they get those outfits?

858
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Not a bad idea that.

859
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
All right, it's Plank.
Is Willie there?

860
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,400
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

861
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,900
Perhaps you can help.

862
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,200
Perhaps I can't, Plank,
if you know what I mean.

863
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,100
Look, if you could just open the door so
I could talk without shouting.

864
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
I can't help you, Plank.

865
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,300
I think you'll find
it's in your interest.

866
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,800
Hold on, OK?

867
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,700
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.
He says it's in our interest.

868
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,000
Listen, I don't care if it's
King-fucking-Kong,

869
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,500
he's not coming in here,
not today.

870
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,200
Hold on. We are in business
and...correct me if I'm wrong, but --

871
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,000
that is business.

872
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,600
Corrected. That's a walking
accident that we can do without.

873
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,600
Jesus. He's OK... He knows
only to buy weights now.

874
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,400
We're looking at at least
a couple of thou'.

875
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,200
What do you think, Winston?

876
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,400
Willie, this is
the last time. All right?

877
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,700
But you and the money
are going out the back.

878
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,400
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

879
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,400
And just clear this shit up!

880
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,200
- What, now?
- Yes! Now!

881
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Just get rid of him quick.

882
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,800
All right. Just coming.

883
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,100
What the fuck is he doing?

884
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,600
Come on, I can't wait
out here all day!

885
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,300
All right. Just coming.

886
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,900
I thought you was gonna
leave me out there all day.

887
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,000
I didn't know you were
a removals man, Plank.

888
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,900
Lives and learns, don't ya?
Keep the gates locked now here?

889
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,300
Ya, sorry. Gotta
do business like this now.

890
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,100
Can't be too careful these days.

891
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,300
I know.

892
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,400
Shut it! You say a fucking word, the right ear goes,
another one - and your left!

893
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,800
- What are you doing, Plank?
- What do you think I'm doing?

894
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,900
Hang on, what are you doing?

895
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Unlock the gate!
Oi! I say unlock the fucking gate!

896
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,500
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

897
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,600
What the fuck's going on?

898
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,700
Just hang on, I've got the keys.

899
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,300
The gate's locked! I thought they weren't gonna
let the fucking gate locked.

900
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,500
What've you done to Fauntleroy?

901
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
I didn't touch him.
He just passed out.

902
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,300
Don't you stand there. Get the fucking door shut!
D'you want the world to see this?

903
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,900
What's going on down there?

904
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,500
Shit!

905
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,300
Charles, get the rifle out.

906
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,700
We're being fucked.

907
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,900
It must be this one.

908
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Hold that gun. Plank, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Plank.

909
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,900
Don't point that at my bollocks!
Point it in there!

910
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,400
Planks of wood. I'm working
with fucking planks of wood.

911
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,500
Shit !

912
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,600
What the fuck is that?

913
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,400
- What the fuck's that?
- IT'S ME BREN GUN!

914
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,800
Don't you think you could've brought something
a little bit more practical?

915
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,500
Don't none of you slags move.
I'll kill the fucking lot of you!

916
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,900
Who you gonna kill, Plank?
There's no one fuckin' there?

917
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,900
Aaagh! They fucking shot me!

918
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,200
Well, shoot 'em back.

919
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,000
Jesus, Plank! Couldn't you get
smokeless cartidges?

920
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,600
I can't see a bloody thing !

921
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,600
Aaagh! Shit, I've been shot.

922
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,500
I don't fucking believe this.
Could everyone stop getting shot?

923
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,400
John, sit down and patch
yourself up, you tart!

924
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,300
It's a fucking air rifle!

925
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,800
- What the fuck was that?
- Well, that was the bren gun.

926
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,700
You fire that gun again, you're a dead man.
Understand? Dead!

927
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,700
- No ifs, no buts, you're a fucking dead man!
- All right, all right!

928
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,200
I've got bollock ache with this.
Where's my fucking gun?

929
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,700
All right. Now I've got your attention.
Firstly, I'm gonna blow his toes off.

930
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,300
There go his toes.

931
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,300
Now if you want me out of here,
in five minutes flat,

932
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,800
open the fucking gate
'cause I'm gonna blow his leg off!

933
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,700
They're gonna fucking kill us
if we do, man.

934
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,800
Poor J'll certainly get it
if we don't. He's serious.

935
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,300
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls!

936
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,900
It's all right, all fucking right!

937
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,200
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here..., just .....

938
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Sort something out.

939
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,800
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

940
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,600
- There's only three of us here.
- I don't believe you.

941
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,200
- Fuck, I'm gonna blow his leg off.
- I mean it. There's only three of us!

942
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,300
- Plank?
- Yeah, one of 'em's out.

943
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,200
Now open the gate.

944
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,200
Up, up, up, there's a good lad.

945
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,800
John, get them tied up.
Plank, where's the money?

946
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,800
There, in those shoe-boxes.

947
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,800
- Where?
- Out the back.

948
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,800
- And the weed?
- Out the back.

949
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,200
- Point.
- With what?

950
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,400
- Your fucking hands, now!
- I'm tied up.

951
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,300
Well, nod your head or something!

952
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Check it out.

953
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,000
Plank, get Paul out that van lively.

954
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,600
Knife.

955
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,500
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

956
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,800
How you doing, Mick?

957
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,100
How d'you think I'm doing?
He's fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

958
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,200
Jesus Christ.

959
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,600
Gordon Bennett.

960
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,600
What the fuck's
been going on here?

961
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,800
Shut up, you idiot.
It's Hanukkah.

962
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,700
Don't just stand there.

963
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,800
Look at the bags, can you fit it all in?

964
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,900
There's a lot...l can't
get Epping Forest in my van.

965
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
'Can't'. I don't hear 'can't'.
Bollocks to 'can't'.

966
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,300
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

967
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,700
Bollocks!

968
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,600
You got a ticket already. Now if you
don't move it, we will move it for you.

969
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,000
- I'll only be a minute.
- You've already been 15.

970
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,000
- Look, come and have a look.
- At what exactly?

971
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,200
- Well, the van's half full.
- So?

972
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,300
So, all I've got to do
is fill it up, put you in it...

973
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
What?

974
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,600
..and I'm off.

975
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,800
Do you think you can carry
more than one bag this time?

976
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,200
- I can't. My neck, Dog.

977
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,700
- How many more bags ?
- Just a couple.

978
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,200
Mick, you dead yet?

979
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,600
I'll be all right. Once I've
dealt with that lanky prick.

980
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,000
Do it quietly.

981
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,600
It's time to say "Goodnight, nurse".

982
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,300
Where the fuck
did she come from?

983
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That is it. Tie her up.
We're out of here.

984
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,600
Not like that,
you idiot. Give it us here.

985
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,100
What you doing, Ed?

986
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,600
D'you want one?

987
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,700
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make a cup of tea, Edward.

988
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,300
The entire British Empire
was built on cups of tea.

989
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah, and look what happened to that.

990
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,400
And if you think I'm going to war
without one, mate, you're mistaken.

991
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,200
Going to war with what?

992
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,200
Have you forgotten
those guns, you dozy prat?

993
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,400
You won't get away with this.

994
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,300
- Paul, what's that?
- It's a traffic warden.

995
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,500
I can see it's a fuckin' traffic warden,
what's he doing in the back of the van?

996
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,200
He was gonna call the cozzers.

997
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,600
Fair enough -
we'll deal with him later.

998
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,500
How we doing, Tom?

999
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,200
Right as rain.

1000
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,600
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

1001
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Keep us posted.

1002
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,800
All right, mate, do you do airports?

1003
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,400
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

1004
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,000
Don't complicate things.
Just hide.

1005
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,900
We're on.

1006
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,400
They weigh a pound or two!

1007
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,400
Shut up and back up!

1008
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,900
Spin round, big boy.

1009
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Fuck!

1010
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,200
Stay down. Stay down!

1011
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,200
Tie 'em up. Tape 'em up.
Hands and face.

1012
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,500
On the floor!

1013
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,900
Bend over the fucking desk.

1014
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,500
Keys. I want keys, now.

1015
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,300
I'll find ya.

1016
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,900
'Course you will, sweetheart.

1017
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,500
I'll find ya.

1018
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,700
What d'you think this is?
Fucking hide-and-seek?

1019
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,400
That one. Search that one.

1020
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,800
Right, I'll see you in the van,
when you've finished with handsome here.

1021
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,100
Jesus. That wasn't
too bad, was it?

1022
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,200
When the bottle in my arse has
contracted, I'll let you know.

1023
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,900
Bacon, see what we've got.

1024
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,900
Let's have a butchers, ey?

1025
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,800
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1026
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,900
We've got God knows how much
of this stinking weed.

1027
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,200
A shitload of cash.

1028
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,700
And a traffic warden.

1029
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,800
What?

1030
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,600
Jesus, Ed.
We got a traffic warden.

1031
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,200
I think he's still alive.

1032
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,100
He's got claret
coming out of him somewhere.

1033
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,400
What did they want
with a traffic warden?

1034
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,200
I don't know.
I don't think we need him.

1035
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,500
Knock him out and dump him
at the lights.

1036
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Knock him out? What d'you mean,
knock him out? Knock him out with what?

1037
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,300
I don't know! Use your imagination.

1038
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,000
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out.

1039
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,500
I'll knock you out in a minute!

1040
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,500
Look, you wanna knock him out,
you knock him out.

1041
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,100
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1042
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,600
It's about time you gave my
young friends a visit, Chris.

1043
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,700
Tomorrow's the day
and mum's the word.

1044
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,400
Now I can't have that,
can l, Baz?

1045
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,300
No, Harry, you can't.

1046
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,600
I mean it's a liberty.

1047
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,000
And I can't have a liberty taken,
can l, Chris?

1048
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,900
No, Harry, you can't.

1049
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,200
I mean, it's enough
to give me the arsehole.

1050
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,700
And I can't have the arsehole,
can l, boys?

1051
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,500
No, Harry, you can't.

1052
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,300
All right, that's it.
We're done.

1053
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,300
We're off.

1054
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,000
Here, Ed, are you sure it's a good
idea taking this back to yours?

1055
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,400
Why, it's the only place we can take it,
and the last place they're gonna look.

1056
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,400
Anyway, fuck it. The battle
is over and the war is won.

1057
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,000
Now, Tom, you take this to Nick the
Bubble and we get rid of it quick.

1058
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,200
This skunk
is as good as it gets.

1059
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,400
All right.
We'll take it. Half price.

1060
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,400
I don't think he'll like that.

1061
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,700
And you said three five a key.
And... and you know that's a good price.

1062
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,800
That was yesterday I said three and a half.

1063
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,100
And now it's today
if I'm not mistaken.

1064
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,600
We'll take it tomorrow.
Half price.

1065
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,900
If he wants to get rid of it
quick, he'll have to take it.

1066
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Now look, I've got a race coming up in a minute,
so if you'd just be kind enough to...

1067
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,000
Lenny,

1068
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,900
take that round to Snow White
and the three little chemists.

1069
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
They should have
a gander of that.

1070
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,800
I want a second opinion.

1071
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,100
Hang on a minute, Nathan,
something stinks.

1072
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,400
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1073
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,400
Fuck you, funny man.

1074
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
For God's sake, help me.

1075
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,600
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain, Jesus!

1076
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,900
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1077
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,300
Fuck you, funny man.
You go first.

1078
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Just get the fuck in there, will you ?

1079
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,800
I want this house searched for bugs,
I mean I want it stripped.

1080
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,400
Where is the poin in that ?
Even if there was a bug,
they'd have taken it with 'em.

1081
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,700
It's a bit late
for you to start thinking, John.

1082
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,200
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1083
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
I want you to strip this place.
I want every slag this side of Ceylon
pulled in.

1084
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,500
And tortured...badly.

1085
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,300
I want to know
who's responsible for this,

1086
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,900
otherwise I'm gonna hold
you all responsible.

1087
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,600
Not a bad day.

1088
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,500
That pile takes care of Harry.

1089
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,400
What's left over?

1090
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
Give me half a chance
to count it.

1091
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,100
What about this gear, then, ey?

1092
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,500
Oh, what, you want
a toke on that?

1093
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,000
No. I don't think I want any
of that horrible shit.

1094
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,900
Can we lock up
and get drunk now, please?

1095
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,600
We shot one of them...
in the...er, throat.

1096
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,700
What d'you want, a medal?

1097
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,500
I'll shoot you in the fuckin throat
if I don't get my ganja back.

1098
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,700
The one you shot.
Is he still in there now?

1099
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,400
No, it was another one.

1100
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,600
That's more like it.
Where is he?

1101
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,400
Well, they...they
took him with them.

1102
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,300
He's still, still alive.

1103
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,000
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1104
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:13,700
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1105
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,400
You don't say.

1106
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,000
Who could it be?
Where do we start, Rory?

1107
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,300
Mr Breaker.

1108
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Today my name is Mr Breaker.

1109
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,800
You think this
is a coincidence?

1110
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,800
This white shite
steals my things

1111
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,900
and thinks that he can
sell it back to me!

1112
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,200
He's got less brains
than you, Lenny!

1113
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,100
Get Nick - the greasy wop

1114
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,500
shistos pezavengy gammore
Greek bastard round here now,

1115
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,000
if he's still stupid enough
to be on this planet.

1116
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,000
# Come with me,
I'll fill you with desire

1117
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,600
# Take my hand and we'll walk
this land together ##

1118
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Your stupidity might be
your one saving grace.

1119
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,900
Uuh?

1120
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
Don't uuh me, Greek boy.

1121
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,400
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1122
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,300
thought that they might be able
to steal my cannabis

1123
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,300
and then sell it back to me?

1124
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,600
Is this a declaration of war?

1125
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,600
Is this some white cunt's joke
that black cunts don't get?

1126
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,300
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Ni-ko-las!

1127
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,200
I know you couldn't
have known my position,

1128
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,900
'cause you're not that stupid
that if you did,

1129
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,300
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse,

1130
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,200
with that "what's going on here" look
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1131
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,500
But what you do know
is where these people live.

1132
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,100
If you hold back anything,
I'll kill you.

1133
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,200
If you bend the truth, or I think
you are bending the truth, I'll kill you.

1134
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1135
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,000
In fact, you're gonna have to work
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1136
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,800
Now do you understand
everything I've said?

1137
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,500
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1138
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:33,400
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak...
you may enlighten me.

1139
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,700
So we've got a bit
of a problem, don't we?

1140
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,100
Er, well...yeah, yeah, we do.

1141
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,000
Yea, yeah, we do. In fact, this is a little bit more
than looking a bit of a problem, isn't it ?

1142
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,200
On the scale of things, you could say it's the
Mount fucking Everest of problems!

1143
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,100
And the reason it's such a
mon-fucking-struosity of a problem is...

1144
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,200
you don't have the first idea
who did this to us, have you?

1145
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,900
Dog, we've... we've been up all night.
It's no one from round here.

1146
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,600
We've had 'em all lined up
against the wall.

1147
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,800
If it was a toerag
from round the manor, we'd know.

1148
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,200
- We'd know.
- You'd know? You'd fucking know?

1149
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,000
You wouldn't know if it was
the next door fucking neighbours!

1150
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,500
Now get out there and find them!

1151
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:13,400
I'm sick of the fucking sight of you!
Get out of the fucking sight!
You look shit!

1152
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,600
"Scarface" -
I've watched "Scarface".

1153
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,800
If you want to know how to do
a drug deal, you watch "Scarface".

1154
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,900
That really inspires confidence.

1155
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,000
- This guy, Rory Breaker...
- Rory Breaker ?

1156
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,400
The psychotic black dwarf with an afro?

1157
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,900
That'll be the same man, yes.

1158
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,800
I've heard of him -
he's a fucking lunatic.

1159
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,500
Well, he can afford to do the deal
at the price we're selling.

1160
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,800
It's not worth him
giving us any trouble.

1161
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,700
Cause he knows we'll be a pain
in the arse. And who needs a pain in the arse?

1162
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,700
I'd take a pain in the arse
for half a million quid.

1163
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,700
You'd take a pain
in the arse for air miles.

1164
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,900
Tom, the fatter you get,
the sadder you get.

1165
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,800
Will you two stop flirting
for a minute?

1166
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:06,500
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up...

1167
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,700
nearly 200,000 pounds each.

1168
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,400
That's not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1169
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,800
So they had the cash.

1170
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,900
And the puff.

1171
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,100
Cheeky bastards. Count it.

1172
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Shit, Dog. There's a lot.

1173
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,700
Do you want to do it next door?

1174
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,300
We're not going next door

1175
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,900
'til we've flayed
them dead men walking.

1176
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,700
We'll count it upstairs.

1177
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,500
I don't want them to see you
fingering the money when
they walk through the door...

1178
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,400
Dog, look...

1179
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,200
Give it us here...dozy bastard.

1180
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,200
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1181
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,400
You wait till they get right inside
the door, then you give it to'em.

1182
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,400
Give me them shooters,
you can use your own.

1183
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,700
Yeah.

1184
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,600
That's no way
to answer the phone.

1185
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,100
Is that you, Dean?

1186
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,800
No, it's Lord fucking Lucan.
Who do you think it is?

1187
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,000
What can I do for you?

1188
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,900
You know those guns I sold you,
I need them back.

1189
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,700
Not likely I'm afraid. I don't think
I'll be seeing them again.

1190
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,900
Look, I've got the money
to pay for them.

1191
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,800
I'm sure you do.
But don't think you understand.

1192
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,300
I ain't gonna be seeing them
or the guns again.

1193
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,900
We can't get them.

1194
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,800
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1195
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,300
Well, you'll have to fucking get them.

1196
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,900
We made a fucking deal for
everything inside the cabinet.

1197
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:47,200
Inside, out-fucking-side -
I don't give a shit.

1198
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,800
- You get those guns because if you don't...
- Oh yeah, Bazza, or what ?

1199
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Have you heard
of Harry Lonsdale?

1200
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,600
Otherwise known as "Hack You
Up With an Hatchet Harry"?

1201
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,800
Well, this is...

1202
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,800
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1203
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:06,000
When you dance with the devil,
you wait for the song to stop.

1204
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,000
Know what I mean?

1205
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,900
I mean find 'em,
torture 'em and kill 'em.

1206
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,100
And bring back
what belongs to me.

1207
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:23,000
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1208
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,200
Who was that?

1209
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,600
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1210
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,200
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1211
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,500
Shit, they were
his fucking guns we sold.

1212
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,200
We've got to find them.

1213
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,900
Now no fucking about now, Nick.
Where can I find those guns?

1214
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,600
Six black cocks
and a little white kitten

1215
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,500
sitting on the side
of the road.

1216
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,200
We're gonna do
a proper decoration job.

1217
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,600
I want the grey skies
of London illuminated.

1218
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,500
I want that house painted red.

1219
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,100
All right, there's this brass
standing on the corner, right?

1220
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,900
Dwarf walks up to her
carrying a suitcase...

1221
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,200
Winston there
is gonna come along

1222
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,100
and see if he recognises
any of them.

1223
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,700
Now watch out for these fellas -

1224
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,500
they've got a bit of an arsenal
and they don't mind using it.

1225
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,200
...and I'm taking down her panties...

1226
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,800
Now does everyone here know
what they got to do?

1227
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,600
Yeah.

1228
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,600
What the fuck is going on?

1229
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,500
You got something here
for me, have you?

1230
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,700
Come on, chop-chop.

1231
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,800
Thank you very much.

1232
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,100
- He's got the guns.Go ahead you get them.
- Why me?

1233
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,900
You're supposed
to be the hard case...

1234
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,700
You go get the guns!
I drive the car!

1235
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,100
Good boy.

1236
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,800
- Go get the fucking guns.
- I'm not going get the fucking guns!
YOU get the fucking guns!

1237
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,700
You fucking big...

1238
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,900
All right. Wrap them guns up.

1239
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,400
Count the money.

1240
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,600
Put your seat belt on.

1241
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,200
Fucking guns, we've got to get the fucking
guns or we're dead!

1242
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,700
..so I made sure I fucked
the one that was coughing.

1243
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,400
Out of the car, you yuppy fucker!
Aaaaaaaagh !

1244
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,100
He's the one
we shot in the neck.

1245
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,200
Is that right, Mr Botanical?

1246
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,500
Jesus!

1247
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,900
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1248
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,600
Jesus.

1249
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,500
The money. The gear.

1250
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,500
This is fucked.

1251
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,500
No money. No weed.

1252
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,100
It's all been replaced
by a pile of corpses.

1253
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,800
All right. Don't panic.
Let's think about this.

1254
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,800
No, fuck that,
you can think about it.

1255
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,500
I'm panicking and I'm off.

1256
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,600
How did you get your hands
on these, then?

1257
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,900
The boys had 'em.

1258
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,300
I know you like
these sort of things -

1259
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,500
wondered if you wanted 'em.

1260
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,800
Yeah, I'll have 'em.

1261
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,300
- Was it hard getting the money?
- Not especially.

1262
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,700
Upset a few characters, though.

1263
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,300
Have you counted it?

1264
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,400
Yeah, it's all there,
to the pound.

1265
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,800
- And they were gonna pay?
- Looks like it.

1266
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,800
But who knows?
The opportunity was there.

1267
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,900
In my experience it's best
to take that opportunity -

1268
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,000
if it's there.

1269
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,500
Good work, Chris.

1270
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,100
We've got to get those guns.

1271
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,900
This is dangerous shit there.
We don't even know who lives there.

1272
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,900
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1273
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,600
All's I know is that it's preferable
to death by Hatchet.

1274
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Fair enough. Let's go.

1275
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,100
I don't think
it's the right move.

1276
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,800
It's either that

1277
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,500
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1278
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,100
- I'm gonna phone him.
- As if he'll care.

1279
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:50,100
He'll care, all right? That was
supposed to be his money.

1280
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,400
Whether he cares about us
or not, is different.

1281
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,500
Pass me the phone.

1282
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,900
Yeah? That you, boy?

1283
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's Ed,
if that's what you mean.

1284
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,200
'Pay day, ain't it?'

1285
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,900
Yeah...l wanted
to talk to you about that.

1286
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,800
I'll bet you do.

1287
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,500
I got half
a million nicker sitting here,

1288
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,900
which means
some poor sod doesn't.

1289
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,500
You've been upsetin' a few people, boy.

1290
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,400
But that really
isn't my concern, is it?

1291
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:37,400
What does concern me...
is the guns you had.

1292
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,500
'l want to talk to you
about that.'

1293
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,700
So get your arse over here now.
And I do mean now!

1294
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:23,700
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1295
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,400
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1296
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,400
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1297
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,600
Job well done. We made
a few quid out of that one.

1298
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,500
Son...?

1299
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,200
Made a few quid, did you?

1300
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,400
Where's what I want, now?

1301
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,100
You all right down there, mate?

1302
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,300
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?

1303
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,900
I've just left it in the office.

1304
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,700
Well, we'd better go to the office and get it,

1305
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,600
that is if you want
your son to see his next birthday.

1306
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,800
- Now chop-fucking-chop.
- All right. Fair enough.

1307
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,600
Where you going?

1308
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,200
It's a thirty second drive
or a five minute walk.

1309
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:29,000
I couldn't have parked outside,
I'd have got a ticket.

1310
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,100
I suppose that don't
matter now, does it?

1311
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
Just be careful.

1312
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,900
Right.

1313
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,100
You and me.

1314
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,000
You and who?

1315
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,300
You know where
the door handle is, Tom.

1316
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,900
# "The Payback" #
by James Brown

1317
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,600
# Pay back

1318
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,700
# That's it, pay back.

1319
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,500
# Revenge, I'm mad

1320
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,300
# Get down with my girlfriend

1321
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,400
# That ain't right ##

1322
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,300
Oh, no. Not again.

1323
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,400
That's it. I'm off.

1324
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:35,300
Tom...that is our bag.

1325
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,200
- Ed...!
- Hold on.

1326
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,700
This is our bag.

1327
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,000
That's it. We're off.

1328
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,300
- I'll see you in the car. I'm gonna take these guns.
- Tom, don't fuck about!

1329
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,900
- I'll see you in the car.
- Tom !
- It'll only take a minute.

1330
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,700
What is going on?

1331
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,100
I don't know, but what I do know
is there's no more Harry.

1332
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,500
Which means
there's no more debt.

1333
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,400
And if there's no more debt,
there's no more problem.

1334
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,400
And there's no problem with the
neighbours - because they're all dead.

1335
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,000
And I think,
if I get this right,

1336
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,200
we haven't done anything wrong
and we're in the clear.

1337
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,100
Never ever...

1338
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,600
has anyone
been as fucking rude...

1339
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,400
..to me...

1340
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,900
...as you,   YOU... FUCKING... BASTARD!

1341
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,900
You all right, mate?

1342
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,300
Cheeky bastard!

1343
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,700
'Now this was an embarrassing
position for Tom to be in.

1344
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,700
'But Chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding

1345
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,300
'what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns.

1346
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,200
'And Tom had to respect the fact
that they were not loaded.

1347
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,500
'So without anybody
losing too much face,

1348

01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,300
'And everybody else got arrested.'

1350
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,900
He's not one of 'em.

1354
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,700
I think your dad would like
a word with you, Ed.

1355
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,800
Where are the others?

1356
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,200
They got out yesterday.
They're back at the bar.

1357

# Super-human being ##

1360
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,800
All right, Dad?

1361
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I'm all right.
How about yourself?

1362
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:45,900
I'm all right.
Could do with a drink, though.

1363
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,900
All in good time. All in good time.

1364
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,300
So, are you in the clear?

1365
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,200
More importantly...am l?

1366
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,800
It appears so.

1367
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:03,800
Appears? You'll have to do
better than fucking appears, my friend.

1368
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,400
Well, everybody's dead, Dad.

1369
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,800
I think that's about as clear
as it can get.

1370
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,500
How about that drink?

1371
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,300
You know where the bar is.

1372
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,600
Eh?

1373
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,600
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

1374
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:19,800
Alan's got to sit there.
Alan!

1375
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,500
You're lucky
you're still breathing,

1376
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,900
Iet alone able to walk.

1377
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:31,400
I suggest you take
full advantage of that fact.

1378
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,400
# 'Cause I'm a man machine

1379
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,400
# Takin' gasoline

1380
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,200
# I'm a teen dream

1381
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,300
# Super-human being

1382
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,300
# I'm a man machine

1383
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,600
# I'm a man machine ! ##

1384
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,200
You took your time.
Where the hell have you been?

1385
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,400
Sit down. I'll tell you.

1386
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:11,300
The traffic warden identified
the neighbours' bodies.

1387
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,900
Which sort of
puts us in the clear.

1388
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,700
The only thing connecting us
with the case...

1389
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,700
..is those shotguns.

1390
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,100
And Tom took care of them.

1391
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,500
You did take care of the shotguns,
didn't you, Tom?

1392
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,800
I wanted to talk to you about that.

1393
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,200
Well, talk.

1394
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,500
Well, actually...no.

1395
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,500
I've got them sittin' in the car,
I.. I was gonna sell 'em back to Nick the Greek,

1396
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,700
but I am having a bit of a problem
gettin' hold of him.

1397
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,400
You dippy bastard.

1398
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:49,500
So...the only thing
connecting us with the case

1399
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,700
is in the back of your car,
which is parked outside!

1400
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,800
They costed 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw 'em away.

1401
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,500
And they're hardly likely to trace
'em back to us, are they?

1402
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,600
Do you really think it's worth taking the
the risk for £700?

1403
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,900
Tom, you're a dick!

1404
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,900
Now you take those guns
and you throw 'em off a bridge.

1405
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,500
And throw yourself off while you're at it.

1406
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,600
Now.... Tom.

1407
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
- Look, all I'm...
- Now, Tom !

1408
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1409
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,800
I'm busy. Get it yourself.

1410
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,000
It seemed Hatchet
underestimated you lot.

1411
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,500
And it seems to have cost him.

1412
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,100
I ain't gonna make
the same mistake now, am l?

1413
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,700
So I've decided
to bring your bag back.

1414
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,300
I think the word you're looking
for, gentlemen, is "thank you".

1415
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,600
Thank you.

1416
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,500
Now you've presented me
with a problem.

1417
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,900
I've lost my employer.

1418
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,600
So I've taken care
of meself and me son.

1419
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:25,000
Now if you think that's unfair,
you come and pay me a little visit.

1420
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,200
But you better be
waving a white flag,

1421
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:31,000
high and clear
so as I can see it.

1422
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,700
Or it'll be the last little visit 
you ever make.

1423
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,300
You understand ?

1424
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,700
That's all I've come to say.

1425
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,400
There is one more thing...

1426
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,500
It's been emotional.

1427
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,100
# "Fool's Gold" #
by The Stone Roses

1428
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,900
# The gold road's
sure a long road

1429
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,400
# Winds on through the hills
for fifteen days ##

1430
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:21,300
We are now officially in
the money-lending business, all right, son?

1431
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,600
Put your seatbelt on.

1432
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,200
We're out of here.

1433
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,900
It's empty.

1434
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:03,200
# The pack on my back is aching

1435
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,200
# The strap seems
to cut me like a knife

1436
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,900
# I'm no clown
I won't back down

1437
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:26,500
# I don't need you
to tell me what's going down...

1438
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,500
What's his number?

1439
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,800
Don't! Don't! You'll jam the line!
I'll call him!

1440
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,500
My fucking batteries!

1441
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:11,200
- No, you muppet!
- Give me the phone! Give me the fucking phone!

1442
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,700
- I'll dial it!
- Tell me the number!

1443
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,600
- Now give me your phone!
- You'll break it!

1444
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,900
- You give me the phone!
- You'll break it and it'll be fucked!

1445
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,300
You shut it. It's fucking ringing!

1446
