1
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:33,774
<i>It's an important and popular fact</i>

2
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:37,785
<i>that things are not always
what they seem. </i>

3
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:41,653
<i>For instance, on the planet Earth,
man had always assumed</i>

4
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:45,318
<i>that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet,</i>

5
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:48,090
<i>instead of the third most intelligent. </i>

6
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,658
<i>The second most intelligent creatures
were dolphins, who, curiously enough,</i>

7
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,671
<i>had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth. </i>

8
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,071
<i>They'd made many attempts
to alert mankind,</i>

9
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,167
<i>but most of their communications
were misinterpreted</i>

10
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:05,736
<i>as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for tidbits. </i>

11
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:10,308
<i>So they eventually decided they would
leave Earth by their own means. </i>

12
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,617
<i>The last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted</i>

13
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,920
<i>as a sophisticated attempt
to do a backward somersault</i>

14
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:20,052
<i>through a hoop, whistling
The Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

15
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,891
<i>In fact, the message was this:</i>

16
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,898
<i>"So long and thanks for all the fish. "</i>

17
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:05,190
<i> The extraordinary story
of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>

18
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:06,955
<i>begins very simply. </i>

19
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,930
<i>It begins with a man. </i>

20
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,966
Ooh!

21
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,939
<i>An Earthman, to be precise. </i>

22
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>Who no more knows his destiny,</i>

23
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:26,203
<i>than a tea leaf knows the history
of the East India Company. </i>

24
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,315
<i>His name is Arthur Dent. </i>

25
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:34,686
<i>He is a five-foot-eight-inch-tall
ape descendant</i>

26
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,783
<i>and someone is trying to drive
a bypass through his house. </i>

27
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,226
What do I want you to do about it?
Find him

28
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:50,328
and tell him I'm currently lying
flat on my back in front of...

29
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,703
Fine, I'll hold.

30
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,503
You can't lie in front
of the bulldozers for ever.

31
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,703
I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

32
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:00,111
This bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built.

33
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:04,242
- Why has it got to be built?
- It's a bypass.

34
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:08,881
You've got to build bypasses. Besides,
you should've protested months ago.

35
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,358
The plans have been on display
at the planning office for a year.

36
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:15,124
On display?
I had to go down to a cellar.

37
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,566
Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer

38
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,104
if I just let it roll straight over you?

39
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:27,298
- How much?
- None at all.

40
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:30,209
<i> By a strange coincidence,
none at all</i>

41
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,010
<i>is exactly how much suspicion
ape-descendant Arthur had</i>

42
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,880
<i>that one of his closest friends</i>

43
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,648
<i>was not descended from an ape,
but was, in fact, from a small planet</i>

44
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:43,055
<i>somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. </i>

45
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,351
Arthur! Arthur!

46
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,225
- Ford!
- Yes?

47
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:49,764
Here.

48
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,231
Ah, there you are!

49
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,131
Eat, drink. We gotta talk.

50
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:56,433
Now's not the best time.
They're going to demolish my home.

51
00:05:56,505 --> 00:06:00,942
Whoa! You already...
You already know? How?

52
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,943
What do you m...?

53
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,808
Oh, they, they? When you say
"they" you mean they? Got it.

54
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:12,582
Listen. I got somethin' important
I gotta tell you. Right now.

55
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,122
Well, what about my house?

56
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:25,123
Workers of the Earth, I bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer!

57
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,542
- Good. Let's go to the pub.
- Huh?

58
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:40,582
They won't demolish it
until they've finished the beers.

59
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:43,082
- Can we trust 'em?
- To the end of the Earth.

60
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,550
- How far's that?
- About 12 minutes away.

61
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,678
Huh?

62
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,790
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

63
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,791
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

64
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,759
Six pints coming up.

65
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:56,524
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.

66
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:59,965
Three pints each? At lunchtime?

67
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:11,536
Sorry. Ah. Time is an illusion.

68
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,740
Lunchtime, doubly so.

69
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,683
And eat those peanuts,
because you'll need the salt.

70
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,415
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...

71
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:26,050
What if I told you
I really wasn't from Guildford?

72
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:30,531
I was from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

73
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,725
Is that something
you're likely to say?

74
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,166
Remember when we met?

75
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:42,336
Out the way!

76
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:47,007
- Oof!
- Hi.

77
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:50,108
Wasn't it strange I was trying
to shake hands with a car?

78
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,743
I assumed you were drunk.

79
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:55,915
I thought cars were the dominant
life form. I was introducing myself.

80
00:07:56,024 --> 00:08:00,461
You saved my life. And now
I'm saving yours. Please drink.

81
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,862
It must be Thursday. I could never get
the hang of Thursdays.

82
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:07,333
- If this is about your house...
- No, it's not about the house.

83
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,433
- Who's he?
- She. She.

84
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:17,171
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy-dress party.

85
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,673
<i> I hate those kind of parties. </i>

86
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,683
<i>I'd rather have stayed at home
and ironed my hankies. </i>

87
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,913
<i>- But there I was. 
- Who are you?</i>

88
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,750
<i>- Oh!
- And there she was. </i>

89
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:32,556
- Uh, Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Oh, no. I mean, who are you?

90
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:35,893
Oh, the costume? Right.
"Livingstone, I presume!"

91
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:41,401
Yeah, it's not as clever as Darwin,
but the best I could do at short notice.

92
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,495
You're the first to get that right.

93
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,403
- Really?
- Yes. Everyone calls me Santa.

94
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,000
- Right.
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway.

95
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,738
So did I.

96
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,246
People at these parties
are drunken idiots.

97
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,748
What?

98
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:59,185
All these people are idiots!
God!

99
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,985
That's awkward.

100
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:04,855
Tell me.

101
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,526
She was amazing though, Ford.

102
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,623
<i>Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon. </i>

103
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:17,331
Uh, without the beard,
you look at least 80 years younger.

104
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,169
Maybe I'm de-evolving.

105
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,845
Well, I should tell you
that I do not date

106
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:28,644
single-celled organisms, okay?

107
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,548
Let's go somewhere.

108
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:37,786
Yeah. Definitely.
Um, where do you have in mind?

109
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,818
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?

110
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:45,230
No, it's a country
off the coast of Africa.

111
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,303
That Madagascar?
Why are we waiting here?

112
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:51,429
Wait a sec.

113
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,064
Go.

114
00:09:56,211 --> 00:10:00,705
God, you're serious.
Um, I can't go to Madagascar.

115
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,842
- Why not?
- Because, I just, you know...

116
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,318
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,050
I want to go somewhere I've never been
and I'd like to go with you, so...

118
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:11,820
...what do you say, Dr Livingstone?

119
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:17,762
I say that's
an extraordinary proposition.

120
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,858
I can't go. I mean, I've got a job.

121
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,199
Quit. Get a new one
when you come back.

122
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,296
I don't even know your real name.
Ow! Ow!

123
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,740
- Tricia McMillan.
- Well, Tricia McMillan.

124
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,246
Um, I have a proposition for you.

125
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:39,253
Why don't we go somewhere
a little closer first, say Cornwall,

126
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:43,257
and we'll see how it goes.

127
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:47,887
Right, of course, Cornwall.

128
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,193
Hey, excuse me.

129
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,591
Is this guy boring you?

130
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,229
Why don't you talk to me instead?

131
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:00,604
I'm from a different planet.

132
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,441
It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

133
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,612
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat-up line is that?

134
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,883
Mm, that does happen.

135
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:17,925
Speaking of...

136
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:20,290
We've got two minutes.
Drink up.

137
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,363
That's my house.

138
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:34,199
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone, on me.

139
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,972
You really think
the world's going to end?

140
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,569
Yes.

141
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:43,107
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

142
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:46,153
- If you like.
- Will it help?

143
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:48,917
Not at all. See you.

144
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,218
Last orders!

145
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,873
- What is that?
- Run!

146
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,912
Look out!

147
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,769
Aha! Towel!

148
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,834
Arthur!

149
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,880
What the hell are those things?

150
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:49,508
Yeow! They're ships
from a Vogon constructor fleet.

151
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,781
I picked up their signal this morning.
You'll need this.

152
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:57,384
- What are you doing?
- We're hitching a ride.

153
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,221
Um, people of Earth,

154
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,768
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the
Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.

155
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,428
As you are probably aware,

156
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:13,099
plans for the development of the
outlying regions of the galaxy

157
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,736
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

158
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:22,010
<i>And your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition. </i>

159
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,549
<i>There's no point
acting surprised about it. </i>

160
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:35,152
<i>The plans have been on display</i>

161
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:38,994
<i>at your local planning office
in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years. </i>

162
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:43,865
<i>If you can't be bothered with
local affairs, that's your lookout. </i>

163
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:46,407
Apathetic bloody planet.

164
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,500
I've no sympathy at all.

165
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:40,115
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

166
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,179
<i>is a wholly remarkable book. </i>

167
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:45,522
<i>Perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful,</i>

168
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:49,689
<i>ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor. </i>

169
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:53,063
<i>More popular than
The Celestial Homecare Omnibus,</i>

170
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,934
<i>better selling than
53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity,</i>

171
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,030
<i>and more controversial than
Oolon Colluphid's trilogy</i>

172
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:03,271
<i>of philosophical blockbusters,
Where God Went Wrong,</i>

173
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,869
Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes,

174
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:08,279
<i>and Who Is This God Person Anyway?</i>

175
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,085
<i>It's already supplanted
the Encyclopedia Galactica</i>

176
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:15,156
<i>as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom</i>

177
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:17,817
<i>for two important reasons. </i>

178
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,486
<i>First, it's slightly cheaper,</i>

179
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,689
<i>and second, it has the words
"Don't Panic"</i>

180
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:27,257
<i>printed in large,
friendly letters on its cover. </i>

181
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:38,675
So you're not from Guildford?

182
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:42,874
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

183
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,751
Um, you're not an out-of-work actor,

184
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:52,282
but rather a writer for this,
this book thing.

185
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,794
Good, huh?

186
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,297
I don't feel well.
I need a cup of tea.

187
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:00,766
If I asked where we were,
would I regret it?

188
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:04,100
- We're safe for now.
- Good.

189
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:08,039
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

190
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,635
- Oh, get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...

191
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:16,308
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.

192
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,056
You don't remember.

193
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:30,496
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell
you. It's unfortunate, but it's true.

194
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,762
Your home planet has been blown up.

195
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,444
Huh, blown up.

196
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,510
Couldn't you have done something?

197
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:57,615
I saved your life.
Okay, that makes us even.

198
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:01,661
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here, you've...

199
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:05,392
...gotta know where your towel is.

200
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,992
Okay, give me a hand over here.

201
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:14,465
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

202
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,635
Before the Vogons find us.

203
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,737
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

204
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,147
Huh?

205
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:28,886
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

206
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,821
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

207
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,653
Vogons.

208
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:39,866
<i> Vogons are one of the
most unpleasant races in the galaxy. </i>

209
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:44,268
<i>Not evil, but bad-tempered,
bureaucratic, officious and callous. </i>

210
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,866
<i>They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers</i>

211

213
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:57,148
<i>queried, lost, found,

214
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,686
<i>lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months</i>

215
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,588
<i>and recycled as firelighters. </i>

216
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:09,727
<i>On no account should you allow
a Vogon to read poetry to you. </i>

217
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:15,962
They can't think or imagine.
Most can't spell. They just run things.

218
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,631
Hmm?

219
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,268
And if we don't get a ride soon,

220
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,780
we won't need the Guide to tell us
how unpleasant the Vogons are.

221
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,215
They've already destroyed
a planet today.

222
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,617
That always makes them a little eee!

223
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,687
Ughh! What is that?

224
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,787
- Put this in your ear.
- Huh?

225
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:50,436
<i> We have unwittingly
picked up a couple of hitchhikers. </i>

226
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:53,201
The fish is translating for you.

227
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,303
<i> The Babel fish
is small, yellow, leech-like,</i>

228
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:01,747
<i>and probably the oddest thing
in the universe. </i>

229
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:06,276
<i>It feeds on brainwave energy,
absorbing unconscious frequencies,</i>

230
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,914
<i>and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies</i>

231
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,252
<i>to the speech centers of the brain. </i>

232
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,886
<i>The practical upshot of which is that,
if you stick one in your ear,</i>

233
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:20,560
<i>you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language. </i>

234
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,144
Resistance is useless.

235
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,041
- All right.
- Someone's coming.

236
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,551
Here we go. Look lively.

237
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,674
Wheee!

238
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:10,182
Ha, ha!

239
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,553
- Hmmm.
- Sir.

240
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:21,390
- What?
- Hitchhikers.

241
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:04,033
"O freddled gruntbuggly... "

242
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,665
No, really, you don't have to read.

243
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,470
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

244
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:14,708
"... as plerdled gabbleblotchits

245

<i> Vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe. </i>

246
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:24,553
<i> The second worst
is that of the Azgoths of Kria. </i>

247
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,186
<i>During a recitation by their
Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent,</i>

<i>of his poem
Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty</i>

I Found in my Armpit
One Midsummer Morning,

250
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:37,198
<i>four of his audience
died of internal hemorrhaging,</i>

251
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:40,832
<i>and the President of the
Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council</i>

252
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,308

00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,351
"... with my blurgle... "

255
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:55,855
<i> The absolute worst poetry was
by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex. </i>

256
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:58,448
<i>Luckily, it was destroyed
when the Earth was. </i>

257
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,223
"See if I don't. " Yeah.

258
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:10,803
So, Earthlings,
I present you with a choice.

259
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:14,000
Either die in the vacuum of space,

260
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:18,909
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

261
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:24,451
A... a... actually, I rather liked it.

262
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,553
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

263
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,350
- That's good. Run with it.
- Hmmm.

264
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,857
Uh, some of the words
I didn't understand,

265
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:35,360
but I found the imagery quite effective.

266
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,595
Continue.

267
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:41,362
Well, uh, yes,
interesting rhythmic devices,

268
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,903
which seemed to counterpoint

269
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:46,667
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of...

270
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,972
- Vogonity!
- Vogonity, sorry, vogonity...

271
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:53,377
of the poet's soul.

272
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:00,213
So what you're saying is,

273
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,882
I write poetry because

274
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,393
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

275
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:11,420
I just want to be loved?

276
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,758
Yes, yes, yes.

277
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:17,270
Yes, yes, yeah, please.

278
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:22,799
Ahh, ooh, ooh, mmm.

279
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:24,502
Throw them off the ship!

280
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,979
- No! No!
- Ford. Ford!

281
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,539
Ahh!

282
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,914
All right! All right!

283
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:35,547
Resistance is useless!

284
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,754
Shut up! Get a job!
Wash your filthy hands!

285
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:45,560
Don't panic. Don't panic.

286
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:51,663
So this is it?
We're going to die?

287
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:55,367
Yeah, we're gonna die.

288
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:58,411
No, no, what's this?

289
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,106
What is this?

290
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:04,548
What's this? This is... nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

291
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,289
You're sweating.

292
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:27,837
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

293

<i>where Arthur went to a fancy dress party</i>

307
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:27,331
<i>and met a very nice young woman
whom he totally blew it with. </i>

308
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:34,865
<i>Though the planet Earth,
the Islington flat and telephone</i>

309
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:40,608
<i>have all now been demolished, Ford
and Arthur were, in fact, rescued. </i>

310
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,514
- Ford?
- Yes.

311
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,680
- I think I'm a sofa.
- I know how you feel.

312
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,825
So much for the laws of physics.

313
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:59,763
<i> And our top story. </i>

314
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:04,133
<i>The sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe,</i>

315
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:06,172
<i>the starship Heart of Gold. </i>

316
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,765
<i>Stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other</i>

317
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,709
<i>than Galactic President
Zaphod Beeblebrox. </i>

318
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:17,079
<i> In the name of people, freedom,
and, uh... democracy, stuff like that,</i>

319
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:21,247
<i>I hereby kidnap myself
and I'm taking the ship with me. Whoo!</i>

320
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:23,347
<i>Come on!</i>

321
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,892
<i> Beeblebrox,
universally considered</i>

322
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,929
<i>to be the dimmest star
in several solar systems,</i>

323
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:32,692
<i>is most famous for his controversial
defeat of Humma Kavula</i>

324
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,759
<i>who claimed many thought they were
voting for the worst-dressed being</i>

325
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:39,829
<i>in the universe contest. </i>

326
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,032
Great.

327
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,009
<i>Kavula is best remembered
for his slanderous</i>

328
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,705
<i>"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign. </i>

329
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:50,273
Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.

330
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:54,754
If there's anything more important than
my ego, I want it caught and shot now.

331
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:56,550
Come on, I love it.

332
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,650
<i> Zaphod's just this guy, you know. </i>

333
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:03,586
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What d'you...?

334
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:07,963
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.

335
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,629
Hitchhikers?
Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

336
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:12,604
I didn't. The ship did.

337
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,970
What? Wh... wh... Say what?

338
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:19,672
When we engaged the
Improbability Drive... The big button.

339
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,580
- I know.
- They were picked up here.

340
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,211
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Wait.
That's where you picked me up.

341
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,254
- On Earth.
- That's impossible.

342
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:31,655
- No, just very improbable.
- Listen. I don't have time for this.

343
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:36,024
We've got the police of half the galaxy
after us. We've stopped for hitchhikers.

344
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,497
So ten out of ten for style, but...

345
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,000
...minus several million
for good thinking.

346
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:44,367
You're too gorgeous, baby, stop it.
You drive me crazy.

347
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,805
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

348
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:50,805
Marvin.

349
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,883
You ought to know,
I'm feeling very depressed.

350
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:01,351
Well, we have something
that should take your mind off things.

351
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:06,154
It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

352
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:12,166
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

353
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:15,099
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

354
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:18,501
Just that? I won't enjoy it.

355
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, well, that's life.

356
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:25,574
Life?
Don't talk to me about life.

357
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,223
<i>-  Commander Kwaltz. 
- Yes.</i>

358
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,625
<i> We have located the spaceship
Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox. </i>

359
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:45,893
<i>- Where?
- Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. </i>

360
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,457
<i>Requesting hyperspace clearance. </i>

361
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:54,508
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

362
00:29:54,575 --> 00:30:00,309
<i>- Yes, sir. 
- Get me Vice-President Questular.</i>

363
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:06,515
<i>Hyperspace permission granted, captain. </i>

364
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,952
Here we go.

365
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:33,274
I think that door just sighed.

366
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,815
Ghastly, isn't it?

367
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:38,283
All the doors have been programmed

368
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:41,583
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition.

369
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:48,558
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

370
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:52,388
Please yourselves.

371
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:55,697
Here I am,
brain the size of a planet,

372
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,329
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge.

373
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:01,930
Call that job satisfaction?
'Cause I don't.

374
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:07,036
You can thank the Sirius Cybernetics
Corp. For building robots with G.P.P.

375
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:11,312
- What's G.P.P.?
- Genuine People Personalities.

376
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:15,855
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

377
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:23,526
Arthur?

378
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:29,027
<i> Hey, Slim, are you wearing
my underwear? 'Cause I'm wearing yours. </i>

379
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,901
<i>And they ain't doing the trick. 
Come on. All right. </i>

380
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:38,070
Oh, for heaven's sake.

381
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:41,012
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

382
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,208
Ah-ha! Ow!

383
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,342
Freeze!

384
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:48,979
Freeze?
I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

385
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:52,651
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- Oh, why do I bother?

386
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,523
- Zaphod?
- Ford!

387
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:59,065
Is that you?
Ford! Praxibetel Ix!

388
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,158
What the hell are you doing here?

389
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,671
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.

390
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,570
- That is so you.
- Look at you!

391
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:12,077
President of the Galaxy.
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

392
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,807
You zarkin' frood.

393
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:18,284
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

394
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:19,409
Oh.

395
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:24,480
President of the Galaxy. This is my
cousin. He's a semi-half brother...

396
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,153
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We've met.

397
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:33,723
Have we? I'm sorry.
I've got a terrible memory for species.

398
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:38,135
This is him, Ford. The would-you-like-
to-see-my-spaceship bloke.

399
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:39,638
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

400
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:44,974
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia!

401
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,411
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian.

402
00:32:47,514 --> 00:32:51,314
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

403
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:54,183
- Hi.
- Hi.

404
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:58,281
Um, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

405
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,590
You went down on that little planet
and didn't call me?

406
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:04,562
Sorry, I didn't know.
I had a galaxy to run.

407
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,896
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

408
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:10,164
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

409
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,762
I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.

410
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:15,466
Right. I was thinking
of changing mine to,

411
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,533
I don't know, Arthoolia.

412
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:21,638
That's a good one.
Well, this is weird.

413
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,276
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.

414
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:28,981
- Right. In your pajamas?
- I was in a hurry.

415
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:31,182
Okay. Did you know I was here?

416
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:33,954
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

417
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,756
Yeah, that's kinda like
the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

418
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,923
Okay, um, look.

419
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:42,833
I left you at the party. I feel bad, but
I was gonna call you when I got back.

420
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,905
Well, there is no
going back now, is there?

421
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,598
You do know what happened?

422
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,507
Enough small talk.
We're on the run, remember?

423
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,512
Excuse me, we're having a chat.

424
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:56,081
Well, I think the girl's getting...
Boo!

425
00:33:56,183 --> 00:34:01,450
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut
your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

426
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:03,147
- You wanna fight?
- Okay.

427
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,021
- No. No.
- I'm just kidding.

428
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:09,529
I'm a kidder. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

429
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,365
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

430
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:15,925
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah!

431
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:19,500
Teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

432
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,972
He's a guest on my ship!

433
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:25,001
I thought you said you stole it.

434
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,547
Stole what?
What are we talking about?

435
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:33,177
Whoa! That doesn't sound good.

436
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:41,125
- Are you okay?
- Just fabulous, thanks, "Trill".

437
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:43,992
A little help over here.
I'm in over my head.

438
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:47,464
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

439
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:48,830
Yes, I do!

440
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,097
Hey, this is really pretty.

441
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,731
- Don't!
- Whoo! They're on our tail.

442
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:56,206
Fire a gun. Launch a missile.
Do some damage!

443
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,743
Ow! Stop that! Ow!

444
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,912
Just kiddin'. I love it rough. Hit me.

445
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:11,924
<i>- Uh, computer?
-  Hi, there. </i>

446
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:14,085
<i>I'm Eddie, your computer. </i>

447
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:17,959
<i>I'm pleased to report that it's
a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers. </i>

448
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:20,329
<i>They're sending you a message. </i>

449

<i>This is Vice-President Questular Rontok. </i>

450
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:26,272
<i>I am speaking to the kidnapper
of the President?</i>

451
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,533
She digs me.

452
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,836
<i>Surrender the stolen vessel at once</i>

453
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:35,404
<i>or we will take action
as defined and permitted by... </i>

455
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:42,920
<i>Zaphod, please come back now. 
This is ridiculous. </i>

456
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,754
Leap to hyperspace! Come on!

457
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,453
<i> Sure thing, fella!</i>

458
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,468
No.

459
00:35:56,603 --> 00:36:02,007
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorization?

460
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:05,943
- No, commander.
- Oh.

461
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:11,451
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

462
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:14,385
I'm coming, sir.

463
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:21,187
I'm boiling!
Oh, oh. Here's the form, sir.

464
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:26,128
So are you along for the ride
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

465
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:29,566
That depends. Where are you going?

466
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:31,627
Where am I going?

467
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:37,166
- You okay?
- Yeah. Don't suppose there's any tea.

468
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:40,371
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

469
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:44,907
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

470

<i> The best drink in existence

473
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:04,536
- Belgium. Hold it one second.
- Belgium.

474
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,406
Ape-man, Earth dude, sorry,
what's your name again?

475
00:37:08,508 --> 00:37:10,942
- Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

476
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:14,445
No hard feelings, okay?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

477
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:16,311
- Earth.
- Yeah. I liked Earth.

478
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:19,352
Got these boots there.
But don't mention it to the girl.

479
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:23,219
Because if you do... I'll pull your
spleen out through your throat.

480
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,225
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- Okay.

481
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:29,319
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

482
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:35,158
Hey, hey, Zaphod,
what's with the two-head thing?

483
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:39,895
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't be
president with a whole brain.

484
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,998
It's crazy.

485
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,236
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

486
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:48,441
Parts of my personality weren't exactly
what you'd call presidential.

487
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:50,483
You know what I'm talkin' about.

488
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,748
<i> Your tea is ready. </i>

489
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:13,465
I suppose I should've said
it resembles tea.

490
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:16,303
So, two heads
is what does it for a girl?

491
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,776
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or three...

492
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:20,972
Or your own spaceship.

493
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,845
Anything else he's got two of?

494
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,408
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

495
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:30,751
What am I supposed to be like?
Green? Bleeping?

496
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,622
I can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like.

497
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:37,561
Okay, look. Do you see this?

498
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:41,691
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

499
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:44,032
<i> Enjoy your doughnut. </i>

500
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:50,504
Do you see this?

501
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:59,375
This toasts bread
while you're slicing it.

502
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:05,256
We're on a spaceship, Arthur. In space.

503
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,293
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

504
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:14,596
That was... some sort of test.
And I failed.

505
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:18,160
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

506
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:20,297
No, I mean your chin.

507
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:22,568
- Ah...
- I might have an aspirin.

508
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:24,041
Right.

509
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,905
Hey!

510
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:35,849
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

511
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:39,221
- Please, don't.
- Showtime, Trill.

512
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,491
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

513
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:50,263
Buttons aren't toys.

514
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:53,431
Anyway... When I saw
what I'm about to show you,

515
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:58,171
that's when I realized
why I had to do what I did to my brain.

516
00:39:58,278 --> 00:40:01,406
I think. It's all a little...

517
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:03,239
...shaky.

518
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,882
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

519
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,446
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

520
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:15,290
<i> Many millions of years ago,</i>

521
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:18,798
<i>a race of hyper intelligent,
pan-dimensional beings</i>

522
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:22,801
<i>got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life,</i>

523
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:25,861
<i>that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best</i>

524
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:29,271
<i>to design and build
a stupendous super-computer</i>

525
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:33,745
<i>to calculate the answer to life,
the universe and everything. </i>

526
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,806
O Deep Thought,

527
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:41,149
we want you to tell us the answer.

528
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:43,484
<i> The answer to what?</i>

529
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,186
The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

530
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:52,356
We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

531
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:55,128
<i>Hmm, I'd have to think about that. </i>

532
00:40:55,202 --> 00:41:02,040
Return to this place in exactly
seven-and-a-half million years.

533
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:05,839
- Is it finished?
- No, there's more. They go back.

534
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:11,009
- Seven-and-a-half million years later?
- That's right, they do.

535
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:30,192
Deep Thought, do you have...

536
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,707
<i> An answer for you?
Yes, but you're not going to like it. </i>

537
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,936
<i>- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- All right. </i>

538
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:41,947
<i>The answer to the ultimate question... </i>

539
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,546
<i>... of life, the universe
and everything... </i>

540
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,314
<i>... is... </i>

541
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,722
<i>... 42.</i>

542
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,528
Yeah? What?

543
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:04,195
42?

544
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:08,435
<i> Yes, I thought it over
quite thoroughly. It's 42.</i>

545
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,806
<i>It would've been simpler
to have known what the question was. </i>

546
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:16,781
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything!

547
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,750
<i>That's not a question. </i>

548
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:22,583
<i>Only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means. </i>

549
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:27,286
<i>- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can't. But there is one who can. </i>

550
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:31,330
<i>A computer that will calculate
the ultimate question. </i>

551
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:34,025
<i>A computer of such infinite complexity,</i>

552
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:38,195
<i>that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix. </i>

553
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:42,434
<i>And you yourselves shall take on new,
more primitive forms,</i>

554
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:48,276
<i>and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10-million-year program. </i>

555
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:52,112
<i>I shall design this computer for you,
and it shall be called... </i>

556
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:01,185
- That's it?
- That's it.

557
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:05,128
You're looking for
the ultimate question? You? Why?

558
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:07,995
I tried that.
Why? 42. Doesn't work.

559
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:10,968
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why...

560
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:14,598
...do you want to know
the ultimate question?

561
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:17,234
Partly curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

562
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:20,778
but, uh, mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

563
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:23,008
You're President of the Galaxy.

564
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:24,981
- Yes, Arman.
- Arthur.

565
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:27,451
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.

566
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,320
I find the question, that's permanent.
It sticks.

567
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:33,915
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep.
Win-win.

568
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:39,360
We just hit that button and bam,
we're at Magrathea, I think.

569
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,629
We've hit it twice and
we're still not there, but anyway...

570
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,136
- You in?
- Always.

571
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,036
- All right!
- Uh, I want to get off.

572
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:51,566
- Uh, sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This!

573
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:59,513
<i> The Infinite Improbability Drive

<i>almost simultaneously. </i>

581
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,875
<i>It's therefore important

582

<i>The Drive was invented following

<i>Many physicists said they
wouldn't stand for that sort of thing,</i>

588

<i>partly because it debased science,</i>

589

<i>but mostly because they didn't get

Wow, is this gonna happen

Very probably, yes.

592

Ah, I think
the Earthman's about to be sick.

593
00:45:06,419 --> 00:45:09,252
In the trashcan, ape-man.

Aw, come on!

00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,617

00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:39,042
<i>but this is not Magrathea. </i>

604
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:42,951
<i>We are currently in orbit around
the planet Viltvodle Six. </i>

605
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:46,788
Humma Kavula!

606
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,797
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

607
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:56,864
Humma Kavula!

608
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:04,038
<i> In the beginning,
the universe was created. </i>

609
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:08,945
<i>This made a lot of people very angry,
and is widely regarded as a bad move. </i>

610
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:14,349
<i>Many races believed it was created
by some sort of god,</i>

611
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:17,014
<i>though the Jatravartid people
of Viltvodle Six</i>

612
00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:22,060
<i>firmly believe that the entire universe
was sneezed out of the nose of a being</i>

613
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:24,960
<i>called the Great Green Arkleseizure. </i>

614
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:26,692
Humma Kavula!

615
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,131
<i> The Jatravartids,
who lived in fear</i>

616
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:32,694
<i>of the time they called the
Coming of the Great White Handkerchief,</i>

617
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:36,538
<i>were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each. </i>

618
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:39,203
<i>They were unique in being
the only race in history</i>

619
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:42,976
<i>to have invented
the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. </i>

620
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,909
Mr. President!

621
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:48,715
Hey, all right. How you doin'?

622
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:51,449
Hey, what have we here? I love it!

623
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,455
Hey, I love you. Fantastic!

624
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:01,193
You guys related? Don't go changing.

625
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:03,360
Arthur, I want a drink.

626
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:07,600
I think I've been here before.
Have I been here before?

627
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:13,270
Ixxie!

628
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:16,371
- I've been here before.
- Humma Kavula!

629
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,246
Come on.

630
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,116
Tricia! Tricia, I...

631
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,547
Hello, Humma.

632
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,422
- Join us. Sit down.
- Good to see you. Thanks. All right.

633
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,617
The handkerchief is coming.

634
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:05,596
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

635
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:11,203
So that's Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.

636
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:16,204
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown,

637
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:18,402
in reverence to you.

638
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:25,116
Send the handkerchief, O Blessed One,
so that it may wipe us clean.

639
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:30,884
We ask this and all things
in Thy precious and alliterative name.

640
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:41,697
Bless you.

641
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:44,501
We goin' in here?

642
00:48:44,604 --> 00:48:48,438
All right, I like it. It's big,
it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants.

643
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:52,035
Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous President.

644
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:54,841
What brings you to our humble planet?

645
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:57,472
Oh, I think you know
why I'm here.

646
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,108
No, I don't think I do.

647
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:05,680
I think you think you don't.
But we both know... you do.

648
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:07,522
Eloquent as always.

649
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:11,461
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

650
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,625
That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

651
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,135
when you were my opponent
running against me,

652
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:20,138
you said I was stupid.

653
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:44,263
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

654
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:47,563
...if memory serves, you won,

655
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:50,966
proving that good looks
and charm win

656
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:55,974
over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

657
00:50:00,246 --> 00:50:03,511
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

658
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,143
Excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir.

659
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:10,450
Uh, I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix up

660
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:12,889
'cause, actually, he's not with us.

661
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:15,927
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

662
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:18,759
He grew, didn't he. He's not that tall.

663
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:23,859
You didn't come half-way across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge.

664
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:27,396
Why are you here?

665
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:31,670
Of course not,
that's, that's ridiculous.

666
00:50:31,744 --> 00:50:37,376
I've been stranded on a strange planet
for years, I haven't been avoiding you.

667
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,476
You look great. You're doing well.

668
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:42,247
You've grown, obviously.

669
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:46,416
- Aggh! Oomph!
- Wait! We don't know why we're here.

670
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:50,087
We were trying to get to Magrathea
and our ship brought us here.

671
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:55,155
How very, very improbable.

672
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:05,441
I kept a few souvenirs
from my former life.

673
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:08,412
Ah, the heady days of space piracy.

674
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:16,184
But... even an Infinite Improbability
Drive requires coordinates.

675
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,723
Which I happen to have.

676
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,417
No, no, no.

677
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,960
You don't get something
for nothing, Zaphod.

678
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:25,690
You must bring me something in return.

679
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:28,699
- Wh... What?
- A gun.

680
00:51:28,768 --> 00:51:30,759
- A gun?
- A very special gun.

681
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,136
Designed by the greatest computer
ever invented.

682
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:37,176
But the only way to find it
is to go to Magrathea.

683
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:41,736
Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

684
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:44,612
And what will you give me
to ensure your return?

685
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:47,851
My word as President.

686
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:52,646
No. I need a hostage.

687
00:51:55,194 --> 00:52:02,362
Only... what does
Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

688
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:08,165
Come on.

689
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:13,042
Oh, no!

690
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,943
Hey, take it easy now.

691
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:19,178
No, stop it.
Ah! Oh, that kind of tickles.

692
00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:22,846
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.

693
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:26,722
You need me!

694
00:52:26,826 --> 00:52:31,024
Come back! Come back!
Don't leave me alone.

695
00:52:33,982 --> 00:52:35,973
Come back!

696
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:39,917
I thought I alone
considered your boyfriend

697
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:42,684
a narcissistic moron,
but the whole galaxy does.

698
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:45,590
What about you?
"Excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir. "

699
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,097
"We're not with him. We just came
to worship you. " Very brave.

700
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:54,464
Where the hell is Ford?

701
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:02,700
By the left, march.
Left, right, left, right.

702
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:07,008
Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

703
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:10,780
Fire upon the kidnapper!

704
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:12,251
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

705
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,914
The President is the kidnapper.
You'll kill him!

706
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:16,917
Bang! Bang!

707
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:18,959
It's locked!

708
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:24,229
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

709
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:31,995
Come on, Zaphod.

710
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,274
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?

711
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:41,838
Field research. So they found
where we are? Belgium bummer!

712
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,680
They're shooting at us!
What are we going to do?

713
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:48,085
- I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?

714
00:53:48,156 --> 00:53:50,624
What? He's the one they want.

715
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:52,989
You can't go out there.
What are you doing?

716
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:57,231
- Back off!
- What's going on?

717
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,199
I have the President
and I will kill him, I swear.

718
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,229
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

719
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,501
- It's an aerosol can.
- Oh.

720
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:12,103
Okay, frightened now,
frightened.

721
00:54:12,747 --> 00:54:16,205
- Hi, little guy.
- Get her!

722
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:19,276
- Zaphod, no, come on!
- Arthur!

723
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:22,921
- Arthur!
- Tricia!

724
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,982
- Arthur!
- Tricia! Wait!

725
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,461
Arthur!

726
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:44,110
Resistance is useless!

727
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:56,953
<i> Bring her to Vogsphere
for processing, captain. </i>

728
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,460
Where's the circus?

729
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:03,190
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go!

730
00:55:03,264 --> 00:55:04,731
Let's go!

731
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:10,364
Whoo! Computer, take us to Magrathea!

732
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,906
What? No, no, no.
We've got to go after Tricia.

733
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:14,407
- Who?
- Trillian.

734
00:55:14,475 --> 00:55:18,002
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git!

735
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:21,206
Right, you're coming out!

736
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:25,218
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea, we want to follow the ships.

737
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:28,949
<i> I'd love to, but my
guidance system has been deactivated. </i>

738
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:30,148
Oh, come on!

739
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:32,658
<i> I'm sorry. 
It wasn't my fault. </i>

740
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,785
What you doing on this ship?

741
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,488
- Ford?
- Marvin.

742
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:38,997
I've been talking
to the ship's computer.

743
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,795
And?

744
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:42,392
It hates me.

745
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,705
No, uh-uh. Eddie, computer,

746
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:49,298
is there another way
to follow the ships?

747
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,870
<i> Activating Emergency Escape
Pod. It's super-neat and fun to fly!</i>

748
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:56,211
Ow!

749
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:57,784
Unbelievable!

750
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:02,221
I'm in. I'm in.
Okay, Ford, do you have any idea?

751
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:03,914
We'll press this.

752
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:06,118
Oh, no, no, no, no.

753
00:56:06,194 --> 00:56:09,186
- This button.
- Okay. Nothing's... Okay!

754
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:12,266
Good man, good man, good man.

755
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:15,962
- Okay, we're wobbling...
- You forgot your towel.

756
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:18,528
Get him off me! I'll kill him!

757
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,164
- Okay, Ford, there's a...
- Is that better?

758
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:23,243
No, that's worse, that's worse.

759
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:26,677
- Do what... I don't need that.
- Okay.

760
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:29,477
Stop the rocking.
Marvin, any ideas?

761
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,179
I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

762
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:34,686
Thanks, Marv.

763
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:51,667
Ooh, ooh. Eee. Ooh, ooh.

764
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,771
Whoo!

765
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:04,341
Whee! Whee!

766
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:15,023
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,831
- Magrathea!
- No, we're on the Vogon planet.

768
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:27,533
- Yes, it is. It's Magrathea!
- This is Vogsphere.

769
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:30,771
- Yeah, Magrathea. I know it.
- No, it's not.

770
00:57:30,878 --> 00:57:34,405
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is.

771
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:37,712
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

772
00:57:37,818 --> 00:57:40,651
They have these
on Arcturan mega freighters.

773
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:43,246
They use them when
they need to concentrate.

774
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:45,621
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

775
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:52,492
There you go.

776
00:57:56,537 --> 00:58:00,303
Should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

777
00:58:00,374 --> 00:58:04,811
Now I'm feeling
much better about our predicament.

778
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:29,296
I checked the Guide for how
to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

779
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,567
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

780
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,165
Well, I kind of had this idea
that we could... Ow!

781
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:39,475
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

782
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,480
- What was it?
- Uh...

783
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:45,882
Nothing, it's, uh, nothing.
It's just my imagination.

784
00:58:45,986 --> 00:58:50,252
Okay, right. Now, everyone just stop
a minute, please, and look at me.

785
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:55,227
There's... definitely
something going on here.

786
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:59,232
Just... just watch.

787
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,758
Just watch.

788
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:07,173
Okay, I think we...

789
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:09,333
- Oooh!
- Ah-ha! You too!

790
00:59:11,078 --> 00:59:13,410
Yeah, what was that?

791
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:15,573
I thi...

792
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:18,808
Zaphod, what do you think?

793
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:26,822
I think... Ow! Zarquon!
What was that? Jeez!

794
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:30,556
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

795
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:33,565
- No one ever does.
- I have an idea.

796
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,795
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Ford!
Kill it! Get rid of it!

797
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:48,012
Okay, don't think.

798
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:50,606
Nobody think. No ideas.

799
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,845
No theories. No nothing.

800
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,915
Ow!

801
00:59:59,026 --> 01:00:01,654
This is crazy.
Trillian is in there somewhere.

802
01:00:01,762 --> 01:00:06,597
- We need an idea to save her.
- I have an ide...

803
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,794
- Ah! Run!
- Yeeaaghh!

804
01:00:33,494 --> 01:00:35,860
Ooh! Ah!

805
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:40,259
You're supposed to stop.

806
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:53,776
Okay, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

807
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:59,745
Okay, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

808
01:00:59,854 --> 01:01:03,756
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

809
01:01:06,193 --> 01:01:08,320
Okay, where is she?!

810
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:14,131
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

811
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:20,330
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus
of... Blaard?

812
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:23,672
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

813
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:25,335
Oh. Right.

814
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:35,353
Sorry, no record of Earth.

815
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:39,222
Galactic sector
ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

816
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:42,762
- Oh, yes.
- She's lying.

817
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:47,598
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

818
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:51,466
- Mmmm.
- Here we are. Earth.

819
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:54,940
Oh. Um, "destroyed. "

820
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:58,476
Um, do you have
a second home planet?

821
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:02,106
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

822
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:07,347
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

823
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:17,993
Who in their right mind
gives an order to destroy a planet?

824
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,093
- He said the gray building, right?
- All the buildings are gray.

825
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:27,537
"Give me a hand. " Ha-ha, very funny.

826
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:31,100
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

827
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:38,708
Go and fill that in.

828
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:42,119
Then, make sure, when you fill in
the facilitating form...

829
01:02:42,222 --> 01:02:47,091
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

830
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:51,063
If you'd fill that form in for me,

831
01:02:51,131 --> 01:02:53,861
and return it as soon as possible.

832
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:58,303
- Writing implements to your left...
- You're President. Can you do anything?

833
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:03,274
Presidents don't have power. Their job
is to draw attention away from it.

834
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:07,405
Hey, how you doin'?

835
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:12,214
Hey, it's me, your President!
What's goin' on? Thanks for coming.

836
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:15,119
All right. I know that sponge.
All right!

837
01:03:15,222 --> 01:03:17,588
- Next!
- President coming through.

838
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:20,660
How you doin', Pinhead?
No, really, it's me.

839
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:23,359
I love kabuki. Look at that.

840
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,331
Out the way.

841
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:29,465
Give us a kiss!

842
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:33,439
Hi, I've come about
release of a prisoner.

843
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:37,238
Prisoner release form.

844
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:38,903
Oh, wha...?

845
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:41,209
I don't believe you.

846
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,909
These are the orders.

847
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:49,856
"Love and kisses"?!

848
01:03:49,957 --> 01:03:54,621
Mm. Now, according
to the Galactic Penal Code,

849
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:59,428
the punishment for
a presidential kidnapping

850
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:03,299
is to be fed to
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

851
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:06,139
Good day.

852
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,970
Ow, get off of me!

853
01:04:09,076 --> 01:04:12,705
Ow! What the hell is that?

854
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:19,184
Ow, no, wait, wait! There's been
some kind of mistake. Ah!

855
01:04:20,254 --> 01:04:25,886
- Tick all the boxes on the right.
- Right. Got it.

856
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:27,950
Not that one!

857
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:32,328
<i> What to do if you find yourself
stuck with no hope of rescue. </i>

858
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:36,802
<i>Consider how lucky you are
that life has been good to you so far. </i>

859
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,271
<i>Alternatively, if life
hasn't been good to you so far,</i>

860
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:43,537
<i>which, given your current circumstances
seems more likely,</i>

861
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:47,740
<i>consider how lucky you are that
it won't be troubling you much longer. </i>

862
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:54,086
Right, there we go.

863
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,588
Oh, kidnapping the President.

864
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:01,127
Oh, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

865
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:04,358
Okay. Right.
Look, this is the President.

866
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,592
- Oh!
- Okay. See, there?

867
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:10,330
He says the kidnapping business
was a horrible misunderstanding.

868
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:11,928
Oh, yeah.

869
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:15,736
She meant nothing by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

870
01:05:15,843 --> 01:05:20,576
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

871
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:23,878
Those are blue.

872
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:28,045
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Hold that. Okay. Wai...

873
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:36,789
Oh, he's hungry today.
Heh heh heh.

874
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:39,188
That's blue. Right.

875
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:44,404
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

876
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:47,736
Okay, this is, uh,
it's for Tricia McMillan.

877
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:52,108
Tricia McMillan. Mm. Okay.

878
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:57,477
Sir, it's a release form.

879
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:58,915
Thank you.

880
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:02,079
She's free to go.

881
01:06:02,189 --> 01:06:05,420
Release her.

882
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,894
Zaphod's here.
Well, then, uh, that's fine then.

883
01:06:10,998 --> 01:06:13,592
Let's just go and get him.

884
01:06:17,635 --> 01:06:20,331
Who are we waiting for again?

885
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:25,638
No, I'm serious.

886
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:30,610
Tricia!

887
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:36,211
- Tricia.
- Trill.

888
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:39,256
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot!

889
01:06:39,324 --> 01:06:41,349
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

890
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:43,258
- He did?
- I did?

891
01:06:43,362 --> 01:06:47,822
Yes. "Love and kisses, Zaphod"?
You didn't even read it, did you?

892
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,701
Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

893
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:56,638
An entire planet, my home,

894
01:06:56,709 --> 01:06:59,837
destroyed because you thought
they wanted your autograph.

895
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:02,710
- They framed me!
- Are you an idiot?

896
01:07:02,782 --> 01:07:06,718
- Trillian.
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

897
01:07:06,786 --> 01:07:10,882
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

898
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:16,087
Oh, a backbone? What about coming here
to rescue you? Thank you. My idea. Oh!

899
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:20,355
Stupid!

900
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:26,002
- Got your arm.
- How considerate.

901
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:30,405
Right, then, all those lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

902
01:07:45,826 --> 01:07:50,263
Oh, the President tests my patience.

903
01:07:50,363 --> 01:07:55,198
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

904
01:07:55,268 --> 01:07:58,203
Fantastic. At last.

905
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:06,802
Oh. That's one hour for lunch,
everybody.

906
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:11,105
I think I'll have soup today.

907
01:08:11,852 --> 01:08:15,379
<i>The Encyclopedia Galactica,
in its chapter on love,</i>

908
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:18,892
<i>states that it is
far too complicated to define. </i>

909
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,397
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide

913
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:35,665
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

914
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:38,040
I... I didn't...

915
01:08:38,112 --> 01:08:42,640
Um, look, uh...

916
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:45,652
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right,

917
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:50,588
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

918
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:55,061
Um, for what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling...

919
01:08:56,831 --> 01:09:01,165
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

920
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,629
Thank you.

921
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:07,698
Actually,
what I was going to say was...

922
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:14,074
...if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

923
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:18,017
then neither of us would be here now.

924
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,886
I just thought that might
count for something.

925
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,160
It doesn't matter.

926
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:55,816
All right, computer, take us to...
Where are we... Where we headed again?

927
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:59,350
Okay, I'm gonna get you
another lemon.

928
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,420

Incredible.

939
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:51,214
It's even worse
than I thought it would be.

940

- Zarkin' A, cousin.

946
01:11:14,905 --> 01:11:18,341
Okay, computer, keep going.

<i> I'd be happy to. </i>

<i>Impact minus 45 seconds. </i>

01:12:07,526 --> 01:12:11,792
<i> Sure. Handing over

962
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:25,238
I need some help.

963
01:12:25,344 --> 01:12:27,869
I can't do this without my third arm.

964
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:32,947
Arthur, grab my hand!

965
01:12:43,395 --> 01:12:47,126
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

966
01:12:49,768 --> 01:12:53,499
- Why don't I just press this?
- No, we're not back to normal yet.

967
01:12:53,573 --> 01:12:55,598
- What will happen?
- I don't know.

968
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:59,668
Don't do it! We're here.
No telling where it'll send us.

969
01:13:03,149 --> 01:13:04,616
- Sod it all.
- No!

970
01:13:08,622 --> 01:13:11,989
Wow. Where are we?

971
01:13:14,461 --> 01:13:19,160
Exactly where we were.

972
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:20,596
And the missiles?

973
01:13:21,668 --> 01:13:27,197
Apparently, they've turned...
into a bowl of petunias.

974
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:31,572
And a very surprised-looking whale.

975
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:38,982
<i> And an improbability factor
of 8,767, 128 to 1 against. </i>

976
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:42,754
We have norm... normality.

977
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:45,291
Normality, right.

978
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,294
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

979
01:13:49,463 --> 01:13:52,489
- What is normal?
- What's home?

980
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:54,294
What are cows?

981
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:58,370
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

982
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:02,705
<i> It is important to note that
suddenly, and against all probability,</i>

983

<i>a sperm whale had been
called into existence</i>

984
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:09,842
<i>several miles above
the surface of an alien planet. </i>

985
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:12,784
<i>Since this is not a tenable
position for a whale,</i>

986
01:14:12,853 --> 01:14:17,881
<i>this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity. </i>

987
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:20,553
<i>This is what it thought as it fell:</i>

988
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:23,859
<i>Ah, whoa, what's happening? Who am I?</i>

989
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:27,560
<i>Why am I here? What's my purpose?
What do I mean by who am I?</i>

990
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:29,830
<i>Okay, Okay, calm down, get a grip now. </i>

991
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:33,999
<i>Ooh, this is an interesting sensation. 
A sort of tingling in my... </i>

992
01:14:34,076 --> 01:14:39,139
<i>I better start finding names for things. 
Let's call it a tail. Yeah, tail. </i>

993
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:43,308
<i>What's this roaring sound whooshing past
what I'm gonna call my head?</i>

994
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:45,511
<i>Wind. Is that a good name? That'll do. </i>

995
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,885
<i>Yay, this is really exciting. 
I'm dizzy with anticipation. </i>

996
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:51,551
<i>Or is it the wind?
There's a lot of that now. </i>

997
01:14:51,626 --> 01:14:55,687
<i>And what's this thing coming towards me
very fast? So big and flat and round. </i>

998
01:14:55,797 --> 01:15:00,894
<i>It needs a big wide-sounding name
like ow, ound, round, ground!</i>

999
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:05,531
<i>That's it, ground. I wonder if it will
be friends with me. Hello, ground. </i>

1000
01:15:07,943 --> 01:15:11,743
<i> The only thing that went through
the mind of the bowl of petunias</i>

1001
01:15:11,814 --> 01:15:15,841
<i>as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again!"</i>

1002
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:22,718
<i>Many have speculated that if we knew
why the petunias had thought that,</i>

1003
01:15:22,825 --> 01:15:28,195
<i>we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now. </i>

1004
01:15:32,535 --> 01:15:34,799
What are those things?

1005
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:38,238
They're portals
to another dimension.

1006
01:15:38,341 --> 01:15:42,801
Right. I don't suppose this
portal has central heating, does it?

1007
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:50,642
Ah, this is the one.

1008
01:15:50,787 --> 01:15:55,224
This will all end in tears,
I just know it.

1009
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,256
Right here.

1010
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:04,562
Hey! Whoa!

1011
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:07,136
Okay, in we go!

1012
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:12,369
We can't just step into that... that!
We don't know where it leads.

1013
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,570
If we pick the wrong one,

1014
01:16:14,678 --> 01:16:18,409
we just... we come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

1015
01:16:18,515 --> 01:16:22,110
What? Yeah, it's a big biggie,
Ford. A big biggie.

1016
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:27,213
What if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?

1017
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,852
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

1018
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:35,126
- Ford!
- His hunches are good.

1019
01:16:35,232 --> 01:16:37,632
Arthur, I say we go.

1020
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:43,604
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?!

1021
01:16:43,675 --> 01:16:45,336
This is suicide!

1022
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:49,471
- I think I resent that.
- I don't care.

1023
01:16:49,547 --> 01:16:52,448
I'm getting hostility
from you, Alex...

1024
01:16:52,517 --> 01:16:56,078
- Arthur!
- Have you ever tried yoga?

1025
01:16:57,288 --> 01:17:00,883
- Trillian!
- I think that's supposed to happen.

1026
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:09,131
She's gone!
Ford, she's gone!

1027
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:12,226
Arthur, don't panic!

1028
01:17:13,938 --> 01:17:17,874
- Ford!
- Hey, wait for me!

1029
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:20,942
Whoo!

1030
01:17:31,423 --> 01:17:33,186
Come on.

1031
01:17:33,259 --> 01:17:39,289
Idiot! Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1032
01:17:43,002 --> 01:17:45,402
Ahhh!

1033
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,016
No, no, no, don't leave.
Come on, come on, just start!

1034
01:18:04,089 --> 01:18:07,217
I told you this would end in tears.

1035
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:09,419
Did you? Did you?

1036
01:18:17,237 --> 01:18:20,434
Geronimo!

1037
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,031
Ooomph!

1038
01:18:23,143 --> 01:18:27,637
Far out! Far out! Ha-ha!

1039
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:32,413
This is it. This is it!
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

1040
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:41,559
So, this is how
it's all going to end, is it?

1041
01:18:41,628 --> 01:18:46,565
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

1042
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:49,101
You think you've got problems.

1043
01:18:49,202 --> 01:18:51,727
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

1044
01:18:51,838 --> 01:18:53,032
Excuse me.

1045
01:18:53,106 --> 01:18:57,065
- Aaaaagghhh!
- Whoa, whoa.

1046
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:04,743
- Who are you?
- No, uh, my name is not important.

1047
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:08,413
Uh, you must come with me.

1048
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:12,755
- Get away.
- Terrible events are afoot.

1049
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:16,387
Um, you... you must come
or you'll be late.

1050
01:19:16,464 --> 01:19:18,728
- Late? What for?
- What?

1051
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:24,328
No, no. What's...
what's your name, Earthman?

1052
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:27,706
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Well...

1053
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:30,505
late as in
"the late Dentarthurdent. "

1054
01:19:31,245 --> 01:19:35,147
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1055
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:38,241
- No.
- Your friends are safe.

1056
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:41,584
- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

1057
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:46,423
Okay, my name is, um...

1058
01:19:46,494 --> 01:19:50,430
...my name is... is...
is... Slartibartfast.

1059
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:55,661
I... I... I said it wasn't important.

1060
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:01,537
Well... so my friends are safe?

1061
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,110
Let me show you.

1062
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:09,083
I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

1063
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:36,807
Did you know we built planets?

1064
01:20:36,913 --> 01:20:40,940
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

1065
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:45,716
Doing the, um... doing the coastlines
was always my favorite.

1066
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:51,454
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1067
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:56,521
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

1068
01:20:56,632 --> 01:21:02,161
are a... are a bit of
a luxury commodity...

1069
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,106
Come with me because there's
been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

1070
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:08,439
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

1071
01:21:08,544 --> 01:21:12,002
- And men.
- What?

1072
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:14,072
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1073
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:18,917
Yes, well, I don't think men
have much to do with it. Here.

1074
01:21:58,929 --> 01:22:01,898
Um, I must warn you,

1075
01:22:01,965 --> 01:22:05,457
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

1076
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:07,799
- Huh?
- It may disturb you.

1077
01:22:07,872 --> 01:22:11,672
It scares the willies out of me.

1078
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:13,767
Aghh! Aghh!

1079
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:45,974
Ha, ha, ha.
Welcome to our factory floor.

1080
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,863
Okay.

1081
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:12,392
All right. All right.

1082
01:23:12,471 --> 01:23:15,338
Yeah, this is it.

1083
01:23:18,377 --> 01:23:20,902
This is it.

1084
01:23:21,013 --> 01:23:24,881
O great Deep Thought!

1085
01:23:24,984 --> 01:23:26,679
We have traveled long...

1086
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:30,550
...and far.

1087
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:36,151
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

1088
01:23:36,228 --> 01:23:38,628
the universe and everything?

1089
01:23:38,697 --> 01:23:40,460
<i> No. </i>

1090
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:43,128
<i>- What?
- I've been watching TV.</i>

1091
01:23:43,236 --> 01:23:44,294
Oh.

1092
01:23:44,371 --> 01:23:48,068
<i>I designed
another computer to do that. </i>

1093
01:23:48,141 --> 01:23:50,439
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

1094
01:23:50,544 --> 01:23:53,308
<i>No, it's not here. It's another world. </i>

1095
01:23:53,413 --> 01:23:55,574
It's on another world.

1096
01:23:55,649 --> 01:23:59,141
<i>It is another world, stupid. </i>

1097
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:01,687
<i>Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it</i>

1098
01:24:01,755 --> 01:24:04,087
<i>to make way
for a hyperspace expressway. </i>

1099
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:06,555
Well... Okay.

1100
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:08,719
You sure you don't have the question,

1101
01:24:08,828 --> 01:24:12,355
or a way to, you know,
access it or something?

1102
01:24:12,432 --> 01:24:14,400
'Cause I think I've done
a lot to get here.

1103
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,961
<i>Oh, shh, shh. The show's back on. </i>

1104
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:27,371
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

1105
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:31,918
Great. I'm gonna go and find something
else for my entire life to be about.

1106
01:24:31,986 --> 01:24:35,285
Zaphod, Zaphod,
there's the... the gun.

1107
01:24:35,356 --> 01:24:37,654
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

1108
01:24:37,758 --> 01:24:42,218
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I... Why'd I do that?

1109
01:24:42,296 --> 01:24:43,991
- Okay.
- That's stupid.

1110
01:24:44,098 --> 01:24:49,195
O Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

1111
01:25:04,018 --> 01:25:06,282
- There you are.
- Hm?

1112
01:25:06,354 --> 01:25:08,049
Look familiar?

1113
01:25:08,122 --> 01:25:11,614
So it wasn't destroyed?

1114
01:25:11,692 --> 01:25:15,992
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark II.

1115
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,898
So you... you made the Earth?

1116
01:25:21,003 --> 01:25:24,632
Not me alone,
but I... I did my part.

1117
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,005
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

1118
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:31,978
That was one of mine.
I... I got an award for it.

1119
01:25:39,354 --> 01:25:41,584
Oh, hoo!

1120
01:25:41,657 --> 01:25:45,115
All right, Frank?
That's... that's Frank.

1121
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:50,828
Ah-ha. They...
they've nearly finished the oceans.

1122
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:00,338
Zaphod.

1123
01:26:00,443 --> 01:26:02,434
Here, it's...

1124
01:26:04,947 --> 01:26:08,007
...it's just like Humma said.

1125
01:26:08,084 --> 01:26:10,678
- Now you can go get your head back.
- Hey, Ford.

1126
01:26:10,787 --> 01:26:13,255
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarking frood.

1127
01:26:13,322 --> 01:26:14,346
No!

1128
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:16,688
- Whoa!
- This is a bust too.

1129
01:26:16,793 --> 01:26:22,356
H... H... Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

1130
01:26:22,465 --> 01:26:25,366
You go through all you have,
you don't get an answer,

1131
01:26:25,468 --> 01:26:28,062
which means no money or fame,
which you deserve...

1132
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:30,765
<i> The Point-of-View Gun,
conveniently,</i>

1133
01:26:30,873 --> 01:26:33,273
<i>does precisely what its name suggests. </i>

1134
01:26:33,376 --> 01:26:35,901
Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic.

1135
01:26:37,013 --> 01:26:39,982
<i> If you point it at
someone and pull the trigger,</i>

1136
01:26:40,116 --> 01:26:42,710
<i>they instantly see things
from your point of view. </i>

1137
01:26:42,819 --> 01:26:44,787
Give me that thing.

1138
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:46,855
<i>It was designed by Deep Thought,</i>

1139
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:50,826
<i>but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives</i>

1140
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:53,362
<i>who, after arguments
with their husbands,</i>

1141
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:56,797
<i>were sick of ending
those arguments with the phrase,</i>

1142
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,959
<i>"You just don't get it, do you?"</i>

1143
01:27:00,204 --> 01:27:04,038
Uh, uh, and you're right,
I shouldn't be so upset

1144
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:06,372
because life goes on, you know,

1145
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:09,241
and I should just go on with it.

1146
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:11,611
Shoot him again.

1147
01:27:11,682 --> 01:27:13,673
Whoa.

1148
01:27:14,918 --> 01:27:18,684
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

1149
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:22,089
- Say what?
- That is brilliant.

1150
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,218
What's goin'...?

1151
01:27:24,294 --> 01:27:27,092
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

1152
01:27:28,332 --> 01:27:31,062
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Who cares?

1153
01:27:31,135 --> 01:27:35,697
I do. Especially since we're somewhat
of an endangered species, thanks to you.

1154
01:27:35,774 --> 01:27:37,901
Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

1155
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:40,806
You wanna know why I'm edgy?

1156
01:27:40,912 --> 01:27:44,848
Argh. Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up

1157
01:27:44,949 --> 01:27:48,578
and you've been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order.

1158
01:27:48,686 --> 01:27:50,210
Huh?

1159
01:27:50,288 --> 01:27:53,086
Ugh! You actually wanted
to know the question

1160
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:56,092
because you always wondered
if there was more to life

1161
01:27:56,127 --> 01:28:00,029
and now you're crushed
because you find out there really isn't.

1162
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:04,626
Hey, fantastic. Psychedelic.

1163
01:28:06,437 --> 01:28:10,203
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

1164
01:28:10,308 --> 01:28:13,937
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

1165
01:28:14,012 --> 01:28:17,641
Huh? That's not true.

1166
01:28:21,053 --> 01:28:25,456
And you're worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does.

1167
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:28,956
Hey, whoops.

1168
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:33,691
Oh, baby doll.

1169
01:28:33,799 --> 01:28:37,166
Give me that thing.

1170
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:42,870
It won't affect me.
I'm already a woman.

1171
01:28:53,986 --> 01:28:56,284
It's okay.
It's only a couple of little mice!

1172
01:29:00,025 --> 01:29:03,517
Voil!
Himalayas. Good, eh?

1173
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,366
Earthman, you must realize

1174
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:15,999
that the planet you lived on was
commissioned, paid for and run by mice.

1175
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:22,077
When you say mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1176
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:24,048
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1177
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:29,213
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyper intelligent beings.

1178
01:29:29,289 --> 01:29:32,781
I don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

1179
01:29:32,893 --> 01:29:36,624
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1180
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:41,633
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1181
01:29:41,735 --> 01:29:45,603
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

1182
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:49,631
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

1183
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:53,813
Actually, this explains a lot.

1184
01:29:53,915 --> 01:29:56,543
All my life,
I've had this strange feeling

1185
01:29:56,617 --> 01:29:59,643
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

1186
01:29:59,754 --> 01:30:03,485
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1187
01:30:06,827 --> 01:30:10,354
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

1188
01:30:10,431 --> 01:30:13,127
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1189
01:30:13,234 --> 01:30:17,330
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1190
01:30:17,438 --> 01:30:19,872
I'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

1191
01:30:19,974 --> 01:30:21,942
- And are you?
- Uh... no.

1192
01:30:22,043 --> 01:30:24,705
That's where
it all falls down, of course.

1193
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:38,083
Here you are then.

1194
01:30:52,607 --> 01:30:54,234
Is this...?

1195
01:31:08,223 --> 01:31:10,487
It's, um... It's all there.

1196
01:31:11,626 --> 01:31:13,890
You know, it all works.

1197
01:31:13,962 --> 01:31:16,021
Welcome home.

1198
01:31:35,585 --> 01:31:37,917
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

1199
01:31:38,021 --> 01:31:40,114
- There you are!
- Surprise!

1200
01:31:40,189 --> 01:31:43,124
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1201
01:31:43,259 --> 01:31:44,726
Is that tea?

1202
01:31:44,794 --> 01:31:49,128
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1203
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:52,690
But then they made up for it
by making us...

1204
01:31:52,769 --> 01:31:55,067
...this amazing meal.

1205
01:31:56,105 --> 01:31:59,302
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1206
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:03,606
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1207
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,943
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1208
01:32:10,153 --> 01:32:14,817
The, um, talking... talking mice. Cool.

1209
01:32:14,925 --> 01:32:20,056
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1210
01:32:21,031 --> 01:32:24,467
- Please, drink.
- Um, uh, excuse me.

1211
01:32:24,568 --> 01:32:27,935
- Uh, is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1212
01:32:28,038 --> 01:32:31,769
Um, good, I'll be outside, so...

1213
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:34,072
You were right.

1214
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:35,941
- Please, drink.
- Yes.

1215
01:32:36,613 --> 01:32:38,547
He was right.

1216
01:32:38,682 --> 01:32:40,513
Now, to business.

1217
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:42,415
To business!

1218
01:32:42,486 --> 01:32:43,783
Eat!

1219
01:32:43,887 --> 01:32:45,650
- Shh.
- Sorry.

1220
01:32:45,756 --> 01:32:48,247
We've spent a lot of time
on your planet

1221
01:32:48,325 --> 01:32:50,293
looking for this ultimate question.

1222
01:32:50,394 --> 01:32:53,955
Only to have it blow up
in our faces. Literally.

1223
01:32:54,064 --> 01:32:57,591
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1224
01:32:57,635 --> 01:32:59,660
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

1225
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:02,331
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1226
01:33:02,407 --> 01:33:05,604
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

1227
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,769
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

1228
01:33:07,846 --> 01:33:11,009
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

1229
01:33:11,082 --> 01:33:13,277
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1230
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:14,648
More tea?

1231
01:33:14,752 --> 01:33:17,482
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

1232
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:19,819
Yes, to complete the program.

1233
01:33:22,794 --> 01:33:25,524
You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

1234
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:30,465
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... Cheeky mouse.

1235
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:37,499
Zaphod! Trillian!

1236
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:39,907
Ford.

1237
01:33:39,978 --> 01:33:41,468
What was in that food?

1238
01:33:41,579 --> 01:33:45,310
What was in my tea?

1239
01:33:45,384 --> 01:33:47,978
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1240
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:53,448
Just wait a sodding minute.

1241
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:56,117
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1242
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:57,856
What about, what's 6x7?

1243
01:33:57,963 --> 01:34:01,524
Or, um, uh, how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

1244
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,400
Here's one: How many roads
must a man walk down?

1245
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:08,740
Hey, that's not bad.

1246
01:34:08,841 --> 01:34:15,246
Fine. Fine, take it, 'cause my head
is filled with questions,

1247
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,577
and no answer to any one of them

1248
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:21,312
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

1249
01:34:21,387 --> 01:34:22,979
Except for one.

1250
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:26,024
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

1251
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:27,718
Is she the one?

1252
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:32,230
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

1253
01:34:32,332 --> 01:34:37,861
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1254
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:40,839
And for one week,

1255
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:45,708
one week in my sad little...
blip of an existence...

1256
01:34:48,014 --> 01:34:50,482
...it made me happy.

1257
01:34:52,185 --> 01:34:53,618
That's a good answer.

1258
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,917
We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1259
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:00,687
- What's this "Is she the one" tripe?
- Take his brain!

1260
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,957
No, don't take the brain!
Don't take the brain, mice!

1261
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:14,700
It wasn't me!

1262
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:16,674
I'm famous.

1263
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:19,144
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him!

1264
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:20,680
Oh, bollocks!

1265
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,305
Agghh!

1266
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,214
I'm gonna be sick.

1267
01:35:34,028 --> 01:35:35,495
Belgium.

1268
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,105
Follow me.

1269
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,266
Left, right, left, right.

1270
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:51,868
Attention!

1271
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:58,318
Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

1272
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:00,683
Though I can't say I blame you.

1273
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:04,452
Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

1274
01:36:04,526 --> 01:36:06,858
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

1275
01:36:06,962 --> 01:36:08,293
Fire!

1276
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:11,725
No! No!

1277
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,863
What's all the fuss about?

1278
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:19,805
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy. Ooh.

1279
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:25,006
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1280
01:36:31,653 --> 01:36:36,147
Now I've got a headache...
headache... headache...

1281
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:46,334
Marvin!

1282
01:36:46,435 --> 01:36:47,697
Oh, no.

1283
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:53,207
He's got a towel, run away!

1284
01:36:55,445 --> 01:36:58,414
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1285
01:37:02,251 --> 01:37:05,311
We need that gun.

1286
01:37:05,388 --> 01:37:08,323
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start!

1287
01:37:09,425 --> 01:37:11,450
Come on. Oh, fire, fire!

1288
01:37:11,594 --> 01:37:12,891
Fire, fire!

1289
01:37:13,896 --> 01:37:16,126
Oo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

1290
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,764
He's locked it
from the other side.

1291
01:37:19,836 --> 01:37:21,963
We'll have to go the other way.

1292
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:24,005
Come on, let's go!

1293
01:37:29,312 --> 01:37:31,803
Stop!

1294
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,075
Oh, no!

1295
01:37:37,855 --> 01:37:41,985
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop shooting at us!

1296
01:38:01,078 --> 01:38:04,741
Oh, I feel so depressed.

1297
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:11,087
I can't face another day.

1298
01:38:12,956 --> 01:38:14,753
What's the point?

1299
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:25,065
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1300
01:38:30,775 --> 01:38:33,642
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1301
01:38:39,184 --> 01:38:41,414
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1302
01:38:41,486 --> 01:38:44,751
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

1303
01:38:50,228 --> 01:38:53,254
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

1304
01:38:53,398 --> 01:38:56,128
Take it away.

1305
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:08,975
You could do all of that, but it's not
gonna... Well, I'll ask... I'll just ask.

1306
01:39:09,081 --> 01:39:12,881
I... I... I've just been informed
by some of the lads

1307
01:39:12,985 --> 01:39:15,419
that since we're so near completion,

1308
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:17,888
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1309
01:39:17,957 --> 01:39:19,481
Oh.

1310
01:39:19,592 --> 01:39:23,619
We, well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1311
01:39:23,696 --> 01:39:27,063
Unless there's, um...

1312
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:30,658
...there's, you know,
anything you want to change.

1313
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:38,107
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1314
01:39:39,545 --> 01:39:42,844
Yeah. Me.

1315
01:39:43,315 --> 01:39:45,579
Oh! Um, hello?

1316
01:39:45,651 --> 01:39:49,348
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1317
01:39:51,323 --> 01:39:52,915
Let's go somewhere.

1318
01:39:52,992 --> 01:39:55,586
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1319
01:39:55,695 --> 01:39:58,926
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1320
01:39:59,032 --> 01:40:02,058
I am a little peckish.

1321
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,868
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1322
01:40:06,973 --> 01:40:12,570
- I think. I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1323
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:16,308
All right, let's trip the
light fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

1324
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:18,247
Come on.

1325
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:22,412
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I going to need it?

1326
01:40:22,522 --> 01:40:25,958
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1327
01:40:26,059 --> 01:40:29,995
I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel.

1328
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:37,969
Okay. Hold tight.

1329
01:40:41,475 --> 01:40:46,674
<i> Stand by for commencement
of life cycle. In three, two, one... </i>

1330
01:40:46,747 --> 01:40:50,308
<i> All right! Whoo!</i>

1331
01:41:32,861 --> 01:41:35,159
Not that
anyone cares what I say,

1332
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:38,461
but the restaurant
is at the other end of the universe.

1333
01:43:41,692 --> 01:43:42,989
Yeah!

1334
01:43:54,139 --> 01:43:55,572
Play it!

1335
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:58,065
<i> It is, of course, well known
that careless talk costs lives. </i>

1336
01:44:58,170 --> 01:45:01,264
<i>But the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated. </i>

1337
01:45:01,373 --> 01:45:05,002
<i>For instance, at the very moment
that Arthur Dent said,</i>

1338
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:08,671
<i>"I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel"</i>

1339
01:45:08,747 --> 01:45:13,343
<i>a freak wormhole opened up in
the fabric of the space-time continuum</i>

1340
01:45:13,419 --> 01:45:16,911
<i>and carried his words far,
far back in time,</i>

1341
01:45:16,989 --> 01:45:21,050
<i>across almost infinite reaches of space,
to a distant galaxy</i>

1342
01:45:21,127 --> 01:45:24,824
<i>where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink</i>

1343
01:45:24,898 --> 01:45:27,389
<i>of frightful interstellar battle. </i>

1344
01:45:27,467 --> 01:45:32,029
<i>The two opposing leaders, resplendent
in their black-jeweled battle shorts</i>

1345
01:45:32,105 --> 01:45:34,130
<i>were meeting for the last time,</i>

1346
01:45:34,274 --> 01:45:37,038
<i>when a dreadful silence fell. </i>

1347
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:39,078
<i>And at that very moment,</i>

1348
01:45:39,179 --> 01:45:43,172
<i>the words "I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel"</i>

1349
01:45:43,316 --> 01:45:46,285
<i>drifted across the conference table. </i>

1350
01:45:46,353 --> 01:45:49,049
<i>Unfortunately, in their native tongue,</i>

1351
01:45:49,122 --> 01:45:52,114
<i>this was the most appalling
insult imaginable. </i>

1352
01:45:52,225 --> 01:45:53,852
<i>So the opposing battle fleets</i>

1353
01:45:53,927 --> 01:45:56,521
<i>decided to settle
their remaining differences,</i>

1354
01:45:56,596 --> 01:45:59,997
<i>in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy,</i>

1355
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:04,196
<i>now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark. </i>

1356
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:07,535
<i>For thousands of years,
the mighty starships tore across</i>

1357
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:13,113
<i>the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet Earth,</i>

1358
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:17,207
<i>where, due to
a terrible miscalculation of scale,</i>

1359
01:46:17,318 --> 01:46:22,153
<i>the entire battle fleet was
accidentally swallowed by a small dog. </i>

1360
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:25,818
<i>Those who study the complex
interplay of cause and effect</i>

1361
