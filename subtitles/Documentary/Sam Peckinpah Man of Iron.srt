00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,686
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

3
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,788
This is crazy. What did I do?

4
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:29,921
I feel like you're
going to pull over...

5
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:30,323
and snuff me.

6
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,097
What, you're not
allowed to talk?

7
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:32,826
Hey, Forrest.

8
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,127
We can talk, sir.

9
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,997
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

10
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,230
Good God, you're a woman.

11
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,267
I honestly... I couldn't
have called that.

12
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,168
I mean, I'd apologize,

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,803
but isn't that what
we're going for here?

14
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,877
- I thought of you
as a soldier first.

15
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:46,673
I'm an airman.

16
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,369
You have, actually,

17
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,508
excellent bone
structure, there.

18
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,377
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

19
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:54,581
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

20
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,427
- Sir, I have a
question to ask.

21
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,150
Yes, please.

22
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,927
Is it true you went 12 for 12...

23
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,920
with last year's
Maxim cover models?

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,156
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

25
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,691
March and I had a
scheduling conflict,

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,694
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

27
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,446
Anything else?
You're kidding me...

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,663
with the hand up, right?

29
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,398
- Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

30
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:16,498
Yes. It's very cool.

31
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,539
All right.

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,741
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

33
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,409
Please, no gang signs.

34
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,078
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

35
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,528
Yeah, peace. I love peace.

36
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:28,248
I'd be out of a
job with peace.

37
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,828
Come on. Hurry up.

38
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:33,413
Just click it. Don't
change any settings.

39
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,959
- What's going on?
- Contact left.

40
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,059
What have we got?

41
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,054
Jimmy, stay with Stark.

42
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,164
- Stay down.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,572
Son of a bitch.

44
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,552
- Wait, wait, wait.
Give me a gun.

45
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:00,652
Stay here.

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,807
Whoa.

47
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,658
Tony Stark.

48
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,827
Visionary. Genius.

49
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,566
American patriot.

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,800
Even from an early age,

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,851
the son of legendary...

52
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,336
weapons developer
Howard Stark...

53
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,018
quickly stole the spotlight...

54
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,973
with his brilliant
and unique mind.

55
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,073
At age four,

56
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,510
he built his first
circuit board.

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,075
At age six, his first engine.

58
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,460
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

59
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,716
Then, the passing of a titan.

60
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,125
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

61
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,762
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

62
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,165
until, at age 21, the
prodigal son returns...

63
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,635
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

64
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,070
With the keys to the kingdom.

65
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,939
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

66
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,566
creating smarter weapons,

67
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,077
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.

68
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,960
Today, Tony Stark has changed...

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,014
the face of the
weapons industry...

70
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,917
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America...

71
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,992
and her interests
around the globe.

72
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,563
As liaison to
Stark Industries.

73
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,746
I've had the unique privilege...

74
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:35,668
of serving with
a real patriot.

75
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:39,397
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

76
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,108
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor...

77
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,215
to present this year's
Apogee Award...

78
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,315
to Mr. Tony Stark.

79
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,753
Tony?

80
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,902
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

81
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,673
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

82
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,773
This is wonderful.

83
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,234
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,629
But if I were Tony,

85
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,077
I would tell you how
honored I feel...

86
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,262
and what a joy it is...

87
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:31,592
to receive this very
prestigious award.

88
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,025
Tony, you know...

89
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:37,029
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

90
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,129
He's always working.

91
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,000
Work it. Come on.

92
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,834
- We should just stay
till the morning.

93
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,110
You are unbelievable.

94
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,987
- Oh, no. Did they
rope you into this?

95
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:54,480
Nobody roped me into anything.

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,548
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that...

97
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,260
if I presented
you with an award,

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,518
you'd be deeply honored.

99
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,581
Of course I'd be
deeply honored.

100
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,486
And it's you, that's great.

101
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,288
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

102
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,173
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

103
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:04,524
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

104
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,958
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

105
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,361
Wow. Would you look at that?
That's something else.

106
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,029
I don't have any of those
floating around.

107
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,188
We're gonna let it ride.

108
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,130
Give me a hand, will you?

109
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,435
Give me a little s
omething-something.

110
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,636
Okay, you, too.

111
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,821
- I don't blow
on a man's dice.

112
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,604
Come on, honey bear.

113
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,243
There it is.

114
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,207
Lieutenant Colonel
Rhodes rolls. And...

115
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,542
Two craps. Line away.

116
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,444
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

117
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,412
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

118
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,513
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

119
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,581
Tomorrow, don't be late.

120
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,916
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.

121
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,284
I know, I know.

122
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,027
Render unto Caesar...

123
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:36,272
that which is
Caesar's. There you go.

124
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,927
Mr. Stark. Excuse
me, Mr. Stark.

125
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,163
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

126
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,331
Can I ask you a
couple of questions?

127
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,966
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

128
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,034
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,069
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

130
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,971
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

131
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,191
- What do you say to that?

132
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,907
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.

133
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,576
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

134
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,844
'The Merchant of Death'?

135
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,944
That's not bad.

136
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,516
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

137
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,982
Well, Ms. Brown,

138
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,365
it's an imperfect world,

139
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:08,521
but it's the only
one we've got.

140
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,996
I guarantee you, the
day weapons are...

141
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,324
no longer needed
to keep the peace.

142
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,807
I'll start making
bricks and beams...

143
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:13,593
for baby hospitals.

144
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,727
Rehearse that much?

145
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,965
Every night in front
of the mirror...

146
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:16,496
before bedtime.

147
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,356
- I can see that.

148
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,931
I'd like to show
you first-hand.

149
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,267
All I want is a
serious answer.

150
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,569
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

151
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,179
'Peace means having
a bigger stick...

152
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,072
than the other guy.'

153
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,940
That's a great line...

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,441
coming from the guy
selling the sticks.

155
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,855
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

156
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:31,310
He worked on the
Manhattan Project.

157
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,166
A lot of people,

158
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,980
including your
professors at Brown,

159
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,248
would call that being a hero.

160
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,093
And a lot of people...

161
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:37,517
would also call that
war profiteering.

162
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,752
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved...

163
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,587
by advancing medical
technology...

164
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

165
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,203
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

166
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,863
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

167
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,278
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

168
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,714
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

169
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,272
The weather in Malibu...

170
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:12,585
is 72 degrees with
scattered clouds.

171
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,195
The surf conditions are fair...

172
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:15,955
with waist-to-shoulder
high lines.

173
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,690
High tide will
be at 10:52 a.m.

174
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,541
Tony?

175
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,244
Hey, Tony?

176
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,703
You are not authorized
to access this area.

177
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,803
- Jesus.

178
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,906
That's Jarvis. He
runs the house.

179
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,054
I've got your clothes here.

180
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,609
They've been
dry-cleaned and pressed,

181
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,444
and there's a car waiting
for you outside...

182
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,080
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

183
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,489
- You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

184
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:19,151
Indeed I am.

185
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,587
After all these years,
Tony still has you...

186
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,155
picking up the dry-cleaning.

187
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,592
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

188
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,462
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

189
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,562
Will that be all?

190
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,181
Give me an exploded view.

191
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,589
The compression in
cylinder three...

192
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:52,818
appears to be low.

193
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,918
Log that.

194
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:58,923
- I'm gonna try
again, right now.

195
00:10:59,023 --> 00:10:59,992
Please don't turn
down my music.

196
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,093
I'll keep you posted.

197
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:01,866
You are supposed to be...

198
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:02,928
halfway around the
world right now.

199
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,531
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

200
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,592
Why are you trying
to hustle me...

201
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:06,999
out of here?

202
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,099
Your flight was
scheduled to leave...

203
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:08,801
an hour and a half ago.

204
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,326
That's funny, I thought
with it being...

205
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:11,003
my plane and all,

206
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,638
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

207
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,473
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things...

208
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,641
before I get you
out of the door.

209
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,855
Doesn't it kind of
defeat the whole...

210
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:17,977
purpose of having
your own plane...

211
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,278
if it departs
before you arrive?

212
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,040
Larry called. He's
got another buyer...

213
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,715
for the Jackson
Pollock in the wings.

214
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,417
Do you want it? Yes or no.

215
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,319
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

216
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,529
No. The Springs was actually...

217
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,889
the neighborhood
in East Hampton...

218
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,223
where he lived and worked,

219
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,642
- not 'spring'
like the season.

220
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:32,825
So?

221
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,159
I think it's a fair example.

222
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,149
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

223
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,724
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,070
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

225
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,595
Is in June. Please,
don't harangue me...

226
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:46,972
about stuff that's
way, way, down...

227
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,475
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

228
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,043
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

229
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,478
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

230
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,806
What are you trying
to get rid of me for?

231
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:54,480
What, you got plans?

232
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,625
- As a matter of fact, I do.

233
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,083
I don't like it when
you have plans.

234
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,218
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

235
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,820
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

236
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,354
I knew that. Already?

237
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,356
Yeah. Isn't that strange?

238
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,826
It's the same
day as last year.

239
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,753
- Get yourself
something nice from me.

240
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,495
I already did.

241
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,029
- And?
- It was very nice.

242
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,131
- Yeah.

243
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,206
Very tasteful. Thank
you, Mr. Stark.

244
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,563
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

245
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
Okay.

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
You're good.

247
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,780
I thought I lost
you back there.

248
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,267
You did, sir.

249
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,066
I had to cut
across Mulholland.

250
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,736
I got you. I got you.

251
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,238
What's wrong with you?

252
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,839
- What?
- Three hours.

253
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,075
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

254
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,274
For three hours.
For three hours...

255
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:58,144
you got me standing here.

256
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,389
Waiting on you now.
Let's go. Come on.

257
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,538
Wheels up. Rock and roll.

258
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,026
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

259
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,328
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

260
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,131
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

261
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,666
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

262
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,537
You don't need to
apologize to me.

263
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:21,901
I'm your man.

264
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,002
Hi. I told him I
was sorry, but he...

265
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,102
- I'm just
indifferent right now.

266
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:24,470
Hot towel?

267
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,771
You don't respect yourself,

268
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,758
- so I know you
don't respect me.

269
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:27,206
I respect you.

270
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,641
I'm just your babysitter.

271
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,635
So, when you need...

272
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,243
your diaper
changed... Thank you.

273
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:31,953
Let me know...

274
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,512
and I'll get you
a bottle, okay?

275
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,247
Hey. Heat up the
sake, will you?

276
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,715
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

277
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,551
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

278
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,005
- You can't have
sashimi without sake.

279
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,053
You are constitutionally...

280
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,755
incapable of
being responsible.

281
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,142
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.

282
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,357
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

283
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,492
Hot sake?

284
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,624
- Yes, two, please.

285
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,895
No. I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

286
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,330
That's what I'm talking about.

287
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,466
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

288
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,302
you know what I recognize?

289
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,036
I see in that mirror
that every person...

290
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,640
that's got this
uniform on got my back.

291
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,612
Hey, you know what?

292
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm not like you.
I'm not cut out...

293
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,060
No, no. You don't
have to be like me.

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,580
But you're more
than what you are.

295
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

296
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,795
No. You can't be
distracted right now.

297
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,895
Listen to me.

298
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,336
General.

299
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,411
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward...

300
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,006
to your weapons presentation.

301
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,106
Thanks.

302
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,945
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

303
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,275
I say, is it too much
to ask for both?

304
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,996
With that in mind,

305
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,986
I humbly present
the crown jewel...

306
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,854
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

307
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:49,989
It's the first
missile system...

308
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,925
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

309
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,962
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

310
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,102
I respectfully disagree.

311
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,124
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

312
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,306
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

313
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,541
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

314
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,943
Find an excuse...

315
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,669
to let one of these
off the chain,

316
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,346
and I personally
guarantee you...

317
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:19,121
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

318
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,199
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

319
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,818
I'll be throwing
one of these in...

320
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,920
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

321
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
To peace.

322
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,825
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

323
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,332
I couldn't sleep
till I found out...

324
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,394
how it went. How'd it go?

325
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,685
It went great. Looks
like it's gonna be...

326
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:04,296
an early Christmas.

327
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,267
Hey. Way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

328
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,440
Why aren't you
wearing those pajamas

329
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,802
I got you?

330
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,902
Good night, Tony.

331
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,505
- Hey, Tony.

332
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,341
I'm sorry, this
is the 'fun-vee.'

333
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,376
The 'hum-drum-vee'
is back there.

334
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,366
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

335
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,984
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

336
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,501
What the hell
did you do to me?

337
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,554
What I did?

338
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,292
What I did is to
save your life.

339
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,537
I removed all the
shrapnel I could,

340
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,029
but there's a lot left,

341
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,565
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

342
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,665
Here, want to see?

343
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,898
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

344
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,116
I've seen many
wounds like that...

345
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:29,808
in my village.

346
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,311
We call them the
walking dead...

347
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,770
because it takes about a week...

348
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,581
for the barbs to reach
the vital organs.

349
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,251
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

350
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,353
hooked up to a car battery,

351
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,043
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

352
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,690
That's right. Smile.

353
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,181
We met once, you know,

354
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:01,086
at a technical
conference in Bern.

355
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,909
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

356
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,224
If I had been that drunk,

357
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,045
I wouldn't have
been able to stand,

358
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,315
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

359
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,415
Where are we?

360
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,065
Come on, stand up. Stand up.

361
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,555
Just do as I do.

362
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,553
Come on, put your hands up.

363
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,530
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

364
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,435
Do you understand
me? Do as I do.

365
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,470
He says, 'Welcome, Tony Stark,

366
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,690
the most famous
mass murderer...

367
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,170
'in the history of America.'

368
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,062
He is honored.

369
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,956
He wants you to
build the missile.

370
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,754
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

371
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,175
This one.

372
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,415
I refuse.

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Tony.

374
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,897
He wants to know
what you think.

375
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,541
I think you got a
lot of my weapons.

376
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,916
He says they have
everything you need...

377
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,929
to build the Jericho missile.

378
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:41,599
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

379
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,971
He says for you
to start working immediately,

380
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,641
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

381
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,361
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

382
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,530
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

383
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,625
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

384
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:20,065
Look, what you just saw,

385
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,201
that is your legacy, Stark.

386
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,728
Your life's work,

387
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,979
in the hands of
those murderers.

388
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,714
Is that how you
want to go out?

389
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,806
Is this the last
act of defiance...

390
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,935
of the great Tony Stark?

391
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,156
Or are you going to
do something about it?

392
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,111
Why should I do anything?

393
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,362
They're going to kill
me, you, either way.

394
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,577
And if they don't,

395
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:46,698
I'll probably be
dead in a week.

396
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,667
Well, then,

397
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,662
this is a very
important week for you,

398
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,762
isn't it?

399
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,531
If this is going to
be my work station.

400
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,343
I want it well-lit.
I want these up.

401
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,443
I need welding gear.

402
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,446
I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.

403
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,659
I need a soldering
station. I need...

404
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,715
helmets. I'm gonna
need goggles.

405
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,145
I would like a smelting cup.

406
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:09,220
I need two sets of
precision tools.

407
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,224
- How many languages
do you speak?

408
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:22,634
A lot.

409
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,437
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

410
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,577
They speak Arabic, Urdu.

411
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,039
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

412
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,126
- Who are these people?

413
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:37,158
They are your loyal
customers, sir.

414
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:40,233
They call themselves
the Ten Rings.

415
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,095
You know, we might be
more productive...

416
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,680
if you include me
in the planning process.

417
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,770
Okay, we don't need this.

418
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,744
What is that?

419
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,178
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

420
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,639
We need at least
1.6, so why don't...

421
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:17,374
you go break down
the other 11?

422
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,670
Careful.

423
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,606
Careful, we only get
one shot at this.

424
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,368
Relax. I have steady hands.

425
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,436
Why do you think
you're still alive?

426
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,670
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

427
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,422
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

428
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,326
Nice to meet you, too.

429
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,770
That doesn't look like
a Jericho missile.

430
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,012
That's because...

431
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:42,307
it's a miniaturized
arc reactor.

432
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,410
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

433
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,246
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

434
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,015
But what could it generate?

435
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,908
If my math is right,
and it always is,

436
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,053
three gigajoules per second.

437
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,622
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

438
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,952
Yeah. Or something
big for 15 minutes.

439
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,578
- This is our
ticket out of here.

440
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:14,539
What is it?

441
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,849
Flatten them out and look.

442
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,777
Oh, wow.

443
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,847
Impressive.

444
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,508
Good.

445
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,138
Good roll. Good roll.

446
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,816
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

447
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,061
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

448
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,522
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

449
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:08,956
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

450
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,794
And you, Stark?

451
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,661
- No.
- No?

452
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,649
So you're a man who
has everything...

453
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,774
and nothing.

454
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Relax.

455
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,012
The bow and arrow...

456
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,774
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

457
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,618
It allowed the great
Genghis Khan...

458
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,161
to rule from the
Pacific to the Ukraine.

459
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:31,497
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great...

460
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,892
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

461
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,410
But today,

462
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,064
whoever holds the
latest Stark weapons...

463
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,017
rules these lands.

464
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,221
And soon,

465
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,559
it will be my turn.

466
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,912
What does he want?

467
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,319
What do you want?
A delivery date?

468
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,138
I need him.

469
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,642
Good assistant.

470
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,941
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

471
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,116
Okay? Can you move?

472
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,455
Okay, say it again.

473
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,058
41 steps straight
ahead. Then 16 steps,

474
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,893
that's from the door,

475
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,798
fork right, 33
steps, turn right.

476
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,323
Yinsen. Yinsen. Stark.

477
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,461
Say something.
Say something back to him.

478
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,001
- He's speaking
Hungarian. I don't...

479
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:18,896
Then speak Hungarian.

480
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,886
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

481
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,225
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

482
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,926
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

483
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,171
- Let me finish this.

484
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,929
Initialize the power sequence.

485
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,029
Okay.

486
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,299
- Now.
- Tell me. Tell me.

487
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:56,399
Function 11.

488
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:59,303
Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

489
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:00,638
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

490
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,839
Talk to me. Tell me
when you see it.

491
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,474
- I have it.
- Press Control 'l'.

492
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,289
- 'I.' Got it.

493
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,977
'I.' 'Enter.' 'l' and 'Enter.'

494
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,797
Come over here
and button me up.

495
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,016
Okay. All right.

496
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,418
Every other hex bolt.

497
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,183
- They're coming.

498
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,620
Nothing pretty,
just get it done.

499
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,780
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

500
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,757
Make sure the
checkpoints are clear...

501
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:21,826
before you follow
me out, okay?

502
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,926
We need more time.

503
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,564
Hey,

504
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,140
- I'm gonna go
buy you some time.

505
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,568
Stick to the plan.

506
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,668
Stick to the plan.

507
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,005
Yinsen.

508
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,346
- Yinsen.
- Watch out.

509
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,463
Stark.

510
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,991
Come on. We got to go.

511
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,440
Move for me, come
on. We got a plan.

512
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,638
We're gonna stick to it.

513
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,040
This was always
the plan, Stark.

514
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,677
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

515
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,777
My family is dead.

516
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,318
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

517
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,251
It's okay.

518
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,724
I want this. I want this.

519
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,804
Thank you for saving me.

520
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,126
Don't waste it. Don't
waste your life.

521
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,210
My turn.

522
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,781
Not bad.

523
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,781
Hey.

524
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,705
How was the 'fun-vee'?

525
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,799
Next time, you ride
with me, okay?

526
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,501
Watch it, coming up here.

527
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,938
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

528
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,564
Your eyes are red.

529
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:43,861
A few tears for your
long-lost boss?

530
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,990
- Tears of joy. I
hate job hunting.

531
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,090
Yeah, vacation's over.

532
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,402
Where to, sir?

533
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,944
- Take us to the
hospital, please, Happy.

534
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:53,103
No.

535
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,271
No? Tony, you have to...

536
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,372
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

537
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,347
- The doctor has
to look at you.

538
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:57,207
I don't have to do anything.

539
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:58,943
I've been in captivity
for three months.

540
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,918
There are two things
I want to do.

541
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:02,780
I want an American
cheeseburger,

542
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,847
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

543
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,163
...is not what you
think. I want you...

544
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,350
to call for a press
conference now.

545
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,651
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

546
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,465
- What on earth for?

547
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:12,426
Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.

548
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Look at this.

549
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,403
Tony.

550
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:31,676
- We were going to
meet at the hospital.

551
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,776
No, I'm fine.

552
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,876
Look at you.

553
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,658
- You had to have
a burger, yeah?

554
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:37,414
Well, come on.

555
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,749
- You get me one of those?

556
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:42,699
There's only one
left. I need it.

557
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,717
Hey, look who's here. Yeah.

558
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,596
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

559
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:53,931
Can I speak to
you for a moment?

560
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,859
I'm not part of the
press conference,

561
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:57,635
but it's about to
begin right now.

562
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,036
I'm not a reporter.

563
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,537
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

564
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,373
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement...

565
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,074
and Logistics Division.

566
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,877
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

567
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,994
You know, we've
been approached...

568
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:11,415
already by the DOD,
the FBI, the CIA...

569
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:15,152
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

570
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,851
We need to debrief Mr. Stark...

571
00:44:16,951 --> 00:44:18,922
about the circumstances
of his escape.

572
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:22,512
- I'll put something
in the book, shall I?

573
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:24,612
Thank you.

574
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,667
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

575
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,240
Why don't you just sit down?

576
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,303
That way you can
see me, and I can...

577
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,698
A little less formal and...

578
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,013
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

579
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,149
I don't know what he's up to.

580
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,651
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

581
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,320
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

582
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,820
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

583
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,228
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

584
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,804
I would have asked
him how he felt...

585
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:02,766
about what this company did.

586
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,521
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

587
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,730
Or maybe he was
every inch the man...

588
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:12,709
we all remember
from the newsreels.

589
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,947
I saw young
Americans killed...

590
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,858
by the very weapons I created...

591
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,678
to defend them
and protect them.

592
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,787
And I saw...

593
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,767
that I had become part
of a system that...

594
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:31,161
is comfortable with
zero accountability.

595
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,261
- Mr. Stark.
- Hey, Ben.

596
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,089
What happened over there?

597
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,101
I had my eyes opened.

598
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,471
I came to realize
that I have more...

599
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,151
to offer this world...

600
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:44,942
than just making
things that blow up.

601
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,248
And that is why,
effective immediately.

602
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:48,512
I am shutting down...

603
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,732
the weapons
manufacturing division...

604
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,249
of Stark International...

605
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,221
until such a time
as I can decide...

606
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,353
what the future of
the company will be.

607
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:57,988
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

608
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,878
What direction it should take,

609
00:45:58,978 --> 00:45:59,823
one that I'm
comfortable with...

610
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,150
and is consistent with
the highest good...

611
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,229
for this country, as well.

612
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,389
What we should take
away from this...

613
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:10,473
is that Tony's back.

614
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,032
And he's healthier than ever.

615
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,508
We're going to have...

616
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,373
a little internal
discussion...

617
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,213
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

618
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,458
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

619
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:37,056
Well, that... That went well.

620
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,563
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

621
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,965
Your head? What about my head?

622
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,591
What do you think
the over-under on...

623
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:45,135
the stock drop is
gonna be tomorrow?

624
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,572
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

625
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:49,907
Yep.

626
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,238
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.

627
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,978
Obie, I just don't
want a body count...

628
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:55,979
to be our only legacy.

629
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,861
That's what we do.
We're iron mongers.

630
00:46:57,961 --> 00:46:58,682
We make weapons.

631
00:46:58,782 --> 00:46:59,917
It's my name on the
side of the building.

632
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:00,743
And what we do...

633
00:47:00,843 --> 00:47:02,619
keeps the world from
falling into chaos.

634
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,759
Not based on what I saw.

635
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:06,890
We're not doing a
good enough job.

636
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,225
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

637
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,325
Like what?

638
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:12,145
You want us to
make baby bottles?

639
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,042
I think we should
take another look...

640
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:15,465
into arc reactor technology.

641
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:16,565
Come on.

642
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:20,186
The arc reactor, that's
a publicity stunt.

643
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:22,119
Tony, come on. We
built that thing...

644
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:23,340
to shut the hippies up.

645
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,840
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

646
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,654
The arc was never
cost effective.

647
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:30,314
We knew that before
we built it.

648
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:33,550
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

649
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,152
Maybe.

650
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,444
Am I right? We haven't had...

651
00:47:36,544 --> 00:47:37,821
a breakthrough
in that in what?

652
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,151
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

653
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,301
Could you have a
lousier poker face?

654
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:45,295
Just tell me, who told you?

655
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,290
- Never mind who
told me. Show me.

656
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,599
It's Rhodey or Pepper.

657
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,589
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

658
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,443
- Okay.
- Okay?

659
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,214
It works.

660
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,239
Listen to me,
Tony. We're a team.

661
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:13,690
Do you understand?

662
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,027
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

663
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,528
like your father and I.

664
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:20,397
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

665
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,065
- But if I had...
- Tony.

666
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,168
Tony, no more of this
'ready, fire, aim' business.

667
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:28,505
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

668
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,741
You gotta let me handle this.

669
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,837
We're gonna have to play...

670
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:33,243
a whole different
kind of ball now.

671
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,145
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

672
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,682
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

673
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,517
Stark Industries.

674
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,453
I've got one recommendation.
Ready? Ready?

675
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,821
Sell, sell, sell.

676
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,921
Abandon ship.

677
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,323
Does the Hindenburg
ring any bells?

678
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,766
Let me show you the new

679
00:48:53,866 --> 00:48:56,631
Stark Industries
business plan.

680
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:02,673
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons.

681
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,542
Pepper. How big
are your hands?

682
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,312
- What?
- How big are your hands?

683
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:13,087
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

684
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:20,688
Hey.

685
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,294
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

686
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,662
Let's see them.

687
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,665
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

688
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,485
I just need your
help for a sec.

689
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,271
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

690
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,896
It was. It is now an antique.

691
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,344
This is what will be
keeping me alive...

692
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,510
for the foreseeable future.

693
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,946
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

694
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,382
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

695
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,740
- Speed bump, what
does that mean?

696
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,251
It's nothing. It's
just a little snag.

697
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:51,688
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

698
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,331
And it's contacting
the socket wall...

699
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:54,891
and causing a little
bit of a short.

700
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,991
It's fine.

701
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,384
- What do you want me to do?

702
00:49:58,484 --> 00:49:59,463
Put that on the
table over there.

703
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,331
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God.

704
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,261
I want you to reach
in, and you're just...

705
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:06,436
gonna gently lift
the wire out.

706
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,572
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

707
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,307
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch...

708
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,742
the socket wall or
it goes 'beep.'

709
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,087
- What do you
mean, 'Operation'?

710
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:14,311
It's just a game, never mind.

711
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,391
- Just gently lift
the wire. Okay? Great.

712
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,491
Okay.

713
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,753
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

714
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,070
No, you're fine.

715
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,890
You're the most
capable, qualified,

716
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,745
trustworthy person
I've ever met.

717
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:31,695
You're gonna do great.

718
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,156
Is it too much of
a problem to ask?

719
00:50:33,256 --> 00:50:33,730
'Cause I'm...

720
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,606
- Okay, okay.

721
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:36,500
I really need your help here.

722
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,600
Okay.

723
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,640
Oh, there's pus.

724
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,993
It's not pus. It's
an inorganic...

725
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:48,345
plasmic discharge
from the device,

726
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,347
- not from my body.
- It smells.

727
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,249
Yeah, it does.

728
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,018
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

729
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,219
- Okay, I got it. I got it.
- Okay, you got it?

730
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,040
Now, don't let it
touch the sides...

731
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,222
when you're coming out.

732
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

733
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,682
That's what

734
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:01,725
I was trying to
tell you before.

735
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,545
Okay, now make sure...

736
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:03,960
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

737
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,437
There's a magnet
at the end of it.

738
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:06,997
That was it. You
just pulled it out.

739
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,231
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I was not expecting...

740
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,783
- Don't put it back in.
Don't put it back in.

741
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:10,467
Okay, what do I do?

742
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,568
What's wrong?

743
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:11,855
Nothing,

744
00:51:11,955 --> 00:51:13,003
I'm just going into
cardiac arrest...

745
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,371
'cause you yanked it
out like a trout...

746
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,638
- What? You said it was safe.

747
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:17,240
We gotta hurry. Take
this. Take this.

748
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,008
- You gotta switch
it out really quick.

749
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:19,543
Okay. Okay.

750
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,445
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

751
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,512
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

752
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,682
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

753
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,413
Okay, you're gonna attach that...

754
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:31,488
to the base plate.
Make sure you...

755
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,476
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

756
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:38,595
Here, I got it.
I got it. Here.

757
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,729
Nice.

758
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:42,065
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

759
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,165
You okay?

760
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,735
Don't ever, ever, ever,

761
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:50,807
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

762
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,287
I don't have anyone but you.

763
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,682
Anyway...

764
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,092
- What do you want
me to do with this?

765
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:09,192
That?

766
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,094
Destroy it.

767
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,194
Incinerate it.

768
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,965
You don't want to keep it?

769
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,520
Pepper, I've been
called many things.

770
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,669
'Nostalgic' is
not one of them.

771
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,908
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

772
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,074
That will be all, Miss Potts.

773
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,909
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

774
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,911
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

775
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,011
That's my phone,

776
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:31,181
that's a picture
of me and my dad.

777
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,936
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

778
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,640
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

779
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,063
I'll tell you, in
my experience,

780
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,396
no unmanned aerial vehicle...

781
00:52:49,496 --> 00:52:52,202
will ever trump a
pilot's instinct,

782
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,537
his insight,

783
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,719
that ability to look...

784
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,640
into a situation
beyond the obvious...

785
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,343
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

786
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,443
Colonel?

787
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:03,446
Why not a pilot
without the plane?

788
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:05,515
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

789
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:06,127
- Hello, sir.

790
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:07,517
Speaking of manned
or unmanned,

791
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:08,457
you gotta get him to tell you...

792
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:09,452
about the time he
guessed wrong...

793
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:10,259
at spring break.

794
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,155
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

795
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,118
- That lovely lady
you woke up with.

796
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:13,523
Don't do that.

797
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,991
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

798
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,159
- Was it lvan?
- Don't do that.

799
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,494
They'll believe
it. Don't do that.

800
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,728
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

801
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,800
- Pleasure meeting you.

802
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,928
Give us a couple
minutes, you guys.

803
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,369
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

804
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,145
I swear, I didn't
expect to see you...

805
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:29,239
walking around so soon.

806
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,141
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

807
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,241
- Really?
- Yeah.

808
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,112
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.

809
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:40,283
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

810
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,459
You're about to make a whole...

811
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:42,852
lot of people around
here real happy,

812
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:45,922
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

813
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,891
that was a doozy.

814
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,306
This is not for the
military. I'm not...

815
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:52,495
It's different.

816
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,453
What? You're a
humanitarian now...

817
00:53:54,553 --> 00:53:55,232
or something?

818
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,733
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

819
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,701
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

820
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:04,605
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

821
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,279
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

822
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,379
Thanks.

823
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:22,222
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

824
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,502
I'd like to open a
new project file,

825
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:27,464
index as Mark Two.

826
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,025
Shall I store this on...

827
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,468
the Stark Industries
Central Database?

828
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,937
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

829
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,460
Till further notice,
why don't we just...

830
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,840
keep everything on
my private server?

831
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,340
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

832
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:47,608
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

833
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,507
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

834
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,293
Next. Up.

835
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,737
Not in the boot,
Dummy. Right here.

836
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:40,837
You got me?

837
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,996
Stay put. Nice.

838
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,721
You're of no benefit at all.

839
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,045
Move down to the
toe. I got this.

840
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,035
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

841
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,188
Up.

842
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,025
Screw it. Don't even move.

843
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,151
You are a tragedy.

844
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,598
Okay, let's do this right.

845
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:22,133
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

846
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,614
Dummy, look alive.

847
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,082
You're on standby
for fire safety.

848
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,182
You, roll it.

849
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,445
Okay. Activate hand controls.

850
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,962
We're gonna start
off nice and easy.

851
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,222
We're gonna see if...

852
00:56:40,322 --> 00:56:42,232
10% thrust capacity
achieves lift.

853
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,332
And three,

854
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,269
two,

855
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,369
one.

856
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,954
Up two. All right, set that.

857
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,345
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

858
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,281
Yeah, everything's... What?

859
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,515
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great.

860
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,023
- What would you
like me to tell him?

861
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:35,018
Great. I'll be right up.

862
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,118
Okay.

863
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,922
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

864
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,423
It is.

865
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:45,028
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

866
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,131
I didn't expect that.

867
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,671
How'd it go?

868
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,976
It went that bad, huh?

869
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,712
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York...

870
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,683
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

871
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,819
It would have gone better
if you were there.

872
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,454
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

873
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:14,441
- I lay low, and you
take care of all...

874
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:17,060
Hey, come on. In
public. The press.

875
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,745
- This was a board of
directors meeting.

876
00:58:19,845 --> 00:58:22,298
This was a board of
directors meeting?

877
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,834
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

878
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,035
They're filing an injunction.

879
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,171
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

880
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,472
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

881
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,540
We knew that was gonna happen.

882
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,709
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

883
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,287
We own the controlling
interest...

884
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:35,011
in the company.

885
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,841
Tony, the board
has rights, too.

886
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,361
They're making the case...

887
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:42,585
that you and your
new direction...

888
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,065
- isn't in the
company's best interest.

889
00:58:44,165 --> 00:58:44,921
I'm being responsible.

890
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,931
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

891
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,844
I mean, me on the
company's behalf...

892
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,829
being responsible
for the way that...

893
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,930
This is great.

894
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,500
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

895
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,769
Hey, hey. Hey, Tony. Listen.

896
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,608
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,

897
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,206
but you gotta give
me something.

898
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,908
Something to pitch them.

899
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,929
Let me have the
engineers analyze that.

900
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:08,444
You know, draw up some specs.

901
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:09,303
- No. No, absolutely not.

902
00:59:09,403 --> 00:59:10,680
It'll give me a bone
to throw the boys...

903
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,348
- in New York.
- This one stays with me.

904
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,543
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.

905
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:15,251
All right, well, this
stays with me, then.

906
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,186
Go on, here, you
can have a piece.

907
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:18,755
- Take two.
- Thank you.

908
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,723
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

909
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,823
Good night, Obie.

910
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,711
Day 11, test 37,
configuration 2.0.

911
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:27,897
For lack of a better option.

912
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,667
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

913
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,736
and I'm not on fire,

914
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:33,570
I'm donating you
to a city college.

915
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,505
All right, nice and easy.

916
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:38,429
Seriously, just
gonna start off...

917
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:40,569
with 1% thrust capacity.

918
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,104
And three, two, one.

919
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,958
Okay.

920
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,896
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

921
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,398
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

922
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:02,972
Just stand down.

923
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:04,167
If something happens,
then come in.

924
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,502
And again, let's
bring it up to 2.5.

925
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:08,602
Three, two, one.

926
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,390
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.

927
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,615
Not the car, not the car.

928
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,159
Table.

929
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,833
Could be worse.
Could be worse.

930
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,933
We're fine. Okay.

931
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,460
No.

932
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,064
Yeah, I can fly.

933
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,440
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

934
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,742
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

935
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,878
Import all preferences
from home interface.

936
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,978
Will do, sir.

937
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,387
All right, what do you say?

938
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,502
I have indeed been
uploaded, sir.

939
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:34,991
We're online and ready.

940
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,693
Can we start the
virtual walk-around?

941
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,931
Importing preferences...

942
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:39,762
and calibrating
virtual environment.

943
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,164
Do a check on
control surfaces.

944
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,264
As you wish.

945
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:05,845
Test complete. Preparing to...

946
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:07,223
power down and
begin diagnostics.

947
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:10,226
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

948
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,794
Start listening in
on ground control.

949
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,962
Sir, there are
still terabytes...

950
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,665
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

951
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,199
Jarvis. Sometimes
you got to run...

952
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:19,669
before you can walk.

953
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:24,035
Ready? In three, two, one.

954
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,363
Handles like a dream.

955
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:18,907
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

956
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:20,408
What's SR-71's record?

957
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:23,303
The altitude record for
fixed wing flight...

958
01:03:23,403 --> 01:03:24,646
is 85,000 feet, sir.

959
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:27,976
Records are made to be broken.
Come on.

960
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:32,662
Sir, there is a
potentially fatal...

961
01:03:32,762 --> 01:03:34,189
buildup of ice occurring.

962
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:36,289
Keep going.

963
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:39,659
Higher.

964
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,906
We iced up, Jarvis.
Deploy flaps. Jarvis.

965
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:02,486
Come on, we got
to break the ice.

966
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:39,285
Kill power.

967
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:04,966
Notes. Main transducer
feels sluggish...

968
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,139
at plus 40 altitude.

969
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,191
Hull pressurization
is problematic.

970
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:10,644
I'm thinking icing is
the probable factor.

971
01:06:10,744 --> 01:06:12,946
A very astute
observation, sir.

972
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:14,814
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

973
01:06:14,914 --> 01:06:16,349
we should improve
the exosystems.

974
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:17,384
Connect to the sys. co.

975
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:19,019
Have it reconfigure
the shell metals.

976
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,672
Use the gold titanium
alloy from...

977
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,188
the seraphim
tactical satellite.

978
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:24,204
That should ensure a
fuselage integrity...

979
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:26,126
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.

980
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:27,494
- Got it?
- Yes.

981
01:06:27,594 --> 01:06:29,896
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

982
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:31,996
Thrill me.

983
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:35,203
Tonight's red-hot red
carpet is right...

984
01:06:35,303 --> 01:06:37,270
here at the Disney
Concert Hall,

985
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,602
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit...

986
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:41,608
for the Firefighter's
Family Fund...

987
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,276
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

988
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:44,611
Jarvis, we get an
invite for that?

989
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:47,213
I have no record of
an invitation, sir.

990
01:06:47,313 --> 01:06:48,748
...hasn't been
seen in public...

991
01:06:48,848 --> 01:06:50,717
since his bizarre and highly...

992
01:06:50,817 --> 01:06:52,686
controversial
press conference.

993
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:55,422
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress...

994
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:57,750
and has been
bedridden for weeks.

995
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,526
Whatever the case may be,

996
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:02,362
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

997
01:07:02,462 --> 01:07:04,589
The render is complete.

998
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:06,366
A little ostentatious,
don't you think?

999
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:10,461
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

1000
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:11,850
Tell you what.

1001
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,773
Throw a little
hot-rod red in there.

1002
01:07:13,873 --> 01:07:17,613
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

1003
01:07:19,946 --> 01:07:21,946
The render is complete.

1004
01:07:22,315 --> 01:07:24,184
Hey, I like it.
Fabricate it. Paint it.

1005
01:07:24,284 --> 01:07:25,852
Commencing automated assembly.

1006
01:07:25,952 --> 01:07:29,122
Estimated completion
time is five hours.

1007
01:07:29,222 --> 01:07:31,602
Don't wait up for me, honey.

1008
01:07:54,547 --> 01:07:56,113
Weapons manufacturing is only...

1009
01:07:56,213 --> 01:07:58,284
one small part of what
Stark Industries...

1010
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:01,359
is all about, and
our partnership...

1011
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:04,513
with the fire and
rescue community...

1012
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:08,021
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

1013
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:10,828
You look great, Hef.

1014
01:08:12,165 --> 01:08:13,466
We're going to have
a great quarter.

1015
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:15,357
What's the world
coming to when...

1016
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:17,303
a guy's got to
crash his own party?

1017
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:21,567
Look at you. Hey,
what a surprise.

1018
01:08:21,674 --> 01:08:23,674
I'll see you inside.

1019
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,275
Hey. Listen, take
it slow, all right?

1020
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,082
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

1021
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:33,517
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

1022
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:40,015
- Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

1023
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:41,461
Mr. Stark?

1024
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:43,561
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

1025
01:08:43,797 --> 01:08:45,999
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

1026
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:47,627
Strategic Homeland
Intervention.

1027
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:49,402
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.

1028
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:51,137
God, you need a
new name for that.

1029
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:53,277
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

1030
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:56,031
Listen, I know this must
be a trying time...

1031
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,777
for you, but we need
to debrief you.

1032
01:08:57,877 --> 01:08:59,846
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

1033
01:08:59,946 --> 01:09:01,815
and time can be a factor
with these things.

1034
01:09:01,915 --> 01:09:03,917
Let's just put
something on the books.

1035
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:06,178
How about the
24th at 7:00 p.m.

1036
01:09:06,278 --> 01:09:07,654
at Stark Industries?

1037
01:09:07,754 --> 01:09:08,754
Tell you what.

1038
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:11,124
You got it. You're
absolutely right.

1039
01:09:11,224 --> 01:09:14,404
Well, I'm going to
go to my assistant,

1040
01:09:14,504 --> 01:09:16,504
and we'll make a date.

1041
01:09:16,896 --> 01:09:18,965
You look fantastic.
I didn't recognize you.

1042
01:09:19,065 --> 01:09:20,032
- What are you doing here?

1043
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:21,334
Just avoiding
government agents.

1044
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:22,105
- Are you by yourself?

1045
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:23,203
Yes. Where'd you
get that dress?

1046
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:24,534
- Oh, it was a
birthday present.

1047
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:25,105
That's great.

1048
01:09:25,205 --> 01:09:27,340
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

1049
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,675
Yes.

1050
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:30,643
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

1051
01:09:30,743 --> 01:09:33,888
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

1052
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,240
Am I making you uncomfortable?

1053
01:09:46,326 --> 01:09:48,857
No. No. I always
forget to wear...

1054
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:51,564
deodorant and dance
with my boss...

1055
01:09:51,664 --> 01:09:54,117
in front of everyone
that I work with...

1056
01:09:54,217 --> 01:09:55,668
in a dress with no back.

1057
01:09:55,768 --> 01:09:57,204
- You look great
and you smell great.

1058
01:09:57,304 --> 01:09:58,304
Oh, God.

1059
01:09:58,404 --> 01:09:59,611
But I could fire
you if that would...

1060
01:09:59,711 --> 01:10:00,273
take the edge off.

1061
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:01,976
I actually don't think that...

1062
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,010
you could tie your
shoes without me.

1063
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,545
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

1064
01:10:05,645 --> 01:10:08,620
What's your Social
Security number?

1065
01:10:11,618 --> 01:10:13,618
- Five.
- Five?

1066
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,488
- Right.
- Right.

1067
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:17,924
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

1068
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:19,334
The other eight?

1069
01:10:19,434 --> 01:10:22,239
So I got you for
the other eight.

1070
01:10:33,806 --> 01:10:37,886
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

1071
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:40,713
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

1072
01:10:40,813 --> 01:10:43,750
It was totally not
harmless, by the way.

1073
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,118
We're dancing. No
one's even watching.

1074
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:46,986
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

1075
01:10:47,086 --> 01:10:48,645
I think you lost
objectivity. I think...

1076
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,223
they just... People...
We just danced.

1077
01:10:50,323 --> 01:10:52,219
No, it was not just
a dance. You don't...

1078
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,693
understand because you're you.

1079
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:56,596
And everybody knows
exactly who you are...

1080
01:10:56,696 --> 01:10:57,968
and how you are with girls...

1081
01:10:58,068 --> 01:10:59,933
and all of that, which
is completely fine.

1082
01:11:00,033 --> 01:11:02,368
But, you know, then
me, you're my boss,

1083
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:03,262
- and I'm dancing with you.

1084
01:11:03,362 --> 01:11:04,437
I don't think it
was taken that way.

1085
01:11:04,537 --> 01:11:07,373
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

1086
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:08,558
- I just think you're
overstating it.

1087
01:11:08,658 --> 01:11:09,375
You know, and we're here,

1088
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:13,241
and then I'm wearing
this ridiculous...

1089
01:11:13,346 --> 01:11:16,013
dress, and then we
were dancing...

1090
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:18,113
like that and...

1091
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:32,768
- I would like
a drink, please.

1092
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,234
Got it, okay.

1093
01:11:34,334 --> 01:11:36,137
- I would like a
vodka martini, please.

1094
01:11:36,237 --> 01:11:37,237
Okay.

1095
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:40,482
Very dry with olives,
a lot of olives.

1096
01:11:40,538 --> 01:11:42,809
Like, at least three olives.

1097
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:45,945
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

1098
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:48,850
Make one of them
dirty, will you?

1099
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:55,412
Wow. Tony Stark.

1100
01:11:55,788 --> 01:11:58,678
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

1101
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:02,278
- Carrie.
- Christine.

1102
01:12:02,378 --> 01:12:03,162
- Carrie.
- Christine.

1103
01:12:03,262 --> 01:12:04,230
That's right.

1104
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:07,000
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

1105
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,468
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?

1106
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:11,004
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

1107
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:12,438
'Cause I was referring
to your company's...

1108
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:13,873
involvement in this
latest atrocity.

1109
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:15,111
Yeah. They just put
my name on the...

1110
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:16,509
invitation. I don't
know what to tell you.

1111
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:18,945
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

1112
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:20,447
I was out of town
for a couple months,

1113
01:12:20,547 --> 01:12:21,414
in case you didn't hear.

1114
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:23,816
Is this what you
call accountability?

1115
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:27,316
It's a town called
Gulmira. Heard of it?

1116
01:12:38,197 --> 01:12:41,000
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

1117
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,215
- I didn't approve
any shipment.

1118
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:43,102
Well, your company did.

1119
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:45,327
Well, I'm not my company.

1120
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:47,618
- Please, do you mind?

1121
01:12:47,718 --> 01:12:49,509
Have you seen these pictures?

1122
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:50,944
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

1123
01:12:51,044 --> 01:12:52,693
- You can't afford
to be this naive.

1124
01:12:52,793 --> 01:12:54,347
You know what? I
was naive before,

1125
01:12:54,447 --> 01:12:54,937
when they said,

1126
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,282
'Here's the line.
We don't cross it.

1127
01:12:56,382 --> 01:12:57,750
'This is how we do business.'

1128
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,287
If we're double-dealing
under the table...

1129
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:01,387
Are we?

1130
01:13:01,487 --> 01:13:03,782
Tony, your picture, please.

1131
01:13:05,858 --> 01:13:09,513
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time.

1132
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:14,360
Tony. Who do you
think locked you out?

1133
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:19,251
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

1134
01:13:20,706 --> 01:13:24,106
It was the only way
I could protect you.

1135
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:27,812
No. No.

1136
01:13:35,088 --> 01:13:37,204
The 15-mile hike to
the outskirts...

1137
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:39,359
of Gulmira can only
be described...

1138
01:13:39,459 --> 01:13:40,879
as a descent into hell,

1139
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:43,229
into a modern day
Heart of Darkness.

1140
01:13:43,329 --> 01:13:46,232
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages...

1141
01:13:46,332 --> 01:13:48,034
have been driven
from their homes,

1142
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:50,595
displaced from their
lands by warlords...

1143
01:13:50,695 --> 01:13:52,605
emboldened by a
new-found power.

1144
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:54,136
Villagers have been
forced to take...

1145
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:55,708
shelter in whatever
crude dwellings...

1146
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:58,578
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

1147
01:13:58,678 --> 01:14:00,724
or here in the remnants...

1148
01:14:00,824 --> 01:14:03,544
of an old Soviet
smelting plant.

1149
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,074
Recent violence has
been attributed...

1150
01:14:09,174 --> 01:14:10,690
to a group of
foreign fighters...

1151
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:13,659
referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.

1152
01:14:13,759 --> 01:14:15,404
As you can see, these men are...

1153
01:14:15,504 --> 01:14:17,096
heavily armed
and on a mission.

1154
01:14:17,196 --> 01:14:19,296
A mission that
could prove fatal...

1155
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:21,434
to anyone who stands
in their way.

1156
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:24,070
With no political will
or international pressure,

1157
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,606
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

1158
01:14:26,706 --> 01:14:28,876
Around me, a woman
begging for news...

1159
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:29,976
on her husband,

1160
01:14:30,076 --> 01:14:31,844
who was kidnapped
by insurgents,

1161
01:14:31,944 --> 01:14:35,174
either forced to join
their militia...

1162
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:38,117
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

1163
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:40,787
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

1164
01:14:40,887 --> 01:14:43,047
A child's simple question,

1165
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:45,952
'Where are my
mother and father?'

1166
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:48,528
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

1167
01:14:48,628 --> 01:14:51,383
refugees who can
only wonder who,

1168
01:14:51,483 --> 01:14:53,483
if anyone, will help.

1169
01:18:24,744 --> 01:18:26,744
He's all yours.

1170
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:26,003
What the hell was that?

1171
01:19:26,103 --> 01:19:27,106
Were we cleared
to go in there?

1172
01:19:27,206 --> 01:19:28,363
No, they were using
human shields.

1173
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,442
We never got the green light.

1174
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:30,085
Put me through to State.

1175
01:19:30,185 --> 01:19:30,976
They're going to
be all over this.

1176
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:33,076
Get those monitors up.

1177
01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:34,380
We got a bogey.

1178
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,615
- Wasn't Air Force.
- We got the CIA on the line?

1179
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:38,651
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

1180
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,386
No, it definitely
is not us, sir.

1181
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:42,154
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

1182
01:19:42,254 --> 01:19:42,992
I need answers.

1183
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:44,724
Can I please get
eyes on target?

1184
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:47,093
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

1185
01:19:47,193 --> 01:19:49,353
Get me Colonel Rhodes from

1186
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:52,343
Weapons Development
down here now.

1187
01:19:56,635 --> 01:19:58,371
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced...

1188
01:19:58,471 --> 01:20:00,172
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

1189
01:20:00,272 --> 01:20:02,475
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

1190
01:20:02,575 --> 01:20:04,243
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

1191
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:06,011
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

1192
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:07,446
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

1193
01:20:07,546 --> 01:20:09,515
Got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.

1194
01:20:09,615 --> 01:20:11,817
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

1195
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,220
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

1196
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,635
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?

1197
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:22,601
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

1198
01:20:25,197 --> 01:20:26,999
- Hello?
- Tony?

1199
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:29,001
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

1200
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:31,137
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

1201
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:32,277
- Speak up, please.

1202
01:20:32,377 --> 01:20:34,106
What in the hell
is that noise?

1203
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:35,938
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving
with the top down.

1204
01:20:36,038 --> 01:20:37,643
Yeah, well, I need
your help right now.

1205
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:39,111
It's funny how
that works, huh?

1206
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,846
Yeah. Speaking of
funny, we've got a...

1207
01:20:40,946 --> 01:20:42,581
weapons depot that
was just blown up...

1208
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:44,316
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

1209
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:46,051
Well, that's a hot spot.

1210
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:48,621
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

1211
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:49,789
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?

1212
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:51,090
I'm not, I was just
jogging in the canyon.

1213
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,958
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving...

1214
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:54,827
to the canyon, where
I'm going to jog.

1215
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,079
You sure you don't
have any tech...

1216
01:20:56,179 --> 01:20:57,263
in that area I
should know about?

1217
01:20:57,363 --> 01:20:58,831
- Nope.
- Bogey spotted.

1218
01:20:58,931 --> 01:20:59,907
- Whiplash, come in hot.

1219
01:21:00,007 --> 01:21:01,667
Okay, good, 'cause
I'm staring at one...

1220
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:04,577
right now, and it's
about to be blown...

1221
01:21:04,677 --> 01:21:05,771
to kingdom come.

1222
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:07,871
That's my exit.

1223
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:14,034
Ballroom, this
is Whiplash One.

1224
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:15,881
I've got the bogey
in my sights.

1225
01:21:15,981 --> 01:21:17,416
Whiplash One, what is it?

1226
01:21:17,516 --> 01:21:18,818
I've got no idea.

1227
01:21:18,918 --> 01:21:21,253
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

1228
01:21:21,353 --> 01:21:23,818
Then you are clear to engage.

1229
01:21:24,456 --> 01:21:26,456
Hit it.

1230
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:32,966
That bogey just
went supersonic.

1231
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:35,066
I got a lock.

1232
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:39,598
- Inbound missile.
- Flares.

1233
01:21:42,341 --> 01:21:45,486
Wait a second. Bogey
deployed flares.

1234
01:21:59,224 --> 01:22:01,224
Deploy flaps.

1235
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,862
Holy.

1236
01:22:02,962 --> 01:22:04,530
That thing just jumped
off the radar, sir.

1237
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,165
The sat visual has been lost.

1238
01:22:06,265 --> 01:22:07,933
No way that's a UAV.

1239
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:09,168
What is it?

1240
01:22:09,268 --> 01:22:10,803
I can't see anything.

1241
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:13,772
Whatever it was, it
just bought the farm.

1242
01:22:13,872 --> 01:22:16,762
I think bogey's
been handled, sir.

1243
01:22:25,851 --> 01:22:27,520
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

1244
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:29,288
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

1245
01:22:29,388 --> 01:22:29,633
You asked.

1246
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:30,656
What you were
asking about is me.

1247
01:22:30,756 --> 01:22:32,224
No, see, this isn't a game.

1248
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,278
You do not send
civilian equipment...

1249
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:35,628
into my active war zone.

1250
01:22:35,728 --> 01:22:36,439
- You understand that?

1251
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:37,630
This is not a
piece of equipment.

1252
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:40,494
I'm in it. It's
a suit. It's me.

1253
01:22:40,633 --> 01:22:43,353
Rhodey, you got
anything for me?

1254
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:47,664
- Mark your position
and return to base.

1255
01:22:47,764 --> 01:22:49,764
Roger that, Ballroom.

1256
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:50,943
On your belly.

1257
01:22:51,043 --> 01:22:53,043
It looks like a man.

1258
01:22:53,145 --> 01:22:55,773
Shake him off. Roll. Roll.

1259
01:23:03,856 --> 01:23:04,990
I'm hit. I'm hit.

1260
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:07,810
It's confirmed.
He has been hit.

1261
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,530
Punch out. Punch out.

1262
01:23:19,938 --> 01:23:21,674
Whiplash One down.

1263
01:23:21,774 --> 01:23:23,309
Whiplash Two, do
you see a chute?

1264
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:25,874
Negative. No chute, no chute.

1265
01:23:31,183 --> 01:23:33,183
My chute's jammed.

1266
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,926
Sir, I've got a
visual on the bogey.

1267
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:42,931
Whiplash Two, reengage.

1268
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,144
If you get a clear
shot, you take it.

1269
01:23:46,244 --> 01:23:48,000
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1270
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,870
- Call off the Raptors.

1271
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,169
That thing just
took out an F-22...

1272
01:23:50,269 --> 01:23:51,604
inside a legal no fly zone.

1273
01:23:51,704 --> 01:23:52,291
Whiplash Two,

1274
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:54,006
if you have a clear
shot, take it.

1275
01:23:54,106 --> 01:23:56,475
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1276
01:23:56,575 --> 01:23:58,575
Keep going.

1277
01:24:05,551 --> 01:24:07,551
Good chute. Good chute.

1278
01:24:15,194 --> 01:24:18,030
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

1279
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,275
Oh, my God, you
crazy son of a bitch.

1280
01:24:21,533 --> 01:24:24,637
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1281
01:24:24,737 --> 01:24:27,172
Yeah, well,
technically, he hit me.

1282
01:24:27,272 --> 01:24:28,841
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1283
01:24:28,941 --> 01:24:31,877
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1284
01:24:31,977 --> 01:24:33,512
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1285
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:36,115
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1286
01:24:36,215 --> 01:24:38,215
It's not that simple.

1287
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:40,552
An unfortunate
training exercise...

1288
01:24:40,652 --> 01:24:44,189
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1289
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:45,744
I am pleased to report...

1290
01:24:45,844 --> 01:24:47,660
that the pilot
was not injured.

1291
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,089
As for the unexpected
turn of events...

1292
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:51,664
on the ground in Gulmira,

1293
01:24:51,764 --> 01:24:55,334
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1294
01:24:55,367 --> 01:24:58,377
but I can assure
you that the United

1295
01:24:58,477 --> 01:25:01,446
States government
was not involved.

1296
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,546
Hey.

1297
01:25:04,543 --> 01:25:06,543
It is a tight fit, sir.

1298
01:25:07,412 --> 01:25:08,698
Sir, the more you struggle,

1299
01:25:08,798 --> 01:25:10,282
the more this is
going to hurt.

1300
01:25:10,382 --> 01:25:13,153
Be gentle. This
is my first time.

1301
01:25:13,253 --> 01:25:16,568
I designed this to
come off, so... Hey.

1302
01:25:17,289 --> 01:25:19,962
- I really should
be able to...

1303
01:25:20,062 --> 01:25:22,527
Please, try not to move, sir.

1304
01:25:22,627 --> 01:25:24,858
What's going on here?

1305
01:25:29,434 --> 01:25:31,968
Let's face it. This
is not the worst...

1306
01:25:32,068 --> 01:25:33,939
thing you've caught me doing.

1307
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:36,039
Are those bullet holes?

1308
01:26:03,402 --> 01:26:05,402
Welcome.

1309
01:26:08,006 --> 01:26:10,216
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1310
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:12,787
If you'd killed him
when you were...

1311
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:14,680
supposed to, you'd
still have a face.

1312
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,849
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

1313
01:26:16,949 --> 01:26:18,949
Show me the weapon.

1314
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:23,388
Come. Leave your
guards outside.

1315
01:26:40,205 --> 01:26:43,010
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

1316
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,535
So this is how he did it.

1317
01:26:47,713 --> 01:26:50,315
This is only a
first, crude effort.

1318
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:53,050
Stark has perfected
his design.

1319
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:56,126
He has made a
masterpiece of death.

1320
01:26:56,321 --> 01:27:00,401
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1321
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,813
And you dream of
Stark's throne.

1322
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:07,425
We have a common enemy.

1323
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:14,150
If we are still in business.

1324
01:27:16,275 --> 01:27:18,995
I will give you
these designs...

1325
01:27:19,978 --> 01:27:21,978
as a gift.

1326
01:27:22,648 --> 01:27:24,648
And in turn.

1327
01:27:25,717 --> 01:27:30,780
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1328
01:27:47,773 --> 01:27:49,773
Technology.

1329
01:27:51,009 --> 01:27:53,742
It's always been your
Achilles' heel...

1330
01:27:53,842 --> 01:27:55,647
in this part of the world.

1331
01:27:55,747 --> 01:27:59,487
Don't worry. It'll only
last for 15 minutes.

1332
01:28:00,118 --> 01:28:03,008
That's the least
of your problems.

1333
01:28:07,793 --> 01:28:11,023
Crate up the armor
and the rest of it.

1334
01:28:12,064 --> 01:28:14,784
All right, let's
finish up here.

1335
01:28:18,036 --> 01:28:20,973
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1336
01:28:21,073 --> 01:28:23,125
and I'm going to want
this data masked.

1337
01:28:23,225 --> 01:28:24,576
Recruit our top engineers.

1338
01:28:24,676 --> 01:28:27,226
I want a prototype right away.

1339
01:28:34,753 --> 01:28:35,753
Hey. You busy?

1340
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:37,890
You mind if I send
you on an errand?

1341
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,540
I need you to go to my office.

1342
01:28:40,726 --> 01:28:41,986
You're going to hack
into the mainframe...

1343
01:28:42,086 --> 01:28:43,128
and you're going
to retrieve all...

1344
01:28:43,228 --> 01:28:45,831
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1345
01:28:45,931 --> 01:28:47,499
This'll get you in.

1346
01:28:47,599 --> 01:28:49,167
It's probably under
Executive Files.

1347
01:28:49,267 --> 01:28:50,631
If not, they put it
on a ghost drive,

1348
01:28:50,731 --> 01:28:51,637
in which case you need...

1349
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:54,606
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

1350
01:28:54,706 --> 01:28:55,775
And what do you
plan to do with...

1351
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,175
this information if
I bring it back here?

1352
01:28:57,275 --> 01:28:58,310
Same drill.

1353
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,517
They've been dealing
under the table,

1354
01:28:59,617 --> 01:29:00,412
and I'm going to stop them.

1355
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:04,337
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1356
01:29:04,549 --> 01:29:06,549
Tony,

1357
01:29:07,919 --> 01:29:08,421
you know that

1358
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:09,788
I would help you
with anything,

1359
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,438
but I cannot help you if...

1360
01:29:11,538 --> 01:29:13,859
you're going to start
all of this again.

1361
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:17,729
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1362
01:29:17,829 --> 01:29:21,654
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1363
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:25,737
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1364
01:29:26,438 --> 01:29:28,438
Is that so?

1365
01:29:29,975 --> 01:29:31,975
Well, then, I quit.

1366
01:29:34,546 --> 01:29:36,148
You stood by my side
all these years...

1367
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:39,284
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1368
01:29:39,384 --> 01:29:41,219
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people...

1369
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:43,121
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1370
01:29:43,221 --> 01:29:45,486
You're going to kill
yourself, Tony.

1371
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,659
I'm not going to
be a part of it.

1372
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:49,759
I shouldn't be alive,

1373
01:29:51,063 --> 01:29:53,358
unless it was for a reason.

1374
01:29:54,032 --> 01:29:56,032
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1375
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:59,631
I just finally know
what I have to do.

1376
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:07,224
And I know in my
heart that it's right.

1377
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:25,232
You're all I have,
too, you know.

1378
01:31:34,299 --> 01:31:39,066
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1379
01:31:52,017 --> 01:31:54,145
You did not tell us
that the target you...

1380
01:31:54,245 --> 01:31:56,321
paid us to kill was
the great Tony Stark.

1381
01:31:56,421 --> 01:31:57,531
- As you can see,
Obadiah Stane...

1382
01:31:57,631 --> 01:31:57,956
Oh, my God.

1383
01:31:58,056 --> 01:32:00,759
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1384
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:04,684
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1385
01:32:07,566 --> 01:32:11,935
So, what are we going
to do about this?

1386
01:32:23,949 --> 01:32:26,249
I know what you're
going through.

1387
01:32:26,349 --> 01:32:28,349
Pepper.

1388
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,935
Tony. He always gets
the good stuff,

1389
01:32:37,955 --> 01:32:39,955
doesn't he?

1390
01:33:00,285 --> 01:33:04,654
I was so happy
when he came home.

1391
01:33:04,756 --> 01:33:08,241
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1392
01:33:10,595 --> 01:33:12,595
Now I realize,

1393
01:33:14,866 --> 01:33:18,691
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1394
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:23,186
He left a part of
himself in that cave.

1395
01:33:25,343 --> 01:33:27,343
Breaks my heart.

1396
01:33:29,247 --> 01:33:33,183
Well, he's a
complicated person.

1397
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,255
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1398
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,360
You are a very rare woman.

1399
01:33:50,902 --> 01:33:53,792
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

1400
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:57,807
Thank you. Thanks.

1401
01:33:59,811 --> 01:34:02,021
I'd better get back there.

1402
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:09,319
Is that today's paper?

1403
01:34:10,989 --> 01:34:12,724
Yes.

1404
01:34:12,824 --> 01:34:14,824
Do you mind?

1405
01:34:14,826 --> 01:34:16,628
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1406
01:34:16,728 --> 01:34:18,728
Of course.

1407
01:34:21,533 --> 01:34:23,533
Take care.

1408
01:34:47,025 --> 01:34:48,328
Ms. Potts? We had
an appointment.

1409
01:34:48,428 --> 01:34:49,894
Did you forget about
our appointment?

1410
01:34:49,994 --> 01:34:51,496
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1411
01:34:51,596 --> 01:34:51,840
- Right now?

1412
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,697
We're going to
have it right now.

1413
01:34:52,797 --> 01:34:55,177
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1414
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:57,829
I'm going to give
you the meeting...

1415
01:34:57,929 --> 01:34:59,404
of your life. Your office.

1416
01:34:59,504 --> 01:35:02,607
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1417
01:35:02,707 --> 01:35:03,980
Absolutely, we're...

1418
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,344
I'm going to have
to call you back.

1419
01:35:06,444 --> 01:35:09,164
Mr. Stane? Sir,
we've explored...

1420
01:35:09,214 --> 01:35:10,329
what you've asked
us, and it seems...

1421
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:11,449
as though there's
a little hiccup.

1422
01:35:11,549 --> 01:35:13,218
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1423
01:35:13,318 --> 01:35:14,938
Yes, to power the suit, sir,

1424
01:35:15,038 --> 01:35:17,255
the technology actually
doesn't exist.

1425
01:35:17,355 --> 01:35:18,355
- So it's...

1426
01:35:18,455 --> 01:35:20,492
Wait, wait, wait.
The technology?

1427
01:35:20,592 --> 01:35:23,227
William, here is
the technology.

1428
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:26,660
I've asked you to
simply make it smaller.

1429
01:35:26,664 --> 01:35:28,725
Okay, sir, and that's
what we're trying...

1430
01:35:28,825 --> 01:35:30,635
to do, but honestly,
it's impossible.

1431
01:35:30,735 --> 01:35:34,160
Tony Stark was able
to build this...

1432
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,299
in a cave. With
a box of scraps.

1433
01:35:39,544 --> 01:35:42,604
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

1434
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:00,730
Tony?

1435
01:36:02,467 --> 01:36:05,732
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1436
01:36:07,338 --> 01:36:09,338
Breathe.

1437
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:12,437
Easy, easy.

1438
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:17,011
You remember this one, right?

1439
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,852
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1440
01:36:20,952 --> 01:36:23,413
There's so many applications...

1441
01:36:23,513 --> 01:36:26,318
for causing
short-term paralysis.

1442
01:36:27,425 --> 01:36:29,425
Tony.

1443
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:35,329
When I ordered the hit on you.

1444
01:36:37,969 --> 01:36:40,437
I worried that I was...

1445
01:36:43,508 --> 01:36:45,633
killing the golden goose.

1446
01:36:46,878 --> 01:36:50,609
But, you see, it was just...

1447
01:36:51,983 --> 01:36:54,363
fate that you survived that.

1448
01:36:59,324 --> 01:37:03,158
You had one last
golden egg to give.

1449
01:37:07,365 --> 01:37:10,680
Do you really think
that just because...

1450
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:13,741
you have an idea,
it belongs to you?

1451
01:37:16,574 --> 01:37:21,671
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1452
01:37:21,779 --> 01:37:24,824
Now, what kind of
world would it be...

1453
01:37:24,924 --> 01:37:27,814
today if he was as
selfish as you?

1454
01:37:36,027 --> 01:37:38,027
Oh, it's beautiful.

1455
01:37:40,298 --> 01:37:45,099
Tony, this is your
Ninth Symphony.

1456
01:37:47,438 --> 01:37:50,243
What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

1457
01:37:51,276 --> 01:37:53,276
This is your legacy.

1458
01:37:55,580 --> 01:38:00,745
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1459
01:38:03,988 --> 01:38:06,592
Weapons that will help
steer the world...

1460
01:38:06,692 --> 01:38:07,692
back on course,

1461
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:11,022
put the balance of
power in our hands.

1462
01:38:11,629 --> 01:38:13,629
The right hands.

1463
01:38:16,401 --> 01:38:20,895
I wish you could've
seen my prototype.

1464
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,340
It's not as...

1465
01:38:25,176 --> 01:38:28,151
Well, not as
conservative as yours.

1466
01:38:30,214 --> 01:38:32,284
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper...

1467
01:38:32,384 --> 01:38:33,384
in this.

1468
01:38:33,484 --> 01:38:36,714
I would have preferred
that she lived.

1469
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,369
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1470
01:38:51,469 --> 01:38:54,699
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1471
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,608
Okay, where's Tony now?

1472
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:58,409
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1473
01:38:58,509 --> 01:38:59,352
Please go over there...

1474
01:38:59,452 --> 01:39:00,645
and make sure
everything's okay.

1475
01:39:00,745 --> 01:39:03,890
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1476
01:40:09,681 --> 01:40:11,681
Good boy.

1477
01:40:50,788 --> 01:40:52,788
Tony?

1478
01:40:54,525 --> 01:40:56,525
Tony?

1479
01:40:57,395 --> 01:40:59,395
Tony?

1480
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:02,631
Tony?

1481
01:41:04,435 --> 01:41:06,435
Tony.

1482
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:09,969
Tony. You okay?

1483
01:41:10,374 --> 01:41:11,502
- Where's Pepper?

1484
01:41:11,602 --> 01:41:13,978
She's fine. She's
with five agents.

1485
01:41:14,078 --> 01:41:16,447
They're about to
arrest Obadiah.

1486
01:41:16,547 --> 01:41:19,097
That's not going to be enough.

1487
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:48,434
Section 16. Section
16. There it is.

1488
01:41:57,488 --> 01:42:00,158
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1489
01:42:00,258 --> 01:42:02,393
Oh, wow. What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1490
01:42:02,493 --> 01:42:03,387
It's, like, a thing
that's going...

1491
01:42:03,487 --> 01:42:03,895
to pick the lock?

1492
01:42:03,995 --> 01:42:07,310
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1493
01:42:25,316 --> 01:42:27,819
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1494
01:42:27,919 --> 01:42:30,683
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1495
01:42:37,395 --> 01:42:40,115
You need me to do
anything else?

1496
01:42:40,364 --> 01:42:42,364
Keep the skies clear.

1497
01:42:47,305 --> 01:42:49,305
Damn.

1498
01:42:56,647 --> 01:42:58,647
Next time, baby.

1499
01:43:28,412 --> 01:43:32,283
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1500
01:43:32,383 --> 01:43:34,508
I thought it'd be bigger.

1501
01:44:31,108 --> 01:44:32,043
How do you think the Mark One...

1502
01:44:32,143 --> 01:44:33,077
chest piece is
going to hold up?

1503
01:44:33,177 --> 01:44:35,479
The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.

1504
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:36,389
That chest piece...

1505
01:44:36,489 --> 01:44:38,249
was never designed
for sustained flight.

1506
01:44:38,349 --> 01:44:40,349
Keep me posted.

1507
01:44:41,652 --> 01:44:42,620
Pepper.

1508
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,723
- Tony. Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1509
01:44:45,823 --> 01:44:47,725
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know.

1510
01:44:47,825 --> 01:44:49,039
- Listen, you'd better
get out of there.

1511
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:49,594
He built a suit.

1512
01:44:49,694 --> 01:44:51,989
Get out of there right now.

1513
01:45:03,007 --> 01:45:05,727
Where do you think
you're going?

1514
01:45:10,848 --> 01:45:13,972
Your services are
no longer required.

1515
01:45:14,072 --> 01:45:16,072
Stane.

1516
01:45:40,711 --> 01:45:42,380
I love this suit.

1517
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:46,050
- Put them down.
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1518
01:45:47,251 --> 01:45:49,376
Divert power to chest RT.

1519
01:45:58,029 --> 01:46:00,122
Power reduced to 19%.

1520
01:46:08,005 --> 01:46:10,005
Lady.

1521
01:46:11,008 --> 01:46:13,008
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1522
01:46:35,099 --> 01:46:38,414
For 30 years, I've
been holding you up.

1523
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:45,430
I built this company
from nothing.

1524
01:46:47,244 --> 01:46:50,304
Nothing is going to
stand in my way.

1525
01:46:56,053 --> 01:46:58,053
Least of all you.

1526
01:47:08,032 --> 01:47:11,263
Impressive.
You've upgraded your armor.

1527
01:47:11,869 --> 01:47:14,759
I've made some
upgrades of my own.

1528
01:47:22,947 --> 01:47:24,882
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.

1529
01:47:24,982 --> 01:47:26,650
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1530
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:29,020
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1531
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,247
I know the math. Do it.

1532
01:47:39,563 --> 01:47:41,048
Sir, you're not going
to believe this.

1533
01:47:41,148 --> 01:47:41,866
That thing is back.

1534
01:47:41,966 --> 01:47:45,196
Get me Major Allen.
Scramble the jets.

1535
01:47:47,304 --> 01:47:50,274
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1536
01:47:50,374 --> 01:47:52,374
Yes, sir.

1537
01:47:59,583 --> 01:48:02,813
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb.

1538
01:48:05,523 --> 01:48:08,073
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going.

1539
01:48:14,298 --> 01:48:16,400
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen.

1540
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,500
Stop telling me.

1541
01:48:27,778 --> 01:48:30,334
You had a great
idea, Tony, but my...

1542
01:48:30,434 --> 01:48:32,850
suit is more advanced
in every way.

1543
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:34,985
How'd you solve
the icing problem?

1544
01:48:35,085 --> 01:48:37,085
Icing problem?

1545
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:41,121
Might want to look into it.

1546
01:48:52,836 --> 01:48:54,836
Two percent.

1547
01:48:56,273 --> 01:49:00,013
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1548
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:11,788
- Potts.

1549
01:49:11,888 --> 01:49:14,249
Tony. Oh, my God,
are you okay?

1550
01:49:14,349 --> 01:49:16,456
I'm almost out of power.
I've got to get...

1551
01:49:16,556 --> 01:49:18,462
out of this thing.
I'll be right there.

1552
01:49:18,562 --> 01:49:20,562
Nice try.

1553
01:49:32,543 --> 01:49:33,993
- Weapons status?

1554
01:49:34,093 --> 01:49:37,218
Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.

1555
01:49:40,918 --> 01:49:42,918
Flares.

1556
01:49:50,995 --> 01:49:53,020
Very clever, Tony.

1557
01:49:58,369 --> 01:50:00,837
- Potts?
- Tony.

1558
01:50:00,938 --> 01:50:01,906
This isn't working.

1559
01:50:02,006 --> 01:50:03,143
We're going to have
to overload...

1560
01:50:03,243 --> 01:50:04,275
the reactor and
blast the roof.

1561
01:50:04,375 --> 01:50:06,124
- Well, how are you
going to do that?

1562
01:50:06,224 --> 01:50:07,244
You're going to do it.

1563
01:50:07,344 --> 01:50:09,780
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1564
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,282
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1565
01:50:11,382 --> 01:50:13,951
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1566
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:17,196
It's going to fry
everything up here.

1567
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:19,885
Okay. I'm going in now.

1568
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:23,425
Make sure you wait
till I clear the roof.

1569
01:50:23,525 --> 01:50:25,525
I'll buy you some time.

1570
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,770
This looks important.

1571
01:50:55,459 --> 01:50:58,229
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

1572
01:50:58,329 --> 01:51:02,425
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit.

1573
01:51:10,708 --> 01:51:13,598
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.

1574
01:51:15,579 --> 01:51:18,469
You'd have made
your father proud.

1575
01:51:22,686 --> 01:51:25,661
It's ready, Tony.
Get off the roof.

1576
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:46,708
Tony.

1577
01:51:47,244 --> 01:51:49,244
How ironic, Tony.

1578
01:51:50,681 --> 01:51:53,344
Trying to rid the
world of weapons,

1579
01:51:53,444 --> 01:51:55,719
you gave it its best one ever.

1580
01:51:55,819 --> 01:51:56,893
- Pepper.

1581
01:51:56,993 --> 01:52:01,689
And now I'm going to
kill you with it.

1582
01:52:04,762 --> 01:52:07,078
- You ripped out my
targeting system.

1583
01:52:07,178 --> 01:52:08,599
Time to hit the button.

1584
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:10,505
- You told me not to.

1585
01:52:10,605 --> 01:52:13,119
Hold still, you little prick.

1586
01:52:14,738 --> 01:52:17,263
- Just do it.
- You'll die.

1587
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:22,411
Push it.

1588
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:21,470
Tony.

1589
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,780
You've all received
the official...

1590
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,782
statement of what occurred...

1591
01:53:31,882 --> 01:53:34,468
at Stark Industries
last night.

1592
01:53:34,568 --> 01:53:36,677
There have been
unconfirmed reports...

1593
01:53:36,777 --> 01:53:39,056
that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned...

1594
01:53:39,156 --> 01:53:42,301
and caused damage
to the arc reactor.

1595
01:53:42,493 --> 01:53:43,256
Fortunately, a member...

1596
01:53:43,356 --> 01:53:44,728
of Tony Stark's personal
security staff...

1597
01:53:44,828 --> 01:53:45,838
'Iron Man.' That's
kind of catchy.

1598
01:53:45,938 --> 01:53:46,730
It's got a nice ring to it.

1599
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:48,727
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1600
01:53:48,827 --> 01:53:50,467
The suit's a
gold-titanium alloy,

1601
01:53:50,567 --> 01:53:53,203
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1602
01:53:53,303 --> 01:53:55,303
Here's your alibi.

1603
01:53:55,806 --> 01:53:56,874
Okay.

1604
01:53:56,974 --> 01:53:59,109
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1605
01:53:59,209 --> 01:54:00,497
We have port papers
that put you...

1606
01:54:00,597 --> 01:54:01,311
in Avalon all night,

1607
01:54:01,411 --> 01:54:03,113
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1608
01:54:03,213 --> 01:54:04,847
See, I was thinking
maybe we should...

1609
01:54:04,947 --> 01:54:06,316
say it was just
Pepper and me...

1610
01:54:06,416 --> 01:54:08,416
alone on the island.

1611
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:10,788
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1612
01:54:10,888 --> 01:54:13,268
Just read it, word for word.

1613
01:54:14,925 --> 01:54:16,927
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1614
01:54:17,027 --> 01:54:20,342
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1615
01:54:20,697 --> 01:54:23,133
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1616
01:54:23,233 --> 01:54:24,783
But what about the
whole cover story...

1617
01:54:24,883 --> 01:54:25,736
that it's a bodyguard?

1618
01:54:25,836 --> 01:54:27,010
He's my... I mean, is that...

1619
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,705
That's kind of flimsy,
don't you think?

1620
01:54:28,805 --> 01:54:31,108
This isn't my first
rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1621
01:54:31,208 --> 01:54:33,117
Just stick to the
official statement,

1622
01:54:33,217 --> 01:54:35,179
and soon, this will
all be behind you.

1623
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:37,509
You've got 90 seconds.

1624
01:54:40,417 --> 01:54:42,417
Agent Coulson?

1625
01:54:42,753 --> 01:54:45,707
I just wanted to say
thank you very much...

1626
01:54:45,807 --> 01:54:47,224
for all of your help.

1627
01:54:47,324 --> 01:54:50,427
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1628
01:54:50,527 --> 01:54:52,500
- From the Strategic
Homeland...

1629
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,131
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1630
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:56,231
Right.

1631
01:54:56,366 --> 01:54:58,170
- Let's get this
show on the road.

1632
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:00,237
You know, it's
actually not that bad.

1633
01:55:00,337 --> 01:55:02,639
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1634
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:04,274
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1635
01:55:04,374 --> 01:55:06,810
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1636
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:08,822
You know, if I were
Iron Man, I'd have...

1637
01:55:08,922 --> 01:55:10,881
this girlfriend who
knew my true identity.

1638
01:55:10,981 --> 01:55:12,266
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always...

1639
01:55:12,366 --> 01:55:13,517
be worrying that I
was going to die,

1640
01:55:13,617 --> 01:55:15,986
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1641
01:55:16,086 --> 01:55:18,331
She'd be wildly conflicted,

1642
01:55:18,431 --> 01:55:21,236
which would only
make her more...

1643
01:55:21,525 --> 01:55:22,559
crazy about me.

1644
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:24,328
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1645
01:55:24,428 --> 01:55:26,468
- What night?
- You know.

1646
01:55:29,232 --> 01:55:32,361
Are you talking about
the night that...

1647
01:55:32,461 --> 01:55:35,351
we danced and went
up on the roof,

1648
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:42,203
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1649
01:55:42,312 --> 01:55:45,543
and you left me
there, by myself?

1650
01:55:46,783 --> 01:55:50,098
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1651
01:55:51,488 --> 01:55:53,488
Thought so.

1652
01:55:55,292 --> 01:55:56,994
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

1653
01:55:57,094 --> 01:55:59,029
Yes, that will be
all, Miss Potts.

1654
01:55:59,129 --> 01:56:02,633
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1655
01:56:02,733 --> 01:56:05,543
He will not be taking
any questions.

1656
01:56:05,643 --> 01:56:07,643
Thank you.

1657
01:56:09,973 --> 01:56:13,373
Been a while since I
was in front of you.

1658
01:56:13,427 --> 01:56:16,997
I figure I'll stick to
the cards this time.

1659
01:56:17,047 --> 01:56:18,495
There's been speculation
that I was...

1660
01:56:18,595 --> 01:56:20,083
involved in the events
that occurred...

1661
01:56:20,183 --> 01:56:21,451
on the freeway
and the rooftop...

1662
01:56:21,551 --> 01:56:22,848
I'm sorry, Mr.
Stark, but do you...

1663
01:56:22,948 --> 01:56:24,321
honestly expect us
to believe that...

1664
01:56:24,421 --> 01:56:25,804
that was a bodyguard...

1665
01:56:25,904 --> 01:56:28,158
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

1666
01:56:28,258 --> 01:56:31,361
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1667
01:56:31,461 --> 01:56:33,373
It is one thing to
question the official...

1668
01:56:33,473 --> 01:56:35,065
story, and another
thing entirely...

1669
01:56:35,165 --> 01:56:36,487
to make wild accusations,

1670
01:56:36,587 --> 01:56:38,402
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.

1671
01:56:38,502 --> 01:56:40,103
I never said you
were a superhero.

1672
01:56:40,203 --> 01:56:43,486
Didn't? Well, good,
because that would...

1673
01:56:43,586 --> 01:56:45,966
be outlandish and fantastic.

1674
01:56:47,544 --> 01:56:50,775
I'm just not the
hero type. Clearly.

1675
01:56:51,348 --> 01:56:54,284
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1676
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:55,819
all the mistakes I've made,

1677
01:56:55,919 --> 01:56:57,102
- largely public.

1678
01:56:57,202 --> 01:56:59,256
Just stick to the cards, man.

1679
01:56:59,356 --> 01:57:01,356
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1680
01:57:03,126 --> 01:57:05,126
The truth is

1681
01:57:10,834 --> 01:57:12,834
I am Iron Man.

1682
02:05:15,552 --> 02:05:16,786
Jarvis.

1683
02:05:16,886 --> 02:05:18,886
Welcome home, sir.

1684
02:05:22,058 --> 02:05:25,033
'I am Iron Man.'
You think you're...

1685
02:05:25,033 --> 02:05:27,753
the only superhero
in the world?

1686
02:05:27,897 --> 02:05:31,134
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1687
02:05:31,234 --> 02:05:33,529
You just don't know it yet.

1688
02:05:33,536 --> 02:05:35,536
Who the hell are you?

1689
02:05:35,538 --> 02:05:38,513
Nick Fury, Director
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1690
02:05:40,343 --> 02:05:44,763
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

1691
