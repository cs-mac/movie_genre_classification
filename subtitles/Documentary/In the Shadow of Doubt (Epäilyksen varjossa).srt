Last year when
President Kennedy was assassinated,

34

who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?

35
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,328
Despair?

36
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,422
Which way? What now?

37
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,398
What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?

38
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,744
It was a time of people sitting together,

39
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:16,110
bound together
by a common feeling of hopelessness.

40
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,251
But think of that.

41
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,589
Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.

42
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,492
It was a public experience.
It was awful,

43
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,927
but we were in it together.

44
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:42,766
How much worse is it then
for the lone man, the lone woman,

45
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,645
stricken by a private calamity?

46
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:53,782
'No one knows I'm sick.' 'No one
knows I've lost my last real friend.'

47
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,889
'No one knows
I've done something wrong.'

48
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360

51

I wanna tell you a story.

55
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,846
A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,

56
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,945
and only this one sailor survived.

57
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,089
He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail,

58
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,697
and being of a nautical discipline...

59
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,634
...turned his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.

60
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:46,472
He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.

61
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,707
WILLIAM: Just keeps going on.

62
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,807
Clouds rolled in,

63
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:56,640
and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.

64
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:03,539
He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.

65
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,261
And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,

66
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,293
he began to have doubts.

67
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,270
He just keeps on going.
- Had he set his course right?

68
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,828
Was he still going on towards his home?

69
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,845
Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?

70
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,848
No way to know.

71
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,683
The message of the constellations,

72
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,547
had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?

73
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,528
Or had he seen truth once...
- Straighten up.

74
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,726
...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?

and sustaining as certainty.

475
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,931
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

476
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,836
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

477
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,997
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.

478
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,510
Father, would you care for a...

479
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:19,383
Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

480
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,153
Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.

481
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,554
And yourself, of course.

482
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,855
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?

483
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,691
No, I've already had my cup.

484
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,249
Is there sugar?
- Sugar?

485
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:38,926
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

486
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,909
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.

487
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,977
It mustn't have been much to give up, then.

ALO YSIUS: I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

491
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:59,249
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.

492
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,959
I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.

493
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,367
The sugar?
- Yes. One?

494
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,467
Three.

Three?

Two. Three.

Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.

498
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:25,100
Not that there's anything wrong with sugar.

499
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,686
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

500
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,454
We are at our wit's end.

501
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:34,692
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,

502
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,895
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

503
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,866
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

Thank you, Sister James.

So what do you think, Father?

507
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,409
(CLEARS THROAT)
Is there something new we could do?

508
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,978
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

509
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:58,073
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

510
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,117
Secular?
- Yes.

511
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,320
It's Beginning To Look A Lot
Like Christmas. Something like that.

512
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,990
What would be the point of a secular song?

513
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,292
Just fun.

514
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,494
Or Frosty the Snowman.
- FLYNN: That's a good one.

515
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:15,599
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.

516
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,699
Which boy?

517
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,606
We'd do tryouts.

518
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,234
Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan belief in magic.

519
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,348
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.

520
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,950
If the music were more somber,

521
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,189
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.

522
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,659
I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman like that.

523
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,927
It should be banned from the airwaves.

524
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,322
So, not Frosty the Snowman.

525
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:51,268
Oh, It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas would be fine, I suppose.

526
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,368
Parents would like it.

527
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:59,543
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?

528
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,010
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

529
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:07,384
Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.

530
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,986
How fortunate.

531
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,455
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.

532
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,990
Oh.

533
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,090
What is the idea?

534
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,927
Intolerance.

535
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,703
Would you like a little more tea, Father?

536
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,803
Not yet.

537
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,979
It's a new time, Sister.

538
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,245
What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.

539
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:37,320
There is nothing new under the sun.

540
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,379
The Church needs to change.

541
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,090
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

542
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,892
take the kids out for ice cream.

543
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,193
Sweet tooth.

544
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,263
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

545
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,363
The point being?

546
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,372
We should be friendlier.

547

You know, the children and the parents...

548
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,273
...should see us as members of their family.

549
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:07,106
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.

00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:12,181
Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.

I don't think we're so different.

552

You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

trust us to be different.

All right, what about Donald Miller?

00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,610
We must be careful, in the pageant,

569
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,300
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

570

- That's right, yeah.

Why?
- Oh, come, Father.

I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

573
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:36,662
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.

574
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,730
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?

Yes.

a little odd, yes.

...(STUDENTS CHATTERING)

634
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:22,074
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

635
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,854
You should've let it alone.

636
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,630
Not possible.

637
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,165
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

638
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:46,806
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

639
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:53,924
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.

640
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,361
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.

641
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:01,265
What a relief. That explains everything.
Thanks be to God.

642
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,340
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

643
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,774
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

644
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,084
Talk to him, by all means.

645
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,278
But now that the boy's secret's out,

646
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,113
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.

647
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,681
That's what I was trying to avoid.

648
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,216
JAMES: You were trying to protect the boy.

649
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,316
That's right.

650
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,854
I might have done the same thing.

651
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,556
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?

652
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:30,694
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.

653
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,794
Of course.

654
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,631
Are you satisfied?

655
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes.

656
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,138
Hmm.

657
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:47,216
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

658

ALO YSIUS: Intolerance.
- That's right.

659
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,652
I'm not pleased with how you handled this.

660
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,919
Sister. Sister.

661
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,530
Well...

662
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,993
What a relief. He cleared it all up.

663
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,605
You believe him?

664
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,443
Of course.

665
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,149
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

666
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,518
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

667
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,487
Mmm-hmm.

668
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,587
Yes.

669
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,195
These types of people are clever.

670
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,732
Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.

671
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:48,805
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

672
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,008
I want no further part of this.

674
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,476
I'll bring him down.

675
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,379
How can you be so sure that he is lying?

676
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,786
Experience.

677
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,849
You just don't like him.

678
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,963
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.

679
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,566
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

680
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,835
You don't like it
that he likes Frosty the Snowman,

681
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:25,008
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

682
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,828
Well, I like Frosty the Snowman.

683
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,647
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,

684
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,050
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history...

685
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,252
...and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.

686
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,355
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,

687
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,455
then so be it.

00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,660

were decided by who shouted loudest.

Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.

693

You honestly find the students
in this school...

694
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,927
...to be treated like inmates in a prison?

No.

Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.

Yes. That's how it works.

That night she had a dream.

709
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:34,056
A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.

710
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:40,510
She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt.

711
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,180
The next day she went to confession.

712
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,190
She got the old parish priest,
Father O'Rourke.

713
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,882
She told him the whole thing.

714
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,916
'Is gossiping a sin?'
she asked the old man.

715
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,229
'Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?

'Yes.' Father O'Rourke answered her.

'Yes, you ignorant,

720

'You have borne false witness

'and you should be heartily ashamed.'

So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.

00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,593
'Not so fast,' says O'Rourke.

took a pillow off her bed,

a knife from the drawer,

729
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,551
went up the fire escape to her roof
and stabbed the pillow.

730
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,088
Then she went back
to the old parish priest as instructed.

731
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:02,249
'Did you gut the pillow with a knife?'
he says.

'Yes, Father.' 'And what was the result?'

00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,930
'Feathers,' he repeated.

He's in trouble.

in a human way to these kids...

I am concerned, to be frank,

950
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:28,363
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.

951
01:11:32,017 --> 01:11:34,017
May have made?

952
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,155
I can't be certain.

953
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:38,255
No evidence?
- No.

954
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:41,996
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

955
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:52,006
I think there is something to it.

956
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:55,107
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.

957
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,207
Why would he do that?

958
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,443
(SIGHS)...

959
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:03,676
Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.

960
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:06,218
Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.

961
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:09,054
All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.

962
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:11,424
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

963
01:12:11,524 --> 01:12:13,459
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,

964
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:16,279
but I don't want to get into it.

965
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:18,295
What's that?

966
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:22,768
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

967
01:12:22,868 --> 01:12:25,704
but if we're talking about
something floating around...

968
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:28,207
...between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.

969
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:30,876
I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.

970
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,211
I know.
- Twelve years old.

971
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,913
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...

972
01:12:34,013 --> 01:12:36,048
I know. I agree with you completely.
...not the boy.

973
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,416
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called...

974
01:12:37,516 --> 01:12:38,651
...to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.

975
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:42,152
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

976
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,425
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

977
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:47,893
Yes, I do.

978
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,396
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys...

979
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:52,565
...if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.

980
01:12:52,665 --> 01:12:55,640
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

981
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,305
So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.

982
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,406
No problem my son getting blamed,

983
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,408
and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.

984
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,610
I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against...

985
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,045
...no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

986
01:13:06,145 --> 01:13:10,055
And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.

987
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:13,717
What?

988
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:17,087
It's just till June.

989
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:21,793
Do you know what you're saying?

990
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:24,941
Know more about it than you.

991
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:30,066
I believe this man is creating,

992
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:32,304
or may have already brought about,

993
01:13:32,404 --> 01:13:34,840
an improper relationship with your son.

994
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,742
I don't know.

995
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:38,310
I know I am right.

996
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:43,516
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?

997
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,996
What kind of mother are you?

998
01:13:49,622 --> 01:13:52,625
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.

999
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:53,792
I know enough.

1000
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:55,794
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

1001
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:57,763
I know what I won't accept.

1002
01:13:57,863 --> 01:13:59,965
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.

1003
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,166
This man is in my school.

1004
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:02,368
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and...

1005
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:04,136
...maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys.

1006
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:08,316
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught.

1007
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,220
That's why his father beat him.

1008
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:27,624
Not the wine.

1009
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:37,441
What are you telling me?

1010
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:45,089
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

1011
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:47,978
not anything he's done.

1012
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:55,052
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

1013
01:14:56,488 --> 01:14:59,558
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

1014
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,560
But then there's the boy's nature.

1015
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,400
Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.

1016
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:09,938
You're the one forcing people to say things.

1017
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:14,039
My boy came to your school...

1018
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:18,559
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.

1019
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:22,555
His father don't like him.

1020
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:26,703
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

1021
01:15:26,852 --> 01:15:29,912
One man is good to him, this priest.

1022
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:33,619
Then does a man have his reasons, yes.

1023
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:37,471
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

1024
01:15:38,697 --> 01:15:42,437
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

1025
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:45,802
No.

1026
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:50,741
I don't care why.

1027
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:58,712
My son needs some man
to care about him...

1028
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:03,555
...and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

1029
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:05,557
And thank God this educated man...

1030
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:08,627
...with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

1031
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:11,430
This will not do.
- It's just till June.

1032
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,565
I'll throw your son out of this school.

1033
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:15,834
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

1034
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:18,232
Because I will stop this.

1035
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,139
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

1036
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,142
It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.

1037
01:16:23,242 --> 01:16:28,342
I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?

1038
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:37,053
Nothing.

1039
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:39,890
(SIGHING)

1040
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:42,692
As it turns out.

1041
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:46,947
(CRYING) Please leave my son out of this.

1042
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:58,963
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.

1043
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:09,653
I will try.

1044
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,097
I'm late.

1045
01:17:23,168 --> 01:17:25,168
Sister,

1046
01:17:27,306 --> 01:17:30,961
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

1047
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,848
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.

1048
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:39,603
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

1049
01:18:58,497 --> 01:19:00,497
May I come in?

1050
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:02,434
A third party would be required.

1051
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:06,019
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?

1052
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,674
We were having a chat.
- About what?

1053
01:19:08,774 --> 01:19:10,275
A third party
would truly be required, Father.

1054
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,144
No, Sister. No third party.

1055
01:19:12,244 --> 01:19:14,906
Me and you are due for a talk.

1056
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:17,516
You have to stop this campaign against me.

1057
01:19:17,616 --> 01:19:20,517
You can stop it at any time.
- How?

1058
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:21,787
Confess and resign.

1059
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,189
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation.

1060
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:27,520
Who keeps opening my window?

1061
01:19:29,094 --> 01:19:30,963
What are you doing in this school?

1062
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:33,063
I'm trying to do good.

1063
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:35,525
Even more to the point,

1064
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:38,604
what are you doing in the priesthood?

1065
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:43,108
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

1066
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,143
From what?
- Progressive education...

1067
01:19:45,243 --> 01:19:46,445
...and a welcoming church.

1068
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:48,680
You can't distract me, Father.

1069
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,282
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.

1070
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:52,384
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

1071
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:55,721
That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.

1072
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:57,821
I will decide...

1073
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,759
...what's important.

1074
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:06,109
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

1075
01:20:07,165 --> 01:20:10,903
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.

1076
01:20:11,003 --> 01:20:13,972
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

1077
01:20:14,072 --> 01:20:16,475
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

1078
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:18,744
He doesn't know how he came to drink it.

1079
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:21,079
Did his mother
have something to add to that?

1080
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:23,179
No.

1081
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:26,911
So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.

1082
01:20:27,019 --> 01:20:29,019
Ask the boy then.

1083
01:20:29,354 --> 01:20:32,090
He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?

1084
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:36,092
Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.

1085
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:38,697
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child...

1086
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:41,867
...after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.

1087
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,201
That's right.

1088
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,870
But this has nothing to do with the wine.

1089
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:48,173
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

1090
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:52,077
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

1091
01:20:52,177 --> 01:20:53,445
That's true.

1092
01:20:53,545 --> 01:20:55,925
So you admit it.
- Certainly.

1093
01:20:57,382 --> 01:20:59,382
Why?

1094
01:21:00,852 --> 01:21:02,852
I know people.

1095
01:21:03,855 --> 01:21:05,357
That's not good enough.

1096
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:08,262
It won't have to be.
- How's that?

1097
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:11,420
You will tell me what you have done.

1098
01:21:12,597 --> 01:21:14,597
Oh, I will.

1099
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:18,401
Out again.

1100
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:22,274
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

1101
01:21:22,374 --> 01:21:24,924
So you talked to Sister James.

1102
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:27,980
Well, of course you talked to Sister James.

1103
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,148
Did you know Donald's father beats him?

1104
01:21:30,248 --> 01:21:31,550
Yes.

1105
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:34,653
And might that not account
for the odd behaviour

1106
01:21:34,753 --> 01:21:37,517
Sister James noticed in the boy?

1107
01:21:37,722 --> 01:21:39,224
It might.

1108
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:41,324
Then what is it? What?

1109
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,296
(STAMMERING) What did you hear?

1110

What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?

1111
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:51,334
What does it matter?

1112
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:56,370
It matters. What does it matter?
I want to know.

Out this window,

1114
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:15,082
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

1115
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:19,061
and I saw him pull away.

1116
01:22:34,846 --> 01:22:36,939
Are you serious?
- I am.

- I'm writing down what you say.

It might be important when I have
to explain why you have to be removed.

1122
01:23:04,476 --> 01:23:08,013
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,

1123
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:12,117
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

1124
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:14,217
What did he say?

1125
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:16,786
Who?
- The pastor.

1126
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:22,652
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

1127
01:23:23,195 --> 01:23:26,340
You should have spoken to the pastor.

1128
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:28,300
I spoke to a nun.

1129
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,869
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

1130
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,872
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.

1131
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,875
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?

1132
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,978
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past.

1133
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:41,913
You have a history.

1134
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:44,716
This is your third parish in five years.

1135
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,284
Why?
- Call the pastor.

1136
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:49,054
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

1137
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,957
I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.

1138
01:23:52,057 --> 01:23:55,127
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.

1139
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:57,729
What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.

1140
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:01,266
Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have.

1141
01:24:01,366 --> 01:24:03,735
You haven't the slightest proof of anything.

1142
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,504
But I have my certainty.

1143
01:24:05,604 --> 01:24:07,739
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish...

1144
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:10,842
...and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

1145
01:24:10,942 --> 01:24:13,577
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1146
01:24:14,412 --> 01:24:17,557
You have no right to act on your own.

1147
01:24:18,216 --> 01:24:22,380
You have taken vows,
obedience being one.

1148
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,322
You answer to us.

1149
01:24:24,422 --> 01:24:27,459
You have no right
to step outside the church.

1150
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:31,129
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

1151
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:32,998
though the door should shut behind me.

1152
01:24:33,098 --> 01:24:38,028
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell.

1153
01:24:38,236 --> 01:24:42,605
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

1154
01:24:45,744 --> 01:24:49,569
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1155
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:53,190

And?

1159
01:25:12,304 --> 01:25:15,967
I confessed it, Father.

1160
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,953
Then whatever I have done,

1161
01:25:21,513 --> 01:25:25,593
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.

- Anyone but yourself?

1263
01:35:25,716 --> 01:35:27,285
Nope.

1264
01:35:27,385 --> 01:35:29,910
But you were sure?
- Yes.

1265
01:35:34,425 --> 01:35:36,720
I wish I could be like you.

1266
01:35:38,729 --> 01:35:40,729
Why?

1267
01:35:41,465 --> 01:35:44,015
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1268
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:51,202
Maybe we're not supposed to sleep so well.

1269
01:35:53,978 --> 01:35:57,803
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

1270
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,676
Who?
- The bishop.

1271
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:11,145
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.

1272
01:36:12,096 --> 01:36:14,096
It's a promotion.

1273
01:36:15,232 --> 01:36:16,868
You didn't tell them?

1274
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:22,663
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

1275
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:28,148
He did not believe it to be true.

1276
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:34,411
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1277
01:36:34,518 --> 01:36:37,493
What did you say to make him leave?

1278
01:36:37,755 --> 01:36:41,665
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

1279
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:47,335
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.

1280
01:36:52,336 --> 01:36:54,336
So you did prove it?

1281
01:36:58,676 --> 01:37:00,676
I made no such call.

1282
01:37:04,682 --> 01:37:07,583
You lied?
- Yes.

1283
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:14,071
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

1284
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:20,136
His resignation was his confession.

1285
01:37:24,835 --> 01:37:27,300
He was what I thought he was.

1286
01:37:30,207 --> 01:37:32,207
And he's gone.

1287
01:37:36,647 --> 01:37:38,772
I can't believe you lied.

1288
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:47,020
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1289
01:37:47,858 --> 01:37:50,349
one steps away from God.

1290
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:56,411
Of course, there is a price.

1291
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,842
I see.

1292
01:38:14,985 --> 01:38:16,487
Oh.

1293
01:38:16,587 --> 01:38:18,587
Sister James.

1294
01:38:19,523 --> 01:38:21,523
What is it, Sister?

1295
01:38:27,531 --> 01:38:29,531
I have doubts.

1296
01:38:34,105 --> 01:38:36,105
(SIGHING)

1297
01:38:36,107 --> 01:38:40,441
I have such doubts.

1298
01:38:41,879 --> 01:38:44,769
(ORGAN PLAYING THE FIRS T NOEL)...

1299
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:35,660
...(SIN GIN G) Come, thou,
redeemer of the Earth

1300
01:39:36,033 --> 01:39:42,768
And manifest thy virgin birth

1301
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:49,741
Let every age adoring fall

1302
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:56,909
Such birth befits the God of all

1303
01:39:58,389 --> 01:40:05,124
Begotten of no human will

1304
01:40:05,529 --> 01:40:12,059
But of the Spirit, thou art still

1305
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:19,533
The word of God in flesh arrayed

1306
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:26,848
The promised fruit to man displayed

1307
01:40:28,886 --> 01:40:35,621
The virgin womb that burden gained

1308
01:40:35,859 --> 01:40:42,423
With virgin honor all unstained

1309
01:40:43,067 --> 01:40:49,700
The banners there of virtue glow

1310
01:40:50,241 --> 01:40:57,044
God in his temple dwells below

1311
01:40:59,717 --> 01:41:06,452
Forth from his chamber goeth he

1312
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:13,695
That royal home of purity

1313
01:41:14,131 --> 01:41:21,094
A giant in twofold substance one

1314
01:41:21,572 --> 01:41:28,501
Rejoicing now his course to run

1315
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:37,644
From God the Father he proceeds

1316
01:41:37,988 --> 01:41:44,951
To God the Father back he speeds

1317
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:52,492
His course he runs to death and hell

1318
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:59,833
Returning on God's throne to dwell

1319
01:42:02,313 --> 01:42:09,219
O equal to thy Father, thou

1320
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:16,123
Gird on thy fleshly mantle now

1321
01:42:16,593 --> 01:42:23,522
The weakness of our mortal state

1322
01:42:24,068 --> 01:42:31,031
With deathless might invigorate

1323
01:42:33,677 --> 01:42:40,515
Thy cradle here shall glitter bright

1324
01:42:40,918 --> 01:42:47,847
And darkness breathe a newer light

1325
01:42:48,192 --> 01:42:55,155
Where endless faith shall shine serene

1326
01:42:55,399 --> 01:43:02,328
And twilight never intervene

1327
01:43:04,641 --> 01:43:11,604
All praise, eternal Son, to thee

1328
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:19,022
Whose advent sets thy people free

1329
01:43:19,123 --> 01:43:25,961
Whom, with the Father, we adore

1330
01:43:26,597 --> 01:43:33,435
And Holy Ghost for evermore

1331
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:42,902
Amen
