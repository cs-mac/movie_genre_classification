1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,700
You can't ask a devout people
to disregard a precious teaching.
Yes, but Your Holin ess...

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,800
with true respect,
we can't possibly--

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm sorry, but we can't
possibly rescue all the worms...

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
not if you want a theater
finished in this lifetime.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,700
You have a clever mind.
Think of a solution.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,700
And in the meantime, you can
explaln to me what is an elevator.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,100
Antarctica.
That's down below.

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Here.

9
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Fantastic.

10
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,500
Englan d.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,900
Don't look at me for h elp.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,100
Here?

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Shift.

14
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, I know him.
Honk. Hello!

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,900
Turn !

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,600
Brake!

17
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,200
The robe of a minister is so much finer
than your old brown robe, i sn't it?

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
Please.

19
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,100
Everyone, please.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,400
You must be very clever
to get such a good promotion.

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,200
I did not intend to be
a secretary forever.
Apparently so.

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,900
Well , congratulations.

23
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,700
Evil omen !

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,800
From his headquarters
in Peking...

25
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,900
the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung,
was triumphantly proclaimed leader...

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,700
of the new
People 's Republic of China.

27
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Chairman Mao vowed that the first task
of the Communist regime...

28
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
is to reunite
the Chinese motherland.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,700
He declared that
the remote kingdom of Tibet...

30
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,800
Is an lntegral part
of the Chinese territory...

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
and must join
the great new republic.

32
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,100
"...and must join
the great n ew republic."

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,600
People's Republic of China
is advised...

34
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
the government of Tibet
recognizes no foreign sovereign.

35
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,100
We are an independent nation.

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,400
All the Chinese officials will be
expelled from the borders of Tibet.

37
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,500
We wish you a happy return
to your h omeland.

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,300
Have a safe and pleasant journey
back to China.

39
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,200
May you have a safe and
pleasant journey back to China.

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,400
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,100
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

42
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,600
Let me see.

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,700
You have a very long lifeline,
unlike others here.

44
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,100
When we are faclng the light,
it's day, yes?

45
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,700
When we are in shadow,
it's night.

46
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,500
So if the sun is just rising
in Lhasa...

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,100
that means it is just setting...

48
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,500
in New York City, perhaps.

49
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,900
That's why it can't be the same time
in every place.

50
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,600
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,300
Tell me more.

52
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
What else do you want to know?

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In a few moments, you wIll be
entering the world of mass media.

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
I can hear news
from all over the planet?

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't know if they have live
broadcasts from the Tonga lslands...

56
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,700
but generally speaking, yeah.

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Do you listen to news
from your country?

58
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,400
From Austri a?
No, not really.

59
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,100
Give me some light, Ku-Dun.
- Why? It's your home.
- Not anymore It isn't.

60
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
But don't you have
friends and family there?
A few friends, no family.

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Keep the light steady,
Your Holiness.

62
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,200
Why? ls everyone dead?

63
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,100
Do you know there's another sentence
construction aside from the question?

64
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
I was married,
but I'm divorced.

65
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,300
What did you do?

66
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,600
I didn't want a child,
so I ran away to climb a mountain.

67
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,900
You h ave a child?

68
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,100
Although I've never seen hlm.

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,000
All right. Let me show you
how this thing works.

70
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,100
- Glve it all you've got.
- Yes, Mr. Harrer.

71
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
Happy Christmas.

72
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,400
Thank you.

73
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,200
- What is this special occasion?
- This is Chrlstmas.

74
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,400
And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.

75
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
"I found it in a shop
in the Barkhor.

76
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,200
It has traveled a long way
and finally come back home.

77
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,600
Thank you for your friendshlp.
Heinrich. "

78
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,500
It is incredible.

79
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Thank you for saving my life.

80
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,700
...must be liberated
from religlous oppressors.
Tibetans must be reunited...

81
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,500
- with their brothers and sisters...
- Turn that off.

82
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
- of the great family of new China.
- I'm very sorry.

83
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,700
Foreigners control
Tibet's corrupt government.

84
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,000
Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated
from foreign imperialists.

85
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,900
Tibet 's million serfs
must be freed.

86
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How many foreigners
are there in Tibet?

87
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,500
You, Heinrich.

88
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Tibet will be liberated.

89
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,800
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.

90
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,400
They were destroying the village
I was born in, Takster in Amdo.

91
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,600
It was terrible.

92
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,100
It was just a dream.
You had a bad dream. That's all.

93
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,900
But it was so real.
Where did it come from?

94
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,100
My mind could never imagine
such terrible things.

95
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,900
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid the dream will come back.

96
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
A couple of insomniacs.

97
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,400
Tell me a story.

98
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,300
Tell me a story
about cllmbing mountains.

99
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,400
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.

100
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,100
Then tell me
what you love about it.
What--

101
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,900
The absolute simplicity.
That's what I love.

102
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,500
When you're climbing,
your mind is clear...

103
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,700
freed of all confusions.

104
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
You have focus.

105
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,500
And suddenly
the light becomes sharper...

106
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,100
sounds are rlcher...

107
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
and you are filled with...

108
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,200
the deep, powerful presence of life.

109
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,700
I've only felt that way
one other time.

110
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
When?

111
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
In your presence, Ku-Dun.

112
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,200
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

113
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,500
They have ransacked a village,
destroyed the monasteries...

114
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,300
burnt scriptures
and defaced holy relics.

115
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,200
We've been told they've
even killed some monks--

116
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,400
- Which vill age?
- Takster in Amdo.

117
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,400
It's where His Holiness was born.

118
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,300
Go ahead.

119
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,400
When you were defense minister
to the previous Dalai Lama...

120
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,800
then you wanted to
reorganlze the army.
Can you do it now?

121
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,200
The People's Liberation Army
is one million troops strong.

122
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,700
We have 8,000 men
with 50 pieces of artillery...

123
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,700
and a few hundred mortars
and machine guns.
The task is hopeless.

124
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Then you refuse
the appointment, do you?

125
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,200
No. I accept it with honor.

126
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
You two gentlemen know about wars.

127
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,700
What type of weapon
do you recommend?

128
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,300
It seems the Chinese troops are
advancing toward our northern borders.

129
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,700
Where's His Holiness?

130
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
The glory of
a British coronation.

131
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Nowhere in the world
is there anything half so wonderful.

132
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,900
Only once or twice in the life of each
one of us comes such a day as this...

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,600
when we know that we are watchlng
history in the making...

134
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,300
when we know that generations to come
will look back on this day...

135
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,300
for May 12, 1937, wIll be
one of the dates in hlstory...

136
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,900
that schoolchildren will learn about
maybe a thousand years from now.

137
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Every moment
the thrill of excitement--

138
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,900
Do you thlnk someday people will
look at Tibet on the movie screen...

139
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,600
and wonder what happened to us?
The coronation coach moves forward.

140
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know.

141
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Don't you have all the answers?

142
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
I don't.

143
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
On the same field where Tibetans
traditionally gathered for picnics...

144
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,500
ground was cleared
to build an alrstrip...

145
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,000
so that the plane carrying
three Chinese generals could land.

146
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,400
Nearby, the Tibetan army
practiced its maneuvers.

147
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,100
Some of the soldiers
wear ancient mesh armour.

148
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,500
They bring old muskets
and spears as artillery.

149
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,900
The spectacle of a peace-lovlng nation,
vainly attempting to create a mllitary.

150
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,000
The fears of war
on my friends ' faces...

151
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,500
strike a deeply burled
personal chord.

152
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,200
Echoes of the aggressions
of my own country...

153
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,100
the will to overpower
weaker peoples...

154
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
bring shame to me.

155
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,500
I shudder to recall how once long ago
I embraced the same beliefs...

156
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,600
how at one time I was, in fact...
no different from
these intolerant Chinese.

157
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,700
The Tibetans say an enemy
is the greatest teacher...

158
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,700
because only an enemy can help
develop patience and compassion.

159
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,600
They believe with rock-llke faith
that the power of their religion...

160
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,500
will protect them
against these Chinese.

161
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
In preparation for
the generals ' visit...

162
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
sacred ceremonies are performed
throughout Lhasa.

163
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Sculptures of deities have been carved
with great care in butter.

164
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,500
As the sun melts them, they become
a reminder that nothlng lasts.

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,000
The rising star of the cabinet,
Minister Ngawang Jigme...

166
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,400
made an offering of his own
to greet the Chinese generals...
and lead them through Lhasa.

167
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,300
Raising their flag is an honor
the Chinese don't deserve.

168
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,700
When you are not strong enough to fight,
you should embrace your enemy.

169
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,900
With both arms around you,
he cannot point a gun at you.

170
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,300
Nothing in politics
is a matter of honor, my friend.

171
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,400
History repeats itself,
even in paradise.

172
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,200
General, we shall have
our audience with His--

173
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,800
General, the monks have been making
this mandala of sand for many days.

174
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
It is a symbol of
enlightenment and peace.
General !

175
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,100
We do not sit lower than he does.

176
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,500
But, General,
It is our custom.

177
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,600
I can sit down there.

178
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,500
Your Holiness,
this is General Chang Jing Wu...

179
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,700
General Than Gua,
General Than Gua San.

180
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,600
They wish to have
an audience with you.

181
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,100
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

182
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,100
They are promising regional autonomy
and religious freedom...

183
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,900
if Tibet accepts that China
be its political master.

184
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,500
Until I attain my majority, the
regent ls the political leader of Tibet.

185
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,900
You should have requested
an audlence with him...

186
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,200
to discuss these important matters
of the world.

187
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,900
My experience of such things
is limited.

188
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,900
I am a simple Buddhist monk.

189
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
All I know is the scripture
and the words of Lord Buddha.

190
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
He sald, "All beings tremble
before danger and death.

191
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Life is dear to all.

192
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,200
When a man considers this,
he does not kill or cause to kill."

193
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,500
You must understand.
These words are ingrained
in the heart of every Tibetan.

194
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,700
It ls why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.

195
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,600
I pray you will see this is
our greatest strength...

196
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,800
not our weakness.

197
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,200
I thank you for your vislt.

198
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,000
An offering
to the Enlightened Ones.

199
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,200
Rellgion is poison.

200
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,500
The Chinese have attacked
the Tlbetan frontier near Den-Go.

201
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops
of the 1st and 2nd Field Armles...

202
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,500
under the overall command
of General Chang Jing Wu...

203
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,100
attacked the Tibetan frontier
near Den-Go.

204
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,000
The Tibetan army believes
an attack on Chamdo is imminent.

205
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Ngawang Jigme,
our newly appointed governor...

206
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,200
is preparing to send troops
toward the Chinese column...

207
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,900
In order to stop
their progresslon. "

208
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,700
As you know, Chamdo
is the gateway to Tibet.

209
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,500
If Chamdo falls.

210
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
If I did not know that, I would not
have been appointed governor.

211
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,000
You do realize our troops are committed
to fighting the Chinese to the last man.

212
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,700
They would rather die than surrender.

213
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,300
Rest assured. there will be no surrender

214
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,300
Radio Lh asa.

215
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Now.

216
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,200
We request permission
to surrender.

217
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,700
- But there will be no surrender--
- I said, "Radio Lh asa."
Permission to surrender now.

218
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,900
We lost the war in 11 days,
Heinrich.

219
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,500
This surrender is
our death sentence.

220
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,000
And I'm afraid our friend
Ngawang Jigme has issued it.

221
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,300
He abandoned Chamdo and then
destroyed the ammunition dumps.

222
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Without weapons and ammunition...

223
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,100
there was no hope for
the troops who wanted to fight.

224
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Our guerrillas could have held
the mountain passes for months...

225
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,700
even years.

226
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,500
It would have bought us time to make
appeals for help to other nations.

227
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Now it's lost.

228
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,000
They broke down the gates.

229
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Hello, my friend.

230
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,000
We did what was the best
for our country...

231
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,900
for Tibet.

232
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,200
On the way to Lhasa, I would see
Tibetans wearing these jackets.

233
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
"Chinese soldiers.
Very nice.

234
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,800
Glve food, clothes, money.
Very nice."

235
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,300
It's strange to me that something
so harmless as a jacket...

236
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,100
could symbolize
such a great lie.

237
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,100
After all these years, you still
do not understand Tibetan ways.

238
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,700
To return a gift is unforgivable.

239
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,700
A man who betrays his culture
should not preach about its customs.

240
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,300
There was a time
I would have wished you dead...

241
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,500
but your shame
will be your torture.

242
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,800
And your torture
will be your life.

243
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,100
I wish it to be long.

244
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,100
We pray that His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama...

245
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,000
will be granted the power
to unify his people.

246
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,800
We humbly ask the Tibetan government
to honor our request...

247
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,800
and let the Dalai Lama
attain his political majority.

248
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,000
You have the entire palace
in a panlc.

249
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm hiding from the world
for a day.

250
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,100
Kind of difficult
in a glasshouse, no?

251
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
It's The Moonlight...

252
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
by Debussy.

253
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,700
What else do you know
about this song?

254
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Him, him and him.

255
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I hope you've received your invitation
to the enthronement ceremony.
Yes. Thank you.

256
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,300
- It's next week.
- Th ank you.

257
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Do I look like an egghead?

258
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,600
No, they suit you.

259
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,200
We have a saying in Tibet...

260
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,600
"If the problem can be solved,
there is no use worrying about it.

261
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,400
If it can't be solved.

262
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,300
So stop worrying.

263
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,800
You have to leave Tibet.
Your life's at great risk.

264
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,900
Forgive my presumption, but I made
arrangements to get you out safely.

265
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,500
We should leave after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it--

266
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,600
How can I help people if I run away from
them? What kind of leader would I be?

267
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I have to stay here.

268
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Serving others
is my path to liberation .

269
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,300
- Then I don't go either.
- Why not?

270
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,400
Because you are my path
to liberation.

271
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,400
The Buddha sald. "Salvation

272
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,000
It demands strenuous effort
and practice.

273
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,600
So work hard and seek
your own salvation diligently."

274
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,300
I am not your son...

275
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,500
and I never thought of you
as my father.

276
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
You were much too informal
with me for that.

277
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,600
Do you ever think about him?

278
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,400
And wh at do you think about?

279
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,900
It's not the conscious thought
really.

280
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
It's just always there.

281
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,500
When I crossed Tibet,
he was with me.

282
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,800
When I came to Lhasa.

283
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,200
When I sit beside you,
he's...

284
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,900
there with me.

285
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,100
I can't even imagine how I pictured
the world without him in it.

286
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Then you should go home
and be his father.

287
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
I know.

288
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,000
You have finished
your job with me.

289
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,900
But you have to stay
for my enthronement.

290
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,400
I want you to see me
in all my pomp and glory.

291
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,700
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.

292
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,000
From the government of Tibet...

293
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,400
to Your Holin ess,
the fourteenth Dalai Lama...
we ask you to rule your people...

294
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,900
as the spiritual and
temporal leader of Tibet.

295
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,600
By your prayers and wishes,
I humbly accept.

296
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,700
Butter tea.
It was never my cup of tea.

297
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,900
- One was enough.
- Yes, we must follow the custom.

298
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,600
A fresh cup of tea is poured
for the loved one departing.

299
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
It sits untouched,
walting for hls return.

300
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,100
May all travelers find happiness
wherever they go.

301
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Without any effort may they accomplish
whatever they set out to do.

302
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,400
And having safely
returned to the shore...

303
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,000
may they be joyfully reunited
with their relatives.

304
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,700
Mr. Harrer...

305
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,100
from His Holiness.

306
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,300
- Hello, Horst.
- Hello, Heinrich.

307
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,900
Rolf, come out to meet him.

308
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
No, I don't want to.

309
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,700
May l?

310
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,100
