00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,914
You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all

3
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:25,855
You started messing with 
My head until I hit a wall

4
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:29,820
Maybe I should've known
Maybe I should've known

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,730
That you would walk
You would walk out the door,hey!

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,733
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,730
Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,789
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known

9
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,095
That I would talk, I would talk

10
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:52,326
But even if the stars and moon collide

11
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:56,256
I never want you back into my life

12
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,251
You can take your words and all your lies

13
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:04,019
Oh oh oh I really don't care

14
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:08,156

Oh oh oh I really don't care

19
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,294
I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you

20
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:35,287
You don't deserve to know the way
I used to think about you

21
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:39,327
Oh no not anymore, oh no not anymore

22
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:43,254
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go

23
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:47,194
Now if we meet out on the street
I won't be running scared

24
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:51,159
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air

25
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,294
And make you understand
And make you understand

26
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,503
You had your chance, had your chance

27
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:01,755
But even if the stars and moon collide

28

30
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:13,659
Oh oh oh I really don't care

31
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,491
Even if the stars and moon collide

32
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,521
I never want you back into my life

33

Oh oh oh I really don't care

36
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,113
Yeah, listen up

37
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:42,425
Hey, hey, never look back

38
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,563
Dumb struck boy, ego intact

39
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,460
Look boy, why you so mad

40
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,569
Second guessin
But should've hit that

41
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,355
Hey Demi
You picked the wrong lover

42
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,389
Should've picked that one
He's cuter than the other

43
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,457
I just wanna laugh
Cause you're tryna be a hipster

44
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,256
Kick it to the curb,
Take a Polaroid picture

45
00:02:57,256 --> 00:03:01,210
But even if the stars and moon collide

46
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,157
I never want you back into my life

47
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:09,192
You can take your words and all your lies

48
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:13,222
Oh oh oh I really don't care

49
