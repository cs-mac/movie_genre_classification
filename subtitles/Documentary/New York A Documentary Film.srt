1
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,709
Hey, Rod, do they have
nude beaches in Florida?

2
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,420
Where are my magazines?
I'm sure I left them here somewhere.

3
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,172
Leslie!

4
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,551
Leslie, what'd you do
with my gol-darn golf balls?

5
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,302
Fifteen and a half sun block.

6
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,929
Father, could I get
a string bikini in Florida?

7
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,806
Make sure you pack your beach towel.

8
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,184
Nobody can order pizza in this house.
Where are my golf balls?

9
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,646
You know why? 'Cause I'm the only guy...
Check in your pockets.

10
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,940
All right, has anybody seen my sun block?

11
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,318
What's the point of going to Florida
if you're gonna put on sun block?

12
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,363
I don't care if I age like an old suitcase.
I'm getting toasted.

13
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,284
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a slightly darker shade of skin.

14
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,454
He's just jealous 'cause he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,792
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids, pal.
The rubber sheets are packed.

16
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,046
Vicky says she wants to go with "Ding."
Behind "Ding" is 200 points.

17
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,215
All right. Good for you.

18
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,012
Two hundred points. All right.

19
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,184
Honey, are you packed yet?
Yes.

20
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,061
Yes.

21
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,025
Everything I put out for you?
Yes.

22
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,611
Yes.

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,739
Did you see what Grandma Penelope
sent you for the trip?

24
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,408
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,954
Close. An inflatable clown
to play with in the pool.

26
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,415
How exciting.

27
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,878
Why do we have to go to Florida?
There's no Christmas trees in Florida.

28
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,047
Kevin, what is it with you
and Christmas trees?

29
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,050
How could you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree, Mom?

30
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,095
We'll find a nice, fake silver one
or decorate a palm tree.

31
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,973
Goodbye, everybody.

32
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,684
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

33
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,562
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

34
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,232
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,819
For reservations, call
toll-free 1-800-759...

36
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,489
Honey, do you know where the batteries
for this camcorder are?

37
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,908
Yeah, I put it in the charger.

38
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,922
How's this?
Much better.

39
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,092
Hey, Kevin, you better go put your tie on.

40
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,052
We don't want to be late
for the Christmas pageant.

41
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,304
My tie's in the bathroom.
I can't go in there,

42
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,348
'cause Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,934
He says if I walked in there
and saw him naked,

44
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,937
I'd grow up never feeling like a real man.

45
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,439
Whatever that means.

46
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,484
I'm sure he was kidding.

47
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:42,447
Just run in there and get your tie,
get out, and don't look at anything.

48
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,453
Well, this cat they're talking about

49
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,290
I wonder who could it be.

50
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,293
'Cause they know I'm the heaviest cat.

51
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,713
The heaviest cat you ever did see.

52
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,632
When they see me
walking down the street.

53
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,427
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey.

54
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,554
On their faces they wear a silly smirk.

55
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:11,143
'Cause they know I'm the king
of the cool jerk.

56
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,899
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or I'm gonna slap you silly!

57
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,404
You're cooking, Frankie!

58
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,832
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree.

59
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,669
Lit up like a star.

60
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,089
When I see my Christmas tree.

61
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,968
Can loved ones be far?

62
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,388
Christmas tree, I'm certain.

63
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,933
Wherever I roam...

64
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,770
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Leslie.

65
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,439
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Frank.

66
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,525
Okay. Frank... Frank!

67
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,409
Christmastime means laughter.

68
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,205
Toboggans in the snow.

69
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,208
Caroling to children.

70
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,293
With faces aglow.

71
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,673
Stockings on the mantel.

72
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,177
A wreath on the door.

73
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,722
And my merriest Christmas.

74
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,848
Stop it!

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,684
Needs just one thing more

76
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,063
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree.

77
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,190
Lit up like...

78
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,831
Kevin!

79
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,049
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

80
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,099
I'd like to apologize to my family

81
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,393
for whatever displeasure
I might have caused you.

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,602
What?

83
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,355
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

84
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,693
Immature or not,
it was pretty gol-darn hilarious.

85
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,364
I'd also like to apologize to my brother.

86
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,617
Kevin, I'm sorry.

87
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,497
Buzz, that was very nice.

88
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,006
Kevin, do you have something to say?

89
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,942
Beat that, you little trout sniffer.

90
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,783
I'm not sorry!
I did what I did 'cause Buzz humiliated me.

91
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,495
And since he gets away with everything,
I let him have it.

92
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,997
And since you're all so stupid
to believe his lies,

93
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,042
I don't care if your idiotic Florida trip
gets wrecked or not.

94
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:26,004
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate anyway?

95
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,172
Kevin!

96
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,799
Kevin, you walk out of here,
you sleep on the third floor.

97
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,345
Yeah, with me.
So what else is new?

98
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,931
You'd better not wreck my trip,
you little sourpuss.

99
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,016
Your dad's paying good money for it.

100
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,436
I wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

101
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,443
What a troubled young man.

102
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,242
They're all a bunch of jerks.

103
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,744
Hi.

104
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,873
You know, Kevin,
last time we all tried to take a trip

105
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,751
we had a problem
that started just like this.

106
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,003
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

107
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,713
I don't care for your choice of words.

108
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,508
That's not what happened last time,
that's not what's happening this time.

109
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,718
Buzz apologized to you.

110
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,429
Yeah, then he called me a trout sniffer.

111
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,641
He didn't mean what he said.
He was just sucking up to you.

112
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,687
Okay. Why don't you just sit up here
for a while and think things over?

113
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,491
When you're ready to apologize
to Buzz and to the rest of the family,

114
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,607
you can come down.

115
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat.

116
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,114
Then you can stay up here
the rest of the night.

117
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,410
Fine. I don't wanna be down there anyway.
I can't trust anybody in this family.

118
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,704
And do you know what?
If I had my own money,

119
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,749
I'd go on my own vacation,
alone, without any of you guys.

120
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,627
And I'd have the most fun in my whole life.

121
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,755
Well, you got your wish last year.
Maybe you'll get it again this year.

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,424
I hope so.

123
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,725
We did it again!
We did it again!

124
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,821
Okay, our McCallisters in the first van,
the other McCallisters in the second van.

125
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,323
I know I shouldn't complain
about a free trip,

126
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,825
but, jeez, you guys give
the worst gol-darn wake-up calls.

127
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,619
Frank, do you have the tickets?
I've got them.

128
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,020
Here's your family's.
I've got my family's.

129
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,247
How many do you have?

130
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,499
Seven.
Seven.

131
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,417
Fourteen.
Fourteen.

132
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:17,175
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

133
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,426
How come none of us are sitting together?

134
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,512
At this time of the year,
we're lucky to get on the same plane.

135
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,598
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

136
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,477
Where's Kevin?

137
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,729
Fourteen.

138
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,693
It's a good thing I have my own ticket,
just in case you guys try to ditch me.

139
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,579
Come on, Kevin.
Dad, I need batteries.

140
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,207
I got some batteries in my bag.
I'll give them to you on the plane.

141
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,418
Here's two more.
Why can't I get them now? I can get them.

142
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,922
Not now, Kevin. What's the gate number?
H17, sir.

143
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,132
Here you go.
Thank you.

144
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,300
Hey, you better hurry up.
It's the last gate.

145
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,552
All the way down.
Wow.

146
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,471
Dad, what gate is it?
H17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

147
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,600
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
You take my bag? Come on. Come on.

148
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,960
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

149
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:39,674
American Airlines flight 226 to New York
is now in the final boarding process.

150
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,346
Come on, come on.

151
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:55,641
Dad, wait up!

152
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,109
Wait up!

153
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,361
Wait!

154
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,865
Look out! Look out!
Come on, come on, come on!

155
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,830
Dad, wait!

156
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,921
Here we are. Here.

157
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,303
We made it all.
Everybody here? We made it? All right.

158
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,597
Please, ma'am, you have to board.
The plane is ready to leave.

159
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,265
Let me just make sure everyone gets on.
Come on.

160
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,851
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll get everybody on the flight.

161
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,176
Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.
Merry Christmas.

162
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,897
Bye.
Bye-bye.

163
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,945
Hey, wait up! Hey, guys, wait for me!

164
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,615
Cutting it kind of close.
Yeah, sorry.

165
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,867
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

166
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,452
Dad, wait up!

167
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,663
Wait!

168
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,290
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,794
That's all right. Are you on this flight?
Yeah, so is my family.

170
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,338
They're already on the plane,
and I don't want to be left behind.

171
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,007
Do you have a boarding pass?
It's somewhere.

172
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,551
We have to close up here.
They're ready to go.

173
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,178
He dropped his boarding pass.
This plane can't leave.

174
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,931
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

175
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,695
Are you sure your family's on this flight?

176
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,311
Yeah. My dad ran in here
right before I bumped into this lady.

177
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,482
Okay, board him, but make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

178
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,192
Okay. Come on.

179
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,906
Do you see your family?

180
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,702
There's my dad over there.
Okay. Well, go find an empty seat.

181
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,911
Have a merry Christmas.
You, too.

182
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,581
Ladies and gentlemen, in order
for the captain to push back from the gate,

183
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,665
we need all passengers to be seated
with their seat belts securely fastened.

184
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,823
So, have you ever been to Florida?

185
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:38,186
Welcome aboard American Airlines
flight 176 nonstop to New York...

186
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,908
Boy, I didn't think
we were going to make it.

187
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,412
Something wrong? Honey?

188
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,165
I have that feeling.

189
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,793
We forgot something?

190
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,756
No, I don't think we did, but I...
I just have that feeling.

191
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,466
Bad memories, that's all.

192
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,553
We did everything, we brought everything,
we have everybody.

193
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,598
There's nothing to worry about.

194
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,270
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.

195
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,148
Nothing to worry about.

196
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,003
Mom?

197
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,839
Dad?

198
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,425
Uncle Frank?

199
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,386
Buzz?

200
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,856
We're the last ones off the plane.
Okay, thanks.

201
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,403
Where are those guys?

202
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,744
Whose is this?
That's Brooke's.

203
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,329
This is Megan's. Brooke.
Give this to Brooke.

204
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,292
This to Kevin. Give this to Kevin.
Give this... Give this to Kevin.

205
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,377
Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.

206
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,879
Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.

207
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,508
Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.

208
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,553
Give this to Kevin.
Here you go, Kevin.

209
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:50,311
Kevin's not here.
Kevin's not here.

210
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,993
What?

211
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,040
Kevin!

212
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,029
Excuse me, but this is an emergency.

213
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,075
Yes, sir?
What city is that over there?

214
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,289
That's New York, sir.
Yikes, I did it again.

215
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,380
Something wrong, sir?

216
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,551
I'll be fine.

217
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:10,064
Oh, no.
My family's in Florida and I'm in New York.

218
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,235
My family's in Florida.

219
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,197
I'm in New York.

220
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,067
Thanks! Bye!

221
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,061
Wow.

222
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,555
What's the child's name?

223
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,433
Kevin. K-E-V-l-N.
Kevin.

224
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,853
When did you see him last?
Curbside check-in?

225
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,732
No, I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

226
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,653
Most people get separated
at security checkpoints.

227
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,781
Did everyone get through security?
I don't know. Peter?

228
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,702
We were in a hurry. We were in a hurry.
We had to run all the way to the gate.

229
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,413
When did you notice he was missing?

230
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,083
When we picked up our baggage here.

231
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,627
Has the boy ever run away from home?

232
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,129
No.
No.

233
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,091
Has he ever been in a situation
where he's been on his own?

234
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,432
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

235
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,644
It's becoming sort of
a McCallister family travel tradition.

236
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,897
Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage.

237
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,912
He was left at home by accident last year.

238
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,248
Yeah, that's what my wife meant

239
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,419
when she said it's becoming
a McCallister family travel tradition.

240
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,300
We'll call Chicago
and notify them of the situation.

241
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,346
The odds are that's where he is.
Thanks.

242
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,390
It's very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

243
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,783
Watch out, kid!

244
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,297
Yo, where's your manifest?

245
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,306
Here we are, Marv.
New York City, the land of opportunity.

246
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,811
Smell that?
Yeah.

247
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,521
You know what that is?
Fish.

248
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,733
It's freedom.
No, it's fish.

249
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,738
It's freedom, and it's money.
Okay, okay. It's freedom.

250
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,574
Come on, let's get out of here
before somebody sees us.

251
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,326
And it's fish.

252
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,421
Yup, one quick score. We get ourselves
a couple of phony passports

253
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,924
and we hightail it to some foreign country.

254
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,509
Arizona?

255
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:59,270
That's very smart, Marv. You bust out of
jail to rob 14 cents from a Santa Claus?

256
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:03,441
Every little bit helps.
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

257
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,193
We're the Sticky Bandits.

258
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,864
Real cute. Very cute.

259
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:30,843
"The Plaza Hotel, New York's
most exciting hotel experience."

260
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,399
Sick.

261
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:46,293
What's the matter?
Thought I saw something.

262
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,895
Serves you right. Come on, let's go!

263
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,064
I think she likes me.

264
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,853
Excuse me. Where's the lobby?

265
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,897
Down the hall and to the left.
Thanks.

266
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,912
Wow!

267
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,007
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

268
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,843
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

269
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,512
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

270
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:26,602
For reservations,
call toll-free 1-800-759-3000.

271
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,855
I'll do just that.

272
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,817
Howdy-do.
This is Peter McCallister, the father.

273
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:38,489
I'd like a hotel room, please,
with an extra-large bed, a TV,

274
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,117
and one of those little refrigerators
you have to open with a key.

275
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,952
Credit card? You got it.

276
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,250
Plaza Hotel reservations. May I help you?

277
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,502
Howdy-do.

278
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,922
This is Peter McCallister, the father.
Yes, sir.

279
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,216
I'd like a hotel room, please...
Yes.

280
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,429
With an extra-large bed, a TV,
and one of those little refrigerators

281
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,765
you have to open with a key.

282
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,049
Yes, sir, you'll need
a major credit card upon check-in.

283
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,770
Credit card? You got it.

284
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,940
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

285
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,446
Yes, two at 8:00, Henri, Mr. Yamamoto.

286
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,199
Hold on a second.

287
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,288
I'll call you back, Henri.

288
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,000
Hi.

289
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,842
Can I help you?
Reservation for McCallister?

290
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,054
A reservation for yourself?

291
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,640
Ma'am, my feet are
hardly touching the ground.

292
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,892
I'm barely able to look over this counter.

293
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,562
How could I make a reservation
for a hotel room?

294
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:57,484
Think about it, a kid going into a hotel,
making a reservation? I don't think so.

295
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,946
I'm confused.

296
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,950
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

297
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,911
I hate meetings,
plus I'm not allowed to go in.

298
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,666
I can only sit in the lobby. That's boring.
So my dad dropped me off here.

299
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,045
He gave me his credit card
and said whoever was checking people in

300
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,591
to let me in the hotel room
so I won't get into mischief,

301
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,677
and, ma'am,
sometimes I do get into mischief.

302
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,430
We all do.

303
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,768
Merry Christmas.

304
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,854
No sign of him.

305
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,401
We're gonna have to be able
to get a hold of you.

306
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,567
You have hotel arrangements?
Yeah.

307
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,445
Do you have a recent photo of the boy?

308
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,115
I have one in my wallet.

309
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,202
I don't have my wallet.

310
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,829
My wallet's in my bag.

311
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,998
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport.

312
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,292
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.

313
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,462
Did you have credit cards in the wallet?
Credit cards, money.

314
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,216
We'll notify the credit card companies
immediately. If your son has the cards,

315
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,844
we can get a location on him
when and if he uses them.

316
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,806
No, I don't think Kevin even knows
how to use a credit card.

317
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,352
Wow! It worked.

318
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,816
Cedric.
Yes?

319
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,402
Don't count your tips in public.
I'm sorry.

320
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,074
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

321
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,910
Front, please.

322
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,500
Enjoy your stay with us.

323
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,128
And don't forget to remind your dad
when he arrives

324
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,589
that he has to come down
and sign a couple of things.

325
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,883
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

326
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,010
May I take your bag, sir?

327
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,058
Up here to your left.

328
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,353
You know, Herbert Hoover
once stayed here on this floor.

329
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,773
The vacuum guy?
No, the president.

330
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,906
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

331
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,708
This is great!

332
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,049
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

333
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,809
Luxurious and spacious.

334
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,151
How convenient!

335
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,655
Hey!

336
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,912
Did you want me to put the key in the bag
or did you just want to hang on to it?

337
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,830
I'll hang on to it.

338
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,585
Is everything all right, sir?

339
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,171
Is the temperature in the room okay?
It's okay.

340
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,300
Do you know how the TV works?
I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

341
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,510
Well...

342
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,016
I'm sorry.

343
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,941
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

344
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,361
Thank you.

345
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,975
Would it bother anyone
if I worked on my cannonballs?

346
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,226
No.

347
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,478
Thanks.

348
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,575
Yikes!

349
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,516
This is a vacation.

350
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,978
Hold it right there.

351
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,855
It's me, Johnny.

352
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,234
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.

353
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,531
Two scoops, sir?
Two? Make it three. I'm not driving.

354
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,075
It's gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.

355
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,994
Thank you.

356
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,205
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

357
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,708
I was singin' at the
Blue Monkey last night.

358
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,544
She was not!
She was smooching with your brother.

359
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,214
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

360
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,175
That's a dirty, rotten lie, Johnny.
See?

361
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,386
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

362
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:21,099
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

363
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,771
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff,
I could go on forever, baby.

364
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:30,358
You got me all wrong.
All right. I believe you,

365
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,360
but my Tommy gun don't!

366
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,488
Johnny!

367
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,032
You're the only duck in my pond!

368
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,868
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

369
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,913
Baby! I'm over the moon for you!

370
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,624
You got to do better than that!

371
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,417
If my love was an ocean,

372
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,879
Lindy'd have to take
two airplanes to get across it!

373
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,217
Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.

374
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,220
That's why I'm gonna let you go.

375
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,972
I'm going to give you to the count of three

376
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:07,687
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

377
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,148
She's rat bait.

378
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,399
One,

379
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,819
two,

380
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,912
three!

381
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,540
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

382
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,836
And a happy New Year.

383
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,370
Housekeeping.

384
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:53,786
We know a cat
who can really do the cool jerk.

385
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,633
Well, this cat they talkin' about

386
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,385
I wonder who could it be.

387
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,513
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat.

388
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,183
The heaviest cat you ever did see.

389
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,770
When they see me walkin' down the street.

390
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,648
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey.

391
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,858
On their faces, they wear a silly smirk.

392
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:22,322
'Cause they know I'm the king
of the cool jerk.

393
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,497
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or I'm gonna slap you silly!

394
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,253
You're cooking, Frankie!

395
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,500
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

396
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,311
Hey! Uncle Rob lives here.

397
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,647
If they're back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

398
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,650
They usually give pretty good presents.

399
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,461
Good night, Mom.

400
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,676
Good night, Kevin.

401
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,414
Your drawers, sir.

402
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,458
Jeez! Don't flash these babies
around here!

403
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,504
There could be girls on this floor!
I was very careful, sir.

404
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,257
You can't be too careful
when it involves underwear.

405
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,136
I understand.
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

406
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:36,224
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

407
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,145
No tip? Okay.

408
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,690
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

409
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,110
Excuse me, how do I get
to Columbus Circle?

410
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,321
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi, sir.

411
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,157
Mr. McCallister!

412
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,454
Excuse me.
Sure.

413
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,917
And how are we this morning?

414
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,296
Fine. Is my transportation here?
Out in front, sir.

415
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,259
A limousine and a pizza,
compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

416
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:16,139
I do hope your father understands that
last night I was simply checking the room

417
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,308
to make sure everything was in order.

418
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,852
He was pretty mad.
He was?

419
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,645
He said he didn't come
all the way to New York

420
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,275
to get his naked rear end spied on.
Of course not.

421
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,570
Will he be down soon?
He already left.

422
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,993
I would have liked
to have offered my personal apology.

423
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:41,039
If some guy looked at you in the shower,
would you ever want to see him again?

424
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,665
I suppose not.

425
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,793
I don't think you'll see him
for the rest of our trip.

426
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,420
I understand.

427
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,589
Bye.

428
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,968
Have a lovely day.

429
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,396
McCallister.

430
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,246
Morning, Mr. McCallister.
Good morning.

431
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:32,674
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own cheese pizza.

432
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,574
Hello?
Hello.

433
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,535
Know any good toy stores?
Yes, sir!

434
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,805
Bingo!

435
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,073
Get out of here! Go on, get out!
Get out of here! Go on. Get out of here!

436
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,534
Beat it, beat it, beat it! Get out of here!

437
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,954
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I got to talk to you!

438
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,050
Whoa! Whoa!

439
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,193
Would you like a scarf?
You wanna forget about the scarf, Marv?

440
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,890
We got to talk.

441
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,934
We don't have the equipment
to pull off anything big,

442
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,187
you know, your banks,
your jewelry stores.

443
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,732
We don't want goods.
We need cash, and we need it now.

444
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:18,154
How about hotels?
Tourists carry lots of cash.

445
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,865
There's no guarantees. I got a better idea.

446
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,576
Stores ain't gonna deposit cash
on Christmas Eve.

447
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,995
The only stores that are
gonna have cash on hand

448
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,790
are the ones that deal
in moderate-priced goods.

449
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,291
Right, right.

450
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,170
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve

451
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,964
that nobody's going to think to rob?

452
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,591
Candy stores.

453
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:44,681
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores, Marv.
This is what I had in mind.

454
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,102
That's brilliant, Harry. Brilliant!

455
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,400
Yep. There's nobody dumb enough
to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve.

456
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,151
Yes, there is.

457
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,297
Here we are, sir, Duncan's Toy Chest.

458
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,051
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

459
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,597
This is the greatest accident of my life.

460
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,575
Marv. Marv!

461
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,703
Hey, nice house,
but there's no bathroom in it.

462
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,960
All right, so what's the plan?
Everybody leaves for a nice holiday off.

463
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,588
We come out of our little houses...

464
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,843
Yeah, then what?
We empty the registers

465
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,555
and walk out like we own the joint.
Great plan, Harry!

466
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,432
Shake his hand.

467
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,893
Well, now, thank you
and merry Christmas.

468
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,145
Say hello to the family.

469
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,857
Yes. Let me see.

470
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,986
You shopping alone?

471
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,532
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

472
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,827
Now, I was just checking.
That's very responsible of you.

473
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,579
Well, thank you.
My pleasure.

474
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,042
That'll be $23.75.

475
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,422
My, my, my!
Where did you get all that money?

476
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,552
I have a lot of grandmothers.

477
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,179
Well, that explains it.

478
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,151
This is a really nice
store, one of the finer

479
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,352
toy dealerships I've
ever visited in my life.

480
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,856
Well, thank you.
This Mr. Duncan must be a pretty nice guy

481
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,192
letting all the kids come into his store
and play with all his toys.

482
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,278
Most toy stores prohibit that, you know.

483
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,696
Is that so?
Yep.

484
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,119
Well, he loves kids. As a matter of fact,
all the money the store takes in today,

485
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,123
Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the children's hospital.

486
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:02,670
And the day after Christmas, we empty
out all the money in the cash register

487
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:06,215
and Mr. Duncan just takes it
right down to the hospital.

488
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,636
That's very generous of him.
Well, children bring him a lot of joy.

489
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,390
As they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

490
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:24,066
I'm not supposed to spend this money,
but I have $20 from shoveling snow

491
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,570
in a jar in our garage
where my older brother can't find it.

492
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,739
So I can pay my mother back with that.

493
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,993
So you can give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

494
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:38,998
Besides, I'm probably gonna spend it
on stuff that'll rot my teeth and my mind.

495
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,170
That's very sweet of you.

496
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,882
You see that tree there?

497
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,594
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity,

498
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:56,265
I'm going to let you select an object from
that tree that you can take home with you.

499
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,851
For free?
Yeah.

500
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,021
May I make a suggestion?
Okay.

501
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,357
Take the turtledoves.

502
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,235
I could have two?
Well, two turtledoves.

503
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,990
And I'll tell you what you do.
You keep one,

504
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,869
and you give the other one
to a very special person.

505
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:22,083
You see, turtledoves are a symbol
of friendship and love.

506
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,879
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove,

507
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,757
you'll be friends forever.

508
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:34,011
Wow! I never knew that.
I thought they were just part of a song.

509
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:38,432
They are, and for that very special reason.

510
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,394
Wow! Thanks.

511
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,147
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.

512
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,068
Be sure to bundle up if you go outside.
It's a little nippy.

513
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,278
Thank you, I'll do that.

514
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,942
Well, where to?

515
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,280
Well, you promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

516
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,457
Hey! Look who it is, Marv.

517
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,171
Come on. Let's get him.

518
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,591
Hey!

519
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,053
Hiya, pal.

520
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,573
Come on!

521
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,090
Hey!

522
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,180
Hey! Watch it, man!

523
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,267
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.

524
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,979
Two for $5, two for $5. Four for 10.

525
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,774
All right, kiddo.
There he is!

526
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,692
All right, kiddo!

527
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,319
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

528
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,071
Hey, hey!
Whoa!

529
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,323
Excuse me!

530
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,649
Yes!

531
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,735
Thank you for your suggestion.
My duty, my pleasure.

532
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,154
Bye now.

533
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,168
You got to help me!
There's two guys after me!

534
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,586
What's the matter?

535
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,507
Store wouldn't take
your stolen credit card?

536
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,595
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

537
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,810
Get up! Get up!

538
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,230
Come on! Let's go get him!

539
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,610
Get back here, you little thief!

540
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,114
Stop that child!

541
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,619
Grab him!

542
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,801
You little...

543
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,640
I've committed credit card fraud.

544
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,433
Get me security!

545
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,811
We've got to stop that delinquent!

546
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,439
Come along, Cedric.

547
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,670
I've had enough of this vacation.
I'm going home.

548
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,016
Hold it right there.

549
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,603
This is the concierge, sir.

550
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:39,775
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.

551
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,030
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

552
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,493
Yes, sir, I was.

553
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,831
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

554
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,628
I'm... I'm afraid you're mistaken, sir.

555
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,965
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

556
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:07,636
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

557
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,972
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff...

558
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,269
No!

559
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,980
It's a lie!

560
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,774
I could go on forever, baby.

561
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:25,779
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I'm afraid you're mistaken.

562
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,823
We're looking for a young man.

563
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,617
All right. I believe you,

564
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,619
but my Tommy gun don't!

565
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,749
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

566
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,253
On your knees.

567
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,764
I love you.

568
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,811
You got to do better than that!

569
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,939
I love you!
I love you!

570
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,986
Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.

571
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,489
That's why I'm gonna let you go.

572
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,992
I'm going to give you to the count of three

573
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:18,749
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

574
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,086
One...
Open up the door!

575
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,587
Two,

576
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,852
three!

577
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,064
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

578
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,985
And a happy New Year.

579
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,908
Stay in your rooms! This is an emergency!

580
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,953
There's an insane guest with a gun!

581
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,341
No!

582
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,303
Come to Papa!

583
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,268
Round trip to Miami. What's the matter,
get on the wrong plane, squirt?

584
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,032
Looks like you won't be needing this, kid.

585
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,231
American don't fly
to the promised land, little buddy.

586
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,607
Come on!

587
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,905
We spent nine months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

588
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,490
We were wrong, little buddy.

589
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,951
We're busted out of the clink,
and we're doing fine.

590
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,329
We're gonna be doing even better because
we're not robbing houses anymore.

591
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,998
Now we're robbing toy stores.

592
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,168
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

593
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,170
Five floors of cash.

594
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,422
Then after that, we grab
a couple of phony passports...

595
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,050
Marv! Marv, you want to shut up?
What's the difference?

596
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:57,556
He's not going to talk to anybody
except maybe a fish. Or the undertaker.

597
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,396
Let's just get him to
the subway tunnel. I'll

598
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:02,936
feel a lot better once
we get him on ice.

599
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,148
I've got a gun in my pocket.

600
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:10,777
You open your mouth, and you'll be
spitting gum out through your forehead.

601
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,424
Well, hello.

602
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,347
He did it!
Did what?

603
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,684
Thanks!

604
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,190
Get him, will you!
He went in the park.

605
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,068
What are you doing flirting? Get him.

606
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,687
Over there!

607
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,193
Quit it! Hey!
Creep!

608
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,655
Give me that!
What are you doing?

609
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,240
Hey, Harry.
What?

610
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,700
I got him.
Wait, let me see.

611
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,287
That ain't him. Get down. Put him down.
Put him down. That ain't him.

612
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,414
We should've shot him
when we had the chance.

613
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,833
I hate pulling a job,
knowing that little creep is on the loose.

614
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,586
What can he do? He's a kid.
Kids are helpless.

615
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,046
Not this kid.
Yeah, but this time he doesn't have

616
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,216
a house full of dangerous goodies
to get us with.

617
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:00,345
He's in the Park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the Park.

618
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,599
Yeah. Grown men come in the Park
and don't leave alive.

619
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,850
Yeah.

620
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,686
Good luck, little fella.

621
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:22,326
I want to go home. Mom, where are you?

622
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,232
Turn that down!

623
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,389
Hello?
Kate McCallister, please.

624
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,154
This is she.
Ma'am, we found your son.

625
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,822
Oh, my God!
What?

626
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,114
It's the police. They
know where Kevin is.

627
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:02,532
What?

628
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,493
Where?
He's in New York City.

629
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,703
He's in New York!
New York?

630
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,915
Your husband's credit cards...
What?

631
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,119
Well, I'm sure he was scared.
He's not a troublemaker.

632
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,543
What? What?
Ma'am, the New York police...

633
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,671
Just a second. Please hold.
Yes, I'll hold...

634
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,382
He used your credit card
to check into the Plaza Hotel.

635
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,342
Do they still have him?
Do they have him?

636
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,803
No, the police are still looking for him.
Damn it!

637
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,262
Get to New York
as soon as possible, ma'am.

638
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,431
Yeah, okay, we're on the next flight out.
Thank you.

639
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,974
We're going to New York, move it!

640
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,477
Yes!
Party time!

641
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,201
He ran away from the hotel
when they questioned him about the card.

642
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,023
He must be so scared, Peter!

643
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,109
I wonder if he'd know enough
to go to my brother's place?

644
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,903
Aren't they in Paris?
Maybe they have a house sitter.

645
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,780
I thought you said they were renovating?

646
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:28,660
Hello? Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!
Anybody home?

647
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,914
Hello! Anybody home?

648
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,001
It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

649
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,338
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

650
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,801
Watch it, kid!

651
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:36,061
Hey, you looking for somebody
to read you a bedtime story?

652
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,276
Taxi!

653
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,750
Boy, it's scary out there.

654
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,420
Ain't much better in here, kid.

655
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,492
I don't want to ever take a vacation
like this again.

656
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,524
Where did all you guys come from?

657
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,568
I don't know if I have
enough for everybody.

658
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,778
How hungry are you guys?

659
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,699
You guys ate all my food.

660
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:17,013
Look, I'm sorry I screamed in your face.
You were just trying to help me, right?

661
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,394
I'm Kevin McCallister.

662
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,230
Your birds are real nice.

663
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:29,776
I've seen you before.
You had pigeons all over you.

664
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,322
At first, you look kind of scary,
but when I think about it, it's not so bad.

665
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,951
They must be all over you
'cause they like you.

666
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:42,414
If I'm bothering you, I can leave.
Am I bothering you?

667
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,458
No.

668
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,087
Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?

669
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,298
No.

670
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:01,391
Will those pigeons come back
on their own or do you have to call them?

671
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,361
Give me your hand.

672
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,658
They can hear it.

673
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,635
This is great!

674
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,849
It's pretty cold out.

675
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:48,063
I could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you? My treat.

676
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,487
I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

677
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,739
Can we go someplace warm?

678
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,158
Yes. I know a place.

679
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,499
Nice music.

680
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,336
This place is great.

681
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,631
I've heard the world's
great music from here.

682
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:03,721
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.
Frank Sinatra. Luciano Pavarotti.

683
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,730
So, do you bring your friends up here?

684
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,860
I haven't got many friends.
Sorry.

685
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,822
I'm like the birds I care for.

686
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,827
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

687
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,538
They prefer I wasn't part of their city.

688
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:31,459
Yeah. It's sort of like
that with my family.

689
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,751
I'm kind of the
pigeon of the house

690
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,129
just because I'm the youngest.

691
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,590
Everyone fights for position.

692
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,426
Everybody wants to be seen and heard.

693
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:45,388
I guess so.
I'm seen and heard pretty much.

694
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,433
But then I get sent to my room a lot, too.

695
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,062
I wasn't always like this, you know.

696
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,315
What were you like before?

697
01:09:56,275 --> 01:10:00,278
I had a job. I had a home. I had a family.

698
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:06,409
Did you have any kids?
No. Oh, I wanted them.

699
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,872
But the man I loved
fell out of love with me.

700
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,750
That broke my heart.

701
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:19,047
And whenever the chance to be loved
came along again, I ran away from it.

702
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,508
I stopped trusting people.

703
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:26,888
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

704
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:30,225
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

705
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,936
You see, sometimes
you can trust a person,

706
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,564
and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

707
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,567
Maybe they're just too busy.

708
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:43,571
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

709
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:47,659
I don't think people mean to forget.
I think it just happens.

710
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:52,538
My grandfather says if my head wasn't
screwed on, I'd leave it on the school bus.

711
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:56,626
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone,
I'll get my heart broken again.

712
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,211
I understand that.

713
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,755
I used to have this
really nice pair of rollerblades.

714
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:05,093
I was afraid if I wore them, I'd
wreck them. So I kept them in a box.

715
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,886
Do you know what happened?
No.

716
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,181
I outgrew them.
I never wore them once outside.

717
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,434
I just wore them in my room
a couple times.

718
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:18,189
A person's heart and a person's feelings
are very different than skates.

719
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,400
Well, they're kind of the same thing.

720
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:24,112
If you aren't going to use your heart, then
what's the difference if it gets broken?

721
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,865
If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my rollerblades.

722
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,452
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

723
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,872
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

724
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,042
A bit of truth in there somewhere.

725
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,797
I think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

726
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,800
If it was gone, you wouldn't be this nice.

727
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,428
Thank you.

728
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:55,351
Do you know that it's been a couple
of years since I've talked to anybody?

729
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,187
That's okay. You're really good at it.

730
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:01,232
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit when you talk.

731
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,276
You should do it more often.

732
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,989
I think you just have to wear an outfit
that doesn't have pigeon poop on it.

733
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:13,453
I have been working very hard
at keeping people away, haven't I?

734
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,247
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone,

735
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,167
but when I'm alone,
it isn't that much fun at all.

736
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,961
I don't care how much
people bug me sometimes,

737
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:25,465
I'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.

738
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:29,010
So what are you doing running around the
streets on Christmas Eve on your own?

739
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,220
Did you get into trouble?

740
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,140
Yeah.
You've done something wrong?

741
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:37,143
A lot of things.

742
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:42,065
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

743
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,068
It's getting pretty late.
I don't know if I'll have enough time

744
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:48,321
to do all the good deeds I need
to erase all the bad ones I did.

745
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:51,866
Well, it's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count for extra tonight.

746
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,702
They do?
Of course they do.

747
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,538
So what you must do now is you must
think of the most important thing

748
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,875
that you can do for others
and go and do it.

749
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,045
Just follow the star in your own heart.

750
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,839
Okay.

751
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,469
It's getting pretty late.
I'd better get going.

752
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,312
If I don't see you again,
I hope everything turns out okay.

753
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,439
Thank you.

754
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,609
Say goodbye to your birds for me.
I will.

755
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,995
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

756
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,416
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

757
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,419
I won't forget to remember you.

758
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,130
Don't make promises you can't keep.

759
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,940
All the money in the cash registers,

760
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:52,153
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.

761
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:55,865
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

762
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:00,620
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

763
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:25,473
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite while you're here.

764
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:29,143
It's a penthouse with a view of the Park.
I think you'll find it satisfactory.

765
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:33,147
It was recently vacated
by the Countess of Worcestershire.

766
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:36,275
What kind of hotel allows
a child to check in alone?

767
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,819
The boy had a very convincing story.

768
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,781
What kind of idiots
do you have working here?

769
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,824
The finest in New York.

770
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,423
Well, I mean, when you discovered
that the credit card was stolen...

771
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,330
I made the discovery.

772
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,832
Why did you let him leave?

773
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:55,378
We attempted to confront him, he ran.
You scared him away.

774
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,381
It's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost

775
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:01,342
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

776
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,222
Now could you take our family
and our luggage up to the room, please.

777
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:09,350
Yes, sir!
Run along, Cedric.

778
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,060
I'm going to go down to
the police station and make sure

779
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,853
that they're doing everything
in their power to find Kevin.

780
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,689
I want you to stay here
with Frank, Leslie and the kids.

781
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,233
No, I'm going out to look for him.
What?

782
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,944
With all due respect, madam,
your son is lost

783
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,863
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

784
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,282
Could you stay out of this please?

785
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,451
As you wish.
Thank you.

786
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,787
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to start running around

787
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,671
all over New York
City all by yourself.

788
01:18:31,683 --> 01:18:33,624
I think if our son can
do it, I can do it.

789
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,949
Kate...
Peter, I'll be fine.

790
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,463
The way I'm feeling right now, no mugger
or murderer would dare mess with me.

791
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,759
Madam, there are hundreds of parasites
out there armed to the teeth!

792
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,639
Do bundle up. It's awfully cold outside.

793
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:25,593
Marv. Marv. Come on, let's go.

794
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:49,408
Marv. Crowbars up!

795
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,042
Merry Christmas, Harry!

796
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,423
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

797
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,977
Oh, this is more money
than I can even count!

798
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:21,273
It makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing private homes.

799
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,998
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law,

800
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,753
we're up to our elbows in cash and
there's nobody that even knows about it.

801
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,300
He's back!

802
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,721
He took our picture!
How did my hair look?

803
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:01,605
This is it. No turning back.

804
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,109
Another Christmas in the trenches.

805
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,320
No!

806
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:14,994
Wow.

807
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:19,456
That's it! Get the money! Get the money!
I'll kill him! That little...

808
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:30,843
I'm coming, Harry!
Marv!

809
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,894
Harry?

810
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,524
Harry! That was incredible.

811
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:52,031
I twisted my ankle on that board there.
Where is he?

812
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:54,325
Hey, guys! Smile!

813
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,787
Come on! Come on!

814
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,707
Help me.
I got you. I got you.

815
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:30,903
Taxi!

816
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,369
Times Square.

817
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,892
Where'd he go?

818
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,728
I'm up here! Come and get me!

819
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,858
Let's kill!
Hold on, pea-brain.

820
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,277
We got busted last time
because we underestimated

821
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,946
that little bundle of misery.

822
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,573
This ain't like the last time.
This ain't his house.

823
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,702
The kid's running scared.
He ain't got a plan.

824
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,705
May I do the thinking, please?

825
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,916
Thank you.

826
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:30,504
Sonny!
Yes?

827
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:34,717
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

828
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:39,888
Knocking off a youngster ain't going
to mean all that much to me. Understand?

829
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:43,684
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

830
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:48,397
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

831
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:52,401
You'll never hear from us again. Okay?

832
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:57,948
You promise?
I cross my heart and hope to die.

833
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,576
Okay!

834
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,459
Okay, kid, give it to me.

835
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:18,969
Direct hit!

836
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:27,311
How many fingers am I holding up, Marv?

837
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,647
Eight?

838
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,571
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

839
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,239
Don't do that!

840
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:47,539
If you can't do any better than that, kid,
you're going to lose.

841
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:51,168
Harry, no.

842
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,927
You got any more?

843
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,314
Come on, Marv. Get up. He don't have
any more bricks. He's out of them.

844
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:19,696
What?

845
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:25,369
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it.

846
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:29,456
Come on, Marv. Get up.
You go this way. I'm going round the back.

847
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:41,009
Harry?

848
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:09,866
Harry! I've reached the top!

849
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:05,797
You gotta do better than this, kid.

850
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,783
Wow! What a hole.

851
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,473
Whoa!

852
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,866
Harry.

853
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,472
I'm coming up!

854
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,614
I'm going to murder that kid!

855
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:41,925
Yes!

856
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,100
Whoa.

857
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:01,069
Whoa, whoa!

858
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:12,872
Hey!

859
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:16,292
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

860
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,003
Harry! He's in the living room!

861
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:22,090
He went up the ladder!

862
01:35:39,483 --> 01:35:42,569
I'm coming, Harry. I'm coming.

863
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,784
Harry! Harry!

864
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:55,331
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

865
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:58,501
Hey! Why don't you guys try the stairs?

866
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,462
Right.

867
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,216
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

868
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,261
Don't you remember
what happened last year?

869
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:10,472
No.
Watch this.

870
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,850
Let's get him!

871
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:21,566
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

872
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,110
That's one.

873
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:28,114
Don't worry, Harry. I'll get him.

874
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,540
Right in the schnoz.

875
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,211
That's two. Come on, let's get him.

876
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,725
That's three.

877
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:03,107
No.

878
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:06,986
That's four.

879
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:14,786
Come on, Harry.
Marv, are you sure this is safe?

880
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:20,208
Oh yeah. Yep, I've worked all the
kinks out. It's solid as a rock.

881
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,187
Like a rock, huh, Marv?
Hey? Do you guys give up?

882
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:44,023
Have you had enough pain?
Never!

883
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,621
You better say every prayer
you ever heard before, kid!

884
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:02,292
I hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

885
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:08,047
Where'd he go?
I'm up here and I'm really scared.

886
01:38:18,183 --> 01:38:20,143
What's that sound?

887
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,626
That was the sound of a tool chest
falling down the stairs.

888
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:52,842
Yes!

889
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:29,504
Over there!

890
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:33,049
I don't care if I get the chair,
I'm killing that kid!

891
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,970
Surrender, kid!

892
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,765
He vanished.
I'm down here, you big horse's ass!

893
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,146
Whoa.
Nice night for a neck injury!

894
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,984
Suck brick, kid!

895
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,784
Come on, Marv.
Oh, I don't know.

896
01:40:00,285 --> 01:40:02,245
I said, come on.

897
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:06,416
Come on, you big sissy.

898
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:23,016
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

899
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,228
That's not aftershave. That's kerosene.
The rope is soaked in it.

900
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:31,274
Now, why would anybody
soak a rope in kerosene?

901
01:40:35,612 --> 01:40:37,363
Merry Christmas.

902
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:39,407
Go up!

903
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:15,985
Get off me!

904
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,802
Get the bag!

905
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:44,680
Hello, the two guys who robbed
Duncan's Toy Chest are in the park.

906
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:49,310
Central Park West, 95th Street.
Look for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

907
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:00,321
Hey, I'm down here. Better come
and get me before I call the cops.

908
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,506
My, how the tables have turned.

909
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,925
How do you like the ice, kid?

910
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:28,516
Let's go for a little stroll in the park.

911
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,327
Give me that bag. Give me it!

912
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:55,918
Hey, these'll look great
in the photo album.

913
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:00,715
You may've won the battle, little dude,
but you lost the war.

914
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:05,011
You ought not have messed with us, pal.
We're dangerous.

915
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:13,060
Harry?
Shut up!

916
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:21,235
Harry.
Shut up! I want to enjoy this.

917
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:26,282
Something's wrong. Let's get out of here!
Shut up, I said!

918
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:31,370
I never made it to the 6th grade, kid,

919
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,957
and it doesn't look like
you're going to, either.

920
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,251
Let him go!

921
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:39,086
Kevin, run!

922
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:44,759
Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her!

923
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:47,136
I'm trying to shoot her!

924
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:04,070
Run, Marv!

925
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,261
Bye! Thanks.

926
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:56,539
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

927
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:58,263
Okay, let's go.
We'll take the bridge.

928
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:01,377
You guys get the tunnel.
Let's go. Come on!

929
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:10,720
Oh, my God!

930
01:45:21,064 --> 01:45:22,398
All right, guys, let's go, huh?

931
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:25,735
Come on, on your feet.
Take it easy.

932
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:27,653
What is this stuff?

933
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:31,490
You guys should've started earlier.

934
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:33,993
The prisoners have
already exchanged gifts.

935
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:35,911
We missed the presents?

936
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:39,749
He made us hide out in the store so we
could steal all the kiddies' charity money.

937
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:42,168
Shut up, Marv.

938
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:46,047
Got the right to remain silent, you know.

939
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:49,050
He's a little cranky. We just broke out
of prison a few days ago.

940
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:51,761
Shut up, Marv! Jeez.

941
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,096
Get them out of here!
All right, let's go.

942
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,765
Remember, if this makes the papers,

943
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:58,601
we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

944
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,353
We're not Sticky Bandits, shut up!

945
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:02,772
That's Sticky. That's S...
Shut it.

946
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,315
T...

947
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,275
I.
I...

948
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:20,102
Well, Mr. Duncan, it's all over with.

949
01:46:20,123 --> 01:46:22,166
We apprehended the thieves
and we recovered your money.

950
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:25,836
Good, I want to get that money over to the
Children's Hospital as soon as possible.

951
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:29,382
I'll handle it personally. My pleasure.
Thank you very much.

952
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,008
Excuse me, Mr. Duncan.
Yes.

953
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:34,553
I found this note.
Looks like a kid broke your window.

954
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,280
Turtledoves.

955
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:06,460
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
He's this boy right here.

956
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:10,589
Excuse me. Please help me.
This boy right here. Have you seen him?

957
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,967
This one, he's... Please.

958
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,269
I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen my son? He's...

959
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:25,104
There. He's been missing for two days.

960
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:29,108
Well, have you filed a report, ma'am?
Yes, of course we have.

961
01:47:30,068 --> 01:47:32,611
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

962
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:39,535
But I'm his mother.

963
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:44,540
I realize that, ma'am, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

964
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:48,043
Do you have kids?
Yes, ma'am.

965
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:51,380
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?

966
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:55,718
I'd probably be doing the same thing
you're doing.

967
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:57,761
Thank you.

968
01:48:00,223 --> 01:48:04,393
Look, put yourself in your kid's shoes.
Where would you go? What would you do?

969
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:08,063
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

970
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:14,153
Oh, but not Kevin. No. Kevin is
so much stronger and braver than I am.

971
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:18,532
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is. Fine.

972
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:24,747
But he's still all by himself in a big
city. And he doesn't deserve that.

973
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:29,919
He deserves to be at home with
his own family around his Christmas tree.

974
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:36,759
Oh, dear God, I know where he is.

975
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,763
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

976
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:43,015
Hop in.
Thank you.

977
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:51,690
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

978
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:54,360
I don't want any presents.

979
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:58,697
Instead, I want to take back
every mean thing I ever said to my family,

980
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:01,534
even if they don't take back
the things that they said.

981
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:05,454
I don't care. I love all of them.
Including Buzz.

982
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:10,626
If it isn't possible I can see all of them,
could I just see my mother?

983
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:15,381
I'll never want another thing
as long as I live. I just want my mother.

984
01:49:15,465 --> 01:49:19,426
I know I won't see her tonight,
but promise me I can see her again.

985
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:21,470
Sometime. Anytime.

986
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:25,849
Even if it's just once
and only for a couple of minutes.

987
01:49:25,934 --> 01:49:28,852
I just need to tell her I'm sorry.

988
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,362
Kevin?

989
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,494
Mom?

990
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:49,999
Wow! That worked fast!

991
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,011
Oh, Kevin.

992
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,180
Mom, I'm sorry.

993
01:50:06,933 --> 01:50:09,018
I'm sorry, too.

994
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:23,240
Merry Christmas, Mom.

995
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,328
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

996
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:31,373
Thank you. Let's go.

997
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,293
How'd you know I was here?

998
01:50:34,377 --> 01:50:37,257
Well, I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest one around.

999
01:50:37,339 --> 01:50:39,632
Where's everybody else?
They're at the hotel.

1000
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:42,217
They didn't like palm trees either.

1001
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:28,472
Holy smokes, it's morning!

1002
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:31,975
It's Christmas morning, man.

1003
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,813
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

1004
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:39,024
I don't think Santa Claus visits hotels.

1005
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:42,695
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.
He goes everywhere.

1006
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:47,491
Hey, guys, wake up, it's Christmas!

1007
01:51:51,162 --> 01:51:53,330
Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!
What?

1008
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:07,469
Wow.
Wow.

1009
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:11,932
Where'd it all come from?
Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

1010
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:17,896
My gosh!
Peter!

1011
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,649
Are you sure we're in the right room?

1012
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:27,448
Don't open any of mine. I mean it.

1013
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:30,826
Who's Mr. Duncan?
Duncan? I don't know.

1014
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:34,580
All right, everyone, just calm down.
Calm down! Hey! Hey!

1015
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:40,627
All right. Now, if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place, again,

1016
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:45,674
then we wouldn't be in this
most perfect and huge hotel room

1017
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:48,177
with a truckload of all this free stuff.

1018
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:52,723
So, I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open up the first present.

1019
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:57,352
Then I'll go and the rest of you and so on.

1020
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:05,194
Merry Christmas, Kev.
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1021
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:13,660
Merry Christmas, Kevin.
Okay, Kevin! All right! Merry Christmas!

1022
01:53:15,371 --> 01:53:20,167
Enough of this gooey... Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1023
01:53:20,251 --> 01:53:22,127
All right!

1024
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:25,464
Everybody, now, wait, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1025
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:27,382
Give me the bows...

1026
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,628
Merry Christmas.

1027
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,424
Kevin! Merry Christmas!

1028
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:13,011
I got something for you.

1029
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:21,561
What's this?

1030
01:54:21,573 --> 01:54:24,857
It's a turtledove. I have one.
You have one.

1031
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:28,986
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1032
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,992
Oh, Kevin.

1033
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:39,913
Thank you.

1034
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:43,625
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1035
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:14,823
Mr. McCallister's room service bill, sir.

1036
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:18,160
Merry Christmas, sir.

1037
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:26,293
Nice family. Really.

1038
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:38,347
Merry Christmas indeed.

1039
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,974
Oh, Dad!

1040
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:46,104
Kevin! You spent $967 on room service?

1041
01:59:59,233 --> 02:00:00,233
English US
