1
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>As Head of the Shin Bet,</i>

2
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:26,504
<i>you learn that politicians
prefer binary options.</i>

3
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,550
<i>They don't like having three or four options.</i>

4
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,677
<i>They want you to tell them, "Zero or one."</i>

5
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,637
<i>"Do it. Don't do it."</i>

6
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,352
<i>As a commander, I find myself</i>

7
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:46,608
<i>in situations that are
different shades of gray.</i>

8
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:54,866
<i>Let's say you're hunting a terrorist.</i>

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,285
<i>You can get him,</i>

10
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:02,040
<i>but there are one or two people in the oar.</i>

11
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:08,671
<i>You're not sure
if they're part of his gang or not.</i>

12
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,968
What do you do? Do you fire or not?

13
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,645
<i>There's no time.</i>

14
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:29,734
<i>These situations last seconds,
minutes at most.</i>

15
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,406
<i>People expect a decision,</i>

16
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,786
and by decision they usually mean "to act."

17
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,371
That's a decision.

18
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:45,708
"Don't do it" seems easier,
but it's often harder.

19
00:02:55,385 --> 00:03:00,431
Sometimes it's a super-clean operation.

20
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,434
No one was hurt except the terrorists.

21
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,023
Even then, later, life stops,

22
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,693
at night, in the day, when you're shaving.

23
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:17,240
We all have our moments. On vacation...

24
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,913
<i>You say, "Okay,</i>

25
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,082
<i>"I made a decision</i>

26
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,712
<i>"and X number of people were killed.</i>

27
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,883
<i>"They were definitely about
to launch a big attack."</i>

28
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,515
No one near them was hurt.
It was as sterile as possible.

29
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,309
Yet you still say,

30
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,979
"There's something unnatural about it."

31
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,609
What's unnatural is the power you have

32
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,945
to take three people, terrorists,

33
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,282
and take their lives in an instant.

34
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,363
<i>How old were you during the Six Day War?</i>

35
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,491
<i>I was 11.</i>

36
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:29,539
I remember thinking, "What is war?"

37
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,624
It's hard to say if I really understood,

38
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:36,504
but I remember the feeling

39
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,841
of fear, because our situation was bad.

40
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,559
<i>Most of all I remember a book.</i>

41
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:55,106
<i>I read it</i> a <i>lot, If Israel Lost the War.</i>

42
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:59,110
It described a very unpleasant scenario

43
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,405
<i>of us losing the war</i>

44
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,576
<i>and the Arabs conquering Israel.</i>

45
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:13,750
It had a profound impact on me.

46
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,210
I thought about it a lot as a boy.

47
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:53,456
<i>In the Six Day War, I was in Operations.</i>

48
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,417
The Arabs surrendered

49
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:59,837
and we were suddenly left without an enemy.

50
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:06,511
You're like a dog in a race,
looking for the rabbit.

51
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:12,975
The rabbit goes underground,
and the dog can't find it.

52
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,852
We were like that.

53
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:19,524
Then we started working
in the West Bank and Gaza

54
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,028
in anti-terrorism, without
knowing exactly what it was

55
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,696
because terrorism hadn't developed.

56
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,044
<i>We decided to conduct
a census in the Territories</i>

57
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:43,214
<i>to find out how many people
lived in the refugee camps.</i>

58
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:48,636
<i>It was important.
We used the information for years.</i>

59
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,721
But you know how it is.

60
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,641
They called up the reserves
and trained them quickly.

61
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,561
What do I mean by quickly?
You knock on the door.

62
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,897
They ask, "Who's there?"
You say, "Soldiers."

63
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,318
"What do you want?"
"We came to count you."

64
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,279
That's it. How many words?

65
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,072
It's nothing. Ten words.

66
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,954
<i>The reservist unit comes
and knocks on the door.</i>

67
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,748
They ask, "Who's there?"
What do the soldiers say?

68
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,417
<i>"Soldiers," like they learned.</i>

69
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,919
"What do you want?"

70
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,547
But they made a mistake.

71
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,635
Instead of saying nehsikum
with an unaccented

72
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,179
they used an accented

73
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,346
What's the difference?

74
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,309
<i>"Jinna nehsikum" means
"We came</i> to <i>count</i> you."

75
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,437
"Jinna nekhsikum" with an accent
is "We came to castrate you."

76
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:50,948
<i>We took intensive courses in
spoken and literary Arabic,</i>

77
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:54,035
<i>reading articles and manuscripts.</i>

78
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,539
Anyone who took the Shin Bet's
Arabic program seriously

79
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,708
knows Arabic.

80
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,753
He can listen to Arabic
and read between the lines.

81
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,297
He can read notes from agents...

82
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,015
<i>The Shin Bet looked for people to talk to</i>

83
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:20,603
<i>to understand what
motivated the Palestinians.</i>

84
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:27,485
For the first time, some Jews raised

85
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,613
the idea of a Palestinian state.

86
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,532
I loved the idea,

87
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,911
<i>so I went to the Territories with people</i>

88
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,580
<i>who dealt with the Palestinians.</i>

89
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,171
<i>We didn't know what we wanted to achieve.</i>

90
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,343
We received no direction
about our objectives.

91
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,971
When you don't get direction
from the politicians,

92
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,475
you are... just like with
the rabbit... searching.

93
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,653
<i>I started as a coordinator
in the Nablus district.</i>

94
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,949
<i>It was a very pretty area, full of olive trees.</i>

95
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:21,372
I liked to get out of my car and wander

96
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,583
in the field, refugee camps, alleyways,

97
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:30,423
visit homes, sit in cafés, talk...

98
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:34,552
I really loved the interaction with the people.

99
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:39,181
From that exotic encounter with olive trees,

100
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,225
landscapes, and peasants,

101
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,021
I found myself at the center
of the Palestinian problem.

102
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,148
I was working in the refugee camps.

103
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,485
<i>Suddenly you see what refugees are.</i>

104
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,699
<i>Once you look more deeply, you say, "Wait.</i>

105
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:00,995
<i>"I'm not an observer,
here to take photos and leave.</i>

106
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,748
<i>"I'm an active participant."</i>

107
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,257
At first, your security role
is all you care about.

108
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,718
It's easier to be on that side.

109
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:20,264
<i>A curfew was placed
on the casbah of Hebron,</i>

110
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,268
<i>where one Israeli soldier was killed
and another wounded.</i>

111
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:28,022
<i>The two were on patrol
when shots were heard.</i>

112
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:32,068
<i>One was wounded.
The other chased after the shooters.</i>

113
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,529
<i>He was later found murdered here.</i>

114
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:04,642
Gradually there was an increase...
To put it cynically,

115
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,436
luckily for us, terrorism increased.

116
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,649
Why do I say that?

117
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,319
Because now we had work

118
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,115
and we stopped dealing with
the Palestinian state.

119
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,660
- Understand?
- Of course.

120
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,664
As soon as we stopped dealing
with the Palestinian state

121
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,165
and started dealing with terrorism,

122
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,292
terror became more sophisticated. So did we.

123
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:35,798
Suddenly we had a lot of work
in Gaza and the West Bank,

124
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,553
and overseas, too,

125
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,682
so we forgot about the Palestinian issue.

126
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,066
In Nablus then, wherever you threw a rock,

127
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,152
there was either a cat or a terrorist.

128
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:01,532
Some nights we arrested hundreds of people.

129
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,595
<i>We'd take over a village</i>

130
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,389
<i>and gather all the men in the square,</i>

131
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,517
<i>usually by the mosque or in a schoolyard.</i>

132
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,688
We used the "identifier" technique.

133
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,317
Terrorists who confessed
would be put in a vehicle.

134
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,069
The windows had curtains
and they wore masks.

135
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,075
We'd sit them there, and the villagers passed

136
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,369
beside the vehicle, and they'd tell us,

137
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,581
"He's a terrorist who trained in Syria,"

138
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,750
"He's a terrorist who got back from Jordan."

139
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,920
<i>Not everyone cooperated,</i>

140
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,591
<i>but we usually had a good catch.</i>

141
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:10,434
<i>Back then, most intelligence
was based on HUMINT,</i>

142
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:14,813
<i>HUMan INTelligence we got in two ways.</i>

143
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>Either from our agents
or the interrogation of prisoners.</i>

144
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,287
On my first day at work,

145
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:36,794
the person I was replacing
picked me up at home.

146
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:43,217
He decided that the best place to train
an inexperienced security guy like me was

147
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:48,138
the interrogation facility in Jerusalem.

148
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,266
I started learning intelligence there.

149
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,734
<i>I don't know if you've ever
been inside a prison,</i>

150
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:04,905
<i>but the one in Jerusalem
is the worst that I know.</i>

151
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,826
<i>It's a very old building
from the time of the Turks.</i>

152
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>A normal person walks through the door
and he's ready to admit to killing Jesus.</i>

153
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,968
<i>You need to make the suspect feel tense.</i>

154
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:30,472
You need to make him understand

155
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,184
that when we are done,
he will give up his information,

156
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,394
so the sooner the better.

157
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,189
<i>The Shin Bet has interrogated</i>

158
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,985
<i>tens of thousands of people,
if not hundreds of thousands.</i>

159
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,374
The Shin Bet is a well-oiled system.

160
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:03,005
It's well-organized and effective.
It's systematic.

161
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,467
<i>You receive a territorial unit</i>

162
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,387
<i>and learn it, village by village, trail by trail,</i>

163
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,015
<i>whether by field trips</i>

164
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,144
<i>or lots of interviews
with the masses of people who come</i>

165
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,188
<i>to military government HQ.</i>

166
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,067
<i>You sit with them and ask</i>

167
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,320
<i>them to tell you about the village, the clans,</i>

168
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,948
<i>from the number of people in the village</i>

169
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,326
<i>to what institutions it has...</i>

170
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,915
<i>You eventually reach a point</i>

171
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,834
<i>where you mark who you want to recruit.</i>

172
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,005
<i>In the end you know you want X</i>

173
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,717
<i>because X's connections,</i>

174
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,347
<i>his ability to infiltrate places
that you want to watch over</i>

175
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,518
<i>are such that he's the agent
you want to recruit.</i>

176
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:03,774
Recruiting people means
taking someone who

177
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,110
doesn't usually like you

178
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:14,451
and making him do things
he never believed he could.

179
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:20,082
To convince someone to betray

180
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:26,255
his surroundings, his friends,
sometimes his family

181
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,258
is no small thing.

182
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,149
<i>All in all, we gained control
over the war on terror.</i>

183
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:52,823
We kept it on a low flame
so the country could do what it wanted.

184
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,117
That's important,

185
00:17:55,951 --> 00:18:01,081
but it didn't solve the problem
of the Occupation.

186
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,958
<i>What it did was</i>

187
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,004
<i>instead of 20 attacks a week,
there were 20 a year.</i>

188
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:21,435
<i>All in all, no Israeli prime minister</i>

189
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,814
<i>took the Palestinians into consideration,</i>

190
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,944
whether they lived within
the '67 borders or not.

191
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,826
<i>What's the difference between
Golda Meir and Begin? Nothing.</i>

192
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,330
<i>He didn't visit the Arabs. She didn't either.</i>

193
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,626
<i>She called herself a Palestinian.</i>

194
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:51,548
<i>Begin didn't even say that because
they weren't important to him.</i>

195
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,887
<i>In Peres's day, the atmosphere changed,</i>

196
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,725
<i>but he did the same things
as his predecessors.</i>

197
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,104
- Continuing the Occupation?
- Yes!

198
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:12,486
Peri kept showing us this chart.

199
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,240
How many people were caught?
How many informers were there?

200
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,535
How many attacks were prevented?
How many weren't?

201
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,912
The picture was always rosy,

202
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:27,084
but it was point-specific.
There was no strategy, just tactics.

203
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,532
<i>1982. The Lebanon War.</i>

204
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,869
<i>The IDF entered Lebanon.</i>

205
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:07,749
<i>The Shin Bet recruited operatives.</i>

206
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,963
<i>In no time, the Shin Bet controlled Lebanon,</i>

207
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,465
<i>just like it controlled the West Bank.</i>

208
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,139
<i>Avraham Shalom was head of the Shin Bet.</i>

209
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:29,646
After years as the most
prominent intelligence agency,

210
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,191
the Mossad was replaced by the Shin Bet.

211
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,111
I think that he was

212
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,448
to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and before him, Begin,

213
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:44,328
the most important person
in their security circle.

214
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,418
I think what happened to him was
that he felt he could do whatever he wanted.

215
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,505
<i>People weren't in awe of Avraham Shalom.
They were afraid of him.</i>

216
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,965
<i>They were scared of him.</i>

217
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:01,845
<i>He was strong, forceful, smart,</i>

218
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:08,268
very stubborn, uncompromising and a bully.

219
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:13,106
If he didn't like something, heads would roll.

220
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,884
<i>I was in Jerusalem
when the 300 bus incident occurred.</i>

221
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:45,681
The Chief of Central Command
called me on the hotline.

222
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:51,728
A bus going south from
Tel Aviv was hijacked

223
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,314
<i>and headed to Gaza.</i>

224
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:59,027
<i>There was a chase with helicopters.</i>

225
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:07,661
The bus stopped just outside my district.

226
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:15,127
They called that morning to say
that they stormed the bus

227
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,590
and two terrorists were
taken to interrogation.

228
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:26,054
I turned on the news
and heard that all the terrorists were killed.

229
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:30,517
I told my wife that something stinks here.

230
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,605
Please describe what happened that evening.

231
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:40,235
You got a call and were told
a bus was hijacked?

232
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,740
I don't remember.

233
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,243
- I was in Haifa.
- Yes, and...

234
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:56,376
They said, "A bus was hijacked. Come."
So I went.

235
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:24,548
"The Terrorist Beaten to Death
by the Security Forces"

236
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,509
The army handled it.

237
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:32,722
During the operation,

238
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:38,979
they killed two, and two came out unharmed.

239
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,189
I didn't know that then.

240
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,821
They beat the daylights out of them,

241
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,574
the two of them.

242
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,201
So the Shin Bet took them...

243
00:24:54,202 --> 00:25:00,041
I asked Ehud, the Head of Operations,

244
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,671
what state were they in.

245
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:08,175
He said they were almost dead.
Maybe the soldiers said so.

246
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,928
So I said, "Hit them again and finish it."

247
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,722
He didn't do that.

248
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,765
He did what he described,

249
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:21,104
-which I found out a year later.
- What did he do?

250
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:27,444
I think he took a rock
and smashed their heads in,

251
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,031
but they were unconscious.

252
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,117
I don't know what state they were in.

253
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:38,872
The photo showed them
before they were beaten up.

254
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,041
The army pounced on them.

255
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,961
The photo was taken before that.

256
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,465
It's not how they looked when we got them.

257
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,884
How did they look?

258
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:55,430
I don't know,
but some thought they were dead.

259
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,560
They broke their bones. it was a lynching.

260
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,314
You didn't physically see them?

261
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,983
I didn't see them.

262
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:49,192
We killed a terrorist, whose hands were tied,

263
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,653
who no longer threatened us.

264
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,197
By What right?

265
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,242
But in the Shin Bet back then,

266
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,704
there was no such concept
as an illegal order.

267
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,543
Not only did the Shin Bet fail.

268
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,380
The Cabinet and the Prime Minister failed,

269
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,300
and to some degree,
they oversee the Shin Bet.

270
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,887
<i>It's a tough question.</i>

271
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,184
Did the Prime Minister know
about the premeditated murder,

272
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:28,398
the plan to kill the terrorist
caught on the 300 bus?

273
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:34,863
Did the head of Shin Bet have the authority
to do that, to make those decisions?

274
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,577
Under what circumstances
did Shamir give you permission to kill?

275
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,040
There were one or two cases,
when I couldn't find him,

276
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,916
and it had to be done.

277
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,585
What had to be done?

278
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:54,674
We had to deal with Arabs
who were about to launch an attack,

279
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,593
or that launched an attack.

280
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:01,765
He said, "if you can't find me,
decide on your own."

281
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,768
When did you realize that you had to resign?

282
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,563
I offered my resignation
to Shamir the next day.

283
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,523
He said, "Don't you dare."

284
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:15,779
<i>He was afraid that if I resigned,
he'd have to resign, too.</i>

285
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:23,036
<i>He went to Shimon Peres.
Rabin was Defense Minister.</i>

286
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,873
<i>He said, "You gave similar permission to kill,</i>

287
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,543
<i>"so if you leave us to the wolves,</i>

288
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,046
<i>"we'll drag you down with us."</i>

289
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,967
They kept telling me what to do
and how to respond.

290
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,470
I didn't do anything without coordinating it.

291
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:46,309
I never imagined that after
a year of coordinating,

292
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:52,315
they'd drop the issue and say,
"We didn't know."

293
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,571
I don't take politicians seriously anymore.

294
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,951
- Because?
- Because I saw that they couldn't be trusted.

295
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:06,496
They abandon the wounded in the field.
That's not for me.

296
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,747
You are the wounded?

297
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,667
Notjust me. The whole Shin Bet.

298
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:19,968
The Shin Bet's operatives said,
"We're sent on missions 24/7.

299
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:24,055
"Some are of questionable legality.
Some are barely legal.

300
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,598
"Some are legal.

301
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,934
"No one gives us any backing.

302
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:35,191
<i>"As soon as the press finds out
about an operation,</i>

303
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,485
<i>"if we don't get any support
from the politicians,</i>

304
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,446
<i>"it's a sign that they abandoned us."</i>

305
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:46,286
"Deal reached:
Head of Shin Bet to resign..."

306
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:51,207
<i>The Shin Bet's exposure as a result
of the 300 bus incident</i>

307
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,753
and the sense that,
"Guys, we're not omnipotent.

308
00:29:55,837 --> 00:30:00,884
"There's a legal system above us"
began to sink in.

309
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,811
Why did you give the order to kill them?

310
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,231
I didn't want any more live terrorists in court.

311
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:21,029
It would only increase terrorism.
It increased it anyways.

312
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,865
Was it right to kill
the terrorists on the 300 bus?

313
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,075
Based on the results, no.

314
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,370
- Only because of the results?
- Only because of the results.

315
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,999
So, if there was no reporter,
it would be okay?

316
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,878
Are you asking me, or are you telling me?

317
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,004
I'm asking you.

318
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,424
If he hadn't come, no one would have known.

319
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,679
What about the morality of it?

320
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:52,268
With terrorism there are no morals.
Find morals in terrorists first.

321
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,230
And if he surrendered?

322
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:59,275
- It's not a moral problem.
- Then what is it?

323
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:05,114
It's a tactical problem, not strategic.

324
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,578
So for you, the decision
to kill the two terrorists...

325
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:14,040
You keep painting it black and white.
There are decisions that...

326
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,000
Two captured terrorists were killed.

327
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,378
Why are you caught up on that?

328
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,922
I'm trying to understand the morality of it.

329
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,966
There is no morality in a case like that.

330
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,802
In the war against terror,
forget about morality.

331
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,972
When there's a one-ton bomb,
forget about morality.

332
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:23,443
The First Intifada was the charge
that blew up this room,

333
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,153
with all the explosives,

334
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:27,655
because it occurred spontaneously.

335
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,993
<i>A nation rose up and tried
to launch a revolution,</i>

336
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,536
<i>to kick us out.</i>

337
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,518
I was second in command here
in the Southern District.

338
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:05,652
A wave of mass protests erupted,
bigger than anything we'd seen.

339
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,739
<i>Hundreds and thousands of
people took to the street.</i>

340
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,824
<i>Only live fire could stop them.</i>

341
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:46,776
<i>The number of people
on the Shin Bet's wanted list</i>

342
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>may have been the largest
of any intelligence agency anywhere.</i>

343
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:57,078
<i>Dozens in every region,
hundreds, thousands...</i>

344
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:13,136
<i>Explain how the Shin Bet,
which controlled the territory,</i>

345
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,889
<i>didn't foresee an insurrection
of this magnitude.</i>

346
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,144
<i>What intelligence agency foresaw
the fall of the Berlin Wall?</i>

347
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:27,442
To complain that the Shin Bet
should have foreseen it...

348
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,612
Formally, in principle, yes, it should have.

349
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,281
That was the expectation.

350
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,283
<i>That's why you operate systems,</i>

351
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:38,786
<i>maintain enormous intelligence
factories... Correct.</i>

352
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,622
<i>But you have to tell the truth.</i>

353
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,125
<i>Almost all the intelligence
agencies in the world</i>

354
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:49,839
<i>failed to foresee major historical events.</i>

355
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,178
You ask yourself, "Where did I go wrong?"

356
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,765
Not in the sense that I rule over them,

357
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,684
but should I have let this happen,

358
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:06,522
or should I have left
before they said, "Get out."

359
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:12,695
But those questions are more
philosophical than practical.

360
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,280
They're the most interesting.

361
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,783
Yes, but listen. You can't...

362
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:21,078
Most of them don't have definitive answers.

363
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,955
I don't need definitive answers.

364
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,504
There were plenty of instances
since 1967, when, in my opinion,

365
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:35,051
and I thought it then, too,

366
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,054
we should have reached
an agreement and got out.

367
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,764
Why didn't you say so?

368
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,516
We all have our criticisms,

369
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,726
but it's not within my mandate

370
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,647
to convince the Prime Minister
to go to the Palestinians or not.

371
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:51,901
It also depends on
who's dealing with the issue.

372
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,322
<i>Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir never believed</i>

373
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,242
<i>that an agreement
with the Arabs was possible.</i>

374
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,869
<i>Yitzhak Rabin really did believe it.</i>

375
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,674
<i>If we ever want a serious chance</i>

376
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,261
<i>at solving the Palestinian-Israeli problem,</i>

377
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:23,432
the time is now, and the partner is the PLO,

378
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:31,607
which rid itself of the principles
that I despised them for.

379
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,334
<i>For us, the Oslo Accords
erupted in a single day.</i>

380
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,337
Peri was head of the Shin Bet then.

381
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,006
He updated me about Oslo.

382
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:41,427
He said, "Avi, listen. We have to act quickly,

383
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,347
"to speak to the PLO's
representatives in the field

384
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:47,266
"and deal with all the suspects

385
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,394
"because we can't keep
going after PLO suspects

386
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:55,691
"after we sign an agreement in Washington."

387
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:04,700
<i>It was amazing.
The first meeting was in Geneva.</i>

388
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,869
<i>Sitting in the lobby was Jibril Rajoub,</i>

389
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,748
and I, not me personally but the Shin Bet,

390
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,000
put him in prison when he was 16.

391
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,836
He sat in prison for 18-20 years.

392
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,714
You see that you are meeting people

393
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,842
whose desire for peace and quiet,

394
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,844
whose desire for an agreement

395
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:27,390
is no less ambitious than yours.

396
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:28,975
It was very hard for me.

397
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,061
I felt like I was doing something that...

398
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,064
I couldn't be doing this.
I chased after those people.

399
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,234
How could I sit with terrorists?

400
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,820
They killed people.

401
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,738
Could I sit down with them?

402
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:46,826
To them, by the way, I was also a terrorist.

403
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,497
As a Palestinian, he looks at you
and says, "You're a terrorist, too."

404
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,165
How can that be?

405
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,418
Then you realize that...

406
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:01,590
"One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter."

407
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,140
The number one terrorist enemy of Israel

408
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:12,268
until the day that Arafat entered Gaza

409
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,061
was Fatah, the PLO.

410
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:17,440
All at once, the PLO left the circle of terror.

411
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:22,111
<i>Hamas and Islamic Jihad filled that vacuum.</i>

412
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:37,209
<i>We wondered how
the Palestinians will function.</i>

413
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:42,715
<i>How committed are they to fighting terrorism</i>

414
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:46,302
in those areas that they control.

415
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:52,433
We also asked how
we could prevent terrorism

416
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,977
if we no longer control the Territories.

417
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>The first bus bombing I saw
was the 5 bus in 1994.</i>

418
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,007
It was the first suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.

419
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:31,305
I'll never forget it.

420
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:37,228
<i>It was the first time I felt
I couldn't isolate myself</i>

421
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:43,359
from that sight,
from the stench of burning bodies.

422
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,194
I'll never forget it.

423
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:49,240
Later it passed.
I saw many other bus attacks.

424
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,875
<i>It continued with the horrible attack
at the Beit Lid Junction</i>

425
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:04,713
and the Stock Exchange
and the 18 bus in Jerusalem.

426
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,137
<i>The feeling in the Shin Bet
whenever there's an attack</i>

427
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,888
that we couldn't prevent

428
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:16,058
is a horrible sense of failure,
disappointment,

429
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,228
especially if the attack is a large one.

430
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,981
There's a real sense of disappointment.

431
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,566
How did we fail to prevent it?

432
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,445
<i>It was the lowest point in the Shin Bet</i>

433
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:33,826
<i>that I remember in my 32-33 years
in the organization.</i>

434
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,749
As the suicide attacks increased,

435
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:44,879
as long as Hamas played
the main role in these attacks,

436
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:49,008
the need to use moderate physical pressure
in interrogations increased.

437
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,765
<i>Interrogating Hamas and Islamic Jihad
is much more difficult.</i>

438
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,436
<i>Anyone willing to sacrifice his life,</i>

439
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:03,606
<i>whether it's for the virgins in paradise or not,</i>

440
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,275
<i>has nothing to lose.</i>

441
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:16,327
Things get more complicated
with a "ticking time bomb."

442
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:22,333
it basically means that
you have information or a lead

443
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:25,419
about a possible terrorist attack,

444
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:27,796
whether suicide or other.

445
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,633
In any event, people will die

446
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:35,888
and the way to find out,
"Yes, no, if so, where?"

447
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,557
lies with the person you're interrogating.

448
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:55,783
<i>You use all sorts of techniques</i>

449
00:42:55,866 --> 00:43:01,288
<i>that reduce his ability to resist.</i>

450
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:10,798
The interrogation techniques
we were allowed were

451
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,300
sleep deprivation

452
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:21,016
<i>sitting handcuffed in a painful,
degrading, exhausting position.</i>

453
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:26,021
<i>What do you get out of covering their heads?</i>

454
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,110
<i>It's pitch black, and you lose
your sense of where you are.</i>

455
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,528
You don't know what's around you.

456
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,282
You can hear,
but you don't know what's there.

457
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:37,700
<i>And shaking?</i>

458
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,036
<i>Shaking is used to establish presence.</i>

459
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,831
<i>It's threatening. It doesn't hurt.</i>

460
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:48,627
What it does is intimidate you.

461
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:53,674
An interrogator picks you up
and shakes you. You feel threatened.

462
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:59,972
<i>What happened was that
someone named Harizat,</i>

463
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,727
<i>from Hamas, was a small man
and he was shaken.</i>

464
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,272
It was a case of shaken baby syndrome.

465
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:11,233
His brain hit his skull and he died as a result.

466
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:18,449
This resulted in bitter arguments

467
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:24,997
between me as head of Shin Bet
and Attorney General Michael Ben-Yair,

468
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,336
who thought it was immoral and unethical.

469
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:34,340
In response, I said that if we don't use it,

470
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:38,385
if we prevent 90 percent
of suicide attacks now,

471
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,764
we'll prevent 70 percent instead,

472
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:45,434
which means dead Israelis.

473
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,271
Prime Minister Rabin had to decide.

474
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:54,860
He once got out of his chair furiously

475
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:58,405
<i>and shouted at Ben-Y a“,</i>

476
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:00,699
"You keep telling me what I can't do!

477
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:03,243
"Tell me once what I can do!"

478
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,788
it was a very contentious issue.

479
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:14,254
<i>Rabin was a security man
in every bone in his body,</i>

480
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,258
<i>not someone we have to
explain to when we said,</i>

481
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,427
<i>"We don't have the tools to provide security."</i>

482
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,096
<i>He understood it perfectly.</i>

483
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:25,099
<i>You saw that he was torn up over it,</i>

484
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:29,186
<i>but he made a decision that said,</i>

485
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:32,815
"We will fight terror
as if there is no peace process

486
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,150
"and continue the peace process
as if there is no terror."

487
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,493
<i>As the attacks increased,</i>

488
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,079
<i>the Right, and not just the extremists,</i>

489
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:51,583
took to the streets against the Oslo Accords.

490
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:55,963
It was exactly what Hamas wanted,
and they succeeded.

491
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:08,642
With blood and fire, we'll throw Rabin out!

492
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:32,291
<i>Most opposition to the peace process
was from the religious camp.</i>

493
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:40,716
Their leaders targeted
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

494
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:45,721
<i>The incitement was focused on him.</i>

495
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:42,110
<i>As a young army recruit in 1974, they took us</i>

496
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:47,199
<i>to stop the first Jewish settlers
in the West Bank.</i>

497
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:53,247
<i>We stood there, rows of soldiers
gripping each other's arms.</i>

498
00:47:53,872 --> 00:48:01,713
The settlers started hitting us in anger.

499
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,882
I remember that I really didn't like that.

500
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:07,219
The illegal settlements were built despite

501
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,888
or in opposition to, government decisions,

502
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:12,307
but there was no Israeli government

503
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:14,893
that didn't accept them,
or come to accept them.

504
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:22,150
<i>The fact that most Israeli governments</i>

505
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:28,532
did nothing gave the settlers

506
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:32,494
the sense that they're slowly
becoming the masters,

507
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:35,247
<i>that they're gaining the freedom to act</i>

508
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:39,084
<i>because the government looks away.</i>

509
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,628
<i>If they do that with an illegal settlement,</i>

510
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:44,506
it can extend into illegal activity.

511
00:48:57,185 --> 00:49:00,522
<i>In 1980, a Fatah cell</i>

512
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:04,359
<i>attacked worshippers leaving
the synagogue in Hebron.</i>

513
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:12,701
<i>A revenge attack occurred 30 days later.</i>

514
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,539
<i>They attacked Palestinian mayors
Bassam Shaka 'a in Nab/us</i>

515
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:20,208
<i>and Karim Halaf in Ramallah.</i>

516
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,841
Another bomb blinded
someone from the bomb squad

517
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:31,386
in the home of Ibrahim Tawil,
mayor of al-Bireh.

518
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,775
We knew Jews did it.

519
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:50,697
We didn't think it was some
rival Palestinian group.

520
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:54,242
You check the Jewish files and find no clues.

521
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:57,162
At some point you realize
that you have a problem,

522
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,538
that it's an intelligence failure.

523
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:06,838
<i>We put our entire
Operations Unit into action.</i>

524
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:11,343
<i>Operations put in
tens of thousands of hours,</i>

525
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:18,850
<i>until, 6 months later,
we were in the right direction.</i>

526
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:20,394
<i>We knew who did it.</i>

527
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:26,566
<i>They were a very ideological group,
really top quality.</i>

528
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:33,448
<i>Moreover, some of them were even leaders
of the communities in which they lived.</i>

529
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:39,746
<i>That gave them access to the Prime Minister.</i>

530
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,915
They had access to the Knesset.

531
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,792
They had access to ministries.

532
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,752
They were friends with ministers.

533
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:48,839
They're part of the Israeli establishment,

534
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:52,134
the respectable establishment
of the State of Israel.

535
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:57,931
We said, "if we don't catch them
in the act, we'll never catch them."

536
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:06,148
<i>The decision came
when they planned to put bombs</i>

537
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:09,609
<i>in Palestinian buses
in a parking lot in Jerusalem.</i>

538
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:15,365
The attack they planned
on the buses was insane.

539
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:19,494
They intended to kill 250 Arabs all at once.

540
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:22,164
<i>We followed them all night.</i>

541
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,916
<i>I commanded the operation in Jerusalem.</i>

542
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:30,589
<i>It was another night I'll never forget.</i>

543
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:37,429
<i>We arrested them at 4:30 a.m.,
putting bombs on the buses.</i>

544
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,808
We got out of our cars and said,
"Come, join us.

545
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:45,687
"If you don't want anything
to happen to our bomb squad,

546
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,939
"dismantle the bombs."

547
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:55,363
<i>We did our first wave of arrests,
of 17 members.</i>

548
00:51:55,447 --> 00:52:01,536
Then we investigated
and found out that since 1978-9,

549
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,372
they were planning an attack
on the Temple Mount

550
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,167
to blow up the Dome of the Rock.

551
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,091
<i>At first, the idea was
based on the belief that</i>

552
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:20,055
<i>as long as the "abomination" stood
over the site of the Jewish Temple,</i>

553
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,307
there will be no Redemption

554
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,518
and therefore,
they have to get rid of that Dome.

555
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,730
<i>They prepared the bombs.</i>

556
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:33,318
<i>They used a very sensitive
type of explosive, Semtex.</i>

557
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:37,739
<i>It was planned by Menachem Livni,</i>

558
00:52:37,823 --> 00:52:40,742
<i>who was a demolitions genius.</i>

559
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:45,831
<i>The charges would be placed so that
the entire force of the explosion</i>

560
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,167
<i>would be directed at the support structure.</i>

561
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:52,254
<i>This would result
in the collapse of the Dome.</i>

562
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:13,441
The consequence of blowing up
the Dome of the Rock, even today,

563
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:18,280
is that it could lead to total war
by all the Islamic states,

564
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,282
not just the Arab states,

565
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,119
not just Iran, Indonesia, too,

566
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:27,455
against the State of Israel.

567
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:34,212
I'm not talking about the risk
to the Jewish minority around the world.

568
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:38,216
These people decided to do it

569
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:45,098
out of some mystical belief
that this would be the War of Armageddon

570
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,977
that would usher in the Messiah
and a Jewish kingdom.

571
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:04,075
<i>After we exposed the Jewish Underground,</i>

572
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:09,331
Prime Minister Shamir called
my unit the "diamond in the crown."

573
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:14,336
We received compliments
and support from everywhere.

574
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:19,758
Then the lobbying on their behalf began.

575
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:25,180
<i>They were put on trial.
Three of them got life in prison,</i>

576
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:28,266
<i>different sentences.
They all got out of prison very quickly.</i>

577
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,353
<i>They went home as if nothing happened.</i>

578
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,064
<i>They went back
to their previous positions,</i>

579
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:38,860
<i>some to even higher positions.</i>

580
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,739
The main question
is how history will judge us

581
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,574
in the annals of the Jewish People.

582
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:47,118
I am sure that
the Dome of the Rock

583
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:49,204
will not remain on the Temple Mount

584
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,415
and the Temple Mount will return to us,

585
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:55,460
just as I am sure
that those same murderers,

586
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:58,088
whose legs I took part in removing,

587
00:54:58,171 --> 00:54:59,881
deserved their fate.

588
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:11,309
The entire Underground
was released by the Knesset.

589
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:15,480
The Clemency Law for the Jewish
Underground is signed by

590
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:19,317
Yitzhak Shamir
as Prime Minister of Israel.

591
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:22,153
It wasn't just a few members
of the Opposition.

592
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,990
At first it was,
"Oh, no! They broke the law.

593
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:29,327
"They killed people.
They wanted to blow up the country," etc.

594
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,206
Later they said,
"They are our own flesh and blood."

595
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:37,377
Then, the delegitimization process
was transferred to the Shin Bet.

596
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:41,339
The story of the Jewish Underground
is an episode

597
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:46,052
that really shook up
the Shin Bet intelligence-wise.

598
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:48,930
It established the intelligence mechanism
that, since then,

599
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:52,934
keeps an eye on those Jewish suspects
worth watching,

600
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:55,687
in our opinion, in the West Bank.

601
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,150
You watch it closely. You work hard

602
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:07,282
and up comes Yigal Amir,
who was never on any list of suspects.

603
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:11,619
He gets up one morning
and shoots the Prime Minister.

604
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:53,745
<i>Around July-August 1995,</i>

605
00:56:54,162 --> 00:57:00,502
I started to feel that we were
faced with an increase

606
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:04,923
in the potential for the assassination
of the Prime Minister.

607
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:10,637
Rabin's a traitor!
Rabin's a traitor!

608
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,850
We're fighting against a government
that's leading us into a chasm!

609
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:23,358
The Right's activity in Israel was no secret.

610
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:28,196
You don't need
the head of the Shin Bet to explain

611
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:34,536
what Bibi Netanyahu or Arik Sharon said

612
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,122
<i>to the demonstrators in Jerusalem.</i>

613
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:40,667
<i>You don't need
the head of the Shin Bet to explain</i>

614
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:45,380
<i>to the Israeli public
and especially the Prime Minister</i>

615
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:50,218
<i>the significance of Rabin's coffin
at a mock funeral.</i>

616
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:59,477
With blood and fire,
we'll throw Rabin out!

617
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:02,856
<i>Things started heating up more and more.</i>

618
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:06,484
<i>There was an attempted attack
at the Wingate Institute.</i>

619
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:13,408
After that, I went over to him and said,

620
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:17,912
"Listen, Yitzhak, it doesn't work like that.

621
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,748
"They'll hurt you in the end.

622
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:25,503
"I'm asking you to start wearing
a bulletproof vest

623
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,342
"and to drive in the armored car.
We'll increase your security detail."

624
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,262
He slammed me down.

625
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:38,725
"I was a soldier before the State.
I won't wear a bulletproof vest."

626
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:40,852
Did you speak to the rabbis
and the settlers' leaders?

627
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:45,607
Yes. I met with rabbis.
I met with the leaders of the settlers.

628
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:50,945
<i>We spoke about incitement and insurrection.</i>

629
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:56,451
The government has no right
to force people to do

630
00:58:56,534 --> 00:59:00,705
anything that runs counter to
the Torah and Jewish Law.

631
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,962
All of you here,

632
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,633
by your presence at this gathering,

633
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,259
prove

634
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:17,805
that the people really do want peace

635
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:20,558
and oppose violence.

636
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:30,944
I went to Paris on Thursday,
maybe Wednesday,

637
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:35,323
on an assignment that was
forced on me by Rabin.

638
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,660
I got a call from my bureau chief,

639
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:43,748
who told me that Rabin was wounded.

640
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:50,880
I was in shock, of course,
but I was surrounded by people,

641
00:59:50,964 --> 00:59:52,924
so I had to function.

642
00:59:54,425 --> 01:00:00,056
On a personal level, until I sat
on the plane in the dark at night,

643
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:03,518
on the flight to Tel Aviv,
I think it was the first time

644
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:08,022
that I started to feel in my heart
what I knew in my head.

645
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:13,111
Thank God for those four hours

646
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:17,782
because it gave me a chance
to absorb the loss

647
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:27,166
of a man who really was extraordinary.

648
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,818
"I am ashamed."

649
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:59,240
In retrospect, I can say that
it changed my whole world.

650
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:05,330
I suddenly saw a different Israel.

651
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:10,084
I wasn't aware of the intensity
of the chasms and hatred,

652
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:15,214
of the rifts that exist between us.

653
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,592
How do we see our future?

654
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:23,389
What do we have in common?

655
01:01:23,473 --> 01:01:28,686
Why did we come here?
What do we want to become?

656
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:37,236
All that was self-evident,
and it all fell apart.

657
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,908
<i>Rabin's assassination shattered all hope.</i>

658
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:48,289
<i>It showed very clearly
that some punk of an assassin,</i>

659
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:50,458
<i>with a pistol that could barely shoot,</i>

660
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:55,046
could eliminate hope,
an entire peace process.

661
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:58,216
He could change everything.

662
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:12,397
First of all, I decided,
after consulting with my wife,

663
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:16,901
that I would take
ministerial responsibility,

664
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,278
and submit my resignation.

665
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:21,823
I did that immediately.

666
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:24,409
What does she tell you?

667
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:30,748
She... tries to keep me alive.

668
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,836
It was a very difficult period.

669
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:39,715
Yigal Amir succeeded.
He changed history.

670
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:45,263
He changed history.
He succeeded big time.

671
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:47,849
- Until today.
- Until today.

672
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:50,768
On the contrary, it's only getting worse.

673
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,188
I believe that we'll see another
political assassination

674
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,361
surrounding the withdrawal
from the West Bank.

675
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:05,283
It will come from every direction,
mainly from the rabbis,

676
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:09,454
because the rabbis have
no reason to learn any lesson.

677
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:15,751
As far as the extremist rabbis are
concerned, the system proved itself.

678
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:42,361
Rabin's assassination
brought me to the Shin Bet.

679
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,491
<i>A year earlier, I turned Rabin down,</i>

680
01:03:46,574 --> 01:03:48,659
<i>when he asked me
to be head of the Shin Bet.</i>

681
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:52,830
<i>After Yitzhak Rabin's assassination,
I realized I had no choice.</i>

682
01:03:53,247 --> 01:04:00,129
It was obvious the Shin Bet
faced a serious crisis

683
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,508
and everyone in the Shin Bet knew it.

684
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:07,970
Everything about the Shin Bet's
operations collapsed.

685
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:11,516
Security surrounding
the Prime Minister collapsed.

686
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:14,852
The intelligence that should have
prevented the assassination collapsed.

687
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:17,063
The Shin Bet's strong suit,

688
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:21,025
preventing Palestinian and Islamic terror,

689
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,985
could no longer provide the goods.

690
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,905
The organization was down for the count.

691
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,877
The Shin Bet needed new tools
and they had to be developed.

692
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:44,674
We also realized
that we were relying on force,

693
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:45,800
rather than our brains.

694
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:58,646
<i>We began to implement
an organizational shift,</i>

695
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,944
<i>from field operations
to people sitting in offices</i>

696
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,405
<i>in front of their computer monitors.</i>

697
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,706
We prevented more attacks each year.

698
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:20,042
We achieved greater security every year.

699
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:21,294
How did it happen?

700
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:25,590
It had a lot to do with changes
we made in the Shin Bet,

701
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:27,633
but the truth must be told.

702
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:33,180
The more significant achievement

703
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:35,850
was cooperation between us
and the Palestinians.

704
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,481
<i>I met with all the top
Palestinian security officials,</i>

705
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,943
<i>all of them, once a month,
to coordinate intelligence.</i>

706
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:47,278
<i>They always told me,</i>

707
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:50,239
<i>"We're not your agents.</i>

708
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:54,160
"We don't put Hamas members
in prison for your sake.

709
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:59,707
"We only do it because our people
believe that,

710
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:03,961
"at the end of the day,
we'll have a state beside Israel.

711
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:07,298
"When we no longer believe that,
forget about us."

712
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:21,062
Just as there was a strong desire,
a firm decision

713
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:25,316
and real intent by Peres and Rabin
to reach an agreement

714
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:30,529
after Rabin was gone, the desire,

715
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:36,911
or Israel's intent to reach
a real agreement dwindled,

716
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,537
to put it mildly.

717
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:45,670
<i>There was no good faith.</i>

718
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:49,507
<i>There was no good faith
from the Palestinian side</i>

719
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,258
<i>and not from the Israeli side.</i>

720
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,722
We wanted security
and got more terrorism.

721
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:00,017
They wanted a state
and got more settlements.

722
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:04,021
When we started the Oslo process
in 1993-1994,

723
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:08,734
100,000 settlers
lived in the West Bank and Gaza,

724
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:11,779
not including the new Jerusalem suburbs.

725
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,240
At the end of the process,

726
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,534
6-7 years later,

727
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,036
in the summer of 2000,
when the process collapsed,

728
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,580
there were over 220,000 settlers.

729
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,961
<i>Ehud Barak is very proud</i>

730
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,964
<i>to have built more settlements
than Bibi Netanyahu</i>

731
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,633
<i>or any other Prime Minister before him.</i>

732
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:38,639
<i>So the question isn't whether
there's a partner.</i>

733
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:42,893
<i>Arafat doesn't have a partner.
Barak doesn't have a partner.</i>

734
01:07:43,436 --> 01:07:47,606
<i>The question is what both sides
do to have a partner.</i>

735
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:58,117
<i>It was obvious we were heading
toward another Intifada,</i>

736
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,787
another round of violence
by a group, a society, a nation

737
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:05,291
that felt that it had nothing to lose.

738
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:24,411
<i>In 2002, I went to London.</i>

739
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:28,249
The Intifada was raging.
It was hell and we went to London,

740
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:31,627
a group of Israelis and a group of
Palestinians,

741
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:35,089
in order to see if we could do anything.

742
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:39,343
At some point,
I was making myself a cup of coffee

743
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:41,679
and I was approached
by a Palestinian acquaintance

744
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:47,226
<i>named wad Satay a Doctor of Psychiatry.</i>

745
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:52,565
He said, "Ami, we finally defeated you."

746
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:56,944
I said to him, "Are you mad?
What do you mean, defeated us?

747
01:09:57,444 --> 01:10:03,117
"Hundreds of you are getting killed.
At this rate thousands of you will get killed.

748
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:07,955
"You're about to lose whatever
tiny bit of a state you have

749
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:12,293
"and you'll lose your dream of statehood.
What kind of victory is that?"

750
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:16,088
He said to me,
"Ami, I don't understand you.

751
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,465
"You still don't understand us.

752
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:22,553
"For us, victory is seeing you suffer.

753
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,305
"That's all we want.

754
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:28,601
"The more we suffer,
the more you'll suffer.

755
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:35,649
"Finally, after 50 years,
we've reached a balance of power,

756
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,985
"a balance,

757
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:43,449
"your F-16 versus our suicide bomber."

758
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:48,829
lyad Saraj's statement
gave me a very clear insight.

759
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:52,583
I suddenly understood
the suicide bomber phenomenon.

760
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,753
I suddenly understood
our reaction very differently.

761
01:10:55,836 --> 01:11:01,508
How many operations did we launch
because we hurt,

762
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:07,181
because when they blow up buses
it really hurts us and we want revenge?

763
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:08,724
How often have we done that?

764
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,677
<i>Yahya Ayyash was the most senior terrorist</i>

765
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:46,845
<i>that ever operated against Israel,</i>

766
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,890
<i>certainly the most senior member of Hamas.</i>

767
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,310
<i>He was an engineer.</i>

768
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:58,232
<i>He knew how to make bombs
out of improvised explosives.</i>

769
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:03,529
Those were the bomb belts
that blew up in buses.

770
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:09,034
Secondly, he knew how to convince
someone to commit suicide.

771
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:14,373
<i>Finally, he had survival skills
that beggared description.</i>

772
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:20,379
<i>For years,
every IDF soldier carried his picture.</i>

773
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,133
He was undoubtedly our
number one most wanted man.

774
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,267
Yahya <i>A yyash moved</i> from Samaria to Gaza.

775
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:37,563
<i>It took some time
to get that intelligence.</i>

776
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:45,029
Then we started basic surveillance to see
who was around him, where he might go.

777
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:56,540
Of course, everyone has his weak points.

778
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,295
<i>Yahya Ayyash's weak point was
his wife and son.</i>

779
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:08,802
After a long time living alone in Gaza,
he asked them to join him.

780
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:16,727
We knew the whole story,
and I decided to let them into Gaza.

781
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:25,110
<i>I thought, once they were in Gaza,
he'll want to see them.</i>

782
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:28,739
<i>Maybe the mouse
would come out of his hole.</i>

783
01:13:31,492 --> 01:13:36,580
<i>Then we found out that
he really misses his father.</i>

784
01:13:37,623 --> 01:13:40,334
How did you know that
he wanted to talk to his father?

785
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,127
We heard.

786
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:45,839
- From a source?
- We hear rumors.

787
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:53,472
<i>He never used a cell phone.
People made calls for him.</i>

788
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:58,852
After weeks of persuasion,

789
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:03,524
he agreed to speak to his father
for a few minutes.

790
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:09,696
At this point, we started
laying the groundwork

791
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:13,492
for our cell phone
to infiltrate his surroundings.

792
01:14:14,243 --> 01:14:17,788
<i>Then we started doing
all the backup work,</i>

793
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:23,252
<i>making sure that an innocent
cell phone had explosives in it.</i>

794
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:27,589
The Shin Bet are technical experts,

795
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:33,011
experts at making small appliances
with lots of power,

796
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:35,639
not so much broadcast power
as explosive power.

797
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:39,059
Since it was difficult for us
to make direct contact with Ayyash,

798
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:43,564
we used the services of a middleman.

799
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,566
He gave him the cell phone.

800
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:52,072
<i>One Friday, everything was in place.</i>

801
01:14:52,406 --> 01:14:54,741
<i>We set off the explosive charge
in the phone</i>

802
01:14:56,869 --> 01:14:58,412
and nothing worked.

803
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:04,835
Everything we built up over eight months
fell apart in front of us.

804
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:07,254
Everything worked perfectly.

805
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:11,008
Then we click to get the coffee
and it doesn't come out.

806
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:12,259
Nothing happened.

807
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:17,431
<i>Within days, the phone was
back in its natural environment.</i>

808
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,601
<i>We saw that no one suspected anything,</i>

809
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:22,186
<i>that things went on as normal.</i>

810
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:26,773
<i>We all got together again.</i>

811
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:34,489
<i>On Friday morning, his father called him.</i>

812
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:40,954
<i>The wire tapper recognized
Ayyash's voice and told us.</i>

813
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,917
Someone hit a button

814
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,461
and the cell phone exploded

815
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:51,632
while it was right next to
Yahya Ayyash's ear.

816
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:55,135
He was killed on the spot
and no one around him was hurt.

817
01:15:55,510 --> 01:16:01,642
More importantly, no one
on the ground floor heard the explosion.

818
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:07,356
The operation was coordinated
with the Air Force. It went very nicely.

819
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,608
It was very clean... elegant.

820
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:15,864
I like operations like that.
They're nice and tidy.

821
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,971
<i>To some people,
the assassination of Yahya Ayyash,</i>

822
01:16:39,054 --> 01:16:43,308
<i>at a time that seemed
relatively free of attacks,</i>

823
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,519
<i>some said it was a mistake.</i>

824
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,522
Sometimes it feels quiet

825
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:53,026
and you say, "Oh! We disturbed the calm."

826
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,039
<i>Two months later, it seemed like
the whole country was exploding.</i>

827
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:09,543
- Yes.
- Don't you see the connection?

828
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:12,754
Yes, we know for a fact,

829
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:17,843
after Ayyash's assassination
a group crossed the fence

830
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:23,682
and left Gaza to organize
attacks from the West Bank.

831
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:25,851
Of course I see the connection.

832
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:28,061
But if we make the equation,

833
01:17:28,145 --> 01:17:31,189
if we assassinate them,
they'll commit suicide attacks,

834
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:35,068
if we don't assassinate them, they won't.

835
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:38,071
The second part of the equation is false.

836
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:48,415
<i>After we pulled out of</i> Gaza,

837
01:17:48,498 --> 01:17:52,669
we couldn't enter the Palestinian areas,

838
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:58,925
unexpectedly,
with a small force, and exit safely.

839
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:05,682
<i>How do you surprise a terrorist?
From the air, from a distance.</i>

840
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:08,310
He has no idea
where the missile came from.

841
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:11,271
But to fire a missile from a distance,

842
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,107
you need very precise intel

843
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:17,778
and not for one split second,
but for the entire operation.

844
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:44,137
What is targeted assassination?

845
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,598
Where do we break the chain?

846
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,226
Okay, we'll injure.

847
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:52,896
If necessary, we'll even kill
whomever comes to kill us.

848
01:18:54,064 --> 01:18:56,483
<i>What happens to the people
surrounding him?</i>

849
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,528
<i>What happens to the people
who make the explosives,</i>

850
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:02,447
<i>who transport him, who make the plans,</i>

851
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:07,411
<i>who gather the intel,
and who just preach the idea?</i>

852
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:09,871
<i>They don't kill.</i>

853
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:14,000
They preach an ideology that, in the end,

854
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:17,838
creates jihad and leads
to the death of Israelis.

855
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,350
<i>Salah Shehadeh was
what we called the "hairspring,"</i>

856
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:33,812
<i>that set Hamas's entire terror
operation in Gaza into motion.</i>

857
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:37,607
<i>The hunt for him was very difficult,</i>

858
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:40,986
<i>with lots of intelligence
tools invested in it.</i>

859
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:45,157
<i>At some stage,
it was clear that he was home,</i>

860
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,702
<i>that his daughter wasn't,</i>

861
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:51,371
<i>and that only his wife was with him.</i>

862
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:56,126
We agreed by phone,

863
01:19:56,209 --> 01:20:01,173
the Chief of Staff, me,
the Defense Minister and the Prime Minister.

864
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:14,811
<i>The Air Force dropped a one-ton
bomb on the house.</i>

865
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:18,773
Unfortunately, because of
inaccurate intelligence,

866
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:21,568
innocents were killed.

867
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:24,237
No one knows the final number, 9-14.

868
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:58,813
When you drop a one-ton bomb
on a densely populated area,

869
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:00,565
like in the Shehadeh incident,

870
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:02,567
obviously bystanders will be hurt...

871
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:05,278
No, it's not obvious.
No. You gather intelligence.

872
01:21:05,362 --> 01:21:08,615
Where do people live?

873
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,870
How many? Who? What are the chances?
Where do you shoot from?

874
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:35,308
The implications of this incident,
in terms of collateral damage,

875
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:40,522
led to criticism of how
we could drop a bomb

876
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:44,067
on a home in the middle of Gaza.

877
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:46,611
An American asked me about it.

878
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:50,031
I said, "We know about
your methods in Afghanistan.

879
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:53,118
"You bombed a wedding
and 70 people were killed

880
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:55,328
"and no one knows
if the target was killed."

881
01:21:56,663 --> 01:22:04,087
Overkill! It's security stupidity!
It's military stupidity.

882
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,755
I don't know what to call it,

883
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:12,762
but it makes no sense that to kill
the most important man in Gaza

884
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,974
you have to drop a one-ton bomb
on a house

885
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:19,686
surrounded by homes
with families and children.

886
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,022
That can't be moral,

887
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,858
it's ineffective militarily

888
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,612
and it's certainly not humane.

889
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:31,197
Is it just? Not that either.

890
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:35,785
There's a concept, "the banality of evil."

891
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:43,168
When you start doing it en masse,
200, 300 people die

892
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:47,714
because of the idea
of "targeted assassinations."

893
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:52,552
Suddenly the processes become
a kind of conveyor belt.

894
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:55,889
You ask yourself
less and less where to stop.

895
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:05,148
September 6, 2003, was, for me,
my toughest day as head of the Shin Bet.

896
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:09,319
On that day the State of Israel had

897
01:23:09,527 --> 01:23:16,201
a chance to get rid of the biggest
terrorist group

898
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:17,410
in a single blow.

899
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:22,332
<i>We had very reliable and precise intel</i>

900
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,710
<i>that the Hamas leadership
was going to hold a meeting</i>

901
01:23:25,794 --> 01:23:28,672
<i>like they never had before,
and probably never will.</i>

902
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:31,925
I think there were
ten or twelve people there,

903
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:39,933
but the créme de la créme,
the merde <i>de</i> Ia merde.

904
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,685
Really... everyone was there.

905
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:52,445
<i>Suddenly I was told,
"Listen, the army is opposed.</i>

906
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,949
"A one-ton bomb
would cause collateral damage."

907
01:23:56,408 --> 01:24:00,745
There was a bitter argument.
Finally, after several hours,

908
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:04,290
the Prime Minister was convinced
to cancel the attack.

909
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:11,214
<i>I called the Prime Minister
to convince him that it's unreasonable.</i>

910
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,467
The compromise was a quarter-ton.

911
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:18,763
It was based on probabilities.

912
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,640
<i>The house had two stories.</i>

913
01:24:20,724 --> 01:24:25,645
<i>If they were on the second floor,
it would kill them.</i>

914
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:30,108
<i>If they were on the first floor,
it wouldn't kill anyone.</i>

915
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:35,947
<i>The bomb was dropped.</i>

916
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:38,158
<i>It was a direct hit.</i>

917
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:40,577
<i>The second story was destroyed</i>

918
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:45,457
and the entire "Dream Team" fled
the house on their own two feet.

919
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:48,460
Some people insist they saw
crippled Sheikh Yassin running.

920
01:25:06,561 --> 01:25:11,816
If there's a moment you realize,

921
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:16,529
not that we missed,
but that we were mistaken,

922
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:23,286
because of what happened
with Salah Shehadeh,

923
01:25:23,495 --> 01:25:25,997
we paid the price with the "Dream Team."

924
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:32,545
it took a long time to get to
some of the people there,

925
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:34,881
like Sheikh Yassin and others.

926
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:38,551
God knows how much
damage they caused

927
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:42,055
until we managed
to take out the ones we did.

928
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:46,142
Some of them were never taken out
and are still active today.

929
01:25:58,446 --> 01:26:03,535
I've often said,
"Terror is a barrel with a bottom."

930
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,288
You can reach the bottom.
You don't need to reach the last terrorist.

931
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:11,251
You reach a critical mass,
and that's enough of a deterrent.

932
01:26:19,384 --> 01:26:24,138
<i>I can prove to you that Hamas
did not become more moderate</i>

933
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:26,057
<i>after Sheikh Yassin was eliminated.</i>

934
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:30,937
<i>I can prove to you</i>

935
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:35,275
that when we killed Abbas Musawi
and Nasrallah took over instead,

936
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:38,862
the security situation in Israel
didn't really improve.

937
01:26:38,987 --> 01:26:44,409
That's why, when we deal, not with
the one coming to kill us immediately,

938
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:46,327
but with the person preaching,

939
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:52,750
we are headed toward a place, which
is forbidden by international law

940
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:58,047
and basicjustice poses huge
question marks as to its ethics,

941
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:00,592
but I'm talking to you
as head of the Shin Bet.

942
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:01,634
It's ineffective.

943
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,668
<i>I was born near the Sea of Galilee.</i>

944
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:38,087
<i>I grew up in a children's house,</i>

945
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:42,175
<i>like all children who lived
on kibbutzim did back then.</i>

946
01:27:43,635 --> 01:27:45,094
<i>I had a wonderful childhood.</i>

947
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:52,185
I knew that there's a house in Jerusalem

948
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:54,979
and on the second floor
there's a long corridor.

949
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,398
At the end of the corridor, there's a door

950
01:27:57,482 --> 01:28:02,278
and behind the door is a wise man
who makes decisions.

951
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:03,529
He thinks.

952
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,699
<i>My parents called him
the "Old Man," Ben-Gurlon.</i>

953
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:12,830
<i>Years later, after the Yom Kippur War,</i>

954
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:17,001
I went to Jerusalem,
and I went to that same building.

955
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:19,253
I was on the second floor

956
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:21,506
and found no door
at the end of the corridor

957
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:25,301
and behind the missing door,
no one was thinking for me.

958
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:56,833
You see that void, that lack of initiative,

959
01:28:56,916 --> 01:29:00,712
that willingness to let things
take their course,

960
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:05,508
without you stepping in and saying,

961
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:08,219
"This is as far as it goes,
in this direction or that."

962
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:12,682
You can't make peace
using military means.

963
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:18,730
Peace must be built
on a system of trust,

964
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:21,357
after, or without using military means.

965
01:29:21,441 --> 01:29:23,735
In the end you must build it
on a system of trust.

966
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,448
As someone who knows
the Palestinians well, I claim that

967
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:31,284
there should be no problem

968
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:33,870
building a system of trust with them,
a genuine one.

969
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:38,750
For Israel, it's too much of a luxury
not to speak with our enemies.

970
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:43,046
As long as they decide not to
speak to us, I have no choice,

971
01:29:43,129 --> 01:29:46,382
but when we decide not to speak,
I think we're making a mistake.

972
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,968
Do you support speaking to anyone?

973
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:54,724
Anyone we can, even if they answer rudely,
I'm for continuing.

974
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,312
There is no alternative.

975
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:01,397
- To what?
- To talking.

976
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:06,611
- Hamas? Islamic Jihad...
-including everyone.

977
01:30:06,694 --> 01:30:09,322
I said everyone, so it includes...

978
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:16,079
Even Ahmadinejad, whoever.
I'm always for it.

979
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:20,625
It's a trait of a professional intelligence
operative to talk to everyone.

980
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,960
Things get clarified.

981
01:30:24,212 --> 01:30:28,424
I see you don't eat glass.
He sees I don't drink petrol.

982
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:30,176
That's how it is.

983
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:33,721
<i>I want to read something that</i>

984
01:30:33,805 --> 01:30:38,351
<i>Professor Leibowitz,
a critic of the Occupation,</i>

985
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:41,187
<i>wrote a year after
the Six Day War, in 1968.</i>

986
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:46,109
<i>"A state ruling over a hostile
population of one million foreigners</i>

987
01:30:46,192 --> 01:30:48,069
"will necessarily become
a Shin Bet state,

988
01:30:48,152 --> 01:30:50,988
"with all that this implies for education,

989
01:30:51,072 --> 01:30:52,990
"freedom of speech and thought

990
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:54,700
"and democracy.

991
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,787
<i>"The corruption found
in every colonial regime</i>

992
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,664
<i>"will affix itself to the State of Israel.</i>

993
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:03,835
<i>"The administration will have to
suppress an Arab uprising on one hand</i>

994
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:07,880
<i>"and acquire Quislings,
or Arab traitors, on the other."</i>

995
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:13,302
What do you think about this prediction,
given where Israel is today?

996
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,472
I agree with every word he wrote.

997
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:22,311
- Explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

998
01:31:22,395 --> 01:31:25,731
Every word he said is etched in stone.

999
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,068
Is that what Israeli society is like today?

1000
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:33,447
I think it's an accurate depiction
of the reality that emerged

1001
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:35,908
from 1968 until today.

1002
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:39,203
I wouldn't say that
it became a Shin Bet state,

1003
01:31:39,287 --> 01:31:45,668
but no doubt, our current
situation with the Palestinians

1004
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:49,338
undoubtedly created
a reality that is very similar

1005
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:53,426
to what Leibowitz wrote.

1006
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:19,428
<i>You knock on doors
in the middle of the night</i>

1007
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:23,015
<i>and wake a sleeping family,
all cuddled up in bed.</i>

1008
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:27,019
<i>The mother's tears</i>

1009
01:33:27,103 --> 01:33:32,775
<i>or the last goodbyes of the suspect
you take from his family's embrace...</i>

1010
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:38,322
It's not easy.
You see the family suffering,

1011
01:33:38,406 --> 01:33:42,285
those difficult moments between
parents and children,

1012
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,953
between children and parents.

1013
01:33:46,122 --> 01:33:51,210
These moments end up
etched deep inside you

1014
01:33:51,377 --> 01:33:56,340
and when you retire
you become a bit of a leftist.

1015
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:26,162
We are making the lives of
millions unbearable,

1016
01:34:26,245 --> 01:34:28,539
into prolonged human suffering.

1017
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:33,419
We leave the decision about
what's appropriate

1018
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:37,715
to a soldier who's spent
a few months in the army.

1019
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:42,720
A year earlier he finished
high school, at best.

1020
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:45,890
He's standing there facing
a father holding his baby girl

1021
01:34:45,973 --> 01:34:51,687
deciding, does he search him or not,
does he let him pass or not.

1022
01:34:53,356 --> 01:34:55,066
It kills me.

1023
01:34:56,359 --> 01:35:00,029
The future is bleak.
It's dark, the future.

1024
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:05,951
Where does it lead? To a change
in the people's character

1025
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:13,250
because if you put most of
our young people in the army,

1026
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:18,798
they'll see a paradox.

1027
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:24,845
They'll see that it strives
to be a people's army,

1028
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:29,100
like the Nahal unit,
involved in building up the country.

1029
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:32,061
On the other hand,
it's a brutal occupation force,

1030
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:35,981
similar to the Germans in World War II.

1031
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:39,360
Similar, not identical.

1032
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:44,073
And I'm not talking about
their behavior toward the Jews.

1033
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:48,244
That was exceptional,
with its own particular characteristics.

1034
01:35:48,327 --> 01:35:53,749
I mean how they acted to
the Poles, the Belgians, the Dutch...

1035
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:57,670
To all of them... The Czechs.

1036
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:05,177
It's a very negative trait
that we acquired,

1037
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:11,851
to be... I'm afraid to say it, so I won't.

1038
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:18,357
We've become cruel,

1039
01:36:18,983 --> 01:36:20,734
to ourselves as well,

1040
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:25,448
but mainly to the occupied population,

1041
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:32,830
using the excuse of the war against terror.

1042
01:36:33,164 --> 01:36:36,959
Clausewitz, who was wise
even though he wasn't Jewish,

1043
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:40,337
or at least we haven't
discovered his Jewish roots,

1044
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:44,216
said almost 200 years ago...

1045
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:48,888
I'm translating,
but the essence of what he said is,

1046
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:55,352
"Victory is simply the creation
of a better political reality."

1047
01:36:55,895 --> 01:36:56,854
That's victory.

1048
01:36:56,937 --> 01:37:01,901
Victory doesn't dictate that
we have to conquer Gaza

1049
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:05,070
or Ramallah or Nablus or Hebron.

1050
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:10,242
I think my son, who served
for three years in the paratroopers,

1051
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:15,581
participated in the conquest
of Nablus at least two or three times.

1052
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:21,337
Did it bring us victory?
I don't think so.

1053
01:37:22,588 --> 01:37:28,636
Did it create a better political reality?

1054
01:37:30,221 --> 01:37:34,725
The tragedy of Israel's
public security debate

1055
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:40,231
is that we don't realize that
we face a frustrating situation

1056
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,942
in which we win every battle,

1057
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,110
but we lose the war.
