00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,895
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things you need to know.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,539
I have nothing to do
with Alexei Volkoff.

4
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,643
- Then why does he pay for the manor?
- Because I'm his daughter.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,678
- My father never gave me any key.
- Yes, sweetheart, he did.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,874
When you were young,
a token of his affection.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,315
Your whole life
your father's been grooming you.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,422
You are his succession plan.

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,025
I give up.

10
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,258
Strange reaction.

11
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,129
Most people show
a bit more enthusiasm...

12
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,069
...when they receive a gift.

13
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,303
- Sorry, who are you?
- My name is Riley.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,209
I'm your father's lawyer.

15
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,044
Your father...

16
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,377
...left a letter for you.

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,920
"My dearest daughter Vivian...

18
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,563
...as you know,
I've met an untimely demise..."

19
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,495
Sorry.

20
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,226
What are you doing?

21
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:47,103
Well, he specified
that I read the letter in his voice.

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,935
He thought it would
make you feel comfortable.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,134
Please, stop.

24
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,940
I spent several weeks perfecting this.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,948
But fine.

26
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,519
"I'm sorry
I was never much of a father.

27
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,257
If I could do it over again,
I would trade my entire empire...

28
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,292
...for another moment with you.

29
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,358
But we can't relive the past...

30
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,993
...which is why I have groomed you
for the future.

31
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:24,007
That card in my safe will help you
rebuild Volkoff Industries."

32
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,611
Mr. Riley,
I'm well aware that my father...

33
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:31,113
...now wants me to take over
his evil corporation.

34
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,018
So how can I say no?

35
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,012
No.

36
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,354
- Nobody ever said no to your father.
- Then I'll be the first to do it.

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,652
I'm sorry...

38
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,922
...I can't allow that.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,330
Now, perhaps
you'd like to rethink your answer.

40
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,802
Hmm?

41
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,188
Okay, roses or orchids?

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:16,021
Uh... I don't know. Roses?
What do you think?

43
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,760
I think that flowers can really
set the tone of a wedding.

44
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,663
You know, roses are beautiful,
they're classic, they're passionate.

45
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,101
- Not very whimsical.
- And that's good?

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,968
If that's what you want.

47
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,406
Uh, okay, well...

48
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,012
Orchids?

49
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,040
Sorry. Sarah.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm sorry, I just... I don't have
a strong feeling either way.

51
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,580
I just don't think I'm cut out for this.
What if you just make the choices?

52
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,089
Okay, you know what?

53
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,627
Maybe this girly stuff
is a little outside your comfort zone.

54
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,628
I will tell you that at some point...

55
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,428
...every bride feels a little overwhelmed
with this stuff. I totally did.

56
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,037
But there was a moment
where that all changed.

57
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,140
I remember I had gone to pick up
our wedding bands...

58
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:07,905
...and I finally held them in my hands
and it all just became so real.

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,575
I was getting married to the man
that I love, for the rest of my life.

60
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,587
And then I just broke down crying,
which sounds ridiculous right now.

61
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,420
- Yeah, a little.
- A lot. But it was a turning point.

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,429
You know, from that moment on,
everything became magical.

63
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,965
It was my wedding.

64
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,736
I don't know when,
I don't know where...

65
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,271
...but I promise you,
it's gonna happen to you.

66
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,811
You know what? New apartment,
I'm gonna go no television.

67
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,315
It'll be very liberating.

68
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,016
Kidding. I'm totally kidding.
Seventy-two inches, dude. Bam.

69
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,286
I was honestly about
to smack you right now.

70
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,197
So how's the apartment hunting going,
anyway?

71
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,199
It's, uh... Pbbt. Oh, man,
it couldn't be going better.

72
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,098
I found a place. A little pricey.

73
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,263
- So I'm looking for a roommate.
- That shouldn't be a problem.

74
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,639
I hope not. And in the meantime,
it's kind of nice being at my mom's.

75
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,873
- Buddy, I gotta say, I'm a little relieved.
- Chuck, this is needed on my part, okay?

76
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:22,544
I am growing mentally and emotionally,
physically... Not so much physically.

77
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,657
But some people are saying
that I'm acting taller.

78
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,723
Uh, I gotta get down to Castle.

79
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:34,526
Buddy, I'm so glad that everything's
going so well. You're killing it.

80
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,293
Have a great day. Talk to you soon.

81
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,906
Hey, son. You sleep okay last night?

82
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,976
No. No, I did not.

83
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,645
Those cats outside the window
are so loud. They gave me nightmares.

84
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,250
Yeah, cats.

85
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,821
Just a heads up. Those cats
are having a romantic dinner tonight.

86
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,357
And there might be more cat fighting
after dinner ends.

87
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,051
Unless your mom eats too much.

88
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,528
Listen, I don't wanna think about you
and my Mom doing...

89
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,758
Making a... Slipping and...

90
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,835
Son, when you move into the forest...

91
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,166
...you can't complain that the wildlife
is making too much noise.

92
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,837
It's only natural. And beautiful.
And frequent.

93
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,037
- I need my own place.
- Yes, you do.

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,912
You went to Volkoff's headquarters
and you were attacked?

95
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,950
Yes. I shouldn't have gone to Moscow.

96
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,351
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- It's okay. You're safe here.

97
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,016
Now, this man Riley, he wants you
to rebuild your father's empire?

98
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,857
Yes. But I told him I don't want anything
to do with my father.

99
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,797
Did he happen to say what his plan
for rebuilding Volkoff was?

100
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,730
I think this may have something
to do with it.

101
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,948
We need to talk to Beckman.

102
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,483
So Volkoff has all of his money
in the First Bank of Macau.

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,052
- We need to freeze those funds.
- We do.

104
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,055
But the First Bank of Macau
is no easy target.

105
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,989
It's really operated
by the Guan Yi Crime Syndicate.

106
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,325
The guards are mercenaries.
We've lost agents inside of there before.

107
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,265
But we've never had
an account holder working with us.

108
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,168
That makes Vivian the perfect asset.
With her help, we'll be able...

109
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,503
...to get through the bank's security
and access her father's accounts.

110
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,009
Um, general, I'm not so sure...

111
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,844
...that Vivian is really built
for this sort of mission, you know.

112
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,782
Not to mention the fact that...

113
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,253
...she was pretty clear about
never wanting to see her father again.

114
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,258
Well, it's your job to change all that.
You're a spy, she's an asset.

115
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,990
If this mission is going to work,
you need to turn that girl into a Volkoff.

116
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,511
Fabulously bearded man...

117
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,672
...seeks roommate ASAP.

118
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,812
No, Morgan, don't lead with the beard.
Let it be a pleasant surprise.

119
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,683
Morgan.

120
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,687
Hey, buddy. You look sharp.

121
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,225
Listen,
you're obviously a worldly fellow.

122
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,387
I was wondering if you could settle
a little debate betwixt us.

123
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,897
Where do you think
would be the best place to meet ladies?

124
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,731
A Renaissance Faire, right?
Or a methadone clinic?

125
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,666
- It's okay if the ladies are really ugly.
- Really? I don't... A Renaissance Faire.

126
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,903
Okay. Interesting.
Can we have two weeks off...

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,742
...to go a Renaissance Faire?
- Not a chance.

128
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,748
- See?
- I don't have time to discuss it.

129
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,353
I'm in the middle
of a housing crisis now.

130
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,455
Really? Dude. Dude?

131
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,387
We have an extra room
in our apartment-slash-van.

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,793
So how about this, a place to stay
in exchange for, say, one week off?

133
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,364
- Hmm.
- Uh?

134
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,695
No.

135
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,236
Manager to Register 7, please.

136
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,873
Okay, I'm not... I'm done here.

137
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,975
Thank you for the offer
but no thank you.

138
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,043
"Slash-van."

139
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,701
See yourselves out, please.

140
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,513
He's a heartbreaker, a soul crusher.

141
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,083
I'm gonna pin that guy down
and shave his beard.

142
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,483
Looks like Morgan's potential
roommates are meeting him here.

143
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,390
If Morgan won't let us go
to the Renaissance Faire...

144
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,226
...we'll bring the Renaissance Faire
to us.

145
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,164
I have no idea
what you're doing right now.

146
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,669
So you want me to help you
break into my father's bank.

147
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,899
Absolutely not.

148
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,442
I've had way too many guns
pointed at me recently.

149
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,773
We'll be there to protect you
the entire time.

150
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,246
Look, most years,
I saw my father maybe once.

151
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,783
The longest conversation
we've had is 10 minutes.

152
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,854
I get that, I do.
Believe me, I understand.

153
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,423
Your father was a criminal mastermind
who forgot your birthdays too?

154
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,151
No.

155
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,259
But he did leave me
when I was 13 years old.

156
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,430
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

157
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,938
All I ever wanted to do
was ask him the same questions...

158
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,597
...that I know are swirling around
in your head now.

159
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:47,474
Why'd you leave? Why didn't you ever
even make an attempt to contact me?

160
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,640
- Did you ever get to ask him?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,809
And I learned that even though
my father wasn't around...

162
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,821
...it didn't mean
he wasn't thinking about me.

163
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,218
Look,
I don't know what you'll find out...

164
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,726
...but I can guarantee you
that if you help us...

165
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:08,196
...we can help you find at least some
of the answers that you're looking for.

166
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,301
When the thugs running the bank
meet Volkoff's daughter...

167
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,906
...they're gonna be expecting
someone intimidating.

168
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,839
And your current outfit
doesn't really scream "bad guy."

169
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,071
I wasn't planning on infiltrating a bank
when I got dressed this morning.

170
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,808
Well, we can fix that. Smile.

171
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,652
It's kind of like J. Crew for spies.

172
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,388
Wow.

173
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:44,002
Yeah. It's also got some really cool
makeover features that are built in...

174
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,698
...in case you wanna do a full...
Not that I've ever... Anyway...

175
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,037
Go ahead, try it on.

176
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,946
So meet me in the armory
when she's done.

177
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,747
Yeah. One sec, though,
I wanna show you something.

178
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,227
- What do you think?
- It's a little formal for a bank job.

179
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,454
You're right,
it is formal for a bank job.

180
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,292
What do you think of it,
I don't know, for our wedding?

181
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,732
Oh. Oh, the wedding. Yeah.
Yeah, you'll look great in that.

182
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,064
Very, very handsome.

183
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,140
What's going on? What's wrong?
Something's wrong with you.

184
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,972
- Because you love me in a black tie.
- It's just that this is not my thing...

185
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,943
...and I feel like
I'm letting you guys down.

186
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,744
You're not letting anybody down.

187
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,719
- Was that Casey?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,750
Casey. Hey. Casey.
Yo, what's going on?

189
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,622
Nothing. Just getting a Hot Pocket.

190
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,632
Love me some Fiesta Chicken, huh?
The way the cheese and the chicken...?

191
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,167
We haven't seen you for a while.
You okay?

192
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,135
I'm fine. Let's hook up later.
We'll get facials and chat.

193
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,434
We're shipping out in a few hours.
Don't you need to get ready?

194
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,137
Actually, Beckman has me
working on a mission of my own.

195
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,141
- What mission would that be exactly?
- Can't really talk about it. Sorry.

196
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:10,152
But I hear you guys are hitting
the First Bank of Macau.

197
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,481
Be careful.

198
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm here to heed your call
for a roommate.

199
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,136
I know, it's intimidating
to be in the presence of a king.

200
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,106
You'll get used to it.

201
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,505
Oh, also, I do dishes.

202
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,510
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me about yourself?

203
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,376
Well, my parents died in the plague.

204
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,516
Okay. Um...

205
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,386
- Do you have any pets?
- No, no pets.

206
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,217
I'm not a big pet guy.

207
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,450
- Good to know.
- I like to work in leather.

208
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,390
You are gonna go down
on the top of the...

209
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,121
You may kiss the ring.

210
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,022
Okay.

211
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,761
Okay.

212
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,900
How...? Look, I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

213
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,670
I don't believe you're here
for the same ad that I put out.

214
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,714
I don't know what ad you're talking about
but the Buy More's a delicate cover.

215
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,680
You need to shut down this now.

216
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,251
I have no idea what happened.

217
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,379
I put out a simple ad to find a roommate
and all these weirdoes start showing up.

218
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:23,594
- Go, go, go.
- Go, weirdo, go. Go, weirdo, go.

219
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,790
Got it.
Those idiots messed with my post.

220
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,995
Good luck getting a roommate now.
Perfect.

221
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,838
Wait a minute. I got it.
Casey, you have an extra room.

222
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,773
- Not even worth saying.
- Think about the possi...

223
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,243
Think about the...

224
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,886
Vivian, remember,
this place is highly dangerous.

225
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,752
You need to act like, well, your father.

226
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,418
- Chuck will pose as your bodyguard.
- I'll be your very own Kevin Costner.

227
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,087
You'll present
your account card to the bank manager.

228
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,895
He will lead you to the vaults.
Remember, the vault is highly restricted.

229
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,369
Once in the vault, you're gonna have to
pass a pretty rigid verification process.

230
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,976
I'm not good with tests.
What happens if I don't pass it?

231
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,042
Just, you know, pass. You'll be fine.

232
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,275
If you're ever at a loss, just look to me,
I'll be right there.

233
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,975
Stay close.

234
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,488
May I help you? I'm sorry,
we aren't accepting any new accounts.

235
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,998
Miss Volkoff
is already an account holder.

236
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,736
Miss Volkoff?

237
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,931
I wasn't aware
this account had changed hands.

238
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,807
Please come with me.

239
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,285
Account holders only.

240
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,324
I am her Kevin Cost... Bodyguard.
I am her bodyguard.

241
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,659
It's okay.

242
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,832
We'll find another way to the account.
I'm getting you out.

243
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,800
You said this might be my only way
to learn about my dad.

244
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,600
- Yeah.
- Then I'm doing it.

245
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,594
We've run into a kink in the plan. Security
stopped me from following Vivian.

246
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,096
- Okay, which way did they take her?
- Main staircase.

247
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:45,635
Okay, there are emergency stairs
across the lobby, east wall.

248
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,204
That should take you up
to the vault level.

249
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,039
I'm gonna need a key card.

250
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,138
Time to be a spy.

251
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,781
Hi, big fella. Sorry about that earlier.
Little security faux pas.

252
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:04,150
I know because we're both in the biz.
You know, the "security biz."

253
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,154
My real concern
is just for Miss Volkoff's safety.

254
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,987
How do we know she's properly
protected in that vault?

255
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,754
- She's safe.
- So you say.

256
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,057
And I wanna believe you, I really do.

257
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,064
But what if someone were to break in?

258
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,329
Perhaps, oh, I don't know,
a kung fu master?

259
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,135
A little bit of this? Or one of these?
How about swooping it and pushing it?

260
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,111
Okay. I believe you. I get it.

261
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,908
Point taken. Point taken.

262
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,779
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- I'm a believer.

263
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,282
- Sarah, I'm in.
- Oh, good. Okay.

264
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,154
- Where are we?
- The vault level, Miss Volkoff.

265
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,162
Follow me.

266
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,304
- What's going on?
- Standard security procedure.

267
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,310
Place your hand there, on the table.

268
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,485
Sorry. Please step back.

269
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,159
We needed a DNA sample to make sure
you are who you say you are.

270
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,456
There should be no problem
as long as you're telling the truth...

271
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,862
...and no one has removed you
from your father's account.

272
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,684
Sarah, I'm on the vault level.
No sign of Vivian.

273
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,081
Copy.

274
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,882
There should be a junction
in the hallway to your east.

275
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,820
Copy. Moving east.

276
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,051
Oh, no.

277
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,753
- Stepping back. What?
- No, it's not you. You're fine.

278
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,092
I just got a text from your sister.
She wants to go cake tasting.

279
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,859
Cake tasting. How awful.

280
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,035
Okay, you should see
two doors up ahead of you.

281
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,207
Yep. Heading toward them now,
but don't change the subject.

282
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,948
Look, I know that this wedding stuff
is supposed to be really fun...

283
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,847
...but I just find it
a little overwhelming.

284
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,750
You know, the cake and the flowers
and the venue and...

285
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,187
Maybe it would be
a little less overwhelming...

286
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,294
...if you would just pick one thing
to get excited about...

287
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,725
...ease your way in.

288
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,579
Sarah, I just flashed.

289
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,814
They have servers here, stolen
from the Chinese army a year ago.

290
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,218
What are they using them for?

291
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,384
I have no idea, but a bank
wouldn't use military-grade tech...

292
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,156
...unless they were
up to something serious.

293
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,430
Please state your full name.

294
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,409
Vivian McArthur Volkoff.

295
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,307
What business
would you like to transact?

296
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,473
I would like to access
my father's account.

297
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,613
Are you working
with a law-enforcement agency?

298
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,590
No.

299
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,330
Vivian Volkoff...

300
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,336
...you have...

301
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,371
...passed our test.

302
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,375
The account is yours.
Sorry for all of our extreme measures.

303
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,213
You'll find subsequent visits
to be significantly less invasive.

304
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,117
Here.

305
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,521
Your father's safe-deposit box.

306
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,022
This was all he kept at this bank?

307
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:08,189
Your father once told me this contained
his most prized possessions.

308
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,153
What are you doing down here?

309
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,847
You guys sure hide the ATMs
around here, don't you?

310
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,255
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing I can't handle.

311
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,562
I spoke too soon. I can't handle it.
I need help.

312
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,755
I'm on my way.

313
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,768
I'm afraid there's been
a small problem.

314
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,139
Your bodyguard was found
in a secure area.

315
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,175
I am so sorry, Miss Volkoff.

316
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,652
Were you trying to steal?

317
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,400
I trusted you.

318
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,530
This is what you do to me?
To my reputation?

319
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,265
Please, Miss Volkoff.
This isn't necessary.

320
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,569
This isn't your concern.
You haven't been lied to like I have.

321
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:32,249
What I mean is, there is no need
to do this on bank property. Yes?

322
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,632
I'll take him from here. Thank you.

323
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,462
You can hand him over
to my head of security.

324
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,004
Vivian's getting pretty good at this,
isn't she?

325
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,976
Miss Volkoff.

326
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,446
I'll admit I didn't see
the family resemblance at first.

327
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,588
But now I see your father in you.

328
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,189
So there's no way these things
could be a clue...

329
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,458
...to where your father hid his funds?
- No.

330
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,263
I mean,
these are all just pictures of me.

331
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,639
So nothing on Volkoff's money.
Looks like we hit a dead end.

332
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,972
Unless Langley uncovers something
about those servers that you saw.

333
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,275
Excuse me.

334
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,220
It's crazy. I mean,
I barely ever knew my father...

335
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,722
...and now I discover that he's been
watching me this whole time.

336
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,292
- I feel like I deserve some answers.
- You do.

337
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,694
At least you got to talk to your father.
I'm never going to be able to do that.

338
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,127
Maybe you will.

339
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,497
I thought the CIA
had him locked up somewhere.

340
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,935
Yeah. But I am the CIA.

341
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,066
I can ask around,
see if we can set up a meeting.

342
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,542
- Are you serious?
- I know what you're going through. I do.

343
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:13,174
If you really wanna talk to your father,
I can do everything that I...

344
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,718
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,493
Hey. So, what's the wedding epiphany?

346
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,153
I just realized we have been going
about this wedding planning all wrong.

347
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,355
- We have?
- Yes.

348
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,558
You don't build a wedding around
flowers or the cake or food.

349
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,498
What do you build
the wedding around?

350
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,572
Uh, the weather?

351
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:40,043
The dress, Sarah.
You build the wedding around the dress.

352
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,340
I know you're not the typical
wedding-dress girl, but I thought...

353
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,881
- It seems like it could be fun.
- Really?

354
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:50,283
Yeah. I've been looking for a way to ease
into this, and I think this might be it.

355
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,787
In fact, I'm gonna
go do some research right now.

356
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,758
Okay.

357
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,434
Oh, God.

358
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,137
No.

359
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,438
Maybe.

360
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,635
Oh, my God.

361
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,171
It's perfect.

362
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,990
We're getting married.

363
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,360
Oh, my God.

364
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,829
We're getting married?

365
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,702
- Pretty dress.
- I know.

366
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:57,103
Might wanna get a new one, though.
Looks like this one's been on a mission.

367
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,057
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa.

368
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,520
I know what you two did to my ad.

369
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,192
And guess what? You owe me.

370
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,861
We owe you? You owe us.

371
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,494
You would be nothing without us.
You get that?

372
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,902
Look, I just need a place
to stay for tonight.

373
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,508
- And you said you had the room.
- Sorry, friend-o.

374
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,144
Vacancy's been filled.

375
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:32,378
- Really?
- Come. Let us adjourn to our castle.

376
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,043
Can you believe
we get to live with a king?

377
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:41,219
This is gonna score us
some serious Ren-tang.

378
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,233
We've just heard back from Langley.

379
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,965
Using the stolen servers,
the bank is turning itself...

380
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,233
...into a black market stock exchange...

381
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,811
...laundering money for criminals,
terrorists, and rogue nations.

382
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,881
If we could access those,
that intelligence would be priceless.

383
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,315
Exactly, Agent Walker.
Which is why we still need Miss Volkoff.

384
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,750
As an account holder,
she can enter the bank...

385
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,618
...and manually upload
a digital tag to their network.

386
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,693
Bartowski, do you think
you can get the asset to do that?

387
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,460
Yes, yes, I think I can, but we might have
to give her something in return.

388
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,793
She would like a meeting
with her father.

389
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,329
A meeting? With Alexei Volkoff?

390
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,599
After all she's been through,
don't you think we owe her that much?

391
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,772
- Fine. I'll set it up.
- Thank you, general.

392
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,181
There is one more thing.
In order to keep the bank from realizing...

393
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,947
...what Miss Volkoff is doing,
we'll need a diversion.

394
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,488
What did you have in mind?

395
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,491
Gear up.
You two are going to rob a bank.

396
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,432
So it comes down to this.

397
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,823
Buy More? Why would there be
a facility at the Buy More?

398
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,329
They got facilities
like you wouldn't believe.

399
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,560
I've seen everything,
nothing surprises me.

400
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,506
The only other TR-476
I'd installed before was in Langley.

401
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,835
So why here in Burbank?

402
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,741
If it's above my clearance, I don't ask
questions. Neither should you, Todd.

403
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,041
- Just making conversation.
- Don't.

404
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,249
No, it's just maintenance, I believe,
over here in Sector 7G.

405
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,695
Sir.

406
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,061
Hi.

407
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,707
- Casey.
- What are you doing here, Grimes?

408
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:49,040
Nothing. Nothing. I was...
I needed a place to stay, as you know...

409
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,705
...so I thought I could
just crash here for tonight.

410
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,310
- What did you see?
- I don't have very good eyesight.

411
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,616
I thought they were installing DirecTV
or something because they were...

412
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,622
There was some... Nothing. I should go.

413
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,990
I'll sleep under my desk at Buy More.
It's probably more comfortable.

414
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,427
If you could point me
in the right direction...

415
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,363
John... Yeah, oh, you're still there.
Okay.

416
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,641
- We are delighted to see you again.
- Thank you so much.

417
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,746
I'm glad you were able to accommodate
me at such a late hour.

418
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,905
Our clientele demands
constant access.

419
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,450
Okay, she's in. You ready to do this?

420
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,186
- What are you doing?
- What? We're robbing a bank, right?

421
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,850
- You packed them, I thought...
- In case we had the chance to go out later.

422
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,192
- Take them off. You'll wreck them.
- Sorry.

423
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,424
That's better.

424
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,165
Now...

425
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,004
...let's go rob a bank.

426
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,847
Take as much time as you need.

427
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,217
Just let him know
when you want to leave.

428
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,752
Ma'am, wait here, please.

429
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,128
- Drop it now!
- This is a robbery!

430
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,897
Everybody stay down!

431
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,418
Miss Volkoff, may I come in?

432
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,615
The CIA is not on your side, you know.

433
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,989
You're simply an asset to them,
they've been using you.

434
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,391
No, it's not true.

435
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,829
Did one of them
seem to understand you...

436
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,128
...you know,
what you're going through?

437
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:03,239
And did he use that connection
to get you to help him?

438
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,108
And was it this one?

439
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,645
Yeah, this is Charles Carmichael.

440
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,650
He's the agent responsible
for putting your father in jail.

441
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,650
Keep filling those bags, people.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

442
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,124
- Having fun?
- A little.

443
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,492
- Takes your mind off the wedding.
- Actually, it hasn't been so bad.

444
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,463
I took you up on your advice,
and I found a dress.

445
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,659
- Hey.
- Ellie was right.

446
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,804
When I put it on, it felt like magic.

447
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,940
Get down on the ground
before I blow your freaking head off!

448
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,009
I'm so glad you found a dress.
I bet you look gorgeous in it.

449
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,113
Don't be a hero, my friend!
I will break your face!

450
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:48,617
It's actually really pretty. I never thought
I would say this, but I felt like a princess.

451
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:54,317
- Mr. Riley, my father is a criminal.
- That's what they call him.

452
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,153
You saw what your father left for you
here at the bank.

453
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,531
He loves you, you know?

454
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,334
The CIA has used you.
You know that, right?

455
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,734
Chuck promised
I would get to meet my father.

456
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,401
No, you're not gonna get
to see your father...

457
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,979
...because they don't want you to.

458
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,484
There's only one way that you can
truly learn about your father.

459
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,815
When you're ready...

460
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,516
...you let me know.

461
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,733
Oh.

462
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,364
You left this in your father's office.

463
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,211
Thought you might like to have it.

464
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,059
- Don't shoot. I'm unarmed.
- Get down here.

465
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,751
Come on, come on.
It's about that time, honey bunny.

466
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,092
Nobody follow, we have a hostage.
Keep walking.

467
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,292
No one shoot. She's a Volkoff.

468
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:17,298
Thank you, Bank of Macau. It's been
a pleasure doing business with you.

469
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,190
Mission accomplished.

470
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,259
Hey, you did great in there.

471
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,802
Thanks.

472
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,799
Everything all right?

473
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,701
Yeah. Everything's fine.

474
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,806
Okay.

475
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,923
You successfully planted the tracer
in the First Bank of Macau's servers...

476
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,963
...and made the break-in
look like a legitimate robbery.

477
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:19,466
The digital tag is already leading us to
terrorist organizations around the globe.

478
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,299
- Good work, team.
- Uh, general, sorry.

479
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,533
About the deal that we made with Vivian.
When does she get to see Volkoff?

480
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,441
Yes. After some consideration...

481
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,606
...we have decided the security risks
are too great. I'm sorry.

482
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:33,807
No, no, no.

483
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,449
I promised her
she'd be able to see her father.

484
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,284
- What am I supposed to tell her now?
- Agent Bartowski...

485
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,722
...you told your asset
what she needed to hear.

486
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,794
That's what a spy does. Well done.

487
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,961
Do you need my help telling her?

488
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,400
No.

489
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,403
Thanks, though.

490
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,603
She trusted me. I'll do it.

491
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:08,274
Vivian, I'm sorry, but they're not gonna
let you see your father.

492
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,283
What?

493
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,255
- What do you mean?
- They went back on their word.

494
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,950
They? The CIA?

495
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,653
- But I thought you were the CIA.
- I am.

496
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,494
It's just... It's... It's complicated.

497
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,297
I'm not giving up. I promise
I will find a way for you to see him.

498
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,202
It just might take a little while,
that's all.

499
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,603
Look, I know this is a lot
to handle right now. Are you okay?

500
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,382
I'm fine.

501
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,876
Thank you for being honest with me.

502
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,153
You told me I had to choose
between roses and orchids...

503
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,956
...but that was before you showed me
Casablanca lilies.

504
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,894
- I need a hundred dozen.
- A hundred dozen? More?

505
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,228
I'm sorry. What about the cake?
Did you like the hazelnut cream...?

506
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,871
It reminded me
of this amazing patisserie in Paris.

507
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,805
I think maybe we should fly the cake in.
Definitely we should fly the cake in.

508
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,412
That sounds really expensive especially
after that dress you picked out.

509
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,207
You only get married once.
This is meant to be special.

510
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,317
Plus, it'll make Chuck really happy.

511
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,750
I should look into booking
a private island for the ceremony.

512
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,253
Yes.

513
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,151
Oh, my God.

514
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,756
Ellie, what the heck was that?

515
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,330
I think I created a monster.

516
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,268
Yeah?
Because I work at the Buy More...

517
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,374
...and that stuff sounds kind of pricey.

518
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,137
Maybe you could
just pick up a few extra shifts.

519
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,338
Or rob a bank.

520
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,041
Ha. You.

521
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,245
Oh, what's going on there,
Case Logic?

522
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,451
Case Logic? Mid-90s, held your CDs?

523
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,222
- You're clearly not a nickname guy.
- Oh, God.

524
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,888
And, well, look,
I just wanted to apologize...

525
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,795
...about, you know, snooping around.

526
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,596
I just want you to know
I just needed a place to sleep.

527
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:10,434
But between you and I, what was exactly
going down there in Castle? I mean...

528
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,666
Nothing.

529
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,441
Not very nice. Okay. Well...

530
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:21,483
Then that wasn't some weird,
mysterious door...

531
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,880
...that I saw you walking out of?

532
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,987
Look, you're right. I have no idea
what I'm even talking about.

533
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,059
There's obviously some
rational reason...

534
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,163
...you would have a TR-476
in some weird, strange room.

535
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,822
I'm just overtired.
I haven't slept, I haven't eaten.

536
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,662
I just really want a place to stay.

537
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:39,894
- Grimes?
- Yeah.

538
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,231
Are you leveraging me
to stay in my apartment?

539
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,567
I don't...

540
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,501
Am I?

541
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,237
Let's say I was. Is it working?

542
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,752
Okay. You can stay at my place
as long as you keep quiet...

543
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,115
...don't tell anyone,
especially Bartowski.

544
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,520
Casey, you have no idea how much
this means to me. Come here.

545
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:05,525
Don't get excited. I'm keeping you close
to make sure you keep your mouth shut.

546
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,321
Because if you don't...

547
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,029
...I know where you live.

548
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,361
Right, because...

549
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,463
- Scram.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

550
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:48,833
Hey, Vivian, it's Chuck and...

551
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,199
Look,
I know that you must be feeling...

552
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,341
Just give me a call
when you get a chance.

553
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,907
If you could. That'd be great.
Thanks. Bye.

554
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,434
I'm ready to learn the truth
about my father.
