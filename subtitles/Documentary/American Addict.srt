00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:47,648
AND SOMAS.

172
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:52,686
ALL PRESCRIBED AT ONE TIME.

173
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,655
AND THIS DOCTOR WAS PRESCRIBING

174
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,624
HIM MEDICATION FOR AN ILLNESS HE

175
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:00,060
DIDN'T HAVE.

176
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,294
HE KIND OF LOST HIS--HIS DRIVE.

177
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,132
YOU WANT TO SAY.

178
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,900
AND I WENT TO WORK. AND ABOUT

179
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,902
PROBABLY. LIKE, 10:00--I DON'T

180
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,938
EVEN--THE DAY IS--THE DAY IS

181
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,706
JUST A MESS FOR ME.

182
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,675
I GET A CALL. AND IT'S MY MOM.

183
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:19,246
SHE SAYS. "SOMETHING'S WRONG

184
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,415
WITH JOSEPH.

185
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,416
I WENT TO WAKE HIM UP.

186
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,786
AND THERE'S THIS STUFF COMING

187
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,754
OUT OF HIS MOUTH."

188
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,222
AND I YELLED AT MY MOM.

189
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,891
I'M LIKE. "WHY ARE YOU CALLING

190
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,225
ME?

191
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,093
WHY AREN'T YOU CALLING THE--

192
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,061
YOU KNOW. THE PARAMEDICS OR

193
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,928
SOMETHING?"

194
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,797
AND I RAN OUT OF WORK.

195
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,065
I LEFT WORK. AND I PRAYED ALL

196
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,133
THE WAY HOME. TRIED TO BARGAIN

197
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,869
WITH GOD.

198
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,203
NO BARGAINING WITH GOD.

199
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,806
I GOT HERE.

200
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,908
NO PARAMEDICS.

201
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,012
ONLY POLICE.

202
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:57,050
AND SO HE WAS GONE.

203
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,890
AND FROM WHAT THE CORONER SAYS.

204
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,493
HIS--HE ONLY TOOK ONE PILL.

205
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,962
HE TOOK ONE PILL.

206
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,799
AND HIS BODY COULDN'T

207
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,467
HANDLE IT ANYMORE.

208
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,935
AND HE WENT TO SLEEP.

209
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,769
AND HE DIDN'T WAKE UP.

210
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,105
AND I GUESS THEY FOUND OUT THAT.

211
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,807
WELL. MAYBE IT WASN'T JUST

212
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,509
MY SON.

213
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,375
MAYBE THERE'S OTHERS.

214
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,811
SO THEY STARTED DOING THEIR OWN

215
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,045
UNDERCOVER WORK.

216
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,214
THEY WENT IN THERE UNDERCOVER

217
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,381
AND HOW EASY IT IS TO WALK INTO

218
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,417
A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND SAY YOUR

219
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,853
BACK HURTS. "MY NECK HURTS,

220
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,922
MY LEG HURTS."

221
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,225
AND GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR

222
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,093
A DRUG THAT IS REALLY FOR PEOPLE

223
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,361
WITH. LIKE, CANCER OR SOMETHING

224
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,563
THAT'S VERY--YOU KNOW. A VERY

225
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,198
SEVERE ILLNESS.

226
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,501
>> OKAY. MY NAME IS SERGEANT

227
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,468
STEVE OPFERMAN FROM THE LOS

228
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,103
ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S

229
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,071
DEPARTMENT.

230
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,940
I'M ASSIGNED TO OUR DETECTIVE

231
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,107
DIVISION. MAJOR CRIMES BUREAU.

232
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,442
I SUPERVISE A MULTI-AGENCY TASK

233
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,210
FORCE CALLED HALT. WHICH IS THE

234
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,912
HEALTH AUTHORITY LAW ENFORCEMENT

235
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,113
TASK FORCE.

236
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,014
WE HANDLE OVER 100 CASES A YEAR.

237
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,450
WE CONFISCATE AND DESTROY

238
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,619
PROBABLY $3 MILLION TO

239
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,620
$5 MILLION WORTH OF CONFISCATED

240
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,488
DRUGS ANNUALLY.

241
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,190
WE'VE ESTIMATED WE'VE PROBABLY

242
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,291
SAVED THE GOVERNMENT BY

243
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,926
STOPPING. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF

244
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,127
THESE ILLEGAL BUSINESSES ABOUT

245
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,996
$50 MILLION IN MEDICARE

246
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,231
AND MEDI-CAL CLAIMS.

247
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,567
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF

248
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,634
MEDICATIONS THAT WE SEIZE FROM

249
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,636
WHAT WE CALL A CAPPER.

250
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,937
THIS IS A RECRUITER THAT WOULD

251
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,673
GO AROUND SKID ROW. AND, YOU

252
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:26,640
KNOW. FIND PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE

253
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,675
CARDS.

254
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,142
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

255
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,110
NON-CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.

256
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,612
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

257
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,479
MEDICINES THEMSELVES.

258
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,014
THERE'S A DIFFERENT BLACK

259
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,716
MARKET.

260
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,584
BUT THE DRUGS ARE INITIALLY

261
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,651
ACQUIRED BY THE SAME MEANS.

262
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,152
>> THE MAIN FOCUS BY GOVERNMENT

263
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,254
IS USUALLY ON SUPPLY.

264
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,256
IF WE REDUCE THE SUPPLY.

265
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,524
THAT REDUCES THE PROBLEM.

266
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,459
WELL. NOT TRUE.

267
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,161
IF YOU HAVE DRUG SEEKING

268
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,362
BEHAVIOR AND YOU REDUCE THE

269
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,699
SUPPLY. IT'S LIKE SQUEEZING THE

270
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,466
END OF A BALLOON.

271
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,467
IT JUST BLOWS UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.

272
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,604
>> AND YOU SEE THIS TREMENDOUSLY

273
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,672
WITH DRUGS. WHETHER IT'S ILLEGAL

274
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,008
DRUGS AND LEGAL DRUGS.

275
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,475
THE MODEL OF SORT OF OPTIMIZING

276
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,646
CONTROL AND PROFITS ON DRUGS IS.

277
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,182
TO ME. VERY MUCH ONE MODEL,

278
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,651
BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS OF BOTH

279
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,485
THE ILLEGAL AND THE LEGAL DRUGS

280
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,454
ARE VERY INTEGRAL FROM A--

281
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,124
FROM A POLICY AND GOVERNANCE

282
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,325
STANDPOINT.

283
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,326
>> I'M PLEASE THAT ALL OF YOU

284
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,493
ARE HERE TO WITNESS THE GREATEST

285

00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,631
THE INFLUX IN PAIN MANAGEMENT

340
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,101
CLINICS.

341
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:41,969
YOU CAN SEE THE INFLUX

342
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,603
IN LEGALIZED DRUG DEALING.

343
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,806
BROWARD. WHICH IS THE FORT

344
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,775
LAUDERDALE AREA. IS THE

345
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,009
EPICENTER OF THIS PILL MILL

346
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,344
EPIDEMIC.

347
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,013
AND WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT IN THE

348
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,782
FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008.

349
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:58,852
67% OF THE OXYCODONE NATIONWIDE

350
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:05,558
THAT WAS PUT OUT BY DISPENSING

351
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,860
PRACTITIONERS CAME OUT OF

352
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,461
BROWARD COUNTY. FLORIDA.

353
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,397
THE ENTIRE MID-EASTERN QUADRANT

354
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,134
OF THE U.S.. ALL THOSE STATES

355
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,470
HAD A PRESCRIPTION DRUG

356
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,172
MONITORING PROGRAM.

357
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,107
WELL. WHAT THAT DID IS STARTED

358
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,174
TO DRIVE DRUG SEEKERS--AND I'M

359
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,177
NOT GONNA USE THE TERM PATIENT.

360
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,446
IT DROVE DRUG SEEKERS FROM THOSE

361
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,815
STATES INTO THE STATE OF

362
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,516
FLORIDA.

363
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,583
>> PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE IS

364
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
RISING. BUT THE INNOCENT VICTIMS

365
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,121
ARE THE INFANTS BORN EXPOSED TO

366
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,755
OPIATES IN UTERO.

367
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,524
BROWARD COUNTY. FLORIDA,

368
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,926
HAS SEEN A QUADRUPLE INCREASE

369
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,061
AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE

370
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,562
TAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE

371
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,563
WOMEN.

372
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,464
>> THEY'RE--OVER THE LAST

373
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,166
SEVERAL YEARS THERE.

374
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,200
THERE'S BEEN NO REGULATION

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,902
WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF PATIENTS

376
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,503
BEING ABLE TO GO TO DIFFERENT

377
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,471
OFFICES AND GET PRESCRIPTION

378
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,874
PILLS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

379
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,876
YOU HAVE AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE

380
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,210
ACTUALLY COMING FROM OTHER

381
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,079
STATES TO GET THESE MEDICATIONS.

382
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,680
SO AS THE NUMBER OF ADULTS AND

383
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,516
WOMEN RISE TAKING THESE

384
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,118
PRESCRIPTION PILLS. IT'S NO

385
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,187
SURPRISE THAT THEY'RE HAVING

386
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,922
BABIES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON

387
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,657
PAINKILLERS.

388
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,959
>> YEAH. THERE YOU GO,

389
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,826
OKAY. LOOK RIGHT THERE.

390
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:13,894
>> HE'S MAKING A BUY.

391
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,761
>> YEAH. HE'S MAKING THE BUY

392
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,695
WITH THE GUY IN THE BROWN.

393
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,731
HE'S GOT HIS MONEY IN HIS HAND.

394
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,267
HE'S SHOWING HIM SOMETHING.

395
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,735
THE DRUG DEALERS. WHEN THEY'RE

396
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,703
DEALING WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

397
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,072
GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.

398
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,773
MEDI-CAL OR MEDICAID.

399
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,976
THESE PROGRAMS PAY FOR THESE

400
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,143
DRUGS. AND THEN THEY'RE RESOLD.

401
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,046
IT STARTS WITH PEOPLE THAT WE

402
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,781
CALL CAPPERS THAT GENERALLY

403
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,283
DRIVE AROUND INDIGENT

404
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,551
NEIGHBORHOODS. ANYWHERE WHERE

405
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,987
PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING GOVERNMENT

406
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,989
BENEFITS. PRIMARILY MEDICARE.

407
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,757
THEY'RE USUALLY NEVER SEEN BY

408
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,859
A DOCTOR.

409
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,894
SOMEBODY IN THERE WILL WRITE

410
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,095
A PRESCRIPTION.

411
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,562
THEN THEY'LL PAY THAT PERSON TO

412
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,597
GO TO A PHARMACY AND FILL THAT

413
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,865
PRESCRIPTION. AND THEN THEY'LL

414
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,700
GIVE THOSE DRUGS BACK TO WHAT WE

415
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,102
CALL A CAPPER.

416
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,103
THEY WILL TAKE THOSE DRUGS TO

417
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,270
SOMEBODY THAT'S GENERALLY

418
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,139
INVOLVED IN ORGANIZED CRIME

419
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,941
HERE IN L.A.

420
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,042
THEY'LL TAKE THEM BACK TO RETAIL

421
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,243
PHARMACIES THAT THEY OWN.

422
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,078
THEY'LL TAKE THEM BACK TO WHAT

423
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,079
THEY CALL CLOSED-DOOR PHARMACIES

424
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,747
THAT THEY OWN. USE THAT AS PART

425
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,016
OF THEIR INVENTORY.

426
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,217
SO NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO BILL.

427
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,351
AGAIN. MEDICARE FOR PRESCRIBING

428
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,021
THESE DRUGS TO. SAY, AN ELDERLY

429
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,688
PATIENT IN A NURSING HOME.

430
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,258
THAT PERSON NEVER RECEIVES THOSE

431
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,659
DRUGS EVEN THOUGH THERE'S

432
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,628
A PAPER TRAIL AND A BILLING

433
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:22,862
TRAIL CREATED SO THEY CAN

434
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,331
CONTINUE BILLING.

435
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,432
THEN WHEN THOSE DRUGS EXPIRE.

436
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,035
THEY'RE GONNA PACKAGE THEM UP.

437
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,002
AND THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THEM TO

438
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,037
OUT OF STATE TO A WHOLESALE

439
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,404
REPACKAGING BUSINESS.

440
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,940
>> IF YOU AUTOMATE ALL THE

441
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,774
RECORDS IN THE STATE. ALL THE

442
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,077
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE RECORDS.

443
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,279
AND A PHYSICIAN ACCESSES YOUR

444
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,081
FILE THROUGH THE PDMP. HE CAN

445
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,051
SEE WHATEVER PHYSICIANS YOU'VE

446
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,285
BEEN TO. WHAT QUANTITIES YOU'VE

447
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,320
BEEN PRESCRIBED.

448
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,956
AND IF HE'S CHECKING THE SYSTEM.

449
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,124
AND YOU'VE RECEIVED A CONTROLLED

450
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,325
SUBSTANCE FROM ANOTHER DOCTOR.

451
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,261
HE'S NOT GOING TO PRESCRIBE.

452
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,363
BECAUSE THAT'S A THREAT TO HIS

453
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,497
LICENSE.

454
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,831
THAT WOULD BE A LEGITIMATE

455
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,967
DOCTOR IDENTIFYING DRUG SEEKING

456
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,435
ACTIVITY.

457
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,937
>> SO OUR BILL. OUR ORIGINAL

458
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,038
BILL LAST YEAR WOULD'VE CHARGED

459
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,839
1/4 CENT PER PRESCRIPTION

460
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,076
DRUG--PILL. I SHOULD SAY--

461
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,378
TO GO INTO A FUND TO COLLECT

462
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,745
A FEW MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WE

463
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,414
COULD DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO

464
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,848
GET EVERYONE WHO WRITES

465
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,816
PRESCRIPTIONS--175.000 PEOPLE

466
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:20,287
WHO ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO WRITE

467
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,055
PRESCRIPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA--

468
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,957
TO BE ELECTRONICALLY ON THIS

DATABASE.

470
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,193
SO IN REAL TIME. THE DEPARTMENT

471
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,860
OF JUSTICE AND THE DOCTOR

472
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,130
PRESCRIBING THE DRUG CAN SEE

473
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,532
WHO'S PRESCRIBING WHAT DRUGS.

474
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,567
AND ON THE OTHER HAND. THE

475
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,468
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAN SEE

476
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,970
THAT IF THERE ARE PHYSICIANS OR

477
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,271
ANYONE WHO'S ALLOWED TO WRITE

478
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,573
PRESCRIPTIONS ARE ABUSING IT

479
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,542
AND BASICALLY TAKING THE TRUST

480
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,178
THE PUBLIC PUTS IN THEM AS

481
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,313
PHYSICIANS AND ABUSING IT BY

482
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,216
MAKING PROFIT MONEY BY SELLING

483
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,051
OPIATES. PAINKILLERS TO PEOPLE.

484
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,920
>> THEY FOUND A PRESCRIPTION

485
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,857
RECEIPT IN HIS CAR. AND I GUESS

486
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,561
THE CORONER CALLED THE DOCTOR

487
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,130
AND ASKED HIM. "WHAT DID YOU

488
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,531
GIVE THIS BOY?

489
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,266
WHAT DID YOU GIVE THIS BOY?"

490
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,235
THE DOCTOR SAID. "WELL, WHY?"

491
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,402
HE'S LIKE. "BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

492
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,072
HE'S DEAD.

493
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:12,939
HE'S 25 YEARS OLD. AND HE'S

494
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,441
DEAD."

495
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,443
THEN HE TOLD HIM WHAT HE

496
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,310
PRESCRIBED TO HIM. AND IT WAS

497
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,480
THE ROXI--NO. OXYCONTIN.

498
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,484
IT'S--THE FORM OF IT WAS THE

499
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,354
KIND THAT DOES NOT--IT DOESN'T

500
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:31,058
TIME RELEASE OR SOMETHING LIKE

501
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,125
THAT.

502
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:32,992
IT'S JUST INSTANTANEOUS PAIN

503
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,662
RELIEF.

504
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,596
>> SO SYSTEMATICALLY FROM 2001

505
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,166
UP TO APPROXIMATELY 2009.

506
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,368
THE STATE OF FLORIDA FOUGHT FOR

507
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,536
A PDMP IN THE LEGISLATURE.

508
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,306
BILLS WERE INTRODUCED. AND IT

509
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,208
WAS FOUGHT DOWN EVERY YEAR.

510
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,643
PURDUE PHARMA ALSO STEPPED UP TO

511
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,012
THE PLATE AND MOST RECENTLY.

512
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,714
AS OF A WEEK AGO.

513
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,948
OFFERED $1 MILLION TO SUPPORT

514
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,451
THE STATE OF FLORIDA IN A PDMP

515
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,387
PROGRAM AND TO PAY FOR THE PDMP

516
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,056
PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF

517
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,291
FLORIDA.

518
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,258
AND THIS IS WHERE POLITICS COMES

519
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,459
INTO PLAY.

520
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,960
THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

521
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,728
FLORIDA DECLINED AND DOES NOT

522
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,465
SEE FIT THAT A PDMP BE

523
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,667
IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE STATE OF

524
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,303
FLORIDA.

525
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,304
HE CITES THAT IT'S A VIOLATION

526
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,671
OF PRIVACY.

527
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,039
>> I MET WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL

528
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,774
INDUSTRY.

529
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,642
I WAS RIGHT UPFRONT WITH THEM.

530
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,543
I TOLD THEM. "THIS IS WHAT I

531
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,477
WANT TO DO.

532
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,345
IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S IN YOUR BEST

533
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,346
INTEREST TO HELP US DO THIS.

534
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,115
IT'S NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST

535
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,216
TO READ ABOUT PEOPLE DYING FROM

536
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,150
ABUSE OF YOUR LEGAL PRODUCT."

537
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,553
AND WE HAD SOME GOOD MEETINGS.

538
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,355
BUT WHEN THE BILL ACTUALLY WENT

539
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,623
TO COMMITTEE AND. OBVIOUSLY,

540
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,458
HAD TO GET PASSED OUT OF

541
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,659
COMMITTEE IN A MAJORITY VOTE TO

542
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,060
GET HERE TO THE FLOOR OF THE

543
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,362
SENATE. I COULDN'T DO IT.

544
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,431
I COULDN'T DO IT TWICE.

545
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,065
THE FIRST TIME. I CAME OUT OF

546
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,735
THE HEARING ROOM. AND I COULD

547
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,736
SEE SOME LOBBYIST TALKING WITH

548
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,238
A COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES.

549
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,372
AND THESE ARE DEMOCRATIC

550
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,240
COLLEAGUES WHO I THOUGHT I HAD

551
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,475
THEIR VOTE.

552
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,577
AND WHEN THE ROLL CALL WAS

553
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,845
TAKEN. I DIDN'T HAVE THEIR VOTE.

554
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,713
>> IF WE ARE SEEING RAPID

555
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,250
ACCELERATION OF PRESCRIPTION

556
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,419
DRUGS THAT ARE BEING GIVEN TO

557
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,820
MORE AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE.

558
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,589
INCLUDING CHILDREN.

559
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,557
OVER THE YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

560
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,492
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT

561
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,393
A CORRESPONDING INCREASE

562
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,228
OF DIAGNOSES BY DOCTORS.

563
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,498
>> WHAT WAS ONCE A DIAGNOSTIC

564
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,333
MANUAL THAT WAS PAPER THIN IS

565
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,569
NOW A HUGE BOOK WITH HUNDREDS OF

566
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,404
DIAGNOSES IN IT THAT GROWS AND

567
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,206
GROWS AND GROWS.

568
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,175
>> TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

569
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,442
BEING SLICED AND DICED.

570
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,444
WHERE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG

571
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,880
WITH THE PERSON. BUT SOMETHING

572
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,848
IS BEING SAID TO BE WRONG WITH

573
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,684
THAT PERSON.

574
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,551
IT GETS INTO THAT AREA.

575
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,288
>> IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE

576
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,156
CREATED ILLNESSES FOR DRUGS.

577
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,192
SO IN OTHER WORDS. I'VE SEEN--

578
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:48,528
YOU SEE--PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE

579
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,429
COMMERCIAL. RESTLESS LEG

580
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,298
SYNDROME.

581
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,199
MOST PEOPLE HAD NEVER HEARD OF

582
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,866
THAT.

583
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,767
BUT ONCE THAT COMMERCIAL STARTED

584
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,802
PLAYING. THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSES

585
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,703
FOR RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME WENT

586
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,505
THROUGH THE ROOF.

587
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,372
>> FORTUNATELY. THERE'S MIRAPEX.

588
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,974
MIRAPEX IS A PRESCRIPTION

589
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,643
MEDICINE THAT HELPS RELIEVE THE

590
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,412
FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF MANY

591
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,214
RLS SYMPTOMS.

592
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,315
>> JUST RECENTLY. I SAW

593
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,816
A COMMERCIAL WHERE THERE IS

594
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,551
A GUY. MID-40s, EARLY 50s,

595
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,886
AND THE NARRATOR IS LIKE.

596
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,888
"YOU CAN'T HIT THE GOLF BALL AS

597
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,324
FAR AS YOU USED TO.

598
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,925
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY LEVEL

599
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,260
YOU'RE USED TO.

600
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,927
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME GUY YOU WERE

601
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:21,961
IN THE BEDROOM."

602
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,496
AND IT SAYS. "MAYBE YOU'RE

603
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,431
SUFFERING FROM LOW 'T.'"

604
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,566
AND THEN I'M LIKE. "WHAT IS LOW

605
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,734
'T'?"

606
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,636
AND THEN BEFORE I CAN EVEN SAY

607
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,503
THAT TO MYSELF. THE ANNOUNCER

608
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,571
SAYS. "LOW 'T' IS LOW

609
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,739
TESTOSTERONE."

610
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,308
TESTOSTERONE LEVELS DROP

611
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,709
NORMALLY IN MEN AS THEY GET

612
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,777
OLDER.

613
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,645
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM.

614
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,647
BUT THEY'RE CREATING A PROBLEM.

615
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,616
BECAUSE THERE IS NOW A NEW

616
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,485
TREATMENT. A NEW PILL FOR IT.

617
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,553
>> CRITICS. ANYWAY,

618
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,420
OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

619
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,288
ADVERTISING SAY THAT IT LEADS TO

620
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,956
A LOT OF PROBLEMS. THAT IT,

621
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,424
NUMBER ONE. OVERMEDICALIZES

622
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,326
THINGS IN SOCIETY THAT ARE

623
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,461
REALLY NOT MEDICAL PROBLEMS.

624
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,995
LIKE. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS

625
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,029
ANXIETY.

626
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,331
SO SOCIAL ANXIETY SYNDROME.

627
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,032
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS PREMENSTRUAL

628
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,035
SYMPTOMS.

629
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,970
>> MY DOCTOR TOLD ME.

630
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,104
"THAT'S NOT PMS; THAT'S PMDD."

631
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,340
>> UNLIKE PMS. SYMPTOMS OF PMDD

632
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,509
ARE SEVERE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY

633
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,643
INTERFERE WITH YOUR LIFE.

634
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,744
THINGS LIKE THIS THAT ARE KIND

635
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,745
OF NORMAL FOR HUMANS ARE TURNED

636
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,815
INTO A DISEASE. AND PEOPLE

637
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,116
SUBSEQUENTLY REQUEST MEDICATION

638
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,352
TREATMENT FOR THESE THINGS THAT

639
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,887
MAY NOT EVEN BE A DISEASE

640
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,854
AT ALL.

641
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,722
SO THAT'S BEEN A CRITICISM OF

642
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,823
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING.

643
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,124
>> ATTENTION YAZ. YASMIN,

644
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,626
AND OCELLA USERS. THE FDA SAYS

645
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,561
THESE DRUGS MAY CAUSE BLOOD

646
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,862
CLOTS AND SERIOUS HEART AND

647
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,163
HEALTH PROBLEMS.

648
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,098
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF

649
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:32,932
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

650
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,800
ADVERTISEMENTS OF

651
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,702
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS. AND TYPICALLY,

652
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,636
PEOPLE WILL COME IN IF THEY'RE

653
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,604
DEPRESSED. ASKING FOR THOSE

654
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,805
PARTICULAR DRUGS AS OPPOSED TO

655
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,072
OLDER ALTERNATIVES.

656
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,008
AND INTERESTINGLY. ONE OF THE

657
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,510
DRUGS THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING

658
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,711
MARKETED FOR DEPRESSION IS

659
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,978
ACTUALLY A DRUG THAT'S USED FOR

660
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,647
PSYCHOSIS. FOR THINGS LIKE

661
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,948
SCHIZOPHRENIA. BUT THAT IT--

662
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,850
IT IS USEFUL AS AN ADJUNCT TO

663
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,152
DEPRESSION MEDICINES IN CASES OF

664
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,887
VERY SEVERE DEPRESSION.

665
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,989
AND WE SAW A LOT OF ADS.

666
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,057
IN OUR REVIEW OF

667
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,926
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

668
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,794
ADVERTISEMENTS WE SAW A LOT OF

669
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,929
ADS FOR THIS PARTICULAR DRUG.

670
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,631
AND I HAVE HAD A LOT OF PATIENTS

671
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,865
ASKING ME FOR IT. EVEN THOUGH IT

672
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,066
IS ACTUALLY COMPLETELY

673
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,134

675
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,836
ADULTS WHEN ADDED TO AN

676
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,037
ANTI-DEPRESSANT.

677
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,539
SOME PEOPLE HAD SYMPTOM

678
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,673
IMPROVEMENT IN AS EARLY

679
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,741
AS ONE TO TWO WEEKS.

680
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,175
>> ADDING ABILIFY HAS MADE

681
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,677
A DIFFERENCE FOR ME.

682
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,545
>> I MEAN. THE ADS DON'T SAY

683
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,746
THAT IT'S A FIRST LINE AGENT FOR

684
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,747
DEPRESSION. BUT BECAUSE IT'S

685
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:21,848
ADVERTISED AND THE PEOPLE IN THE

686
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:22,949
ADS LOOK HAPPY. YOU KNOW,

687
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,684
PATIENTS WHO ARE DEPRESSED WANT

688
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,952
A DRUG THAT'S GONNA MAKE THEM

689
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,919
HAPPY TOO.

690
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:27,987
AND IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING.

691
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,188
PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR THIS DRUG

692
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,256
THAT THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO

693
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,191
TAKE.

694
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,060
>> THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PR

695
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,662
CAMPAIGN IN THE HISTORY OF THE

696
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,497
WORLD WAS ELI LILLY PR-ING THAT

697
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:41,534
DEPRESSION IS CAUSED BY

698
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,902
A BIOCHEMICAL IMBALANCE AND THAT

699
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,605
PROZAC COULD FIX IT.

700
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,741
THERE WAS SOME INTERESTING

701
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:49,642
RESEARCH DONE LOOKING AT THE

702
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,611
GROUP FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC MANUAL

703
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,880
THAT MADE UP THE DIAGNOSES FOR

704
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,015
PSYCHOSES AND FOR MOOD

705
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,250
DISORDERS. WHICH ARE SOME OF THE

706
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,186
MAIN PLACES THAT THE DRUG

707
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,254
COMPANIES MAKE MONEY FROM.

708
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,256
AND EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE

709
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,292
PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'S

710
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,927
COMMITTEE WAS INVOLVED WITH DRUG

711
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,662
COMPANIES. GETTING MONEY FROM

712
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,930
DRUG COMPANIES. ALL OF THEM.

713
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,965
>> ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO.

714
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,735
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY.

715
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,869
MY PARENTS HAD BEEN MARRIED OVER

716
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,705
45 YEARS. AND MY MOM--

717
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:21,073
VERY HEALTHY. IN HER 70s,

718
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,675
ON NO MEDICATIONS--WENT TO HER

719
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,276
DOCTOR FOR REGULAR CHECKUP.

720
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,012
AND THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT HER

721
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,946
AND SAID. "YOU KNOW, MISS SMITH,

722
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,381
YOU JUST DON'T LOOK LIKE YOUR

723
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,348
USUAL SELF." AND SHE WENT AHEAD

724
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,817
AND TOLD THE DOCTOR. "WELL, MY

725
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,085
HUSBAND OF 45. 50 YEARS JUST

726
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,354
PASSED AWAY."

727
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,123
SO BEFORE MY MOM COULD EVEN

728
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,791
FINISH SAYING ANYTHING. HE WAS

729
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,092
WRITING OUT A PRESCRIPTION.

730
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,028
SO HE HANDED HER A PRESCRIPTION.

731
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,831
AND MY MOM SAID. "WHAT IS THIS?"

732
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,232
AND HE SAID. "IT'S PROZAC FOR

733
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,734
DEPRESSION."

734
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,868
AND MY MOM LOOKED AT HIM AND

735
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,769
SAID. "I'M NOT DEPRESSED.

736
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,970
I'M JUST SAD."

737
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,371
AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY

738
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,073
A MICROCOSM OF WHAT IS GOING ON

739
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,108
IN THIS COUNTRY AT THIS TIME.

740
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,309
PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM.

741
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,111
AND INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM.

742
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,780
"WHAT IS THE PROBLEM."

743
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,048
HERE'S A PILL FOR IT.

744
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,149
>> NOW. THINK ABOUT HOW BIZARRE

745
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,684
IT IS TO SUM UP A PERSON'S LIFE

746
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,019
STRUGGLE WITH A DIAGNOSIS LIKE

747
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,055
BI-POLAR DISORDER.

748
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,758
THINK ABOUT LINCOLN.

749
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,292
THERE HAVE BEEN INNUMERABLE

750
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,394
BOOKS STUDYING LINCOLN. TRYING

751
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,063
TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS LINCOLN.

752
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,197
WHAT MADE LINCOLN TICK.

753
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,365
BUT A PSYCHIATRIST SAYS

754
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,800
BIPOLAR DISORDER.

755
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,401
IT USED TO BE THAT A YOUNG

756
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,937
SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE STRUGGLING

757
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,273
WITH HIS ANGST AND HIS SADNESS

758
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,209
AND HIS DEPRESSION WOULD READ

759
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,310
KIERKEGAARD OR READ SOME OTHER

760
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,213
REALLY DEEP AND BROODING BOOK TO

761
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,383
FIND SOME SOLUTIONS TO LIFE.

762
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,251
OR HE'D STUDY PHILOSOPHY.

763
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,887
MAYBE READ SOME FREUD.

764
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,789
MAYBE GET SOME THERAPY.

765
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,457
BUT HE'D VIEW HIMSELF OR HERSELF

766
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,793
AS STRUGGLING WITH LIFE ISSUES.

767
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:50,797
NOW THAT SAME COLLEGE SOPHOMORE

768
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,065
HAS ALREADY READ IN TEXTBOOKS

769
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,536
THAT ALL THE ANGUISH THAT PEOPLE

770
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,404
FEEL IS ABOUT BIOCHEMICAL

771
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,507
IMBALANCES.

772
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,441
AND WITH THAT. ALL THE LEARNING

773
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,044
OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS

774
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,946
THROWN OUT.

775
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,981
>> PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO THE

776
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,316
IDEA OF DRUGS.

777
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,251
THERE'S LOTS OF ADDICTION.

778
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,319
THEY BELIEVE THAT DRUGS WILL

779
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,386
HELP THEM.

780
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,254
>> PEOPLE ARE OVERUSING THIS

781
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,889
THING. THESE PRODUCTS THAT WERE

782
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,491
CREATED TO EASE THEIR PAIN.

783
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,326
AND IT'S CREATING MORE PAIN.

784
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,561
I MEAN. THAT'S THE IRONY OF--

785
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,362
AND THAT'S--AND EVERYTHING

786
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,931
ENDEMIC IN OUR CULTURE IS LIKE.

787
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,199
"WELL. GET RID OF MY PAIN,"

788
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,167
YOU KNOW?

789
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,001
"JUST GET RID OF IT.

790
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:29,902
I'LL PAY ANYTHING FOR IT."

791
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,070
BUT IT'S NOT GETTING RID OF

792
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,038
ANYTHING.

793
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:32,905
IT'S MAKING THINGS WORSE.

794
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,440
>> THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS

795
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,610
SOCIETAL PHENOMENON.

796
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,278
AND IT INDICATES A CULTURE

797
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,448
LOSING TOUCH WITH EMPATHY FOR

798
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,584
ITSELF AS INDIVIDUALS AND

799
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,519
EMPATHY FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

800
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,188
A CULTURE THAT HAS JUST GOTTEN

801
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,923
CAUGHT UP IN THE END PRODUCT

802
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,425
AND EFFICIENCY AND WORK AND NOT

803
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,596
AT ALL THINKING ABOUT.

804
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:59,031
"WHAT IS LIFE ABOUT?

805
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,199
WHO AM I?

WHO ARE MY CHILDREN?

807
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,202
ARE MY CHILDREN GIFTS FROM GOD?

808
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,171
ARE THEY TO BE TREASURED?

809
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,439
DO THEY REQUIRE THAT I CHANGE MY

810
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,975
LIFE TO BRING THEM UP BETTER?

811
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,678
OR ARE THEY OBJECTS TO BE

812
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,012
TINKERED WITH AND GIVEN DRUGS?"

813

>> TALKING WITH MY DOCTOR.

814
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,482
HE DIAGNOSED ME WITH ADHD.

815
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,685
AND I TOLD HIM AT THAT POINT

816
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,986
THAT MY CHILDREN WERE TAKING

817

CONCERTA.

818
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,954
I SAID. YOU KNOW, "IS THERE

819
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:22,622
REASON TO THINK THAT IT WOULD

820
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,190
WORK FOR ME?"

821
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,057
AND HE SAID. "ABSOLUTELY."

822
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,160
>> *AND I'LL PROBABLY

823

837
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,055
ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ISSUE WAS

SECRETARY TOMMY THOMPSON.

839
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,194

891
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,229
[ applause ]

892
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:51,270
>> THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID

893
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,371
MEDICARE PART D TO HELP THE

894
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,707
ELDERLY. ALL RIGHT.

895
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,742
THE ELDERLY OWNERS IN THE

896
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,443
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

897
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,846
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE CEOs.

898
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,881
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MAJOR

899
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:02,815
STOCKHOLDERS.

900
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,350
>> WHEN I WORKED ON WALL STREET

901
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,752
OR WHEN I WORKED IN WASHINGTON.

902
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,686
WE WOULD NEVER ASK THE QUESTION

903
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,855
ON HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY ON

904
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,522
SOMETHING SO MUCH AS THE

905
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,059
QUESTION WOULD BE ASKED.

906
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,727
"WHERE DO WE WANT THE WORLD TO

907
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:15,995
GO AND THEN HOW DO WE ENGINEER

908
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,830
THINGS SO THAT IT WILL GO THAT

909
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,966
WAY.

910
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:20,867
I LEFT WALL STREET. AND I WENT

911
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,068
TO WASHINGTON. AND THEN I LEFT

912
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,535
WASHINGTON AND MOVED TO

913
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,104
TENNESSEE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

914
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,405
I STRUGGLED THE MOST WITH WAS

915
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,907
EXPLAINING TO MY FAMILY AND

916
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:30,076
FRIENDS HOW THE ECONOMIC MODEL

917
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,079
THAT AMERICA WORKS ON REALLY

918
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,781
WORKS.

919
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,915
AND I FINALLY--I FINALLY DECIDED

920
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,617
TO WRITE A CASE STUDY.

921
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,518
IT'S CALLED DILLON READ AND THE

922
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,719
ARISTOCRACY OF STOCK PROFITS.

923
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,122
AND IT TELLS THE STORY OF HOW

924
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,558
WALL STREET MADE MONEY ON

925
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,727
HELPING FINANCING PRIVATE

926
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,562
PRISONS.

927
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,031
AND I--I WROTE IT BECAUSE I

928
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,532
WANTED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

929
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,867
A VERY FUNDAMENTALLY

930
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,168
NON-ECONOMIC ACTIVITY CAN BECOME

931
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,905
VERY PROFITABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE.

932
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,940
>> WHAT MEDICARE PART D DID WAS.

933
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,010
IT GAVE THE DRUG COMPANIES THE

934
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,812
ABILITY TO NAME THEIR PRICE FOR

935
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:08,580
PHARMACEUTICALS AND TO GET IT

936
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,451
AND TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT

937
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,120
PAY FOR IT.

938
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,121
>> WHAT YOU'LL OFTEN SEE IS SORT

939
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,088
OF A COMBINATION OF AN INDUSTRY

940
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,425
MAKING MONEY AND GOVERNMENT

941
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,160
ENGINEERING THE INCENTIVES AND

942
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,129
THE ECONOMICS SO THAT. WHETHER

943
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,965
IT'S THE CONSUMER OR THE

944
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,166
TAXPAYER. THEY ALSO MAKE MONEY

945
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,601
GOING IN THAT DIRECTION.

946
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,803
>> NOW. THIS IS AN INDUSTRY,

947
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:31,703
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING AND FROM

948
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,972
SOME AMOUNT OF RESEARCH. THAT

949
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,574
HAS REALLY CHANGED IN THE LAST

950
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,575
20 YEARS.

951
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,509
AT LEAST PEOPLE WILL OPINE THAT

952
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,978
THERE ARE VENTURE CAPITALISTS

953
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,179
WHO DID A GOOD DEAL OF RESEARCH

954
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,714
TO SEE WHO AMERICANS TRUSTED.

955
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,084
AND AMERICANS USED TO AND STILL

956
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,186
DO PUT A LOT OF TRUST IN PEOPLE

957
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,488
IN WHITE SMOCKS. PHARMACISTS,

958
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,057
DOCTORS--AS THEY SHOULD--

959
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:53,792
AND IN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

960
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,762
UNFORTUNATELY. IN MY OPINION,

961
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,031
LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE

962
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,632
INVESTMENT WORLD. THERE WERE

963
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,701
PEOPLE WHO WENT IN AND TOOK

964
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,702
COMPANIES OVER AND WHAT

965
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,904
COMPANIES USED TO PRIDE

966
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,772
THEMSELVES ON RESEARCH

967
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,840
AND DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDING

968
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,909
A PRODUCT TO THE UNITED STATES

969
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,277
PUBLIC THAT WOULD LENGTHEN YOUR

970
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,945
LIVES AND MAKE THEM HEALTHIER

971
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,546
LIVES SOMEWHAT GOT CORRUPTED

972
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,782
AND GOT DRIVEN MORE ABOUT

973
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:17,749
PROFITABILITY. RETURN ON

974
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:21,287
INVESTMENT.

975
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,154
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

976
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,990
MONEY THEY SPEND ON LOBBYING IN

977
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,292
THE LAST CYCLE. IT WAS ABOUT

978
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,760
$272 MILLION.

979
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,898
I MEAN. THEY HAVE MORE LOBBYISTS

980
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:34,666
ACTIVE THAN THERE ARE MEMBERS OF

981
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,902
CONGRESS.

982
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,036
THERE'S $64 BILLION IN PROFITS

983
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:40,672
LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S ON

984
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,841
REVENUES OF ABOUT $254 BILLION

985
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,913
FOR THE TOP 12 PHARMACEUTICAL

986
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,115
COMPANIES.

987
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,716
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

988
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,650
ENORMOUS ECONOMIC IMPACT. AN

989
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,186
EXTRAORDINARY LOBBYING IMPACT.

990
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,722
AND A REAL POLITICAL IMPACT.

991
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,757
>> WE HAVE SOMETHING IN THIS

992
00:30:58,757 --> 00:30:59,625
COUNTRY CALL A MEDICAL CARTEL.

993
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:03,262
A CARTEL IS BASICALLY

994
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,664
INTERLOCKING INTERESTS THAT FORM

995
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:09,835
EITHER A MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING

996
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,938
CLOSE TO MONOPOLY.

997
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,705
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES.

998
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,307
CORPORATIONS.

999
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,109
IN THIS CASE. WE'RE TALKING

1000
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,210
ABOUT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

1001
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,946
MEDICAL SCHOOLS. GOVERNMENT

1002
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,048
AGENCIES LIKE THE FDA.

1003
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,183
>> AND I WENT BACK TO HARVARD

1004
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,952
FOR MY FIRST YEAR OF RESIDENCY

1005
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,286
RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT THE

1006
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,354
POLITICS OF PSYCHIATRY WAS

1007
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,356
CHANGING.

1008
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,723
WHEN I INTERVIEWED FOR HARVARD.

1009
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,126
I WAS INTERVIEWED BY A FAMILY

1010
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,962
THERAPIST. AND I MET PEOPLE WHO

1011
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,297
WERE DOING FAMILY THERAPY AND

1012
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,032
PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOCIAL

1013
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,934
THERAPIES.

1014
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,102
ONE YEAR LATER. THE PROGRAM HAD

1015
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,938
CHANGED INTO A BIOLOGICAL

1016
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:49,241
PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAM WHERE YOU

1017
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,210
HAD LIMITED TIME WITH YOUR

1018
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,378
PATIENTS AND SPENT MOST OF YOUR

1019
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,313
TIME DOING MEDICATION. MANAGING

1020
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,148
WARDS. GIVING ECT.

1021
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,984
THIS TRANSFORMATION WAS NOT

1022
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,318
THROUGH SCIENCE.

1023
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,953
THIS WAS A DECISION BY POLITICAL

1024
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:03,455
PSYCHIATRY THAT THE FUTURE WAS

1025
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,391
WITH SELLING BIOLOGY AND DRUGS

1026
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,394
AS THE SOLUTION TO HUMAN

1027
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,795
SUFFERING IF PSYCHIATRY WAS

1028
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,530
GONNA KEEP ITS POWER

1029
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,199
AND ITS STATUS.

1030
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,300
>> WELL. ORIGINALLY, MODERN

1031
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,568
MEDICAL SCHOOLS WERE MAINLY

1032
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,804
FUNDED BY HUGE MEDICAL

1033
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,507
NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS.

1034
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,343
THOSE FOUNDATIONS HAD

1035
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,911
A PARTICULAR VIEW OF MEDICINE

1036
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:29,115
THAT WAS LEANING TOWARD WHAT HAS

1037
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,117
BECOME MODERN PHARMACEUTICAL

1038
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,385
MEDICINE.

1039
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:34,253
AND SO TO HONOR THESE GRANTS.

1040
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:37,089
THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS WERE FUNDED

1041
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,258
AND EVEN ESTABLISHED TO TEACH

1042
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,460
THAT BRAND OF MEDICINE.

1043
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,862
>> MANY PEOPLE. WHEN THEY LOOK

1044
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,930
AT A UNIVERSITY.

1045
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,931
SEE A UNIVERSITY. SEE A SCHOOL.

1046
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,599
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SEE.

1047
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,534
I SEE AN ENDOWMENT. AND A LOT OF

1048
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,137
INTERGENERATIONAL CAPITAL THAT

1049
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,904
FINANCES CORPORATIONS IS

1050
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,041
SHELTERED FROM TAXES BY MANAGING

1051
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,043
IT THROUGH ENDOWMENTS. OFTEN FOR

1052
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,977
UNIVERSITIES.

1053
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,012
>> SO EVERYWHERE YOU GO. THERE'S

1054
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,513
THE PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICAL

1055
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,182
COMPLEX. AND ITS TENTACLES REACH

1056
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,484
DEEPLY DOWN INTO OUR EDUCATIONAL

1057
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,354
SYSTEM.

1058
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,521
WE--WE NOW HAVE A SITUATION

1059
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,424
WHERE THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE

1060
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,925
SPONSORING PROGRAMS TO GO INTO

1061
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,595
OUR SCHOOLS TO MONITOR OUR KIDS

1062
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,566
AND FIND OUT WHO MAY BE HAVING

1063
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,268
A PROBLEM. SO THAT THEY CAN BE

1064
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,303
EVALUATED PSYCHIATRICALLY AND

1065
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,238
SENT OFF TO CLINICS WHERE.

1066
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,506
GUESS WHAT THEY'LL GET?

1067
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,575
PILLS.

1068
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,442
>> PEOPLE WILL BE MUCH LESS

1069
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,211
PRONE TO SLIP THROUGH THE

1070
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,080
CRACKS. BECAUSE WE HAVE FORCES

1071
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,083
OPERATING ON THE FAMILY. ON THE

1072
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,620
SCHOOLS. THE WORKPLACE,

1073
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,291
TO GUARANTEE. IN A SENSE,

1074
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,627
THAT THE OVERMEDICALIZATION OF

1075
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,996
SOCIETY TAKES PLACE.

1076
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,698
>> THE GOVERNMENT MONEY AND THE

1077
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,566
GOVERNMENT RULES AND REGULATIONS

1078
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,435
PROGRAM TO DEVELOP THE MODEL

1079
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,204
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO.

1080
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,138
SO. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I FIRST

1081
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,006
MOVED TO TENNESSEE. I HAD A

1082
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,108
FRIEND WHO HAD JUST RETIRED FROM

1083
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,542
TEACHING.

1084
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,776
AND SO MANY PARENTS WOULD LOBBY

1085
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,079
HER TO PUT HER--TO SAY THAT THE

1086
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,582
CHILDREN NEEDED RITALIN. AND THE

1087
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,518
REASON WAS. IF THEY GOT THE KIDS

1088
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,320
ON RITALIN. THEY COULD GET

1089
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,221
A DISABILITY PAYMENT FROM SOCIAL

1090
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,655
SECURITY.

1091
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:17,523
>> IT WAS AN OVERNIGHT

1092
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:18,557
TRANSFORMATION AT HARVARD.

1093
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,226
BECAUSE HARVARD WAS CUTTING

1094
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,327
EDGE.

1095
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,628
AND IN PSYCHIATRY. WE SEE THIS

1096
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,029
PHENOMENA THAT THE BEST IS THE

1097
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,397
WORST. THAT THE MOST CUTTING

1098
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,299
EDGE PSYCHIATRY. LIKE HARVARD TO

1099
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,801
THIS DAY. IS THE PSYCHIATRY THAT

1100
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,172
TAKES THE MOST MONEY FROM THE

1101
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,206
DRUG COMPANIES. THAT HAS THE

1102
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,242
MOST INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1103
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,110
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1104
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,845
>> BUT THERE'LL BE SOMEONE AT

1105
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,447
A MEDICAL SCHOOL TEACHING

1106
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,081
MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS.

1107
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,416
TEACHING RESIDENTS. BUT

1108
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,617
POCKETING $50.000

1109
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,419
OR $100.000 A YEAR FOR BEING A

1110
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,455
CONSULTANT TO THE DRUG COMPANY

1111
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,357
AND GIVING TALKS.

1112
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:52,691
WELL. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE

1113
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:53,625
A CONSULTANT AND THEY'RE NOT

1114
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,593
GONNA GET PAID TO GIVE TALKS

1115
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,094
UNLESS THEY ARE KNOWN TO BE

1116
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,596
FAVORABLE TO THAT COMPANY

1117
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,431
AND ITS PRODUCT.

1118
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,332
SO THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

1119
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,867
PEOPLE IN ACADEMIC MEDICINE.

1120
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,703
DOING TEACHING.

1121
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,238
BEING "PRESTIGIOUS."

1122
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,873
WHO ARE INFLUENCED BY THE VAST

1123
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,808
AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT THEY THINK

1124
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,277
THEY NEED TO GET FROM THE DRUG

1125
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,412
INDUSTRY.

1126
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,280
>> FOR EXAMPLE. AT HARVARD,

1127
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,248
IT'S JOSEPH BIEDERMAN WHO

1128
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,883
PERSONALLY CAUSED A REVOLUTION

1129
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:21,553
IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN BY

1130
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,921
DEFINING MORE AND MORE CHILDREN

1131
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,590
AS BIPOLAR SO THAT THESE KIDS

1132
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,725
WOULD BE GIVEN PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS

1133
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,761
THAT WERE SUITABLE ONLY FOR

1134
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,862
ADULTS LIKE LITHIUM AND ABILIFY

1135
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,765
AND SEROQUEL.

1136
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,234
PILLS. PILLS, PILLS FOR CHILDREN

1137
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,503
IS THE THEME THAT COMES OUT OF

1138
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,637
THE HARVARD PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY

1139
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,506
PROGRAM.

1140
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,540
I BLEW THE WHISTLE ON BIEDERMAN

1141
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,841
YEARS AGO AS SOMEONE GETTING

1142
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,510
HUGE MONEY FROM THE DRUG

1143
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,644
COMPANIES. BUT IT TOOK A WHILE

1144
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,547
FOR THE WHISTLE TO REACH

1145
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:49,415
WASHINGTON. AND NOW THERE HAVE

1146
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:51,217
BEEN HEARINGS. AND IT'S BEEN

1147
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,351
DISCOVERED THAT JOSEPH BIEDERMAN

1148
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,286
WAS GETTING A LOT MORE MONEY

1149
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,721
THAN HE ADMITTED FROM THE DRUG

1150
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,523
COMPANIES TO PUSH DRUGS ON

1151
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,958
AMERICA'S CHILDREN.

1152
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,261
>> THERE WAS A PROFESSOR AT

1153
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,595
HARVARD LAST YEAR WHO HAD GOTTEN

1154
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,432
MORE THAN $100.000 IN THE

1155
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,999
PREVIOUS YEAR FROM THE DRUG

1156
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,301
INDUSTRY. AND HARVARD INSTITUTED

1157
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,370
A RULE THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T BE IN

1158
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,004
THE FACULTY AND GET THAT KIND OF

1159
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,906
MONEY FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY.

1160
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,475
SO HE SAID. "I WANT MY $100,000.

1161
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,877
SO I'M LEAVING THE HARVARD

1162
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:19,811
FACULTY.

1163
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:20,679
>> I WENT ONTO THE NATIONAL

1164
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,813
INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH.

1165
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,282
SPENT TWO YEARS THERE. AND I WAS

1166
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,551
THERE AS THE TRANSFORMATION WAS

1167
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,818
HITTING NIMH.

1168
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,887
WHEN I ARRIVED. THE NATIONAL

1169
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,389
INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH WAS

1170
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,623
BASICALLY A PSYCHOSOCIALLY

1171
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,725
ORIENTED INSTITUTION IN 1966

1172
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,629
AND '68.

1173
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,665
BUT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE

1174
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:40,932
TRANSFORMATION OF NIMH INTO AN

1175
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,835
ARM OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.

1176
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,738
WE WOULD LATER DISCOVER THAT THE

1177
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,407
DRUG COMPANIES ACTUALLY HAD

1178
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:49,541
CONDUITS FOR GIVING MONEY TO

1179
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,410
NIMH TO DO RESEARCH ON THE DRUG

1180
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,546
COMPANIES' DRUGS.

1181
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,448
IT'S ALL VERY. VERY INTIMATE

1182
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,384
AND TIED TOGETHER.

1183
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,518
THE PROFESSION WAS MOVING

1184
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,052
HELL-BENT TO BEING LITERALLY AN

1185
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,589
ARM OF THE DRUG COMPANIES.

1186
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,592
>> WHY HAVE REGULATORY AGENCIES

1187
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,561
BEEN CO-OPTED BY VESTED

1188
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,762
INTERESTS THAT IS MOSTLY

1189
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,063
INDUSTRY INTERESTS?

1190
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,132
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY

1191
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:17,869
IS--IS EVER-PRESENT.

1192
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,673
I DON'T HAVE TO DOCUMENT THE

1193
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,674
FACT THAT INDUSTRY LOBBYISTS

1194
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,443
LOBBY CONGRESS EVERY DAY AND

1195
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,678
VERY POWERFULLY. AND THEY GIVE

1196
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,113
MONEY TO CAMPAIGNS.

1197
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,182
IN TURN. CONGRESSPEOPLE

1198
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,751
INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY

1199
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,052
AGENCIES.

1200
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,587
>> I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

1201
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,022
THAT ARE LOBBYING THAT HAVE A

1202
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,457
LOT OF MONEY THAT THEY CAN THROW

1203
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,791
AROUND. THEY GET FACE TIME,

1204
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,428
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.

1205
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,095
THEY GET FACE TIME WITH THE

1206
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,196
DECISION MAKERS. BECAUSE THEY'RE

1207
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,432
ABLE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS FROM

1208
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,166
A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT.

1209
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,601
>> THE CONGRESS HAS. SEEMINGLY

1210
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,804
REFLECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST--

1211
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,105
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THE PUBLIC

1212
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,207
HAS REALLY WEIGHED IN ON IT--

1213
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,611
DECIDING TO UNDERFUND THE FDA.

1214
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,147
LEAVING THE FDA AT THE MERCY OF

1215
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,683
INDUSTRY FUNDING SO THAT

1216
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,119
COMPANIES PAY LARGE FEES LIKE

1217
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,689
$1/4 MILLION--THAT'S--

1218
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,658
WHEN I SAY A FEE. I MEAN A LOT

1219
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,626
OF MONEY FOR THE--FOR THE

1220
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,095
REGULATOR TO REVIEW ITS OWN

1221
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,930
DRUG. WHICH IS A BALD CONFLICT

1222
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,266
OF INTEREST.

1223
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,167
>> I MEAN. THE DRUG INDUSTRY HAS

1224
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,769
GREATLY REPLACED THE TOBACCO

1225
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:26,605
INDUSTRY AS THE MOST POWERFUL

1226
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:27,706
LOBBY IN WASHINGTON.

1227
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,840
THEY PRETTY MUCH GET THEIR WAY.

1228
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,676
>> TO A POINT WHERE THE CONSUMER

1229
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:33,879
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE.

1230
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,747
SO THE POWER IS VIRTUALLY

1231
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:39,217
COMPLETELY ONE-SIDED ON THE SIDE

1232
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,687
OF THE MARKET. ANTI-REGULATORY.

1233
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:46,592
LET THE DOCTOR DO WHAT THE

1234
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,826
DOCTOR WANTS TO DO BECAUSE

1235
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,994
THE DOCTOR KNOWS BEST. WHEN,

1236
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,662
IN FACT. THERE'S NO WAY THE

1237
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,997
PHYSICIAN CAN KNOW WHAT TO DO

1238
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,565
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

1239
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,566
KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE THAT THEY'RE

1240
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,201
VERY VULNERABLE TO PRESSURE

1241
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,804
BY INDUSTRY LOBBYISTS.

1242
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,706
SO IT'S IN THE NATURE OF

1243
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,673
THE BEAST.

1244
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,375
IT'S IN THE NATURE OF THE GROWTH

1245
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,743
IN KNOWLEDGE. THE GROWTH IN

1246
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,344
INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WHICH CAN

1247
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,879
BE DISTORTED BY PEOPLE WHO STAND

1248
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,148
TO EARN A LOT OF MONEY.

1249
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,783
>> MOUNT SINAI HAD A PRESCRIBER

1250
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,985
EDUCATION GRANT THROUGH THE

1251
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,787
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF

1252
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,922
OREGON. AND THESE GRANTS WERE

1253
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,289
FUNDED TO TEACH PHYSICIANS ABOUT

1254
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,792
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

1255
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,761
AND THE MONEY CAME FROM A

1256
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:23,862
CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT ON BEHALF

1257
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,296
OF MEDICAID ORGANIZATIONS FROM

1258
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,098
A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STATES

1259
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,800
RELATED TO THE IMPROPER

1260
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,335
MARKETING OF NEURONTIN

1261
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,804
OR GABAPENTIN. WHICH IS A DRUG

1262
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,072
FOR--USED FOR SEIZURES AND PAIN.

1263
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,107
>> THE DRUG NEURONTIN WAS

1264
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,308
ILLEGALLY MARKETED FOR

1265
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,343
UNAPPROVED USES. INCLUDING

1266
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,078
TREATMENT FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER.

1267
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,113
NEURONTIN HAS NO PROVEN BENEFITS

1268
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,949
FOR THIS CONDITION. WHICH LEFT

1269
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,150
THOSE TAKING THIS DRUG

1270
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,685
ESSENTIALLY UNTREATED.

1271
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,119
>> AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE

1272
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,054
COMPANY BASICALLY

1273
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,022
INAPPROPRIATELY MARKETED.

1274
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,223
AND THEY SETTLED WITH A LOT OF

1275
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,825
MONEY. AND PART OF THAT MONEY

1276
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,760
WAS USED TO FUND EDUCATIONAL

1277
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,794
PROJECTS.

1278
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,463
SO THAT'S HOW I FIRST BECAME

1279
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:58,396
INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE.

1280
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,031
AS AN OFFSHOOT OF THAT GRANT.

1281
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,000
WE--MY COLLEAGUES AND I DID

1282
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,869
A RESEARCH PROJECT LOOKING AT

1283
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:04,936
THE ADHERENCE OF PRINT

1284
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,438
ADVERTISEMENTS TO FDA

1285
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,339
GUIDELINES.

1286
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,340
>> THE BREADTH AND DEPTH TO

1287
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,876
WHICH COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN

1288
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,278
TRAINING AND EDUCATION. AND SOME

1289
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,215
OF IT IS QUITE INDIRECT.

1290
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,750
AND SOME IS QUITE DIRECT.

1291
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,318
>> YEAH. BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS

1292
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,186
A LOT OF ACADEMIA. AND THERE

1293
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,421
HAVE BEEN MANY. MANY, MANY

1294
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,990
WRITINGS ON THE FACT THAT

1295
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,357
PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN PAID TO GO

1296
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,059
TO MEETINGS. HAVE BEEN PAID TO

1297
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,361
SAY CERTAIN THINGS AT MEETINGS.

1298
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,130
TO NOT SAY CERTAIN THINGS AT

1299
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,999
MEETINGS.

1300
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:34,866
I MYSELF HAVE BEEN DISINVITED

1301
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,367
FROM MEETINGS.

1302
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,203
>> THERE WAS A STUDY NOT TOO

1303
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,038
LONG AGO OF HOW COMPANIES USE

1304
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,339
THE HIGH GROSS PROFITS FROM

1305
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,141
THEIR HIGH PRICES. AND IT

1306
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,143
INCLUDED DOCUMENTING 371.000

1307
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:49,981
PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS A YEAR FOR

1308
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,583
DOCTORS.

1309
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,818
NOW THERE ARE ONLY 1/2 MILLION

1310
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:53,585
DOCTORS WHO ARE ACTIVE IN THE

1311
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,286
UNITED STATES.

1312
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,321
SO THAT IS AN AWFUL LOT OF

1313
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,923
MEETINGS.

1314
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:58,924
>> THE BRANCH OF THE FDA THAT

1315
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,325
REGULATES MARKETING MATERIALS

1316
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,393
HAD A BUDGET IN 2008 OF

1317
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,096
$9 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY, AND

1318
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,332
THAT COMPARES WITH THE MARKETING

1319
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,167
BUDGET OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL

1320
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,368
INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES

1321
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:11,937
IS. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

1322
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,071
CALCULATE IT. ON THE ORDER OF

1323
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,205
$30 BILLION TO $60 BILLION

1324
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,440
PER YEAR.

1325
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,608
>> AND THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH

1326
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,443
AND THE GROSS PROFITS ARE SO

1327
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,045
GREAT BECAUSE AMERICAN PRICES

1328
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,013
ARE. BY FAR THE HIGHEST IN THE

1329
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,015
INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD.

1330
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,183
>> SO THIS IS BIG. BIG BUSINESS,

1331
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,285
AND THEY JUST PUT OUT A LOT OF

1332
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,588
ADVERTISING. AND INCREASINGLY SO

1333
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,057
ON THE WEB. AND THEY HAVE, YOU

1334
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:33,324
KNOW. WEB BANNERS AND SPONSORED

1335
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,560
LINKS.

1336
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,426
>> SO THE PUBLIC DOESN'T KNOW

1337
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,394
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

1338
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,963
SUBSIDIZING 39% OF ALL THE R&D

1339
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:41,066
THAT COMPANIES DO THROUGH

1340
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,668
TAX DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS

1341
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:45,370
AND TAX SUBSIDIES.

1342
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,638
>> IT'S OUR OWN TAXES AND OUR

1343
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,541
OWN RETIREMENT SAVINGS WHICH ARE

1344
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,442
FINANCING A SYSTEM WHICH IS

1345
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,479
LITERALLY LETHAL TO OUR HEALTH.

1346
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,982
>> NOT TO MENTION ANOTHER MAJOR

1347
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:59,184
SOURCE. WHICH NO ONE'S TRIED

1348
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,451
CALCULATING. WHICH IS THE

1349
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,220
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

1350
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,555
COMPANIES ACCUMULATE OVERSEAS IN

1351
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,124
TAX HAVENS TO AVOID PAYING

1352
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,526
U.S. TAX.

1353
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,961
THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT

1354
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:10,629
CONSIDER THEMSELVES VERY

1355
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,230
PATRIOTIC.

1356
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,565
THEY EVADE AMERICAN TAXES BY

1357
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,601
HARBORING BILLIONS OF PROFITS

1358
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:18,136
ABROAD. AND THEN EVERY FIVE OR

1359
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,438
SIX YEARS. THE BUSINESS HAS

1360
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:21,506
GOTTEN SO LARGE IN THESE TAX

1361
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,141
HAVENS THAT THE CONGRESS GIVES

1362
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,176
THEM A TAX HOLIDAY.

1363
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,112
>> I ONCE HELPED A REPORTER

1364
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,780
WRITE A WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT

1365
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,181
NOVARTIS. WHO IS THE MAKER OF

1366
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,083
RITALIN. AND LITERALLY HOW MUCH

1367
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,419
MONEY THEIR STOCK WOULD GO UP

1368
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,722
FOR EVERY CHILD THEY GOT ON

1369
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,023
RITALIN.

1370
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,791
>> *I AM RICH

1371
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,427
* BEYOND BELIEF

1372
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,664
* FOR THIS LOVE

1373
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,165
* YOU HAVE GIVEN ME

1374
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:51,336
>> THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THE

1375
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,470
NEW NEUROTRANSMITTER HAD BEEN

1376
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,172
FOUND CALLED SEROTONIN.

1377
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,641
SO ELI LILLY IMMEDIATELY WENT TO

1378
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,343
STUDY RATS TO FIND A PILL THAT

1379
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,545
WOULD DO SOMETHING. CHANGE,

1380
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,381
THAT IS. CAUSE A DEFECT IN THE

1381
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,583
NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEM

1382
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,218
SO THAT IT COULD BE CLAIMED TO

1383
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,453
FIX IT.

1384
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,455
AND THEY CAME UP WITH PROZAC.

1385
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,457
WHICH BLOCKS THE EFFECTIVE

1386
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,626
FUNCTIONING OF THE SYSTEM BY

1387
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:17,162
STOPPING THE REMOVAL OF

1388
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,563
SEROTONIN FROM ITS ACTIVE PLACE

1389
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,199
IN THE BRAIN AND FLOODING THE

1390
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,469
BRAIN WITH IT.

1391
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:25,637
THEY FOUND QUICKLY THAT PROZAC

1392
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,239
CAUSED SO MUCH AGITATION IN

1393
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,308
PATIENTS THAT THEY HAD TO GIVE

1394
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,843
THE PATIENTS TRANQUILIZERS. OR

1395
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,912
THEY'D DROP OUT OF THE STUDIES.

1396
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,181
WELL. WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO

1397
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:37,916
APPROVING THE DRUG. THEY

1398
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,152
COULDN'T FIND A BENEFICIAL

1399
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,388
EFFECT UNLESS THEY INCLUDED THE

1400
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,290
TRANQUILIZED PATIENTS.

1401
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,425
SO THE FDA FORGAVE ELI LILLY

1402
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,195
FOR CHEATING AND APPROVED

1403
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:53,198
ELI LILLY'S DRUG PROZAC WHEN

1404
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,500
THEY REALLY WERE APPROVING--

1405
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,235
THEY DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY THIS--

1406
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,336
REALLY APPROVING PROZAC WITH ITS

1407
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,939
AGITATION COVERED OVER BY

1408
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,941
ADDICTIVE TRANQUILIZING DRUGS.

1409
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:06,377
SO. AS THE MEDICAL EXPERT,

1410
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:10,381
WE FINALLY HAD OUR FIRST TRIAL.

1411
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,484
NOW. I WONDERED WHY--WHY WOULD

1412
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,220
THIS BE THE FIRST TRIAL THAT WE

1413
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,621
WOULD BRING OUT OF THE 150.

1414
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,223
BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT

1415
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,958
CASE.

1416
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:20,826
THIS MAN. JOSEPH WESBECKER, HAD

1417
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:22,327
BEEN PARANOID AND HATEFUL

1418
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,629
AND THREATENING TOWARD PEOPLE AT

1419
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,831
WORK BEFORE HE WAS PUT ON

1420
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:26,932
PROZAC.

1421
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,834
THAT'S NOT THE BEST CASE.

1422
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,335
BUT WHEN HE WAS PUT ON PROZAC.

1423
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,803
WITHIN DAYS. HE GOT PSYCHOTIC,

1424
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:32,670
AND HE KILLED A DOZEN PEOPLE AND

1425
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,406
INJURED 20 AT HIS PLACE OF WORK.

1426
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,576
SO I WAS GONNA TESTIFY THAT IT

1427
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,746
WASN'T THAT PROZAC JUST CAUSED

1428
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:42,547
THIS. BUT PROZAC TIPPED HIM

1429
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:43,749
OVER.

1430
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:44,615
WELL. I GET READY TO HAVE THE

1431
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,051
TRIAL. AND MY--THE LAWYER ON OUR

1432
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,987
SIDE ISN'T PREPARING ME.

1433
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,723
HE'S NOT SENDING ME ANYMORE

1434
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:52,690
MATERIALS.

1435
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,592
I ARRIVE IN LOUISVILLE. AND THE

1436
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,394
LAWYER FOR OUR SIDE. WHO'S SUING

1437
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,329
LILLY. IS HIDING DOCUMENTS

1438
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,798
FROM ME.

1439
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:00,966
I WAS THROWN ON THE STAND WITH

1440
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:02,433
NO PREPARATION.

1441
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,634
I GAVE THE LAWYER 20 OR 30

1442
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,537
NOTE CARDS BEFORE I WENT ON THE

1443
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,973
STAND AND SAID. "YOU'VE GOT TO

1444
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:08,974
ASK ME THESE QUESTIONS."

1445
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:10,341
HE GOT MAD AT ME.

1446
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,410
WELL. IT WAS VERY HARD TO

1447
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,812
TESTIFY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS.

1448
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:15,814
AS IT WAS. LILLY ALMOST LOST

1449
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,448
THE CASE.

1450
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,116
IT WAS A 9-3 VOTE. WHICH ALLOWED

1451
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,418
THEM TO WIN.

1452
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,586
ONE MORE VOTE AGAINST THEM. AND

1453
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,088
THEY WOULD HAVE LOST.

1454
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,422
BIG HEADLINES: "LILLY WINS ITS

1455
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,057
CASE."

1456
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,859
AND ALL THE OTHER LAWYERS

1457
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,460
STARTED TO SETTLE FROM THE 150

1458
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,996
OR MORE OTHER CASES.

1459
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:32,630
WELL. THE JUDGE FIGURED OUT THAT

1460
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,167
THIS TRIAL HAD BEEN FIXED.

1461
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,703
HE CALLED TOGETHER ELI LILLY AND

1462
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:41,606
MR. SMITH. WHO WAS THE LAWYER

1463
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,009
FOR THE PLAINTIFFS. AND SAID

1464
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:45,743
THAT. "WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO?"

1465
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,479
AND THEY SAID. "IT'S NONE OF

1466
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,848
YOUR BUSINESS."

1467
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:50,982
SO NOW THE JUDGE IS UP AGAINST

1468
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:54,519
BOTH PARTIES ON THE TRIAL.

1469
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,987
SO THE JUDGE INVESTIGATES.

1470
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,923
AND HE FINDS OUT THAT OUR SIDE

1471
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:00,458
WAS INDEED PAID OFF IN ORDER TO

1472
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,193
PRESENT A WEAK CASE SO LILLY

1473
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,995
COULD WIN.

1474
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,130
AND OUR SIDE TRIED TO DISCREDIT

1475
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,631
ME IN COURT. MY OWN SIDE TRIED

1476
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,033
TO DISCREDIT ME IN COURT.

1477
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,667
BECAUSE LILLY NEEDED TO WIN THE

1478
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:10,869
CASE. AND THEY NEEDED TO

1479
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:11,837
DISCREDIT PETER BREGGIN.

1480
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,738
BECAUSE I WAS THEIR ONLY REAL

1481
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:14,639
OPPOSITION IN THE WORLD.

1482
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:48,006

>> SOME DOCTORS. INCLUDING

1500
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,062
MYSELF. GET FRUSTRATED WITH THE

1501

FDA SOMETIMES. BECAUSE THERE ARE

MEDICATIONS THAT WORK WELL IN

1503

EUROPE AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

1504
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,036
HAVE BEEN OUT FOR YEARS. BUT IT

1505
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,237
TAKES ANOTHER 10. 12 YEARS TO

1506
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,405
GET APPROVED IN THIS COUNTRY.

1507
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,706
SO IN MANY WAYS. THEY'RE VERY

1508
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,442
CAREFUL. AND THE PROCESS IS VERY

1509
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,244
SLOW.

1510
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,111
BUT IN OTHER SITUATIONS.

1511
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,812
CERTAIN DRUGS ARE FAST TRACKED.

1512
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,414
SO WHEN YOU--WHEN YOU LOOK AT

1513
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,016
SITUATIONS LIKE FEN-PHEN.

1514
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,351
A DRUG THAT WAS REALLY POPULAR

1515
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,685
IN THE '90s FOR WEIGHT LOSS.

1516
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:08,954
PEOPLE--A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED

1517
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:10,855
FROM THAT DRUG.

1518
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:12,723
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL ALIVE

1519
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,459
NOW THAT ARE HAVING LONG-TERM

1520
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,294
HEART PROBLEMS FROM THAT--

1521
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,828
FROM THAT DRUG COMBINATION.

1522
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:18,729
THEY KNEW BEFORE THAT DRUG WAS

1523
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,965
RELEASED THAT THERE WAS

1524
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:20,999
A PROBLEM.

1525
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:21,899
PEOPLE IN THAT PARTICULAR

1526
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,734
COMPANY KNEW.

1527
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,936
INFORMATION WAS SUPPRESSED.

1528
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:27,005
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH R&D.

1529
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,374
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

1530
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:30,908
TO GET A DRUG BROUGHT TO MARKET.

1531
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,310
IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS.

1532
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,379
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE

1533
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,380
SPENT DOING THIS PROCESS.

1534
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,248
SO WHEN THAT DRUG GETS READY TO

1535
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,349
BE RELEASED BY THE FDA.

1536
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,485
IT IS A BIG DEAL IF IT DOES NOT

1537
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,387
GET RELEASED. BECAUSE THEY'VE

1538
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:43,521
ALREADY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY.

1539
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,890
AND REMEMBER. PHARMACEUTICAL

1540
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,158
COMPANIES ARE FOR PROFIT.

1541
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:49,227
THEY'RE NOT NON-PROFIT. GOOD,

1542
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,462
YOU KNOW. TOUCHY-FEELY

1543
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,830
CORPORATIONS.

1544
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,499
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY.

1545
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,001
>> I REMEMBER I TOLD MY SON.

1546
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:56,767
"DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE

1547
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,935
DOING TO YOURSELF?"

1548
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,371
"MOM. YOU KNOW, I--THESE--

1549
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,141
THEY GOT 'EM FROM A DOCTOR.

1550
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:04,109
A DOCTOR'S NOT GONNA GIVE YOU

1551
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,076
ANYTHING BAD."

1552
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,178
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE IT

1553
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,179
IN THEIR HEAD OF. "OKAY, WELL,

1554
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,214
I'M NOT BUYING IT ON THE STREET.

1555
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,415
I'M NOT BUYING IT FROM THE DRUG

1556
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:11,416
DEALER ON THE CORNER.

1557
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,917
I'M NOT BUYING IT FROM--

1558
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,585
YOU KNOW. IN AN ALLEY SOMEWHERE.

1559
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,354
I'M GOING INTO A DOCTOR'S

1560
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:17,322
OFFICE. AND I'M BUYING

1561
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:18,356
MEDICATION.

1562
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,359
AND IT'S FINE.

1563
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,227
WHY WOULD HE GIVE ME SOMETHING

1564
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:23,194
THAT'S GONNA HURT ME?"

1565
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,062
>> THE FOOD AND DRUG

1566
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,196
ADMINISTRATION BECAME

1567
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,564
RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTIFYING DRUGS

1568
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:30,868
AS BEING SAFE AND THEN.

1569
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:33,971
EVENTUALLY. FOR BEING SAFE

1570
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,441
AND EFFECTIVE. WHICH MEANS

1571
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,109
THAT NO DRUG--NO PRESCRIPTION

1572
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,644
DRUG. NO ANY KIND OF MEDICAL

1573
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,279
DRUG CAN BE LICENSED FOR PUBLIC

1574
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,980
USE IN THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT

1575
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,615
THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FDA.

1576
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,119
NOW. THAT'S A VERY STRONG PIECE

1577
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,156
TO HAVE ON THE BOARD. A VERY

1578
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,390
STRONG POSITION TO HAVE.

1579
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,192
>> THE FDA HAS BUILT UP IN

1580
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,594
STRENGTH AND DEPTH EACH TIME

1581
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:59,530
AROUND A DRUG DISASTER WHERE

1582
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,366
A MANUFACTURER HAS PUT A REALLY

1583
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,268
DANGEROUS DRUG OUT THERE AND NOT

1584
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:05,503
WITHDRAWN IT QUICKLY. AND THAT'S

1585
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,205
LED TO CONGRESSIONAL

1586
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,373
INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN

1587
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,075
A RAMPING UP OF THE REGULATORY

1588
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:11,576
BODY.

1589
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,444
>> I THINK AT SOME TIMES IN

1590
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,246
ITS HISTORY. THE FDA HAS BEEN

1591
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,148
VERY IMPORTANT IN THE REGULATION

1592
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,650
AND MONITORING OF MEDICATIONS IN

1593
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,652
THE COUNTRY.

1594
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:22,687
UNFORTUNATELY. IT, TOO, HAS BEEN

1595
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,955
CO-OPTED BY THE INDUSTRY.

1596
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,357
HAS BEEN HAPPENING GRADUALLY

1597
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,293
OVER THE LAST 20 YEAR--REALLY.

1598
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:30,495
OVER 30 YEARS.

1599
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,029
>> A LOT OF TIMES. YOU HAVE

1600
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,698
DRUGS THAT MAYBE SHOULDN'T EVEN

1601
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,333
BE ON THE MARKET AT ALL GET PUT

1602
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,202
ON THE MARKET. AND PEOPLE START

1603
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,403
DYING. AND PEOPLE START HAVING

1604
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,071
SIDE EFFECTS. BUT NOTHING REALLY

1605
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,472
HAPPENS UNTIL AT LEAST THEY'VE

1606
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,508
RECOUPED MONEY. MADE A PROFIT.

1607
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:45,310
THEN THE FDA COMES RIDING IN ON

1608
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,011
A WHITE HORSE AND PULLS THE VERY

1609
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,046
SAME DRUG THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE

1610
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,048
BEEN ON THE MARKET IN THE FIRST

1611
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
PLACE OFF THE MARKET.

1612
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,551
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHENEVER

1613
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,653
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY MONITORS

1614
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:59,124
AN OUTSIDE ACTIVITY. IT IS

1615
00:50:59,124 --> 00:51:01,192
EVENTUALLY BOUGHT AND CONTROLLED

1616
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,661
BY THAT WHICH IT MONITORS.

1617
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,097
>> SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

1618
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,732
VERY HARDWORKING. CONSCIENTIOUS,

1619
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,335
HIGHLY TRAINED PEOPLE AT THE

1620
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:11,802
FDA. ESPECIALLY THE REVIEWERS,

1621
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,439
WHO ARE GREAT PUBLIC SERVANTS.

1622
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:17,375
ONE PATTERN THAT WE HAVE FOUND

1623
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,111
IN RECENT TIMES BUT GOES BACK

1624
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,513
TO THE '70s. I'VE FOUND,

1625
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,383
IS SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERRIDING

1626
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:30,555
WORRIES AND WARNINGS BY THEIR

1627
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,157
OWN REVIEWERS. BASICALLY

1628
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:33,691
APPROVING A DRUG THAT THEIR OWN

1629
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,262
REVIEWERS SAY SHOULD NOT BE

1630
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,496
APPROVED BECAUSE IT'S TOO

1631
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:39,430
DANGEROUS TO GO ONTO THE MARKET.

1632
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,266
>> IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR

1633
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,833
THE FDA TO GET PHYSICIANS

1634
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,335
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT PAY ANYWHERE

1635
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,671
NEAR AS MUCH AS MOST PHYSICIANS

1636
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,473
WOULD MAKE IN AN ACADEMIC

1637
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,707
MEDICAL CENTER OR CERTAINLY AS

1638
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,409
THEY WOULD MAKE IN THE DRUG

1639
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:52,577
INDUSTRY.

1640
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:53,444
THEY GET DOCTORS AND THERE ARE

1641
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,345
A LOT OF VERY DEDICATED

1642
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,281
PHYSICIANS AT THE FDA.

1643
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,183
BUT FREQUENTLY. THE MOST

1644
00:51:58,183 --> 00:51:59,184
DEDICATED ONES ARE DRIVEN OUT

1645
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:01,619
BECAUSE THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT

1646
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,322
THE DANGERS OF DRUGS ARE

1647
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,456
OVERTURNED.

1648
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,357
WE DID A STUDY OF PHYSICIANS AT

1649
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,925
THE FDA IN 1998.

1650
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,328
BETWEEN THEM. THEY CITED 27

1651
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,563
INSTANCES IN WHICH A DRUG THAT

1652
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,432
THEY THOUGHT WAS TOO DANGEROUS

1653
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:16,201
TO BE APPROVED WAS APPROVED OVER

1654
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:17,802
THEIR HEAD. GOT ON THE MARKET,

1655
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,704
AND IN MANY CASES. THE DRUGS

1656
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,506
HAVE NOW BEEN TAKEN OFF

1657
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:22,407
THE MARKET.

1658
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:23,274
SO IF YOU ARE GOING INTO THE

1659
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,775
GOVERNMENT WANTING TO ENGAGE IN

1660
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,645
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. BEING

1661
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,247
WILLING TO TAKE A LOWER SALARY.

1662
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:31,549
AND YET YOU'RE BEING THWARTED

1663
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,218
FROM YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION

1664
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:34,452
BECAUSE YOUR BOSSES ARE

1665
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,786
OVERTURNING YOU PARTLY BECAUSE

1666
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,855
THEY DON'T WANT TO DISPLEASE

1667
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:38,989
THE DRUG INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT

1668
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,858
A VERY WELCOME ATMOSPHERE.

1669
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,627
>> AND SO TREMENDOUS

1670
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:43,961
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY INFLUENCE

1671
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,497
HAS BEEN EXERTED ON THE FDA TO

1672
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,999
APPROVE DRUGS MANUFACTURED BY

1673
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,503
THESE COMPANIES AS SAFE AND

1674
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,871
EFFECTIVE. NATURALLY.

1675
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,506
>> THE RHETORIC OF THE INDUSTRY

1676
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,007
IS. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE

1677
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,577
CAN TO GET LIFE-SAVING DRUGS TO

1678
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,946
PATIENTS WHO NEED THEM AS

1679
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,848
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

1680
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,650
AND THAT RHETORIC PREVAILS.

1681
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,685
THAT'S WHAT CONGRESSMEN BELIEVE

1682
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,020
AND JOURNALISTS BELIEVE

1683
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,822
AND SO FORTH.

1684
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,691
THE REALITY IS THE FOLLOWING:

1685
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,493
THAT--THAT SEVERAL INDEPENDENT

1686
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:17,462
OF SIX NEW DRUGS. ABOUT 85% OF

1687
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:19,830
NEW DRUGS. ARE LITTLE OR NO

1688
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,467
BETTER THAN EXISTING DRUGS

1689
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,535
AGAINST CLINICAL MEASURES.

1690
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,737
THEY CAN'T BE LIFE-SAVING.

1691
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,706
BECAUSE THEY'RE NO---THEY'RE

1692
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,375
LITTLE OR NO BETTER.

1693
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,776
>> AND A FEW YEARS AGO.

1694
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,177
THE INDUSTRY WAS SUCCESSFUL IN

1695
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,879
GETTING THE TIME TO REVIEW OF

1696
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,714
MEDICATIONS REDUCED SO THAT

1697
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,518
THE FDA COULD GO THROUGH ITS

1698
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:41,919
REVIEW PROCESS MORE QUICKLY.

1699
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:43,488
AND THAT'S BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH

1700
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:46,056
A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF APPROVAL

1701
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,625
OF DRUGS. A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF

1702
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,528
APPROVAL OF DANGEROUS DRUGS.

1703
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,497
>> THE VIOXX DISASTER LED THE

1704
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:54,765
FDA AND CONGRESS AND LEADING

1705
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:57,134
POLICY RESEARCHERS TO BECOME

1706
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:59,870
VERY SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT

1707
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,540
HOW UNSAFE DRUGS WERE.

1708
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,542
>> VIOXX IS A DRUG MADE BY MERCK

1709
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,544
THAT WAS TOUTED AS BEING GENTLER

1710
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:09,814
ON THE STOMACH.

1711
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,882
IT'S A PAINKILLER.

1712
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,284
AND IN THEIR EFFORT TO PROVE

1713
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:14,685
THAT IT WAS GENTLE ON THE

1714
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:18,456
STOMACH. THE COMPANY. MERCK,

1715
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,857
DID A STUDY.

1716
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,426
HALF THE PEOPLE GOT VIOXX AND

1717
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,827
HALF OF THEM GOT ANOTHER

1718
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,629
PAINKILLER. NAPROXEN. WHICH HAS

1719
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,030
BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR A LONG

1720
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,165
TIME.

1721
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,567
THE PEOPLE THAT GOT VIOXX HAD

1722
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,968
FOUR TIMES MORE HEART ATTACKS

1723
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,403
THAN THE PEOPLE THAT GOT

1724
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,771
NAPROXEN.

1725
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,172
WHEN THAT STUDY WAS PUBLISHED.

1726
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:36,574
WE LOOKED AT THE STUDY.

1727
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,008
IT WAS PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER

1728
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,377
OF 2000.

1729
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,778
IT WAS NO MORE EFFECTIVE AS A

1730
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,179
PAINKILLER THAN A LOT OF OTHER

1731
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:43,581
DRUGS THAT DIDN'T CAUSE

1732
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:44,982
HEART ATTACKS.

1733
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,384
IT TOOK THE FDA SEVERAL YEARS

1734
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:47,818
AND YET ANOTHER STUDY SHOWING

1735
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,186
THAT IT CAUSED HEART ATTACKS TO

1736
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,588
GET THE DRUG TAKEN OFF THE

1737
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:51,989
MARKET.

1738
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,424
MERCK PUSHED THE FDA ALL OVER

1739
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,825
THE PLACE TO THE POINT WHERE

1740
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,193
THEY DIDN'T EVEN PUT AN ADEQUATE

1741
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,595
WARNING. LET ALONE TAKE IT OFF

1742
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,996
THE MARKET.

1743
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:00,398
>> AND IT STARTS WITH SOMETHING

1744
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,832
THE FDA IS NOT ATTENDING TO:

1745
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,233
HAVING COMPANIES TEST THEIR OWN

1746
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,102
PRODUCTS. AND THEY NATURALLY

1747
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,204
WANT TO DESIGN THOSE TESTS TO

1748
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,907
MINIMIZE EVIDENCE OF HARMFUL

1749
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,876
SIDE EFFECTS AND MAXIMIZE

1750
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:13,978
EVIDENCE OF BENEFITS SO THEIR

1751
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,580
DRUGS WILL BE APPROVED.

1752
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,015
>> IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT

1753
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,417
CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE

1754
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,818
SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY ARE FAR

1755
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,219
MORE LIKELY TO BE POSITIVE.

1756
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,888
TO SORT OF FIND THAT THE DRUG

1757
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,322
WORKS AS COMPARED WITH PUBLICLY

1758
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,724
FUNDED STUDIES THAT ARE FUNDED

1759

BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF

1760

FOUNDATIONS.

1762
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,297
>> THOSE TRIALS NOT ONLY ARE

1763
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,699
MISLEADING IN THEIR RESULTS

1764
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,100
AND THEREFORE MISLEAD THE REVIEW

1765
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,603
PROCESS. BUT THEY DON'T PROVIDE

1766
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,738
USEFUL INFORMATION TO CLINICIANS

1767
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,740
ON HOW TO USE THE DRUG.

1768
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,842
>> WHEN THESE SO-CALLED DRUGS

1769
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,276
ARE APPROVED ON THE BASIS OF

1770
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,780
THEIR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL.

1771
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,348
THEY'RE USED IN PRACTICE WITHOUT

1772
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,150
ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

1773
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,719
THERE IS NO INFORMATION SYSTEM

1774
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,120
THAT SYSTEMATICALLY LOOKS FOR

1775

THE IMPACT OF THESE APPROVED

1776

MEDICATIONS ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH.

1777
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,992
SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING.

1778
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:04,228
WE'RE NOT HOLDING OURSELVES

1779

ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT WE'RE

1780
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,031
PRESCRIBING IN THE FIELD OF

1781
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,433
MEDICAL CARE.

1782
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:09,834
>> YOU HAVE LOBBYISTS.

1783
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,235
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE

1784
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:12,637
FDA WHO EVENTUALLY GO TO WORK

1785

FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL

1786
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,440
COMPANIES. AND SOME OF THEM

1787
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,841
COME BACK AND WORK FOR THE FDA.

1788

COMPANY.

1792
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,751
PERFECT POSITION FOR A REGULATOR

1793
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:28,185
TO GO TO FROM THE COMPANY'S

1794

POINT OF VIEW.

1795
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:31,822

1796
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,223
HIGHWAYS.

1797
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,392
>> INCREASINGLY. PARTICULARLY

1798
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,794
SINCE 1992. MOST OF THE FUNDING

1799
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:38,195
FOR REVIEWING DRUGS COMES

1800
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,998
DIRECTLY IN CASH PAYMENTS FROM

1801
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,733
THE DRUG INDUSTRY TO THE FDA.

1802
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,469
IT'S A MASSIVE AND ALMOST

1803
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,037
LUDICROUS CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

1804
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,006
BUT IT'S ONE THAT WAS PASSED BY

1805
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,508
CONGRESS AS A WAY OF BALANCING

1806
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,877
THE BUDGET.

1807
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,912
THEY PAY UPWARDS OF $800.000.

1808
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,313
$900.000 PER DRUG.

1809
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:58,783
THEY HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY

1810
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:01,018
WHETHER THE FDA APPROVES THE

1811
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,419
DRUG OR NOT. BUT IT CREATES

1812
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,821
A WHOLE ATTITUDE. A DIFFERENT

1813
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,222
ATTITUDE THAN USED TO EXIST

1814
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,991
BEFORE 1992.

1815
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:08,392
AS TO HOW MUCH POLICING THE FDA

1816
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:10,327
HAS DONE.

1817
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:13,363
>> THAT INEVITABLY IS GOING TO

1818
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,765
MEAN THAT THE FDA PROCESS IS

1819
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,967
GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE

1820
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,470
MONEY THAT THEY GET.

1821
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,938
THE SIZE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

1822
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,339
WORKING IN THE FDA ON MOVING THE

1823

APPROVAL OF DRUGS FORWARD.

1824
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,978
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE DOING

1825
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,415
THAT. AND YOU HAVE LESS PEOPLE

>> BASICALLY. COMPANIES. THROUGH

1831
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,726
THEIR LOBBYING. GOT CONGRESS TO

1832
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:44,495
AGREE THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR

1833

THE FDA.

1834
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,232
THEY GET QUICKER APPROVALS.

1835
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:51,435
THAT MEANS THEY MAKE BILLIONS

1836
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,203
MORE IN REVENUES AND PROFITS.

1837
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,005
AND IN RETURN. MORE PEOPLE GET

1838
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,974
SERIOUSLY ILL. HOSPITALIZED.

1839
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,375
AND DIE.

1840
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,777
>> BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASED THE

1841
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,178
NUMBER OF DRUGS. WE'VE INCREASED

1842
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:02,580
THE ADVERSE EVENT RATES FROM

1843
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,915
DRUGS FOUR TIMES THAN WE'VE

1844
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,617
INCREASED THE PRESCRIPTION RATE.

1845
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:08,285
SO THAT THE ADVERSE EVENT RATE--

1846
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:09,687
EVENT RATES FOR MEDICATIONS ARE

1847
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:11,088
GETTING BIGGER AND NOT SMALLER.

1848
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,657
AND FOR SOME MEDICATIONS.

1849
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,125
WE'VE INCREASED THE ADVERSE

1850
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,527
EVENT RATES 16 TIMES WHAT IT WAS

1851
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:17,928
TEN YEARS AGO.

1852
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,329
SO THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY

1853
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,731
MIND THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS--

1854
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,132
STRONG EVIDENCE--THAT ADVERSE

1855
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,168
EVENTS FROM MEDICATIONS ARE THE

1856
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,403
FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH.

1857
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,438
I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE

1858
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:35,279
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

1859
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,981
ASSOCIATION TEN YEARS AGO.

1860
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:38,382
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. THE

1861
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:39,784
ARTICLE WAS ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED

1862
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,385
TO ANOTHER JOURNAL--A VERY

1863
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:43,087
HIGH-LEVEL. PREMIER JOURNAL.

1864
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,989
WHICH REJECTED IT ON THE GROUNDS

1865
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,523
THAT NOBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED

1866
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,693
IN IT.

1867
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,094
IT WAS AN ARTICLE THAT

1868
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:52,296
DOCUMENTED THE FACT THAT THE

1869
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:53,698
UNITED STATES RANKED VERY POORLY

1870
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:55,365
ON HEALTH LEVELS WITH REGARD TO

1871
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,067
OTHER COMPARABLE COUNTRIES--

1872
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,703
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN THE

1873
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:01,572
WORLD.

1874
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:03,440
AND IT ALSO DOCUMENTED THE FACT

1875
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,842
THAT WE HAD A VERY HIGH RATE OF

1876
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,243
ADVERSE EVENTS FROM THE USE OF

1877
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,645
VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS IN THE

1878
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,414
HEALTH CARE FIELD.

1879
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,549
AND SINCE THAT ARTICLE WAS

1880
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,351
PUBLISHED 11 YEARS AGO. I HAVE

1881
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:15,753
CONTINUED TO GET REQUESTS FOR

1882
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,422
REPRINTS.

1883
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,157
I STILL GET ABOUT FIVE REQUESTS

1884
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,558
FOR REPRINTS EVERY WEEK.

1885
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,160
THE ARTICLE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF

1886
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,062
ATTENTION. MOSTLY. I THINK,

1887
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,031
FROM LAYPEOPLE. ALMOST NO

1888
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,833
ATTENTION FROM GOVERNMENT.

1889
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:32,202
I HAVE NEVER BEEN CONTACTED BY

1890
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,704
THE FDA TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'VE

1891
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,840
DONE OR TO EXPLORE THE

1892
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,475
RAMIFICATIONS.

1893
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,110
AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE

1894
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,613
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO KNOW THAT

1895
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,850
MEDICATIONS CAN BE HARMFUL AND

1896
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,118
THAT THEY. IN FACT. MAY ACCOUNT

1897
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:50,520
AT LEAST IN PART FOR THE FACT

1898
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,757
THAT WE DON'T DO VERY WELL

1899
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:54,524
INTERNATIONALLY IN OUR HEALTH

1900
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,926
LEVELS.

1901
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,862
>> SO HOW IS THE CARTEL GOING TO

1902
00:59:57,862 --> 00:59:59,263
PRESENT ITSELF AS. REALLY.

1903
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,098
THE ONE AND ONLY SOLUTION TO

1904
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,400
THE PROBLEM OF ILLNESS?

1905
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,270
THROUGH MEDIA.

1906
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,806
>> COULD YOU IMAGINE A SOCIETY

1907
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,240
WHERE PEOPLE ADVERTISED.

1908
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,242
YOU KNOW. HEROIN ON TELEVISION?

1909
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,644
YOU KNOW. "I GOT BLUE MAGIC.

1910
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,846
DA DA DA DA DA.

1911
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:18,482
CALL THIS NUMBER OR. YOU KNOW.

1912
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:19,884
THIS WEBSITE."

1913
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:21,285
YOU KNOW. LIKE. THAT'S FUNNY,

1914
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,687
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T IMAGINE

1915
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,088
THAT.

1916
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,489
BUT YOU NOW HAVE PHARMACEUTICAL

1917
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,891
COMPANIES SELLING DRUGS THROUGH

1918
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,292
COMMERCIALS ON TELEVISION.

1919
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,694
BILLBOARDS. AND SUCH.

1920
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:31,095
>> THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF

1921
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:32,496
VERY FEW COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

1922
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,898
IN WHICH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

1923
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,332
ADVERTISING IS LEGAL. AND IT'S

1924
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,734
CONSIDERED A FREE SPEECH RIGHT

1925
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:39,269
IN THE U.S.. AND IT'S PROTECTED

1926
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,871
AS A FREE SPEECH RIGHT HERE.

1927
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,572
PROPONENTS OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

1928
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:43,974
ADVERTISING SAY THAT IT HELPS

1929
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,375
FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

1930
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,411
DOCTORS AND PATIENTS. THAT IT

1931
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:49,346
INFORMS PATIENTS OF THINGS AND

1932
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,748
SORT OF HELPS THEM TO BE ABLE

1933
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,149
TO TALK ABOUT THEM WITH THEIR

1934
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,550
DOCTORS.

1935
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,952
AND THERE ACTUALLY IS SOME

1936
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,353
EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S TRUE.

1937
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,755
THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE THAT IT--

1938
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:59,156
IT INCREASES PRESCRIBING OF

1939
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,557
ADVERTISED DRUGS. AND.

1940
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:01,959
OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW. THE

1941
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,360
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ARE

1942
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,762
PRETTY SMART.

1943
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,163
AND THEY WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT

1944
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,564
DIDN'T WORK.

1945
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:08,966
>> THERE'S NO COUNTERBALANCE TO

1946
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,367
THAT.

1947
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,769
SO IN OTHER WORDS. WHEN A PERSON

1948
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:13,170
IS WATCHING TELEVISION AND THEY

1949
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,571
SEE THIS AD COMES ON. AND THEY

1950
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:15,973
SAY. "ARE YOU NOT GETTING ENOUGH

1951
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,374
SLEEP AT NIGHT?

1952
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,776
ARE YOU RESTLESS?

1953
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,177
ARE YOU ANXIOUS?

1954
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,578
YOU HAVING PROBLEMS IN THE

1955
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:22,980
BEDROOM?

1956
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,381
ALMOST ANYBODY WATCHING THESE

1957
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,783
COMMERCIALS CAN RELATE TO SOME

1958
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,184
OF THESE PROBLEMS AT SOME POINT

1959
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,585
IN TIME. AND THEN ALL THE WHILE.

1960
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:29,987
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL COMMERCIALS

1961
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,388
ROLLING. PEOPLE IN SLOW MOTION.

1962
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:32,790
FROLICKING THROUGH THE FOREST.

1963
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,191
HOLDING HANDS. BEAUTIFUL MUSIC.

1964
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,592
YOU HAVE A GUY READING IN A VERY

1965
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:36,994
LOW VOICE OF ALL THE POTENTIAL

1966
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,395
SIDE EFFECTS.

1967
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,797
BUT OUR VISUAL--THERE'S A VISUAL

1968
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,198
DISCONNECT.

1969
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,599
WE HAVE THE SIDE EFFECTS BEING

1970
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,001
READ REALLY LOW VOLUME AND

1971
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,402
FAST. AND YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE

1972
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,804
THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE JUST

1973
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,205
ENJOYING THEIR LIFE.

1974
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,606
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT END UP

1975
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,008
GOING TO THEIR DOCTOR'S BASED ON

1976
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,409
A COMMERCIAL. ASKING FOR A PILL.

1977
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:53,811
>> HIGH FEVER. STIFF MUSCLES.

1978
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,380
AND CONFUSION TO ADDRESS A

1979
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,782
POSSIBLE LIFE-THREATENING

1980
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:59,183
CONDITION. OR IF YOU HAVE

1981
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,584
UNCONTROLLABLE MUSCLE MOVEMENTS.

1982
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,986
AS THESE COULD BECOME PERMANENT.

1983
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:03,387
HIGH BLOOD SUGAR HAS BEEN

1984
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,789
REPORTED WITH ABILIFY AND

1985
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:06,190
MEDICINES LIKE IT.

1986
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,591
IN SOME CASES. EXTREME HIGH

1987
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:08,993
BLOOD SUGAR CAN LEAD TO COMA OR

1988
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:10,394
DEATH.

1989
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,796
OTHER RISKS INCLUDE DECREASES...

1990
01:02:11,796 --> 01:02:13,197
>> THE--THE FDA GUIDELINES ARE

1991
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:14,598
KIND OF LEGALISTIC. BUT THEY'RE

1992
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,000
ALSO VERY. VERY VAGUE.

1993
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,401
SO THEY DON'T PARTICULARLY

1994
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,803
MANDATE THE PRESENCE OF

1995
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,204
IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

1996
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,605
THEY JUST MANDATE THE ABSENCE OF

1997
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,007
OVERTLY MISLEADING INFORMATION.

1998
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:24,408
BECAUSE THE FDA IS SO UNABLE TO

1999
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,543
LOOK AT ALL OF THE MARKETING

2000
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,612
MATERIALS THAT ARE OUT THERE. WE

2001
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,480
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

2002
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,882
THE ADHERENCE OF MATERIALS TO

2003
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:33,283
THEIR GUIDELINES.

2004
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,852
SO WHAT WE FOUND IN THE CASE OF

2005
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,253
CONSUMER-DIRECTED ADS IS THAT

2006
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,654
RELATIVELY FEW OF THE ADS WERE

2007
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:40,157
CLEARLY ADHERENT.

2008
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,626
BUT MOST OF THE TIME. THAT WAS

2009
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:44,428
BECAUSE OF INCOMPLETE

2010
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:45,830
INFORMATION.

2011
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,231
THEY'RE JUST WAS NOT THE

2012
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:48,632
INFORMATION PRESENT IN THE AD

2013
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,034
FOR US TO EVEN ASSESS THE

2014
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:51,435
ADHERENCE TO THE FDA GUIDELINES.

2015
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,837
WE ALSO FOUND THAT OVER 1/4 OF

2016
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:54,238
THE DRUGS THAT WERE ADVERTISED

2017
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,639
IN OUR SAMPLE HAD A BLACK BOX

2018
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,107
WARNING FROM THE FDA.

2019
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,709
SO A BLACK BOX WARNING IS AN

2020
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,145
INDICATION FROM THE FDA THAT A

2021
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,679
DRUG IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS.

2022
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,514
IF YOU ARE PRESCRIBED A DRUG.

2023
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,250
AND YOU GET THE PACKAGE'S

2024
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,651
INSERT. YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE A

2025
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,053
WARNING IN BOLD LETTERS IN A

2026
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:10,454
BLACK RECTANGLE.

2027
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,856
>> WELL. HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT THE

2028
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,257
WAY THIS COUNTRY HAS GONE OVER

2029
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:14,892
THE--MY PROFESSIONAL LIFETIME.

2030
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,894
THE FACT THAT IT'S FALLING

2031
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:20,164
FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND IN

2032
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,565
POPULATION HEALTH.

2033
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:23,267
IT'S FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER

2034
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,769
BEHIND IN PEOPLE'S SATISFACTION

2035
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,571
WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

2036
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,706
IT'S GOING FURTHER AND FURTHER

2037
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,942
BEHIND IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL

2038
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:33,543
AND. IN GENERAL. JUST SIMPLY NOT

2039
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,914
KEEPING UP WITH THE NECESSARY

2040
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:38,582
CHANGES.

2041
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:40,184
IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING. AND IT

2042
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,219
MAKES ME VERY UNHAPPY. BOTH FROM

2043
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,154
A PROFESSIONAL POINT OF VIEW AS

2044
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,591
WELL AS FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF

2045
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,060
VIEW.

2046
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,728
I KNOW THAT PROBABLY EVER SINCE

2047
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,130
I STARTED WRITING ABOUT PRIMARY

2048
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:56,200
CARE. WHICH WAS IN THE EARLY

2049
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,968
1990s. I HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY

2050
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,403
SHUT OUT OF POLICY MAKING GROUPS

2051
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,372
AND CONSULTANCIES.

2052
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:06,643
AND BASICALLY THE ONLY THING

2053
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:09,279
THAT KEEPS ME GOING IS THE FACT

2054
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,680
THAT I AM WELL REGARDED

2055
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,082
SCIENTIFICALLY AND

2056
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:13,483
PROFESSIONALLY.

2057
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:14,885
I THINK NO ONE HAS EVER MOUNTED

2058
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:16,286
A CHALLENGE TO MY USE OF

2059
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,255
EVIDENCE. AT LEAST I AM NOT

2060
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:19,890
AWARE OF IT.

2061
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,291
THEY CERTAINLY HAVEN'T DONE IT

2062
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,060
IN PROFESSIONAL MEDIA.

2063
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,461
SO I REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH

2064
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:25,862
DISSATISFACTION ABOUT THE

2065
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,198
CONTRIBUTIONS I'VE MADE TO

2066
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,900
SCHOLARSHIP AND TO KNOWLEDGE

2067
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,869
ABOUT THE WAY HEALTH CARE SHOULD

2068
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,105
BE PROVIDED. BUT IT HAS BEEN

2069
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,506
PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTING THAT MY

2070
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,208
WORK HAS NOT LED TO POSITIVE

2071
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,711
CHANGE OVER MY LIFETIME.

2072
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,014
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S

2073
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:58,963
HEALTH CARE POLICY STILL LEFT

2074
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:00,864
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN

2075
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:03,333
CHARGE.

2076
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,734
IT WAS REFORMED WITHIN THE

2077
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,470
CONTEXT OF A FOR-PROFIT SYSTEM.

2078
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,837
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE STILL

2079
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,474
RAISING THEIR RATES TO THE ROOF.

2080
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:11,875
IT ALSO DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO

2081
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,744
TOUCH THE PHARMACEUTICAL

2082
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,380
INDUSTRY. BECAUSE. ESSENTIALLY,

2083
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,781
WITH MEDICARE PART D STILL

2084
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,883
INTACT. THE PHARMACEUTICAL

2085
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:21,285
COMPANIES CAN CONTINUE TO NAME

2086
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,686
THEIR PRICE FOR PRESCRIPTION

2087
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,454
DRUGS AND GET IT.

2088
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:26,890
SO THE GOVERNMENT. THEN. HAS

2089
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,959
A DUAL BURDEN. WHICH IS MORE

2090
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,360
PRESSURE ON THE MEDICARE BUDGET

2091
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,530
THROUGH THE PHARMACEUTICAL

2092
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,066
COMPANIES TAKING A BIG CHUNK OUT

2093
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,501
OF IT AND GREATER PRESSURE ON

2094
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:40,370
THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

2095
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,940
THROUGH ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY

2096
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,443
THREE DOLLARS GOING FOR THE

2097
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,844
ACTIVITIES OF THE FOR-PROFIT

2098
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,246
SYSTEM--CORPORATE PROFITS. STOCK

2099
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:50,647
OPTIONS. EXECUTIVE SALARIES.

2100
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,049
ADVERTISING. MARKETING. THE COST

2101
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,450
OF PAPERWORK.

2102
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,851
>> I SPOKE ABOUT THE URGENT NEED

2103
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,253
FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM AND WHAT

2104
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,654
WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE IT.

2105
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:59,056
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL

2106
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,824
BE REQUIRED. I SAID. WAS THAT

2107
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,226
EVERYONE IN OUR HEALTH CARE

2108
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,627
COMMUNITY IS GONNA HAVE TO COME

2109
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,029
TOGETHER AND DO THEIR PART.

2110
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,430
IN RECENT DAYS.

DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB LEADING

THE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON THIS

2114
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,604
ISSUE...

2115
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,040
>> WHAT I'M HOLDING IS A BOTTLE

2116
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,407
OF ZYPREXA.

2117
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,842
ZYPREXA IS AN ANTI-PSYCHOTIC

2118
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:20,210
MEDICATION.

2119
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,611
IT'S VERY POPULAR. AND IT'S VERY

2120
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,047
EXPENSIVE.

2121
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:24,448
THIS AMONG SOME OF THE OTHERS.

2122
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,815
ABILIFY. CIALIS--ERECTILE

2123

DYSFUNCTION DRUGS--ARE VERY

2124
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:31,255
COMMONLY DIVERTED.

2125
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:34,224
THE REASON BEING IS. AGAIN. THE

2126
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:35,625
MEDICAL PROGRAMS AND INSURANCE

2127
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,127
PROGRAMS PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR

2128
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,096
THESE DRUGS.

2129
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:40,664
>> I'M A SALES REP FOR

2130
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,633
A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY.

2131
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,035
BEEN DOING IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

2132
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,436
AND MY JOB IS ESSENTIALLY TO

2133
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,238
SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO PHYSICIANS.

2134
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,606
YOU CAN BE FIRED FOR TALKING TO

2135
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:54,344
PHYSICIANS OFF-LABELING.

2136
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,480
NOW. DOES IT HAPPEN?

2137
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,648
IT HAPPENS OFTEN. AND IT HAPPENS

2138
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:00,050
FREQUENTLY.

2139
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,319
>> OFF-LABEL PROMOTION IN

2140
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,720
ENGLISH MEANS A DRUG COMPANY

2141
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,522
ATTEMPTING TO SELL A DRUG FOR

2142
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:09,093
A DISEASE THAT THE FDA HASN'T

2143
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:11,095
APPROVED IT FOR.

2144
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:12,729
LET'S SAY A DRUG GETS APPROVED

2145
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,131
BY THE FDA FOR ONE PURPOSE.

2146
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,532
AND IT DOESN'T SELL VERY MUCH.

2147
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,401
SO THE COMPANY SAYS. "HMM. MAYBE

2148
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,269
WE CAN PRETEND. BY ADVERTISING

2149

AND PROMOTION AND BUYING UP

2150
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,241
DOCTORS TO SPREAD THE BUZZ.

2151
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,642
THAT THIS DRUG IS ALSO GOOD FOR

2152
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,244
THE SECOND AND THIRD AND FOURTH

2153
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,246
AND FIFTH DISEASE."

2154
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:31,381
>> THEIR MARKETING IS INGENIOUS.

2155
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,782
IT IS SO ILLEGAL. IT MAKES THE

2156
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:36,019
COLOMBIAN CARTEL LOOK LIKE

2157
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:39,456
CHILD'S PLAY.

2158
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:42,492
ELI LILLY KNOWS HOW LONG IT'S

2159
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:43,893
DRUG IS PATENTED AND HOW LONG

2160
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,464
THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE A PREMIUM

2161
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:50,134
PRICE FOR THAT DRUG.

2162
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,502
AND AS SOON AS THAT DRUG GOES

2163
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,937
GENERIC. THEY NEED ANOTHER DRUG

2164
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:55,339
TO REPLACE IT TO REPLACE THOSE

2165
01:07:55,339 --> 01:07:57,441
PROFITS. BECAUSE SHAREHOLDERS

2166
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:59,143
EXPECT PROFITS AND A RETURN ON

2167
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:01,111
THEIR INVESTMENT.

2168
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,547
SO PROZAC IS GOING OFF PATENT.

2169
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,948
AND THEY NEED TO REPLACE THOSE

2170
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:08,585
PROFITS.

2171
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,086
SO THEY TAKE ZYPREXA. AND THEY

2172
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,488
DEVELOP THIS ELABORATE SCHEME TO

2173
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,157
MARKET ZYPREXA TO THE ELDERLY

2174
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,725
AND TO THE CHILDREN. TO ANYBODY

2175
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:18,528
OFF-LABEL.

2176
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,130
>> THIS IS A CRIMINAL ACT ON THE

2177
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,531
PART OF A COMPANY.

2178
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:24,168
IF THEY DO THIS. THEY'RE

2179
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:25,635
ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT SEEM AS

2180
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,003
THOUGH THIS DRUG IS SAFE ENOUGH.

2181
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,872
RELATIVE TO ITS BENEFITS.

2182
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:32,709
TO BE PROMOTED.

2183
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,711
THE FACT IS. IF IT HASN'T BEEN

2184
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:36,246
APPROVED AT ALL FOR THAT

2185
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:37,647
OFF-LABEL OR SECOND PURPOSE.

2186
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,048
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE

2187
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,385
BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE RISK

2188
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,786
OR WHETHER THE RISKS OUTWEIGH

2189
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,188
THE BENEFITS.

2190
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:45,589
IF THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF

2191
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:46,990
THAT. IT WOULD BE ON-LABEL.

2192
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,392
THE FDA WOULD GET THE EVIDENCE

2193
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:49,793
AND WOULD APPROVE IT.

2194
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,195
>> SO THE ELDERLY THAT WERE

2195
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:52,596
PLACED ON ZYPREXA DIED TERRIBLY

2196
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:53,997
PAINFUL DEATHS.

2197
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,399
ELI LILLY HAD PSYCHIATRISTS IN

2198
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,800
THEIR STAFF DEVELOP

2199
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,902
A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF THE

2200
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:02,539
DOCTORS PRESCRIBING ZYPREXA.

2201
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:05,675
THEY WOULD DIRECT THE MARKER TO

2202
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:08,512
SAY. "NO MATTER HOW DUMB YOUR

2203
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:10,847
DOCTOR IS. DON'T TALK DOWN TO

2204
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:12,916
HIM."

2205
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,419
>> PHARMACEUTICAL

2206
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:16,820
REPRESENTATIVES ARE UNIVERSALLY

2207
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,222
ATTRACTIVE.

2208
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:19,623
THEY GET RECRUITED FROM PLACES

2209
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,024
LIKE CHEERLEADING SQUADS AT BIG

2210
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:22,426
TEN SCHOOLS. IN THE CASE OF

2211
01:09:22,426 --> 01:09:23,827
WOMEN. AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT

2212
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,229
PART OF THEIR HIRING PROCESS IS

2213
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,863
THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF

2214
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,433
THE PEOPLE.

2215
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:30,834
THEY DON'T PARTICULARLY HAVE

2216
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,236
A LOT OF MEDICAL BACKGROUND.

2217
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:33,637
YOU KNOW. THEY ARE MARKETERS.

2218
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,038
BUT THEY GO TO SORT OF BOOT CAMP

2219
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:36,440
TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR DRUG.

2220
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,841
>> THEY'RE GOING TO PRIMARY CARE

2221
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,243
PHYSICIANS. WHO ARE TREATING

2222
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,644
YOU AND I. AND TELLING THEM HOW

2223
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,045
TO MANAGE THEIR PATIENTS.

2224
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:44,948
WHO MIGHT JUST HAVE A SLEEP

2225
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:48,318
DISORDER.

2226
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:49,919
>> AND I GUESS THE MOST

2227
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,321
FRUSTRATING THING TO ME TO FIND

2228
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,722
OUT IS THAT 20% OF THE PEOPLE

2229
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,123
GETTING ZYPREXA. AT LEAST IN OUR

2230
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,959
CLAIMS DATA. WERE PEOPLE THAT

2231
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,794
WERE OVER 65. FOR WHOM IT WAS

2232
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,896
OFF-LABELED.

2233
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,965
NOT ONLY THAT.

2234
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,367
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAD NEVER.

2235
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,768
IN THE DATA THAT WE HAD.

2236
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,169
HAD EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE

2237
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,571
SCHIZOPHRENIC OR BIPOLAR.

2238
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:08,972
>> THEY TAUGHT THEM TO SAY.

2239
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:10,474
"DOCTOR. WELL. DON'T YOU HAVE

2240
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:12,476
ANY PEOPLE THAT COME IN AND

2241
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:13,877
COMPLAIN. 'WELL. YOU KNOW,

2242
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,279
FINANCIALLY. WE'RE DOING--WE'RE

2243
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,680
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. AND I'M

2244
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,081
JUST STRESSED OUT RIGHT NOW'?

2245
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:22,118
ANYBODY WHO SAYS THAT WHO USES

2246
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:23,653
THESE MAGIC WORDS LIKE "STRESS."

2247
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,889
YOU CAN CONVERT THAT WORD INTO

2248
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,458
"DELUSIONAL." OKAY?

2249
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,694
YOU CAN CONVERT ANY ANXIETY THEY

2250
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:33,597
HAVE INTO A DELUSIONAL BEHAVIOR.

2251
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,366
AND AS LONG AS YOU PUT

2252
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,668
"DELUSIONAL" IN YOUR RECORD.

2253
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:40,103
THEN YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR PAYMENT

2254
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:42,839
BY A GOVERNMENT ENTITY LIKE

2255
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:46,843
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE."

2256
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,244
>> THE REASON THAT DRUG

2257
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,879
COMPANIES PRAY ON MEDICAID IS

2258
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,281
THE SAME REASON THAT BANK

2259
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,717
ROBBERS ROB BANKS.

2260
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,118
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS.

2261
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,720
AND THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

2262
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,121
OF DOLLARS IN EVEN A RELATIVELY

2263
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:00,490
SMALL STATE LIKE UTAH. WITH ITS

2264
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,759
POPULATION OF 2.5 MILLION

2265
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,695
PEOPLE.

2266
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,697
>> "IF YOU DO THAT. WE WILL PAY

2267
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:09,098
YOU TO GO ON A SPEAKING CIRCUIT

2268
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,934
TO TELL OTHER DOCTORS HOW

2269

EFFECTIVE THIS DRUG IS FOR YOUR

2270

REGULAR PATIENTS."

2271
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,876
WHAT QUALIFIES AS A SPEAKER IS.

2272
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:22,846
IF THAT DOCTOR GOT ON THE PHONE

2273
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,781
AND TALKED TO EVEN ONE OTHER

2274
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,182
DOCTOR WHO WAS SCHEDULED TO TAKE

2275
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:29,052
PART IN A TELEPHONIC CONFERENCE.

2276
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:31,688
THEY WOULD GET A CHECK.

2277
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:34,591
AND THERE WERE DOCTORS WHO WERE

2278
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,025
GETTING A LOT OF CHECKS FOR

2279
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,427
THAT.

2280
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,763
>> I SUE DRUG COMPANIES.

2281
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:41,164
I SUE THEM ON BEHALF OF

2282
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:42,566
ATTORNEYS GENERAL.

2283
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,167
I SUE THEM ON BEHALF OF

2284
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,769
MEDICAID.

2285
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:47,604
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ABOUT

2286
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,238
SIX YEARS.

2287
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,974
WE WERE REALLY THE FIRST SET OF

2288
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,142
LAWYERS TO BRING AN ATTORNEY

2289
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,612
GENERAL CASE TO TRIAL.

2290
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:58,081
WE BOUGHT--BROUGHT THAT CASE TO

2291
01:11:58,081 --> 01:11:59,816
TRIAL IN ALASKA.

2292
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,217
TWO WEEKS INTO TRIAL AND SHORTLY

2293
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:02,686
BEFORE THE JURY OUT--WENT OUT.

2294
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,688
WE SETTLED THE CASE FOR

2295
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,155
$15 MILLION.

2296
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,557
I SETTLED UTAH'S CASE AGAINST

2297
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,626
THE SAME DEFENDANT.

2298
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:11,194
WHICH IS ELI LILLY. MAKER OF THE

DRUG ZYPREXA.

2300
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:14,764
I SETTLED THE UTAH CASE FOR

FOR ABOUT $24 MILLION.

2305
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:25,274
>> MANY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERALS

2306
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,644
TURNED US AWAY BECAUSE IT'S

2307
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:29,045
UNPOPULAR FOR THEM TO SUE BIG

2308
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:33,349
BUSINESS.

2309
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,820
NOT ONLY IS IT UNPOPULAR.

2310
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,354
BUT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

2311
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,323
THE GOVERNMENT PURSE WAS BEING

2312
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:41,991
DEPLETED IN ENORMOUS AMOUNTS

2313
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,894
BY THESE DRUG COMPANIES THAT

2314
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:48,698
WEREN'T PLAYING FAIR AND THE

2315
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,400
GOVERNMENT HAD THE RIGHT

2316
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,035
TO RECOVER THAT MONEY.

2317
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,903
>> THE ISSUE WAS--IT'S WHETHER

2318
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,371
OR NOT THERE WAS EXCESSIVE COSTS

2319
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,273
OR EXCESSIVE INAPPROPRIATE USES

POPULATION.

2322

CLINICAL CONDITION IN THEIR PAST

2329
01:13:19,463 --> 01:13:20,864
THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY THEY

2330
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,732
SHOULD GET ZYPREXA.

2331
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,133
SECONDLY IS. IS THESE PEOPLE HAD

2332
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,535
A INCREASED PROPENSITY FOR

2333
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:26,936
GETTING DIABETES.

2334
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:30,006
I LOOKED. THEN. AT WHAT THE COST

2335
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,407
WOULD BE TO OUR PROGRAM AND

2336
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,809
NOTED THAT. BESIDES THE PILL

2337
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,177
COSTS. THERE WERE ADDITIONAL

2338
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:35,579
HEALTH CARE COSTS. MAYBE UP TO

2339
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:37,013
$70 MILLION FOR OUR PARTICULAR

2340
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:38,414
STATE FOR THE USE OF THIS

2341
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,484
MEDICATION.

2342
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:41,885
>> THESE ARE PRIMARY CARE

2343
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:43,286
PHYSICIANS THAT THEY'RE SELLING

2344
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,688
ZYPREXA TO.

2345
01:13:44,688 --> 01:13:46,089
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

2346
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,491
PSYCHIATRISTS WHO ARE TREATING

2347
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:48,892
THE PEOPLE THE FDA HAS APPROVED

2348
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:51,928
ZYPREXA FOR.

2349
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,963
ONLY PSYCHIATRISTS ARE TREATING

2350
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:56,365
PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

2351
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:59,102
AND SCHIZOPHRENIA.

2352
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,904
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT

2353
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:02,271
PROSECUTES THESE CASES HASN'T

2354
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,673
FINED THE COMPANIES ANYWHERE

2355
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,341
NEAR AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD.

2356
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,076
IN OTHER WORDS. AS MUCH AS THEY

2357
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,978
MADE. NOR HAS ANYONE EVER GONE

2358
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,379
TO JAIL.

2359
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,848
IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE

2360
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:13,249
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CRIMINAL

2361
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,651
ACTIVITY. A DOCTOR GETS

2362
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,052
ILLEGALLY PROMOTED BY THE

2363
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,987
COMPANY TO PRESCRIBE A DRUG THAT

2364
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,989
THE DOCTOR MAY THINK HAS

2365
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:22,892
BENEFITS THAT OUTWEIGH THE RISK.

2366
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,528
THERE ISN'T ANY EVIDENCE FOR

2367
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,329
THAT AT ALL.

2368
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:27,731
THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES THE DRUG.

2369
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,132
A PERSON DIES BECAUSE THERE

2370
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,534
REALLY WASN'T ANY EVIDENCE THAT

2371
01:14:30,534 --> 01:14:31,935
IT EVEN WORKED FOR THAT.

2372
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,336
AND THERE WERE--THERE'S EVIDENCE

2373
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,738
OF DANGERS.

2374
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:36,139
ONE COMPANY. PFIZER. ONE OF THE

2375
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:37,541
BIGGEST DRUG COMPANIES IN THE

2376
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:38,942
WORLD. SOLD $1 BILLION A YEAR OF

2377
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,343
A PARTICULAR DRUG. AND 90% OF

2378
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,045
THE SALES WERE FOR OFF-LABEL

2379
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:44,313
USE.

2380
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,182
ILLEGAL. THEY WERE CRIMINALLY

2381
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,584
PROSECUTED FOR IT BACK ABOUT

2382
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:48,985
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. BUT THE

2383
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,386
FINE THEY PAID. WHICH SEEMED

2384
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:52,288
LARGE--HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

2385
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,923
DOLLARS--WASN'T BIG ENOUGH TO

2386
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,324
DETER THEM FROM DOING IT AGAIN.

2387
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,326
AND IN SEPTEMBER OF 2009.

2388
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,996
THE SAME COMPANY PAID THE

2389
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,398
LARGEST CRIMINAL PENALTY EVER

2390
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,200
PAID BY ANY UNITED STATES

2391
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,135
COMPANY: OVER $1.2 BILLION FOR

2392
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,204
ILLEGAL. CRIMINAL OFF-LABEL

2393
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:12,041
PROMOTION.

2394
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,277
>> THIS WAS A DELIBERATE SCHEME.

2395
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:15,679
THEY KNOW HOW DEFENSELESS

2396
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,446
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ARE WHEN

2397
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:20,717
IT COMES TO PAYING DRUG

2398
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:23,452
PRESCRIPTIONS.

2399
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:24,854
THERE'S SUCH AN ELABORATE

2400
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,455
COMPUTER ORIENTED SYSTEM SET UP

2401
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,457
FOR PAYMENT OF THESE MILLIONS

2402
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:31,661
AND MILLIONS OF PRESCRIPTIONS

2403
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,329
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY PEOPLE ON

2404
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,098
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE THAT IT

2405
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,233
CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED.

2406
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:40,069
THERE'S NO WAY FOR ANY WATCHDOG

2407
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,571
TO SAY. "OH. WELL, YOU'VE

2408
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:45,642
PRESCRIBED THIS TO SOMEBODY WHO

2409
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:48,177
HAS NO BUSINESS TAKING IT."

2410
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,279
>> MEDICAID WILL PAY WHATEVER IT

2411
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,215
IS THEY CHOOSE TO CHARGE FOR

2412
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,451
THEIR DRUGS.

2413
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:57,453
SO ZYPREXA PRESCRIPTIONS COST

2414
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:58,855
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $500

2415
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:00,724
AND $1.000 A MONTH PER PERSON.

2416
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:02,792
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY

2417
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,662
EXPENSIVE DRUG.

2418
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:07,330
>> WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS.

2419
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,732
WE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS

2420
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:10,133
A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN COST.

2421
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:11,534
IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF

2422
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:12,936
THE MEDICINE ITSELF.

2423
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:14,337
NOW. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY

2424
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,739
FRUSTRATING TO ME. BECAUSE

2425
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,140
RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE

2426
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,541
THAT SOME OF THE OLDER

2427
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,943
ANTIPSYCHOTICS--

2428
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:21,344
ANTIPSYCHOTICS HAD BEEN AROUND

2429
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:22,746
FOR 40 OR 50 YEARS--

2430
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:24,147
WORK ALMOST AS WELL AS ZYPREXA.

2431
01:16:24,147 --> 01:16:25,615
SO HERE WE HAVE A GROUP OF

2432
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,652
PEOPLE OVER 65 WHO ARE GETTING

2433
01:16:28,652 --> 01:16:30,119
A MEDICATION FOR ANXIETY OR TO

2434
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,421
CALM THEM DOWN FOR WHICH

2435
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,158
THE MEDICINE WAS NOT APPROVED.

2436
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:36,559
AND IT'S COSTING A LOT OF MONEY.

2437
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,428
INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD

2438
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,264
THAT THEY'LL HAVE DIABETES.

2439
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,666
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT. THERE

2440
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,067
ARE OTHER MEDICINES THAT THEY

2441
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,669
COULD'VE USED THAT SEEM TO WORK

2442
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:47,070
AS EFFECTIVELY.

2443
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,471
>> BUT THE STATE IS PAYING FOR

2444
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:49,873
IT. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT

2445
01:16:49,873 --> 01:16:51,440
IT'S EXPENSIVE. AND IT DOESN'T

2446
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,376
MATTER THAT THERE ARE OTHER

2447
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,911
THINGS THAT ARE BETTER.

2448
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,313
IT'S SORT OF LIKE A MODERN FORM

2449
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:58,715
OF LOBOTOMY.

2450
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,583
WHILE THE NURSES ARE COMPLAINING

2451
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,519
LESS BECAUSE THE OLD PEOPLE ARE

2452
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:05,621
LESS ACTIVE. IT'S KILLING THEM.

2453
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,390
AND IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

2454
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,493
OUR LOOK AT THE DATA SAID IT'S

2455
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:16,666
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO DIE.

2456
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,501
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS. MEDICAID

2457
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,737
WINDS UP PAYING FOR THE PERSON'S

2458
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:22,471
FINAL ILLNESS.

2459
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,340
SO IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR LILLY AND

2460
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,775
FOR THE DOCTORS. BUT IT IS

2461
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:27,944
A TERRIBLE LOSING PROPOSITION

2462
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,646
FOR THE STATE.

2463
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,950
>> WHAT WE FOUND OUT THROUGH THE

2464
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,351
MEDICAID DATABASES OF THE STATES

2465
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,253
THAT WE REPRESENTED WAS THAT

2466
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:40,289
OVER 50% OF THE DRUG ZYPREXA WAS

2467
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,658
PRESCRIBED OFF-LABEL FOR

2468
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:48,331
UNAPPROVED USES BY THE FDA.

2469
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,266
THIS IS OVER 50% OF THE DRUG

2470
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:52,836
JUST IN THE MEDICAID POPULATION.

2471
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,771
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT AT LEAST

2472
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:58,007
THAT MUCH OF THE DRUG WAS

2473
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,408
PRESCRIBED OFF-LABEL FOR PEOPLE

2474
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,910
OUTSIDE THE MEDICAID POPULATION.

2475
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,479
>> ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'RE GONNA

2476
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:05,648
GET BACK TO OUR EARNINGS.

2477
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:07,050
SPECIFICALLY DRUG EARNINGS.

01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,071
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON

2493
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,472
MORNING CALL.

2494
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:30,874
>> THANKS. CAROL. GOOD MORNING.

2495
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,275
>> SO WHAT ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS

2496
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,676
FROM THE QUARTER?

2497
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,078
>> CAROL. WE HAD A VERY STRONG

2498
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:36,479
QUARTER.

2499
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:37,881
WE GREW OUR SALES 14%.

2500
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,282
WE GREW OUR EXPENSES LESS THAN

2501
01:18:39,282 --> 01:18:40,683
THAT.

2502
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:42,085
WE EXPANDED OUR GROSS MARGIN.

2503
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:43,486
OUR NON GAP QUARTER TO QUARTER

2504
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:44,888
COMPARISON. 14% GROWTH IN

2505
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,289
EARNINGS PER SHARE.

2506
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,690
>> MAKE IT TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO

2507
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,092
IT IN THE UNSAFE WAY.

2508
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:50,493
IF YOU SAY TO THE DRUG COMPANY.

2509
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:52,461
"HEY. LOOK. YOU CAN MAKE

2510
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,031
$4 BILLION WORTH OF PROFIT OUT

2511
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:56,732
OF THIS IF YOU DO IT IN THE

2512
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,804
UNSAFE WAY. BUT I'M ONLY GONNA

2513
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,538
FINE YOU $1 BILLION."

2514
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:05,708
WELL. THAT'S $3 BILLION WORTH OF

2515
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:09,879
PROFIT.

2516
01:19:09,879 --> 01:19:11,815
WELL. IT CAN'T WORK THAT WAY.

2517
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,749
IT'S GOT TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO

2518
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,986
DO IT IN THE UNSAFE WAY.

2519
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:19,923
THE FDA. THEY DON'T HAVE

2520
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:23,192
THE MANPOWER.

2521
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,593
THEY NEVER WILL.

2522
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,995
THEY DO IT--THEY DO THE BEST JOB

2523
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,396
THAT THEY CAN WITH WHAT THEY

2524
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:28,798
HAVE. BUT AS ONE OF OUR EXPERTS

2525
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,199
SAID. NOBODY CAN REVIEW A NEW

2526
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,001
DRUG APPLICATION AT THE FDA.

2527
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,838
BECAUSE NO HUMAN BEING CAN READ

2528
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:37,173
THE WHOLE THING.

2529
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,809
YOU CAN HIDE THE STUFF IN THERE.

2530
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:41,210
BUT WHAT THE DRUG COMPANY NEEDS

2531
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,512
TO KNOW BEFORE THEY EVER SUBMIT

2532
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,914
THAT APPLICATION IS. THAT IF I

2533
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,515
HIDE THINGS IN THERE AND THE

2534
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,117
TRUTH COMES OUT. IT'S GOING TO

2535
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,086
BE MORE EXPENSE THAN IT IS

2536
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:52,822
WORTH.

2537
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:55,758
OTHERWISE. NONE OF US ARE GONNA

2538
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:57,160
BE SAFE FROM THIS BEHAVIOR.

2539
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,495
YOU CAN'T LET THEM MAKE A NET

2540
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:00,930
PROFIT ON LYING.

2541
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,266
YOU MAKE A NET PROFIT ON LYING.

2542
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:05,869
YOU'RE GOING TO LIE.

2543
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:07,871
AND IT'S THE LAWYER'S FAULT.

2544
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:09,705
OKAY?

2545
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:11,107
IT'S THE LAWYER'S FAULT.

2546
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:12,508
WE INVENTED CORPORATIONS.

2547
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:13,910
AND WHEN WE INVENTED IT.

2548
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,311
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT A CONSCIENCE.

2549
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,712
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT A SOUL.

2550
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:18,114
YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN JAIL.

2551
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,482
IT'S NOT A HUMAN BEING.

2552
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,084
IT'S A MACHINE.

2553
01:20:21,084 --> 01:20:22,785
IT'S A LEGAL MACHINE.

2554
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:24,187
WE INVENTED IT.

2555
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:25,588
IT'S OUR FAULT.

2556
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:26,990
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THAT

2557
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,391
MACHINE IN CHECK IS TO MAKE IT

2558
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:29,792
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT MACHINE

2559
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,827
TO DO IT. BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THE

2560
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,297
MACHINE UNDERSTANDS. AND THAT'LL

2561
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:35,932
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

2562
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:38,167
>> I MEAN. WE--WE ARE SPENDING

2563
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,602
FOR A LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE THAT

2564
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:43,973
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE IT

2565
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:46,775
ALL.

2566
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,177
INSTEAD. WHAT WE SPEND ON HEALTH

2567
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,578
CARE BENEFITS THE INSURANCE

2568
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:50,980
COMPANIES AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL

2569
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,016
COMPANIES.

2570
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:54,984
>> I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE

2571
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,385
MEDICAL EDUCATION.

2572
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:57,786
WE NEED TO TRAIN MEDICAL

2573
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,655
STUDENTS IN RESIDENCE SO THAT

2574
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,057
THEY THINK ABOUT ADVERSE

2575
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:02,625
EFFECTS. PROBABLY EVEN BEFORE

2576
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,027
THEY THINK ABOUT THE DESIRED

2577
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:06,029
EFFECT. BECAUSE ADVERSE EFFECTS

2578
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,132
CAUSE PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS.

2579
01:21:09,132 --> 01:21:13,769
AND THAT'S COUNTER TO THE

2580
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:15,738
PRINCIPLE THAT WE ALL HAVE

2581
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:17,740
ABIDED--THAT WE ALL HAVE SWORN

2582
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,142
TO WHEN WE GRADUATED. THAT IS.

2583
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:21,377
"DO NO HARM."

2584
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,212
>> AS MUCH AS I'M FOR SMALL

2585
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,713
GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GONNA NEED

2586
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,115
A MONITORING AGENCY.

2587
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,516
BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS

2588
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:28,918
TO ABSOLUTELY INSULATE THE

2589
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,920
PEOPLE WHO MONITOR FROM THE

2590
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,090
PEOPLE WHOM THEY'RE MONITORING.

2591
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,993
>> WE CAN LOOK BACK AS FAR AS

2592
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:39,695
PEOPLE LIKE ELVIS PRESLEY AND

2593
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:41,097
ANNA NICOLE SMITH MORE RECENTLY

2594
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,132
AND THEN GRADUATING INTO

2595
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:45,401
HEATH LEDGER. COREY HAIM. PEOPLE

2596
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,835
LIKE THIS DYING. AND THE ONLY

2597
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:48,972
POSITIVE THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS

2598
01:21:48,972 --> 01:21:51,240
NEGATIVE IS THAT IT'S BROUGHT

2599
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,808
SOME ATTENTION TO THE AMERICAN

2600
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:54,210
PUBLIC THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM.

2601
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,611
AND THE REALITY IS

2602
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:58,247
IS THAT REGULAR PEOPLE.

2603
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,882
NON-CELEBRITIES. ARE DYING EVERY

2604
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:01,284
SINGLE DAY FROM PRESCRIPTION

2605
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:03,919
PILLS--NOT FROM OVERDOSES.

2606
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,488
NOT FROM PEOPLE TAKING IT FOR

2607
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:08,157
FUN. BUT PEOPLE SIMPLY TAKING

2608
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:09,558
THEIR MEDICATIONS EXACTLY HOW

2609
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,227
THEIR DOCTOR TOLD THEM TO TAKE

2610
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:13,462
IT. BUT THE COMBINATION OF

2611
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,863
SLEEPING PILLS AND ANXIETY PILLS

2612
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,399
AND NARCOTICS. THEY GO TO SLEEP.

2613
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,934
AND THEY DON'T WAKE UP.

2614
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,537
>> SO HOW DO WE STOP IT?

2615
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:30,846
THE PROBLEM IS. WE HAVE A NATION

2616
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:32,248
OF ADDICTS THAT ARE BEING

2617
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:35,051
IGNORED.

2618
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,819
>> THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM.

2619
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:44,994
IN MY OPINION. IS NOT THE

2620
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:46,895
GOVERNMENT.

2621
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:48,497
IT'S NOT OTHER PEOPLE.

2622
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:49,898
IT REALLY STARTS WITH THE

2623
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,300
INDIVIDUAL BEING RESPONSIBLE

2624
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,701
FOR THEMSELVES.

2625
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,103
I THINK THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD

2626
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:55,504
HAVE THEIR OWN MEDICAL RECORD.

2627
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:56,905
PERIOD.

2628
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:59,075
YOU SHOULDN'T RELY ON YOUR

2629
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:00,476
MEDICAL RECORD TO BE AT YOUR

2630
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:01,877
DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

2631
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:03,279
YOU SHOULD MAINTAIN YOUR OWN

2632
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,680
MEDICAL RECORDS.

2633
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,082
IF YOU HAVE AN MRI. GET A COPY

2634
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:07,483
FOR YOURSELF.

2635
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:08,884
THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE THIS

2636
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:22,365
PROBLEM IS TO PREVENT IT FROM

2637
01:23:22,365 --> 01:23:23,766
HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

2638
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:25,168
IF A PERSON HAS TO HAVE SURGERY.

2639
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:26,569
AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED A PAIN

2640
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,237
PILL AFTER SURGERY--

2641
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:29,605
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN ARTHROSCOPY

2642
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,040
OF YOUR KNEE.

2643
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,441
IT HURTS.

2644
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,842
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HURT.

2645
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,211
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE SOME

2646
01:23:35,211 --> 01:23:36,645
PAIN MEDICINE.

2647
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,047
MOST PAIN HAPPENS AFTER SURGERY

2648
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:39,448
IN THE FIRST 72 HOURS. THE FIRST

2649
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:40,816
THREE DAYS.

2650
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:42,251
SO IT'S FINE TO TAKE A STRONG

2651
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,619
PAINKILLER FOR THOSE THREE DAYS.

2652
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:45,054
BUT OFTEN WHAT YOU SEE IS.

2653
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:46,455
DOCTORS WILL GIVE OUT 90 PILLS

2654
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,191
OR 60 PILLS OR 120 PILLS FOR

2655
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:50,426
A SURGERY THAT'S ONLY GONNA

2656
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:53,229
REALLY HURT THE PERSON WHERE

2657
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:55,098
THEY WOULD NEED THOSE PILLS FOR

2658
01:23:55,098 --> 01:23:56,499
MAYBE THREE OR FOUR DAYS.

2659
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:57,900
IF YOU ONLY USE A FEW PILLS.

2660
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:13,249
GET RID OF THE OTHER PILLS.

2661
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:15,151
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THEM

2662
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:17,153
DOWN THE TOILET.

2663
01:24:17,153 --> 01:24:18,554
PEOPLE SAY. "WELL. I FLUSH IT

2664
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,955
DOWN THE TOILET."

2665

WE'RE CONTAMINATING OUR WATER

2666
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,758
SYSTEM. SO YOU DON'T WANT TO

2667
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,160
FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET.

2668
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,561
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT BACK TO YOUR

2669
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,962
PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE.

2670
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:28,364
AND THEY NORMALLY HAVE

2671
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:29,765
A MECHANISM TO GET RID OF DRUGS

2672
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,167
SAFELY.

2673
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:32,568
DON'T LOOK--DON'T ACCEPT A PILL

2674
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:45,214
FOR A PROBLEM.

2675
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:47,316
SO IF YOU GO TO A DOCTOR.

2676
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:48,717
AND YOU TELL THE DOCTOR THAT

2677
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,219
YOU'RE HAVING HEADACHES. AND THE

2678
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:51,687
FIRST THING HE DOES IS GIVE YOU

2679
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:53,256
A PILL FOR HEADACHE--HE DOESN'T

2680
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:54,657
EVEN ASK YOU WHAT KIND OF

2681
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,058
HEADACHES. WHEN DID THEY START.

2682
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,460
WHY DID THEY START.

2683
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,861
YOU FIRST TELL THE DOCTOR.

2684
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00,463
"IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE OTHER

2685
01:25:00,463 --> 01:25:01,864
THAN THIS PILL FOR MY

2686
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:03,266
HEADACHES?"

2687
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:04,667
AND IF THE DOCTOR TELLS YOU NO.

2688
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,068
IT'S TIME TO FIND A NEW DOCTOR.

2689

MEDICATION.

IT HAD SIDE EFFECTS THAT HAD

2732
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,544
CAUSED ME NUMEROUS WHOLE BOUTS

2733

OF PERSONALITY CHANGES THAT

2734
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,414
CAUSED A BREAKUP WITH MY

FIANCEE.

2736
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:03,619

FEELING IN MY LIFE.

FOR TWO YEARS.

I WAS TAKING EIGHT TO TEN A DAY.

2745
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:22,971
AND MY BODY FELT LIKE I NEEDED

2746

IT.

2747
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:27,843
I HAD NO STRENGTH.

LIKE I WAS NOBODY.

2749
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,646
I WAS REALLY SAD. CRYING.

OKAY.

2751
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:37,486

FOR THE FIRST MONTH OR SO.

2753
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:44,092
AND THEN IT SLOWLY PROGRESSED TO

2754
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,194
TWO. AND THEN I ENDED UP AT THE

2755
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,063
MOST--I ENDED UP TAKING ABOUT

2756

SEVEN TO EIGHT PILLS A DAY.

2757
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,902
AND I WAS SIFTING THEM ONTO

2758
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:55,871
FOIL. AND THEN I WOULD SMOKE

2759
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:58,206
THEM. OR SOMETIMES I WOULD SNIFF

2760
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,476
THEM. AND IT JUST TOOK ME AWAY.

2761

>> IT'D MAKE YOU FEEL MAYBE--

2762
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:08,617
MAYBE A LITTLE EUPHORIC OR

2763
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,553
SOMETHING. BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT

2764
01:28:10,553 --> 01:28:11,954
I TOOK THEM FOR THE PAIN.

2765
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:15,023
BUT I THINK I TOOK THEM MOSTLY.

2766
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,425
LIKE THEY SAID. BECAUSE I JUST

2767
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:18,226
THOUGHT I NEEDED THEM.

THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THEM.

2771
