2
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,743
Humanity has spread to the stars.

3
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:42,041
We set out like ancient seafarers
to explore the limitless ocean of space.

4
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,004
But no matter how far we venture
into the unknown,

5
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,340
the worst monsters
are those we bring with us.

6
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,928
"Once upon a time,
in a village in the woods..."

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,597
Don't read it, Tak.

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,641
I want you to tell it our way.

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,311
Okay. You ready?

10
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,275
"Once, there was a cruel father
who had two kids.

11
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,487
He was called Mad Mykola."

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,366
"He was a miller, but he made the kids
do all of the work."

13
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,413
- Where do you think their mom was?
- There are never moms in these stories.

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,208
Come on, keep going.

15
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:28,213
"The girl and the boy worked so hard,
that one night they fainted."

16
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,883
"Mad Mykola
found them lying on the floor,

17
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,552
and he threw them both into the mill."

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,390
"Then he thought, who's going to do
all the work for him?"

19
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,894
"So he went into the village,
stole more children.

20
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,647
He killed them, cut them up,

21
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,567
and took their bits and pieces
to the loom."

22
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,695
"And stitched all their bloody dead parts

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,699
into one huge, strong, creepy thing."

24
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,327
"The Patchwork Man.

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:05,041
But it turned,
and it ripped Mad Mykola to shreds."

26
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:11,798
"Then it went out into the world.
But its body kept falling apart."

27
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,553
"So to this day,
the Patchwork Man wanders the streets

28
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,641
looking for children to kill,
to cut up, and to sew into himself."

29
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:34,779
We're on a new world now,
new lives. Stop complaining!

30
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:44,414
Why can't you just be grateful?
Just once, hmm?

31
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,960
You know what your problem is?

32
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:54,507
You don't know how to be appreciative
for what you have.

33
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,845
I'm sorry, Jakub. I am so lucky.

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,390
You're right. I... I'll be better.

35
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,563
I don't care what you do.
Just stop complaining!

36
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,652
We stick together, Rei.

37
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,407
Never face the monsters alone.

38
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,601
An invitation arrived for you
with the dawn.

39
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,644
I doubted you wanted it in the shower.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,398
It requests your presence
at Suntouch House this evening.

41
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,611
I'm afraid I have other pertinent news.

42
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,698
Miriam Bancroft was not the only one
in attendance last night.

43
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,451
The room's privacy settings
were compromised.

44
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,954
To be vulgar, I was hacked.

45
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,999
I have no explanation how this drone
eluded my security protocols,

46
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,044
but it did acquire... footage.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,256
You're fucking kidding me.

48
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,095
Yeah?

49
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,682
Mr. Kovacs, I sent you an invitation
some hours ago.

50
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,102
- Is there a reason you haven't replied?
- I'm not big on dinner parties.

51
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,854
It's a party in name only.

52
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,567
The guest list includes everybody
I could think of who might want me dead.

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,571
You made a list of everyone who wants
to kill you and invited them to dinner?

54
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,491
Well, they're hardly gonna come
for an interrogation, are they?

55
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,576
You want me to chat them up
at the buffet line?

56
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,804
Do I need to explain the risks?

57
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,039
I think you can manage three courses
and a digestif.

58
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,500
See you at 7:00.

59
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,005
Do you believe he is aware of your conduct
with Mrs. Bancroft?

60
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,882
I believe he's smart enough
to try to kill two birds with one stone.

61
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,886
I'm not strolling into that dinner party
with a bull's-eye on my forehead.

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,013
Oh, I would gladly accompany you
if I could,

63
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,724
- but alas, I cannot be elsewhere.
- What do you mean?

64
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,976
My neural network
is part of the building itself.

65
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,147
Think of the hotel as a body,
of which I am the brain.

66
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,523
I am the hotel.

67
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,609
The hotel is me.

68
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,279
Which leaves you
without a man in the field.

69
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,865
You as a wingman
wasn't quite what I had in mind.

70
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:28,119
You're like a computer program, right?
You can go anywhere you want on the Array.

71
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,622
Anywhere data flows, so can I.

72
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,386
What kind of virtual protocols
do you have?

73
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,211
- A veritable cornucopia, ranging from...
- Psychosurgery therapeutics?

74
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,131
I've never sought that specific license,
but I can.

75
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,340
How long would that take?

76
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,967
Done.

77
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,553
Are you to be the patient?

78
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,388
No.

79
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,187
- Hey.
- I'll take care of it.

80
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh, here she is.

81
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,361
Ms. Prescott. To what do I owe
the complete lack of pleasure?

82
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,530
Detective Ortega. Nice to see you, too.

83
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,014
And save the attitude.
I'm just here to invite you to dinner.

84
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,576
I'd rather starve.

85
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,163
I'm afraid you don't have much choice.
Captain, perhaps you could...

86
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:16,376
Ms. Prescott has requested a permit
for an Extreme Organic Damage event

87
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,710
at Suntouch House tonight.

88
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,546
This permit's time-stamped
two hours ago.

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,926
Fucking Meth bullshit.
No one gets these approved that fast.

90
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,471
Be that as it may, Mr. Bancroft
would like you to monitor the bout

91
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,723
on behalf of the Bay City Police.

92
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,183
That's a job for a Uni.

93
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:36,229
You've been specially requested.
It's an honor.

94
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you, Captain.

95
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,900
And I'll see you tonight, Detective.

96
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,782
Seriously? I have cases to work.

97
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,325
You can work them tomorrow.

98
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,160
Tonight, you kiss the ring.

99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,246
Whatever this thing is
with you and Bancroft,

100
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,581
I need you to bury it
for the good of the department.

101
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,460
So just go, accept the honor
of being invited to the Aerium

102
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,088
on behalf of all us lowly grounders.

103
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,757
Smile, nod, and then get the hell out.

104
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,615
- Ah. Just the man I'm looking for.
- Shut up and get out.

105
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,702
Can we skip to the next part,
or do I gotta knock you out again?

106
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,078
This time, I'm ready for you...

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,415
See, if you want to lose a fight,
you should talk about it first.

108
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,585
This some of your
terrorist brainwashing bullshit?

109
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,005
Nah, just some friendly advice
from the guy who just disarmed you.

110
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,720
- What do you want?
- To offer you some gainful employment.

111
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,223
Which you could clearly use.
You were pretty good backup.

112
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,271
I thought we could work a trade.
You help me, and, uh... I'll help Lizzie.

113
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm not letting you near my daughter
ever again.

114
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,733
She needs psychosurgery.

115
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,279
- Who's gonna pay for that?
- I'll just put it on the Bancroft tab.

116
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,156
I'm not taking anything from that fuck.

117
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,408
I don't think he did it.

118
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,244
He's into consensual death.

119
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,372
- He replaces the sleeves he kills.
- That's fucked up.

120
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,419
- It's true. Doesn't make him guilty.
- Sure doesn't make him innocent, either.

121
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,381
Let's make a deal. I'll keep looking into
what happened to Lizzie,

122
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,302
and if I find out that Bancroft did it
and you wanna blow his brains out...

123
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,014
I'm not gonna stop you.
I'll hand you the fucking gun.

124
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,266
You don't care about Lizzie.

125
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,190
Don't take this personally, but...

126
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,694
I don't care about anyone.

127
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,992
But if it gets me what I want,
I'll still help her.

128
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,331
How?

129
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,976
- Salutations.
- Seriously, you've gotta stop that.

130
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,520
You've brought a friend
to my humble establishment.

131
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,982
Greetings, fine sir.
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.

132
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,608
- Who's this?
- I'm his partner.

133
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,609
No.

134
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,779
- I'm his esteemed colleague.
- Still no.

135
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,282
I am the proprietor of the hotel.

136
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,075
He is the hotel.

137
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,161
- This is Poe.
- I knew this place was too empty.

138
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,331
- Is this one of those freaky AI place...
- You are in the Raven.

139
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:47,128
An establishment of peerless repute,
timeless quality.

140
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:51,549
And extra room, virtual and otherwise.
Tell him, Poe.

141
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,469
I have upskilled for psychosurgery
to Protocol Level Nine

142
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,556
and prepared a VR suite for your daughter.

143
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,516
She must be removed from human contact.

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,312
Every time she is spun back up,
her mental state deteriorates.

145
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,856
- So you're saying...
- I can heal her mind.

146
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,983
But you will not be able to see her.

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,110
For how long?

148
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,615
I cannot say until I've assessed her.
But her condition sounds severe.

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,076
- I won't be able to talk to her?
- No.

150
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,745
Not at all.

151
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Do I have your consent?

152
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,471
In the field, you're under fire...

153
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,974
a guy goes down, he's injured,
but he's too heavy to carry.

154
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,479
You rip his stack and you move on.
Kill a sleeve to save his life.

155
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,606
I'm afraid I cannot construe
your graphic war...

156
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,694
I understand that sometimes you have to
get burned to pull somebody from the fire.

157
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
I consent.

158
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,248
Your faith in me is not misplaced, sir.

159
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,541
If it is,

160
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,337
I will personally reduce this place
to a smoking pile of rubble,

161
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,963
and you along with it.

162
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,341
Ah.

163
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,425
Lovely.

164
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,932
So what do you want from me?

165
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,393
You look like a man
with friends in low places.

166
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,478
I need some hardware.

167
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,318
What are you doing?

168
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,696
Detecting.

169
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,365
That is my job after all.

170
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,659
Okay, think about this.

171
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,703
What do we really know
about Mary Lou Henchy?

172
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,038
What? They found the body.

173
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,374
Tanaka was right.
The mom got what she wanted.

174
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,667
Yeah, but we didn't clear it.

175
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,086
That would be,
as I believe you pointed out,

176
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,046
because it's not your case. Leave it.

177
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,048
What we know is...

178
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,219
she fell out of the sky from nowhere.
Which is impossible.

179
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,264
So she must have been
tossed out of an aircar...

180
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,515
Still not your case.

181
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,017
Mary Lou Henchy was thrown
from somewhere up high.

182
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,271
And quite a few of the people that
live up there will be at Suntouch tonight.

183
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,275
All the times we've wanted
to question Meths and been stonewalled,

184
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,820
and now... I've been invited
into a house full of them.

185
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,536
You know, your father asked me
to look out for you before he died.

186
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:30,124
Perfect. Then you can patch into my ONI
and remote scan their vehicles.

187
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,459
Absolutely not.

188
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,380
Why do you have a picture
of Chief Justice Ertekin on your monitor?

189
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,966
Because she's gonna be
at Bancroft's tonight,

190
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,427
along with all these other Meths.

191
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,678
It's the guest list.

192
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,598
AKA potential suspects
in Mary Lou's death.

193
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,975
It's gonna be great.

194
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
Gotta find something to wear.

195
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,731
Good news, everyone.
It's sugar skull season again!

196
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,860
Día de los Muertos is tomorrow
and preparations are in full swing.

197
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,531
Takeshi Kovacs?
What kind of schizophrenic name is that?

198
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
It's Slavic and Japanese.

199
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,078
In the case of my parents,
a match made in hell.

200
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,707
Here you go. There we go.

201
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,460
Okay, take care, you guys. Be good.

202
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,922
- Here.
- The fuck you talking about?

203
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,716
I said I needed weapons,
not malted milk balls.

204
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,469
Point-one-six percent actual fruit.

205
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,221
Go on.

206
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,891
- Credit check.
- Fuck you, credit check,

207
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,477
you broke-as-fuck jarhead.
I ain't got no freebies.

208
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,812
Nothin' for you.

209
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,734
Credit approved.
Beryllium level.

210
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,071
That's right, motherfucker.
Beryllium level.

211
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,090
- Consider these classic beauties.
- No.

212
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,176
If I wanted cheap and legal,
I'd go to HugeMart, not you.

213
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,429
Stop trying to unload your old inventory
and show us the good stuff.

214
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,067
Ingram 40 flechette gun.

215
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,986
Now this is what I'm talking about.

216
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,489
- Prototype?
- CTAC R and D.

217
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:30,661
Uses flanged armor-piercing rounds.
Ten-round clip. Homing tech onboard.

218
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,581
- Don't put your hand there.
- Why?

219
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,542
Here, I'll show you.

220
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Son of a bitch!

221
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,714
Put the gun down.

222
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,216
You two are sweet.

223
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,759
Stay down.

224
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,722
That's why.

225
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,931
Reverse the field generator,

226
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,017
the flechette homes
through a plasma chamber,

227
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,727
autoloads right into the mag.

228
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,605
You could have skewered me
like a kebab. Twice!

229
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,356
I'll take it.

230
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,319
That's a nice piece of custom
you got there. You mind?

231
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
Modified second series Nemex?

232
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,074
Hey!

233
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,121
- Where did you get this?
- A guy who doesn't need it anymore.

234
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,665
- Fair enough.
- You got any blades?

235
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
Yeah.

236
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,630
Tebbit knife.

237
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,883
Tantalum steel alloy blade.
Flint in the pommel for weighting.

238
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,427
- Bioweapon coating?
- Runnel's coated with Reaper.

239
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,097
Uh, betathanatine. Shit scientists
cooked up to study near-death experience.

240
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,350
Deeper you stab,
the more dose you get.

241
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,269
Ring it up. Plus whatever he wants.

242
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,815
Uh, give me a... Ooh. Sunjet 2320.

243
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,650
Yeah.

244
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,779
Classics never go out of style.

245
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,200
You must learn the weakness of weapons.

246
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,595
This sleeve is a tool.

247
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,849
It does not control me. I control it.

248
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,230
The true strength of the wolf isn't fangs,
speed, and skill. It's the pack.

249
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,858
Whatever world you needlecast into,
build a pack.

250
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,320
Find ways to inspire loyalty
in a few capable locals.

251
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,950
Even if many of them
will ultimately be expendable.

252
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,202
We are Envoys.

253
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,539
And we take what is offered.

254
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,710
What's with all the pink?

255
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,838
It's Poe's idea of nonthreatening.

256
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,049
Looks like the inside
of someone's stomach.

257
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,730
She's not saying anything.

258
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
It's not working.

259
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,666
I am here for whatever you require.
You have my most solemn oath.

260
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,464
They took Mommy away
because she stole stars from the sky.

261
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,344
They ripped her soul out
through her eyes and froze it.

262
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,138
Now she just spins around and around,

263
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,099
a dancer in the frost.

264
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,477
She has icicles in her hair.

265
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,898
I will let nothing harm you in this place.

266
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,121
No. Where'd they go?

267
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,167
She spoke! She spoke.

268
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,879
She did. He's making progress.

269
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,883
He's not even human.

270
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,803
- What the fuck am I doing?
- The right thing.

271
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,140
She's a guest now.
I mean, he'd die to protect her.

272
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,144
Poe can be very... focused.

273
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,394
She's safe.

274
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,117
Which means I kept my part of the bargain.

275
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,277
So now you want me to go to Bancroft's
with you to a party?

276
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,405
I don't know what I'm walking into.
I need you to watch my six.

277
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,742
Shopping and a night out.
You need to get a girlfriend, man.

278
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,412
I'm not bringing you along
so you can take a shot at Bancroft.

279
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,747
- You're there to watch my back.
- I got you.

280
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,458
Nothing else.

281
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,377
I got you.

282
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,656
Gonna need to search the bag, sir.

283
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,623
I would've left it in the car, but I
really don't trust this neighborhood.

284
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,267
Drink, gentlemen?

285
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,857
Fuckin' penguin suit?

286
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,567
My apologies, sir.

287
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,029
I'm afraid this is the best I could do
on such short notice.

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,618
No weapons on the grounds.

289
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,081
Son of a bitch.

290
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,173
I like your idea of fashion.

291
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,552
- Or is this your "something unique"?
- "Something unique" what?

292
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,876
Laurens asked everyone to bring
something utterly unique.

293
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,931
Didn't he tell you?

294
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,724
A theme party? What is he, 12?

295
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,018
I assume he has ulterior motives.

296
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,397
There was a spybot in our room last night.

297
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,566
Someone was watching.

298
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,026
Were they?

299
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,409
I trust my charming wife
is keeping you entertained?

300
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,785
Extremely.

301
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,623
My apologies then, but you and I
have got some business we need to discuss.

302
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,583
Meet me upstairs.

303
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,461
- See you in a moment.
- Mmm.

304
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,798
Miriam.

305
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,884
Be careful.

306
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,197
All right.

307
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,575
Everyone on the invite list
is accounted for,

308
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,618
so let's start checking them off.

309
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,788
Oh, only 276 aircars to track.

310
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,499
We only need flight logs
for one specific night.

311
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,418
And most of the cars were on the ground

312
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,920
in the time Mary Lou Henchy
could have been tossed.

313
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,131
They'll be easy to eliminate.

314
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,383
Yeah, easy for you to say,
because I'll be doing it.

315
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,761
- Quit bitching.
- I'm not bitching.

316
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,557
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What?

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,187
- Son of a bitch Kovacs is here.
- Okay, try to relax. Have a cocktail.

318
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,939
- They've got the good stuff up there.
- You don't even drink.

319
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,691
I'm a Muslim, not a monk.

320
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,319
I don't begrudge you infidels
a little mood modification,

321
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,489
especially if it makes you lay off
your crazy conspiracy theories.

322
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,033
Thanks. I appreciate that.

323
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
Anytime. That's what I'm here for.

324
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,630
Kristin Ortega, BCPD. Organic Damage.

325
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,423
Normally a street cop does that.

326
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,134
Yeah. Don't fucking remind me.
Fighting licenses?

327
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,930
Sir, you have to lose the ring.

328
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,892
My sleeve got killed in the last bout.
This one's got bigger hands.

329
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,020
- But it's a wedding ring so...
- I made him jam it on.

330
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,856
You... You guys are married?

331
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,900
Gotta provide for the kids somehow, right?

332
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,153
Hey, Lieutenant.
Like the uniform.

333
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,616
- Who are these guys?
- They fight to the sleeve death.

334
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,994
The winner gets an upgraded combat sleeve.
The loser gets a downgraded one.

335
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,123
- And they're married.
- We have kids. Want to see a picture?

336
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,667
What? So you go home to your kids
as strangers?

337
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,168
Oh, they're used to it.

338
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,420
- How old are they?
- Five and seven.

339
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,005
They're not used to it.

340
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,593
I need a drink.

341
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,104
Why are you here?

342
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,358
- I told you, there's nothing here for you.
- Someone bugged my room last night.

343
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,068
That feels like something.

344
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,113
You think any one of these people
would bother spying on you?

345
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,115
They were either watching me
or Miriam Bancroft.

346
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,619
Miriam was in your room last night? Why?

347
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,831
Looking for leverage.

348
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,959
She get any? Leverage?

349
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,004
I think you'd be more interested
in who was spying on me.

350
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,422
You slept with a suspect?

351
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,340
There's no suspect
if there's no case, right?

352
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,758
That's not a denial.

353
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,469
Stay out of my way.

354
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,847
No problem.

355
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,312
Something you wanna tell me?

356
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,524
Yes, I've been giving some thought
to which of our guests

357
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,235
might warrant your attention

358
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,362
and which certainly are not suspects.

359
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,863
I thought you were gonna tell me

360
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,243
about your habit of going to biocabins
and beating women nearly to death?

361
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,537
Didn't consider it
to be particularly important.

362
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:45,877
Yes, I have spent some time
in purchased sexual release,

363
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,631
both virtual and real.

364
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,884
But then, I've also spent time
offworld gambling

365
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,096
or indulging my passion
for null-gravity knife fighting.

366
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,973
You certainly find some enemies there.

367
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,517
But I have never taken a single life.

368
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,897
Unlike you, I have a line
that I am very careful not to cross.

369
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,109
- You better watch yourself.
- Are you okay?

370
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,447
My son cannot hold his liquor.

371
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,324
Maybe he pulled the trigger.

372
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,618
Isaac? I only wish he had the balls.

373
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,912
Often wonder where I went wrong
with that one.

374
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,081
- Gave him every advantage.
- Except one.

375
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,792
There's a natural order
to birth and death.

376
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,546
Boy changing to a man. You interrupted it.

377
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,925
Natural order? You sound
like one of those insane Neo-Catholics.

378
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,971
You've lost comrades, Mr. Kovacs.

379
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,726
People you cared for... or loved, even.

380
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,854
If you'd lived in this time,
you could have them all back.

381
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,357
So whatever the price is,
surely you'd be happy to pay it.

382
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,068
Death isn't up to us to give or withhold.

383
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,153
Oh.

384
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,115
You think we should leave it up to God,
do you?

385
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:02,037
Oh, Mr. Kovacs, haven't you heard?
God is dead.

386
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,457
We have taken his place.

387
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,297
If you're a god, then, uh,
what the hell do you need me for?

388
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,884
Every deity has minions.

389
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,095
Observe. Absorb.

390
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,431
Find what others have missed.

391
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,567
He throws a party
with his brains on the wall as decor.

392
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,320
Best news of the year?
When I heard he got torched.

393
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,238
I once hated Laurens.

394
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,034
But 100 years pass
and you realize there's just no upside.

395
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:46,456
We are all going to go through the rest
of humanity's future stuck together.

396
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,625
Excuse me.

397
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,587
I can't believe we've never met.

398
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,299
Been offworld. Just came back
to settle an old debt with Laurens,

399
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,426
but someone else beat me to it.

400
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,095
You don't approve?

401
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,891
It's terrifying that a killer
could get to one of us.

402
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,268
Sickening.

403
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,145
You don't think he killed himself?

404
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:16,277
Whoever murdered him
must be found and punished

405
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,904
or we're all in danger.

406
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,459
Abboud, I want you to scan someone for me.

407
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,753
Guy I'm looking at
wasn't on the invite list.

408
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,956
I don't see anybody.

409
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,529
Where the hell have you been?
You're supposed to be watching my back.

410
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,606
These people drink like fish.
I keep having to get refills.

411
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,610
- Are you even listening?
- No.

412
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,877
Jesus Christ!

413
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,299
Give us a moment, please?

414
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,269
Only way you stay
is if you're unconscious.

415
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,354
It's your call.

416
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,323
- You can't say anything about this.
- Who are you?

417
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,034
- You know who I am.
- I know who you're not.

418
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,914
- I have no idea what you mean.
- What's my name?

419
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
Uh...

420
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,422
Fine. I'm Naomi.

421
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,008
The 12th daughter.

422
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,760
And you are?

423
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,346
Wondering why you're fucking
in your mother's sleeve.

424
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,350
Her clones are state of the art.

425
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,143
Why wouldn't I want
to take 'em for a spin?

426
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,813
I have fun, okay?

427
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:01,234
And friends like Curtis
have even more fun.

428
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,610
The gun that killed your father

429
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,488
was locked in a bio-coded safe that
only he or your mother could open.

430
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,614
Mmm-hmm.

431
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,993
Or a kid wearing her mother's sleeve.

432
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,705
First of all, I'm not a kid.
I'm 67 years old.

433
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:18,167
And secondly, if my father dies,
like, real death dies,

434
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,837
the family gets nothing.
It's written into his will.

435
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,842
So, if I killed him, I'd be penniless.
And I do not do penniless.

436
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,887
That's how he protects himself.

437
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,557
For children who were
never allowed to grow up...

438
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,019
greed isn't the only motive for killing.

439
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,566
Excuse me,
is this young man bothering you?

440
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,401
I was still talking!

441
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,321
He told a joke about a samurai
having carnal relations

442
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,031
with an alley cat.

443
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:53,077
It was a metaphor for my experience
with Japanese assholes like you.

444
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,872
Your deal with Mr. Bancroft
hardly requires you to endure abuse.

445
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,165
Apologies.

446
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,334
That accord was months in the making.

447
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,857
It will not be broken by this child.

448
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,213
Excuse me.

449
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,590
Get off me!

450
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,306
How drunk do you have to get
to go Oedipal on the old man?

451
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,602
I'm not stupid. He's backed up.
We're all backed up.

452
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,771
Mr. Kovacs,
what do you think you're doing?

453
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,854
Isaac, are you okay?

454
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,775
You're crazy. You know that?

455
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,408
I expected something more impressive than
slamming a spoiled child against a wall.

456
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:37,246
- Maybe I was wrong about you, Mr. Kovacs.
- Since we just met, chances are good.

457
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,458
Clarissa Severin.
I deal in art and antiquities.

458
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,085
And you're the Envoy.

459
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,214
Oh, don't worry. Oumou didn't say a word.

460
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,258
Laurens has been obsessed
with Quellcrist Falconer for...

461
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,387
Well, forever.

462
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,973
I really must thank you.

463
00:32:55,056 --> 00:33:01,104
The finder's fee for something as unusual
as you was really quite considerable.

464
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,398
Find you at the bar, Oumou.

465
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,316
What finder's fee?

466
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,778
Do you understand what's at stake
if you humiliate yourself by...

467
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,657
Doing my job? Why do you suddenly care
about my table manners?

468
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,702
This isn't about me. It's about you.

469
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,328
My behavior isn't the issue...

470
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,164
How many non-Meths
are guests at this party?

471
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,667
Two. You and me.

472
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,963
Do you know how many years it took me
to get invited into this house as a guest

473
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,047
and not the help?

474
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,675
- You want to become one of them.
- I will become one.

475
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
- What's this finder's fee?
- Oh...

476
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:38,016
Clarissa suggested bringing you back and
took quite a commission on finding you.

477
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,935
You're just the intersection
between Bancroft's nostalgia

478
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,437
and Clarissa's business sense.

479
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,523
You're an indulgence,
like an overbred pet.

480
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,654
I wasn't any further
than I had been when I walked in the door.

481
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,948
But one thing I knew for sure.

482
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,369
Not one of these people gave a damn
about any life but their own.

483
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,292
For my unique object,
I brought this hand...

484
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,049
which belonged to Konrad Harlan,
Founding Father of Harlan's World.

485
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:16,095
And he has an important message
for everybody here.

486
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,606
It's brilliant.
Just call more attention to yourself.

487
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,399
Oh, come on, that was funny.

488
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,902
I chose to wear my unique object.

489
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,197
They tell us it's illegal
to download the human mind

490
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,865
into anything but a human body.

491
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,743
But I say fuck that.

492
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,996
Laws don't apply to people like us.

493
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,375
So meet Janus, a rapist and a murderer

494
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,712
who was scheduled for erasure
when I plucked him from the shredder

495
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,839
and I offered him a place by my side.

496
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,467
Hey.

497
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,677
No unauthorized personnel.

498
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,221
Oh. Huh.

499
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,057
It's too bad
he didn't read the fine print.

500
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,980
- Hey, uh, you want a drink?
- Not supposed to drink on duty.

501
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,108
Like these skyshits know
what being on duty is.

502
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,112
- Ooh-rah.
- Ooh-fuckin'-rah. Pass the hooch.

503
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:18,199
I was curious what would happen to a man
if you downloaded him into a reptile.

504
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,996
The neomammalian complex, stuffed
into the most base of basal ganglia.

505
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,044
For science.

506
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,214
Turns out you go quite mad.

507
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,010
I tried resleeving him once,
and he just lay on the ground and writhed.

508
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,805
So now he's a snake forever.

509
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
- Ow. What the fuck?
- Reaper.

510
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,061
You'll only be out for a few minutes.
I need the room.

511
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,946
You shouldn't tell anybody about this,
because they'll fire you.

512
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,158
Oh, and take some analgesics
and be sure to hydrate when you wake up.

513
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,245
Tonight...

514
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,375
I offer you something more rare
than any of you can possibly imagine.

515
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,588
Something no one owns
in the entire Protectorate...

516
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,339
but me.

517
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,301
Ladies and gentlemen,

518
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,971
I give you the last Envoy.

519
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,477
Takeshi Kovacs.

520
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,989
Now, please...

521
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,826
enjoy the entertainment
we have for you tonight.

522
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,621
Please proceed to the arena.

523
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,419
Combat sleeves
to null-gravity-ready positions.

524
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,545
Yes.

525
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,177
I thought you didn't want to own me.

526
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,888
In this world,

527
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,810
the only real choice is between being
the purchaser and the purchased.

528
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,918
Shh!

529
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,670
Tonight,

530
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,798
combat to sleeve death...

531
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,177
between a married couple
who love each other.

532
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,727
Married fighters?

533
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,211
- Prepare to launch.
- Seems in poor taste.

534
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
No one is forcing them.

535
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,693
They could choose not to fight
if they wanted to.

536
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,821
...three, two, one.

537
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:10,037
It is a marriage... after all.

538
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,834
Combat sleeves ready.

539
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,762
If you're trying to impress me,
you're failing.

540
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,226
You're far more entertaining
than you know, Mr. Kovacs.

541
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,743
Combat sleeves
must reenter null g-force field.

542
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,863
Take him out, I'll upgrade you both.

543
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,537
Destroy the Envoy!

544
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,914
Make him pay!

545
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,041
Shut it off.

546
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,543
Sorry, ma'am.
Fight sequence is locked.

547
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,143
Move. Move.

548
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,608
Elliot, where the fuck are you?

549
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,693
I'm busy right now.
I'll call you back, okay?

550
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,046
You're not licensed for this.

551
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,174
There's no paperwork on the Envoy.

552
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,844
Oh, dear.
One of those unfortunate accidents.

553
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,390
Legally, of course, he is my property.

554
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,103
Let's raise the stakes, shall we?

555
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,491
Oh, shit.

556
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,043
BCPD, give me that weapon!

557
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,015
Ah!

558
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,281
Gun just went off.

559
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,950
One of those unfortunate accidents.

560
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,828
Show's over, folks.

561
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,663
His sleeve...

562
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,665
it's wrecked!

563
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,460
You fought an Envoy and lived.
Call it good.

564
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,837
But nobody died. We get nothing!

565
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,299
I can't even afford to fix him.

566
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,927
Ah!

567
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,977
They can have my winnings.
Upgraded sleeves for both of 'em.

568
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,855
Or you gonna go back on your word?

569
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,401
By all means. It's only fair.

570
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,846
Let's start by being very clear
with one another, shall we?

571
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,433
Stay away from my wife.

572
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,771
So you're spying on her.

573
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,233
I... I don't need to spy on her.

574
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,988
No, when you've been married
to the same woman for over 100 years,

575
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,242
you know what she does
and you know what she can't help doing.

576
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,120
Why do you care
what your wife does in her spare time,

577
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,330
considering what you're doing in yours?

578
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:09,503
Your limited life experience
cannot possibly encompass what it is

579
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,674
to love another person for over 100 years.

580
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,804
You achieve something close to veneration.

581
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:25,561
How does one match such respect
with the basest desires of the flesh?

582
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,814
So you love your wife too much
to fuck her?

583
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,817
I certainly love my wife too much
to let you fuck her.

584
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,448
Now, do you have anything to report
on your investigations tonight?

585
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,825
No. Great party, though.

586
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,744
Thanks.

587
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,506
Where the hell were you?

588
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,508
I had shit of my own to take care of.

589
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,261
Nothing that could possibly be worth
letting me get cut to ribbons.

590
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,972
Surveillance data.
Night Lizzie disappeared.

591
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,001
- You get something?
- Let you know when I scrub through it.

592
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,272
- You get anything?
- Yeah, I got nauseated.

593
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,109
This place, the way they live,
what they do for fun...

594
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:18,030
Nothing matters to them.
The longer they live, the worse it gets.

595
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,074
They get bored, so...

596
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,949
This is yours.

597
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,370
By the way, who are you?

598
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,705
Supposed to be my backup. And that's mine.

599
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,708
I didn't expect you to be
part of the floor show.

600
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,877
- Vernon Elliot.
- Kristin Ortega.

601
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,713
For just a few hours,
stay out of trouble, okay?

602
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,883
Saving your ass is not my only job.

603
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,843
Whatever you say, Lieutenant.

604
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,179
I like her.

605
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,349
Wait ten minutes.

606
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,227
So, where you going?

607
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,020
I got something to chase down.

608
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,356
Uh, you need, uh... need some backup?

609
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,192
Let me catch up with you later.

610
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,631
Alice...

611
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,136
it's me... Ava.

612
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,822
What happened?

613
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,532
I'm sorry...

614
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,034
They made me do it.

615
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,703
Made you what?

616
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:03,385
♪ O Death, have mercy ♪

617
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:08,098
♪ O Death, have mercy ♪

618
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,686

619
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,900
♪ Just spare me over another year ♪

620
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,651
I told you she'd do it.

621
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:33,040
♪ O Death, have mercy ♪

622
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:38,086
