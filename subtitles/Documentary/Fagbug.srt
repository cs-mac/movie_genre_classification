1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,071
Well, I'm Jewish.

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,706
My ancestors are Jewish.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,941
We would never drive a Kikebug.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,343
So, I'm just wondering ...

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,711
It's a really offensive term.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,281
I was wondering, what's
the argument with

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,050
fagbug?

8
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,258
[Voiceover] It started like
any other trip to the movies.

9
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,160
[Usher] Theater number seven
to your right, thank you.

10
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,229
[Voiceover] But people
at the Fagbug premiere

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,431
got to see a road
trip about tolerance

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,566
unfold before their eyes.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,202
[Voiceover] I'm
a 65yearold fag

14
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,603
in a '99 Beetle.

15
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,571
[Voiceover] The
documentary chronicles

16
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,874
Erin Davies crosscountry
trek in her Volkswagen

17
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,477
that was vandalized
with the words "fag"

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,379
and "U R gay."

19
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,015
[Man] What happened to a car

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,718
and then was able to use
it as away to get people

21
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,087
to talk about what
happens to human beings.

22
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,722
I thought it was very effective.

23
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,524
[Voiceover] Davies
was admittedly nervous

24
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,359
about the movie
premiere here in Albany

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,229
because this is where
here lifechanging journey

26
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,197
started six years ago.

27
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,433
But, 48 states,

28
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,900
four broken windows,

29
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,437
and over 200 speaking
events later,

30
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,239
she says it's been a wild,

31
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,142
and wildly important ride.

32
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,376
[Erin] When my car
first got vandalized,

33
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,245
I decided to leave the
graffiti on the car

34
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,213
to show a visual example

35
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,648
of what homophobia looks like

36
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,184
to people who may have
never experienced it.

37
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,154
A year after I began driving
my car with the graffiti,

38
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,456
I gave my car a
colorful makeover.

39
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,225
I planned a 58day
trip around the US,

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,494
and filmed the
documentary, called Fagbug

41
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,828
about the adventure.

42
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,564
The film is now on Netflix,

43
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,799
and has quite a cult
following from people

44
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,168
all around the world.

45
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,770
Since then, I've become
a nationally touring

46
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,572
motivational speaker.

47
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,573
On a fulltime basis,

48
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,175
I present the Fagbug story

49
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,143
to high schools, middle schools,

50
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,179
colleges, and businesses.

51
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,347
Once I began traveling,

52
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,516
my car became known
as the fagbug.

53
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,151
I made sure to take a picture

54
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,353
of every "welcome to"
sign I came across.

55
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,189
It was always a goal of mine,

56
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,356
from the very beginning,

57
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,958
to get my car to all 50 states.

58
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,661
It took me three years
to reach 48 states.

59
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,331
I spent another
three stuck at 48.

60
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,434
Hawaii and Alaska
being the last two

61
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,336
I had yet to get to.

62
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,806
If you're at 48, you've gotta
do noncontinental states.

63
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,342
Hawaii's fabulous.

64
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,376
Why not?

65
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,211
And, Alaska ...

66
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,878
is Alaska.

67
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,821
I planned a fourweek tour

68
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,657
where I booked myself
26 days straight.

69
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,160
Along the way, I interviewed
over 1,000 people.

70
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,431
Not once did I have to ask
anyone to do an interview.

71
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,233
They all came to me.

72
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,368
That's the magic behind the car.

73
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,304
It allows people's
defenses to disappear,

74
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,739
and brings to the surface

75
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,073
what's always been there,

76
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,376
but otherwise would
not have been seen.

77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,414
* We run far away from here
("We Run" by Caleb)

78
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:05,219
* We run far away from here

79
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:10,958
* And we run far away from here

80
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,397
* And we run far away from here

81
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,201
* And we run far away from here

82
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:26,807
* And we run far away from here

83
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:32,413
* And we run far
away from here *

84
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,450
[Sonya] I just want
people to understand that

85
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,586
the Fagbug, as a whole,

86
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,321
with Erin and the car included,

87
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,390
is a partnership.

88
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,426
The car is her business partner.

89
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,096
It takes at least,
at the very minimum,

90
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,565
50 percent of everything
that she makes.

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,233
[Erin] If you were
me, and you went through

92
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,268
48 states with a car, would
you wanna get to all 50?

93
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,603
Absolutely.

94
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,572
Absolutely, including
Hawaii and Alaska.

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,408
How would you do that?

96
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,310
I was planning on
covering the cost myself

97
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,412
with my tour that I was booking.

98
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,314
But, Sonya had an idea
that I should start

99
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,449
a Kickstarter campaign just
because it's so much money.

100
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,285
It costs about $2300
to ship the car

101
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,454
from California to
Hawaii, and back.

102
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,588
So, I'm on a three
and a half week trip.

103
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,789
I've taken my car to all states,

104
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,491
except Alaska and Hawaii.

105
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,959
I'm literally on my
way to Los Angeles.

106
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,628
I'm shipping my car, April 26th,

107
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,730
to Hawaii.

108
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,897
Today's Saturday, I
have an event to be at

109
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,798
in Northern Illinois,

110
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,467
about five hours from here.

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,302
Monday morning at nine,

112
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,170
my car is stuck in the middle of

113
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,405
a road, blocking traffic.

114
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,140
Getting it towed now.

115
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,509
[Man] This young lady's
vehicle will not go into gear.

116
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,746
We feel that it has
a clutch problem.

117
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,381
My car is getting
worked on right now.

118
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:41,782
It needs a new clutch.

119
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,150
They tried other things

120
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,486
but worstcase scenario
is what happened.

121
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,120
It's gonna cost about $1500.

122
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,188
So, here we go.

123
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,793
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

124
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,295
seven, eight, nine,

125
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,532
10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ...

126
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,000
$1500 ...

127
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,136
is going into fixing my clutch.

128
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,372
I did have an event
scheduled today

129
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,773
at Northern Illinois University.

130
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,174
Since they got me a rental car,

131
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,208
I was willing to drive there.

132
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,377
It's about five hours away.

133
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,446
I gave them the
option of me coming,

134
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,615
and getting there in time
for the screening tonight,

135
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,917
or rescheduling.

136
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,386
They chose to reschedule ...

137
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,321
because they'd rather
have the car there.

138
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,357
See, people like my car
more than they like me.

139
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,592
The car is really

140
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,561
kind of the center of
attraction, I think,

141
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,397
with your story
and your program.

142
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,566
We wanted to do
something like this,

143
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,402
where we could have
your car and you

144
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,371
out in the daytime to get
more interest in the evening.

145
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,740
Just didn't think it was
gonna work out very well

146
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,342
without the actual bug here.

147
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,379
* These things will work in time

148
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,015
* We both say willingly

149
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,518
* But history repeats itself

150
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,454
* Says something inside of me

151
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,089
* I will not be pushed around

152
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,826
* For mutual gain

153
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,361
* We're framing the fabric

154
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:05,098
* For intensity's sake

155
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,467
My favorite part
of driving the car

156
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,401
for the last six years is that

157
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,903
people have left
handwritten notes on my car.

158
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,939
This one is my
secondfavorite one.

159
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,541
I don't know who left this,

160
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,708
but can you read this one to me?

161
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,510
It says, "I sometimes
run past your car

162
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,745
"when I'm out running.

163
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,112
"I told myself the
next time I did,

164
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,514
"I would break up with
my perfect boyfriend

165
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,550
"and tell him the
truth, I'm gay.

166
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,384
"Here goes nothing.

167
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,352
"Thank you Fagbug."

168
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,420
Oh my, God, that's cool.

169
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,988
It's written on this little

170
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,757
kittycat PostIt.

171
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,291
My car has been egged.

172
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,292
My car has been keyed,

173
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,461
the whole driver's side.

174
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,528
Mud's been thrown at my car.

175
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,763
My car has been spit on.

176
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,432
One time, somebody put
a trashcan on my car,

177
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,167
upsidedown.

178
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,470
Another time, somebody put
both my windshield wipers

179
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,971
and stood 'em standing
straight up and down.

180
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,706
I was like, "If you're gonna
do something, like seriously,

181
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,274
"that's the best you
can come up with?"

182
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,109
My car has only been
rewritten on again, one time.

183
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,278
Somebody wrote, "Faggets
plus dikes need to die,"

184
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,713
on my driver's side window.

185
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,548
If you look closely, they
also misspelled faggots

186
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,583
and they misspelled dykes

187
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,150
so I try to keep in mind
the intelligence level

188
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,285
of who we're dealing with, here.

189
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,487
[Girl] I think ...

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,655
it's Ok to be gay.

191
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,757
You're just goin' to
hell, but it's Ok.

192
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,758
[Erin] Would you
drive this car around?

193
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,659
Hell no!

194
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,660
[Erin] Why not?

195
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:07,661
People gone get
the wrong idea.

196
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,963
(laughter)

197
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,465
[Erin] People will
think you're gay?

198
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,600
Yeah!

199
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,067
[Erin] So you wanna
stay as far away from it

200
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:14,935
as possible? [Harrison]
Yeah, I'm gonna have Freddy

201
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:15,569
comin' from across the road,

202
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,670
(exaggerated) "Hey!"

203
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:17,605
Get the fuck away from me.

204
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,606
That's someone who's not

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,840
comfortable with
their sexuality.

206
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,308
No, I just don't like
being around faggots.

207
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,276
I was just looking
out from the window,

208
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,678
and was just seeing
that three guys,

209
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,314
about teenage age,

210
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,650
just walking up,
taking pictures.

211
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,518
I see one guy.

212
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,619
He was facing

213
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,753
towards the window.

214
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,622
I see him just bending down,

215
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,323
and just mooning the camera,

216
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,125
or mooning his friend's phone.

217
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm thinking, "Oh my, God.

218
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,295
"That guy is mooning the car."

219
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,631
[Erin] You decided
to moon my car?

220
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,866
I'm sorry, it's
just a thing we do.

221
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,001
[Erin] What made
you wanna moon it?

222
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,803
I don't know, it's
just a thing we do.

223
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,305
[Erin] You just moon
everything in Bakersfield?

224
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,407
Pretty much, huh?
[Luis] Yeah.

225
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,677
[Erin] Was it your idea
or him to moon the car?

226
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,278
Yeah.

227
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,412
[Erin] Why'd you think
that would be cool? (laughs)

228
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,915
To put it on
Facebook or Tumblr.

229
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,183
[Erin] So, you saw the car?

230
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,618
How'd you see it?

231
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,453
[Jeremy] I walked past
it out of the hotel.

232
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,721
[Erin] What'd you think?

233
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,856
[Jeremy] I thought
it was pretty cool.

234
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,523
[Erin] And you
took a picture of it?

235
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,858
[Jeremy] Yeah.

236
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:11,692
[Voiceover] What'd
you do with the picture?

237
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,726
Tagged it on Instagram.

238
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,327
Threw it to my Facebook.

239
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,497
Put a nice pride tag
on it, and everything.

240
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,465
Within ...

241
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,067
10 seconds, I think it was,

242
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,334
somebody told me
your whole story.

243
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,836
Why aren't you driving

244
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,671
the Dykebug? Lesbians,
I guess that's the ...

245
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,905
That's what I wanna know.

246
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,573
[Adam] It'd be the
same thing, right?

247
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,340
But, is it something

248
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,610
you take offense to?
[Jim] The Dyke Bus.

249
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,680
[Erin] You think it should
be called the Dykebug?

250
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,181
The Dyke Bus.

251
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,249
With a bunch of dykes on it.

252
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,718
Just seeing the car

253
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,819
name is Fagbug,

254
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,353
I think that's just an insult.

255
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,321
[Voiceover] I'm on the way

256
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,556
here from Nebraska.

257
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,958
Some guys in a
truck drove by and

258
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,527
blew up a condom,
and were waving it

259
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,362
out their window at me.

260
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,900
Another person in a truck,

261
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,702
way ahead of me, slowed down.

262
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,437
I thought, "They're
really wanting me

263
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,940
"to catch up to them so
they can get pictures."

264
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,109
As soon as I came
up next to them,

265
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,578
they were taking pictures.

266
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:05,979
I really don't like
when people keep

267
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,514
surrounding my car,

268
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,216
and make it so it's
unsafe for me to drive,

269
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,285
(mumbles) I don't know,
going 15 miles an hour

270
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:16,123
on a 75mileanhour road
just to get a picture.

271
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,691
It's not safe for anybody.

272
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,525
* The ones that jaw flap
("Straighten Up" by YG Rippa)

273
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,593
* And always run they mouth

274
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,595
* Be the main ones
that don't know crap

275
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,230
* 'Bout what they
saying they playing

276
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,898
* They put they issues on you

277
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,600
* But you gone
listen to the fool

278
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,301
* But he the one fooling you

279
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,870
Some guy wrote on Twitter.

280
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,739
Actually, he walked
by a while ago.

281
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,475
He said that he wanted
to throw the table over

282
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,144
and kick out the
windows to the car.

283
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,578
Well, uh ...

284
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,580
You found me on Twitter

285
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,616
posting comments about ...

286
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,919
the fagbug.

287
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,020
[Erin] What'd you think
when you first saw it?

288
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,256
Well,

289
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,625
a lot of things, I guess.

290
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,827
Mainly, why was it here?

291
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,465
I kinda was getting
mixed thoughts

292
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,634
'cause I didn't know
if you was progay

293
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,601
or antigay.

294
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,570
Really didn't know.

295
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,338
As I looked into it, my
views and thoughts kinda

296
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,274
changed on it, because I'm for

297
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,442
a lot of movement.

298
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,443
Definitely if it's
something positive,

299
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,979
I'm all for movements.

300
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,347
I can also respect
that it's a story

301
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,149
behind the Fagbug.

302
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,851
* You don't even know
what you reaching for
("Straighten Up" by YG Rippa)

303
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,787
* Trying to get out of your hole

304
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,255
* But you just keep
on digging more

305
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,257
* Pull yourself up
dust your ish off

306
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,459
* Keep your chin up chin up

307
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,428
* And straighten
up or give it up *

308
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,230
[Terence] When I was driving
through Downtown Chico.

309
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,499
I was on a cookie run.

310
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,268
We did chocolate chip
cookies this afternoon.

311
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,537
Your car was parked on
the side of the road,

312
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,139
so I ...

313
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,875
got online, emailed
you, and you showed up.

314
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,476
In the last six years, I
replied to every single person

315
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,945
that's ever sent me a message,

316
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,646
unless, for some reason,
I accidentally missed it.

317
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,215
So, I probably responded
to 30,000 emails.

318
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,484
I try to be as available to
this conversation as I can.

319
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,854
This one's from Syracuse,
New York, and it says,

320
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,724
"I'm sick of seeing
your car around here,

321
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,326
"and sick of hearing how
inspiring of a person

322
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,861
"people think you
are, or vice versa.

323
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,463
"I think you are a
selfindulging cunt

324
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,698
"who is taking
advantage of something

325
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,233
"that happened to
you seven years ago

326
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,835
"for personal benefit.

327
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,703
"Get a real job, stop
being a bottom feeder.

328
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,205
"Setting a terrible,
pathetic example

329
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,573
"for the GLBT community."

330
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,308
So, even this woman, her
name was Janet Smith,

331
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,910
I emailed ...

332
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,311
I even responded to her,

333
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,213
and said I'd be more than
glad to meet you in person,

334
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,481
have a facetoface
conversation.

335
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,150
And of course
even, she declined.

336
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,485
I'm amazed that
your approach is,

337
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,889
that anybody who writes
to you deserves an answer.

338
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,323
I just love for that.
[Lady] That's awesome!

339
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,092
I just think
that's so amazing.

340
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,128
And you've obviously gotten
some bad responses but

341
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,397
you're talking.

342
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,232
You're just wonderful, I think.

343
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,735

345
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,445
[Voiceover] I seen
an article on TV about

346
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,915
somebody painting a
house in colors like this

347
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,817
across the street
from an antigay

348
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,888
church and I thought
it was unbelievable

349
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,790
what they're doing and
it kind of reminds me

350
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,957
of the same thing.

351
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,458
We're in front of
the Equality House,

352
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,128
which is across the street from
the Westboro Baptist Church,

353
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,597
the most known hate group

354
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,399
in the United States
perhaps right now.

355
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,902
This is a house that we painted
the colors of the pride flag

356
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,104
and it also has actually more
colors that the pride flag

357
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,906
to reflect a greater diversity.

358
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,440
This isn't just a
gay rights issue,

359
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,909
this is about everyone.

360
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,777
Many years ago when I first
went to community college,

361
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,445
I was actually still
in high school.

362
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,482
The community college that I
attended was Kilbourn College

363
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:33,887
and there was a production
of Angels in America slotted

364
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,824
to go on campus and so

365
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,626
I was actually cast in that as
a 17 year old in high school.

366
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,530
The Westboro Baptist Church
came in to protest with signs

367
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,833
that had stick figures that

368
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,170
were having anal
sex, anal intercourse
with flyers that said

369
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,238
"Maggots are better
than faggots,

370
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,006
"because at least
maggots are natural."

371
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,107
What's the opposite of God?

372
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:54,842
The devil.

373
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,476
What's the opposite of

374
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,046
a regular marriage between
a marriage and a woman?

375
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,447
Gays!

376
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,850
So it's a whole opposite
thing, good and bad.

377
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,518
I don't agree with Westboro
Baptist at all because

378
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,487
what they're basically doing

379
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,191
is presenting their opinions
in probably the most

380
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,693
controversial way they
possibly can do it.

381
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,663
And that's not the
message of Christianity.

382
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,033
That's not the message of
what God would have us doing.

383
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,535
You might see their hatred but
there's still love all around

384
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,038
and so it's supposed to be
where ever there's hate,

385
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,673
there's also love, you
just have to look for it.

386
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,276
I love the fact that you
stopped at the Rainbow House

387
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,444
right across from
Fred Phelp's church

388
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,680
because he is the biggest
bigot in the world.

389
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,684
And I've had people ask me
why hasn't somebody shot him

390
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,386
it's like, 'cause none of
us want to make a martyr

391
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,954
out of him that's why.

392
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,356
My comment on that is the
bullet is scared to hit 'em.

393
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,292
(laughter)

394
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,359
[Erin] How did you
feel about this house

395
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,627
when they painted it?

396
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,397
A breath of fresh air.

397
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,333
When they finished painting it,

398
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,037
and that flag went up, the
United States flag flying

399
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,606
the way it was designed
to fly, proudly.

400
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,808
and the rainbow flag below it.

401
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,243
That's what freedom's about.

402
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,212
Freedom to express
ourselves any way in this

403
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,915
United States that we
feel comfortable doing.

404
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,417
We actually have
a third boyfriend.

405
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,920
We were trying to get him
to meet up with us but

406
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,654
we're a throuple, so
there's three of us.

407
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,155
[Erin] Like a triad?

408
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,523
Yeah, a triad.

409
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,927
We call it a throuple
instead of a couple.

410
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,896
[Erin] How do your
families respond to that?

411
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,433
Well, that's real interesting
because Noni's parents know

412
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,236
Todd's family knows but
I haven't talked to my

413
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,238
family about it at all, 'cause

414
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,208
it's like I said before,
I'm really scared

415
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,977
what would happen
if they rejected me.

416
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,246
I have a great family
and we're really close.

417
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,249
We've just never talked
about it any of this.

418
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,417
I knew about there
being gay people

419
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,920
and I knew about straight
people, so I thought

420
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,888
there was maybe something
kind of wrong with me.

421
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,558
Maybe I wasn't
all the way gay or

422
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,993
all the way straight.

423
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,629
"Do other people have crushes
on both boys and girls?"

424
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,198
But then when you
talk to your friends,

425
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,366
"No, no way!"

426
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,900
"No way, ew!"

427
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,602
The other girls were like,

428
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,204
"No way, I wouldn't have a
crush on a girl, that's gross."

429
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,406
So it was like I knew I
was definitely different.

430
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,576
But then I knew I wasn't
different in the ways that like

431
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,144
the gay kids were different.

432
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,280
So I couldn't figure that
out and so I thought maybe

433
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,482
there was just something
weird or freakish about me

434
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,650
or something, I didn't
know about bisexuality.

435
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,456
I just sort of carried it
with me, almost like a secret.

436
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,125
I'm pansexual,

437
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,259
which means I see
people for who they are

438
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,695
and I don't classify
as male or female.

439
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,897
[Erin] So you just
have more of an emotional

440
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,399
connection with people?

441
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,001
Yes.

442
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,435
[Erin] Do people
understand that mostly or no?

443
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,437
I think mostly people are like

444
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,072
say the same thing like,

445
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,275
"Oh, bisexual" but it's
completely different

446
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,613
because if I classified
people as their gender,

447
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,382
they may not associate
with that gender.

448
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,019
It's all a matter
of how they feel

449
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,722
but I connect to people in
general, regardless of sex.

450
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,158
[Erin] So you don't
identify as bisexual?

451
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,659
No.

452
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,194
[Erin] Ok, what's the
main difference between

453
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,795
pansexual and bisexual.

454
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,999
A pansexual is more of

455
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,269
emotional connections and
not classifying people

456
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,704
as male or female, just
accepting all people equal.

457
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,207
[Erin] So it would be more
like you're open to someone

458
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,975
even if they're transgender?

459
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,044
Yeah!

460
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,211
I consider myself
a straight woman.

461
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,379
[Erin] Ok and how about you?

462
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm a transgender man.

463
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,082
And I identify as queer.

464
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,085
[Erin] Ok what does that mean,
like that term mean to you?

465
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,520
What queer means
to me is sort of ...

466
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,222
I'm just gonna be different.

467
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,059
I've dated men,
I've dated women.

468
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,229
I'm open to people of all
genders and sexuality.

469
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,830
Not any more that I'm with

470
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,600
the person that I want
to be with forever.

471
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:49,109
But yeah, I don't feel
that I can be defined.

472
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,213
I like the term queer
in that it's about

473
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,248
being different always.

474
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,650
I thought it showed
an impressive amount

475
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,021
of dedication to say, "Ok,
I'm going to ship a car."

476
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,824
That's pretty impressive.

477
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,959
So kudos on the stubbornness.

478
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,861
To be able to ship the car
I have to have an emergency

479
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,630
working brake and
my emergency brake

480
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,432
works about 70 percent.

481
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,701
We got parts ordered for you,

482
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,604
which we're installing
now, we're replacing some

483
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,607
rusted, corroded
brake cables and

484
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,575
brake calibers.

485
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,078
You're having something
done to your car

486
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,214
to prepare it to be
shipped to Hawaii

487
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,183
from San Diego I hear.

488
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,452
Getting my car fixed
today is almost $1200.

489
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,621
Fixing the emergency brake.

490
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,157
So that's happened.

491
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,592
I'm always getting
work done that's $25.

492
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,131
My spark plugs was $100.

493
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,134
Getting my front and back
lights was about 300.

494
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,401
I have an event with

495
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,240
Sunseeker GLBT Resort
and Maui Pride.

496
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,074
They've set up a screening
of the movie with the car

497
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,614
on May 10th and so when I
called to make the reservation

498
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,950
the woman said there's
really no guarantee

499
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,318
and there's no way of
getting a guarantee so the

500
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,155
car could actually not be there
in time and I know that they

501
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,157
they really want
the car to be there.

502
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,524
If the car's not gonna be there,

503
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,127
they're not sure if they
would wanna to do the event

504
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,162
without the car.

505
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,264
I'm feeling a lot of
pressure right now.

506
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,266
Just uneasiness of

507
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,369
kind of at the whim of,

508
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,671
I've never had to ship
my car before so this is

509
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,406
somewhat unsettling.

510
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,740
We're at San Diego
Vehicle Processing Center

511
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,008
(mumbles) to Hawaii.

512
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,310
doing an inspection
on your vehicle,

513
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,279
writing down any chips,
dents, scratches,

514
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,348
I'll check the interior
for dirt and soiling,

515
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,817
then we will take the vehicle,
put it on a transporter

516
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,352
and take it down to the ship.

517
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,197
If Erin called me from Hawaii
and told me that she wishes

518
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,365
that I was there with her,
I could not handle it.

519
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,367
I'd much rather
drive somewhere,

520
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,869
than drive 20 hours up there.

521
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:01,941
I fly sometimes but I really
get nauseous on a plane.

522
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,345
We're about to get on our
final plane for Hawaii.

523
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,379
While Erin was away,

524
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:11,218
I was obsessively looking
up with anticipation

525
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,152
of coming here on
Google Earth and

526
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,688
looking up all the
pictures and all around

527
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,723
and I knew instantly I was like,

528
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,325
"Erin, I want to live there."

529
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,393
My main concern with Hawaii
is making sure the car

530
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,196
actually gets shipped
there successfully.

531
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,665
We're walking to
pick up Erin's car.

532
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,734
We've already been
told be a couple people

533
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,202
we can't videotape here.

534
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,737
We have a nine
o'clock appointment.

535
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,339
It's about 10 after now.

536
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,373
We have a little bit
more of a walk to go.

537
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,941
Hopefully my car is here.

538
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,043
As soon as we came
into this gated area.

539
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,811
I just felt so
excited to see my car

540
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,348
and how colorful it was and
just in the parking lot.

541
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,350
I've had all this anxiety
not knowing if it was gonna

542
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,585
make it in time when they
told me there's no guarantees.

543
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,755
I felt like I just didn't
know what was gonna happen.

544
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,590
It's kind of surreal to see

545
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,359
your car here in Hawaii.

546
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,394
I feel really happy
that it's actually here.

547
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,597
[Sonya] Are you on the
verge of tears right now?

548
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,232
I don't know.

549
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,502
Kind of with so much
uncertainty with this and I know

550
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,371
I have plans, I have
an event tomorrow.

551
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,340
It was a lot of money
getting it here.

552
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,441
[Sonya] A lot of
pressure on you?

553
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,877
You almost thought
it wouldn't be here.

554
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,445
You were preparing
yourself for the worst?

555
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,646
Yep.

556
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,889
We were just driving
along and there she is

557
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,424
in the fagbug pulling
out of the port,

558
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,393
covered with salt
spray I was like,

559
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,262
"Oh my God, there she is, I
can't believe it, she's here!"

560
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,331
I seen rainbow, at
first I thought was,

561
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,034
"Oh peace" and then when we
read it we were like, "What?!"

562
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,135
We were driving on the road.

563
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,370
I saw the fagbug and I

564
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,606
pretty much crashed our car
into the sign 'cause I was like,

565
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,274
"That's the fagbug!"

566
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,443
And I yelled it to my
coworkers and they didn't know

567
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,311
what I was talking about.

568
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,413
So I pulled over,

569
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,281
I was really excited to
see you here in Maui.

570
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,317
I've been following the
story for like six years.

571
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,454
(mumbles) and you put
it down at the doorways

572
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,789
www.fagbug.com

573
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,327
I'm planning on going on
there soon, checking it out.

574
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,161
I mean I've seen a car
like this but not how

575
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,130
the paint job is
and stuff like that.

576
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,965
That makes it,

577
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,300
three thumbs up.

578
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,568
(laughter)

579
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,303
They thought they'd
bring this car over

580
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,005
so that they could drive it
while they're on vacation.

581
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,342
That's crazy!

582
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,459
I had nothing set up
in Hawaii or Alaska.

583
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,727
So I was trying to figure
out something to help

584
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,665
with the trip so I eventually
found this hotel is called

585
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,000
Maui Sunseeker GLBT Resort

586
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,503
So they're basically comp'ing
our room for five nights

587
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,372
in exchange for us
showing the movie.

588
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,106
I think that it's a
powerful message that needs

589
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,307
to be carried to all 50 states.

590
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,711
I want to join the
cause and contribute,

591
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,212
so here we are.

592
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,881
Erin had reached out
to me and asked about

593
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,817
coming to Maui and this
was part of her dream

594
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,354
to complete her tour and for
all of you that come from

595
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:05,525
the main land you know that
it takes a lot to get here.

596
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,160
And moving a car here
and all the headaches

597
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,497
that you deal with and
timing that to make sure that

598
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,434
we can have this date at this
theater at the same time.

599
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,303
It took quite a bit
of coordination.

600
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,805
I don't ever give
out my toy cars

601
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,206
because they're very
expensive to produce.

602
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,541
I really can't give them out but

603
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,176
because this is a
special opportunity,

604
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,112
once in a lifetime for
me to be here in Hawaii,

605
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,381
I'd love to give the couple ...

606
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,049
Who are the kids
in the audience?

607
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,718
Could you both come
up here real quick?

608
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,420
I just would love to give both
of the kids in the audience.

609
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,354
Thank you for your patience.

610
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,757
(applause)

611
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,694
A lei is just a formal
exchange of aloha,

612
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,431
of greeting, of
affection, of welcoming.

613
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,400
It's just like a
little token and

614
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,568
there's a lot deeper meaning

615
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,437
obviously to the native
Hawaiians and so forth.

616
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,541
For the lei person, I'd
consider myself a lei person

617
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,543
and I'm not of Hawaii
ancestry or blood.

618
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:01,448
We use it as a token of a
gift of welcome, affection.

619
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,584
Say, "Hey, welcome to the
island, welcome to our home."

620
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,520
[Erin] What do you think
of the fagbug getting laid?

621
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,723
Do it, do it, yeah, yeah!

622
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,259
[Erin] Have you ever
given a lei to a car before?

623
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,529
I have never
leid a car before.

624
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,464
He's gotten laid in a car.

625
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,365
(laughter)

626
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,403
Just seeing the way the
people initially embraced us

627
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,573
and welcomed us and they

628
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,408
made a 20 foot long
lei for her car.

629
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,627
[Erin] Where did you
guys get the lei from?

630
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:48,728
[Bruce] We made it.

631
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,396
[Erin] You made it?

632
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,498
[Bruce] We bought all
the individual ones and we

633
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,467
put them altogether so
that we'd have the colors

634
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,435
of the rainbow flag for it.

635
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,572
[Erin] That's awesome,
thanks so much, that's so fun!

636
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,474
[Chuck] You're so welcome.
Welcome to Hawaii!

637
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,175
[Sonya] I just felt like it

638
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,544
was just culminating
right there.

639
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,547
It was just a special
moment that they

640
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,316
they prepared for us in
advance to share with them,

641
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,918
so that was really nice.

642
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,954
They got all this put together
and brought that out today.

643
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,490
That was my highlight
of the day today.

644
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:21,494
[Rudy] A lot of people use the
word pride almost as if it were

645
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,367
a badge of honor but really

646
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:32,038
when you think about it,
pride is a lot of times

647
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:35,575
the cause of shame and the
way out of shame is humility.

648
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,379
I've realized that
perhaps being more humble

649
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,549
and not as proud is really the

650
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,985
best way to get out of that
whole shameful situation.

651
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,188
Mahu is used as a
Hawaiian word for gay.

652
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,958
But a mahu meant
an effeminate male.

653
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,226
They were raised as not
particularly as a woman

654
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,728
but as an effeminate male.

655
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:59,732
But in the Hawaiian culture
they were actual medicine

656
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:03,035
people or consultants
to the king and queen.

657
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,539
They were revered as high
in the Hawaiian court.

658
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:12,144
But as time went on,
you'll hear people go,

659
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,513
"Oh mahu, you fucking mahu!"

660
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,550
That means basically,
it's faggot.

661
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,552
[Erin] When you were
younger and growing up,

662
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,353
do you remember
hearing people say,

663
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,690
fag and gay and
those kind of words?

664
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,710
I was playing a club called
the Rawhide in Los Angeles

665
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,713
and I found out all
the men were gay

666
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,347
but they looked like cowboys.

667
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,917
I thought it was just
a country western bar.

668
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,719
[Erin] So that's how
you first heard the word?

669
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,054
You didn't even
know gay existed?

670
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,423
I didn't until I
saw two men kissing.

671
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,558
[Erin] In 2006.

672
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,829
And I thought, "What the
crap is going on here?"

673
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,897
I didn't know!

674
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:09,268
I think in the fifth
grade there was a boy that

675
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,605
for whatever reason
people started to pick on,

676
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,506
and even though he had
been really popular.

677
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,508
Then they started
to pick on him.

678
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,913
I remember after school one
time everybody following him

679
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:22,514
and calling him a fag.

680
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,587
That still kind of obviously
bothers me to this day

681
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,791
that I sort of went
along with it all.

682
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,727
When I was a little
kid, I heard that word

683
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,628
getting tossed around a lot.

684
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,029
[Erin] How old were you?

685
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:42,769
I would say probably
around eight, nine.

686
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,370
I grew up in a rough life.

687
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,272
[Erin] Did anybody
ever say it to you?

688
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,775
Oh yeah, I've been called
(unclear) a million times.

689
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,310
But I love it, I'm a
fag, I'm proud to be one.

690
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,478
[Clayton] I'll give you
an example of something

691
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,846
that happened last night,

692
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,347
we were walking over to
the restaurant for dinner

693
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,283
and the two guys in front
of us were holding hands

694
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,951
and I'm like, "Oh gosh!"

695
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,653
I kind of walked
back a little bit.

696
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:03,155
I'm like, "Oh I don't want
them to think I'm gay too."

697
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06,458
Because you can become a
victim of a crime, that easy.

698
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,027
[Erin] So you guys
don't walk around

699
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,228
holding hand hands together?

700
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,530
No definitely not!

701
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:16,769
And it always makes me
a little uncomfortable

702
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,570
being around other
gay people that do.

703
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,208
I don't really say anything
to them but it just makes me

704
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,342
feel uncomfortable because

705
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm not very big and
I've had my own share of

706
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,683
being picked on all my life.

707
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,918
I got beat up a lot.

708
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,924
And it's nice now to
just be proud and out.

709
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,126
[Erin] Why do you
think some people,

710
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,695
especially in your
position as educators,

711
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,230
feel hesitant to come out?

712
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:48,234
Well it's dangerous,
it's super dangerous

713
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,736
'cause it could cost us our job.

714
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,240
But certain things you've
got to stand up for

715
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,075
and that was one of the
things I was willing to say,

716
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,379
"I'm gay and you're
going to fire me,

717
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:02,414
"then you got to fire me."

718
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:06,518
I have my masters in
education and I got certified

719
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,754
to teach K12 art.

720
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,256
In the process of getting
certified you have to do

721
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,991
two placements, one
at elementary level,

722
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,225
one in high school.

723
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,428
So I had the elementary
level placement first.

724
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,064
I was in a K through
eight school.

725
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,334
And in the first nine days
there were 39 antigay comments

726
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,903
made in the classrooms I was in.

727
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,438
And it came to a point where

728
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,409
it just had gotten so bad that I
finally just told the students,

729
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,411
"I'm gay and I'm not
gonna tolerate that

730
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,913
"in the classroom."

731
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,483
And within 48 hours I was
fired from my placement.

732
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,886
[Voiceover] I have an
eight year old boy who after

733
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,921
seeing her by the grocery
store wanted to know what

734
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:45,724
fag was and that
to me is an issue!

735
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,894
Sexual orientation,
especially in kindergarten

736
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:51,030
or first grade, shouldn't
be an idea or thought.

737
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,834
I used to work with kids for
eight years at churches and

738
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,970
one of the things one of the
pastors talked to me about

739
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:02,408
was working with kids and he
knew that I was a closet gay

740
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,211
and didn't want me to
have certain relationships

741
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,212
with the other boys
and I was like,

742
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,080
"Nothing's changing."

743
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,283
You have boundaries with
anybody that you work with

744
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,854
whatever you do, just because
you're gay doesn't change

745
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,389
the way you're gonna have
a relationship with a kid.

746
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,257
I showed him a
picture of the toy car

747
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,959
'cause a friend of ours has one

748
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,494
and he wanted a
rainbow car of his own.

749
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,864
We wanted one
because we like yours

750
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,466
and we just think
it's really cool.

751
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,302
It's something for him to
show his little friends

752
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:33,605
and perhaps help teach
other kids that everybody

753
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,074
should be treated equal.

754
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,943
There are some routes
that know me by name because

755
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,444
I've driven them
more than others.

756
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,879
I'm a substitute driver.

757
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,282
Most of the time the way the
conversation will happens is

758
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,317
they'll have conversations
among themselves.

759
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,487
Tallying up, giving me boy
points and girl points.

760
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:52,224
They'll talk about how,

761
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,862
"She sounds kind of like she's
a boy but there are all these

762
00:29:55,895 --> 00:30:00,699
"other things about her that
are feminine" in so many words

763
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,803
then finally one or two
brave students will come up

764
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,505
and ask me if I'm a boy
or girl and I'll tell them

765
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,908
that's not the question
you should be asking.

766
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,844
The question you should be
asking is whether or not

767
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:14,280
you think I'm Ok to drive
this bus, whether or not

768
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,215
you think I can
transport you safely.

769
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,485
My aunt got a restraining
order against me

770
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:23,155
to keep me away from
my little cousins and

771
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,826
to basically keep me
from turning them gay.

772
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,264
I have three little cousins
who I love and adore.

773
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,500
They are like my
other little sisters.

774
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,303
We were really, really
close until then.

775
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,907
I also have a niece that
was like a daughter to me.

776
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,676
I helped raise her when
she was born, my sister's a

777
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,280
teenaged mother so the whole
family helped with that.

778
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:53,019
My niece was like my daughter
and it really killed me because

779
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,021
within the restraining order...

780
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,889
My whole family
lives within like

781
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,225
virtually a block
radius of each other.

782
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,261
So there is absolutely
no house on that block

783
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,262
that I could go to

784
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,633
that I wouldn't be
in violation of.

785
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,404
Not my parents house I
couldn't go over to anything.

786
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,840
Any family functions, I
could not see my grandma

787
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,408
who lives next
door to my parents,

788
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,211
my aunt who lives behind them.

789
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,215
We literally live in a
block radius of each other.

790
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,919
It was covered under
the protection that ...

791
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,956
And I'm not completely
sure how it was legit that

792
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,357
they got this order

793
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,392
but for some reason, the
safety of her children

794
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,061
was at stake because I was gay.

795
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,628
You guys have been

796
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,431
persecuted for so long.

797
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,969
Why shouldn't you be
allowed to educate people?

798
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:46,905
and what a great way to educate
people with a bug, the car,

799
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,708
kids would love it and
kids would understand

800
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,311
and I bet you bottom dollar
when you go in to those schools,

801
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,415
there are so many people
who have same parents

802
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,118
that they call
mommy/mommy or daddy/daddy

803
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,153
and people just don't know it.

804
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,688
I have two moms.

805
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,124
Sometimes I'll be in school,

806
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,061
I have a step mom also,
that's my dad's wife.

807
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,998
And they'll go around and
they'll say I have three dads.

808
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,168
It's Ok, it get's
annoying a little bit

809
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,103
but I try to get through it.

810
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,338
I'm on my school's
archery team

811
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,707
so my parents came
watch me compete.

812
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,344
And my friends were wondering
if my parents were there.

813
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,646
So I said, "Yeah my
parents are over there."

814
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:31,117
And they were like,
"Oh who are they?"

815
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,351
And I said, "Those are my moms."

816
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,254
And they were like, "Oh,
your step mom and your mom?"

817
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,989
And I said "No, they
are both my moms."

818
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,524
And they were like, "Oh!"

819
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,162
It can kind of be hard
because sometimes you do lose

820
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:47,166
friends or people
who you thought you
were friends with but

821
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,002
I guess they really
weren't your friends

822
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:54,140
in the first place if they don't
accept you and your family.

823
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:58,010
I called my mom up just
to see what she was doing

824
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,311
and I went to go
hang out with her.

825
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:04,216
So I come dressed up like how
I am, all manly and stuff.

826
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,252
And she doesn't like that.

827
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,056
And we were sitting on
the couch and she's all

828
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,590
far away and distant.

829
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,162
She just like, "Well I just
don't want you to hit on me!"

830
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,964
There's nothing I could of
said except for, "Hi mom."

831
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,033
I mean how does that
mean that I want to

832
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,869
[Erin] So you think maybe
because you like women

833
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,238
she just thinks in her
mind, just like how a lot

834
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,407
of people think, that
you're gonna hit on them?

835
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,276
Yeah, they think that gay
people don't have a type.

836
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,846
I think people do have a type.

837
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,849
You're my mom so of
course you're definitely

838
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,418
no way in hell gonna be my type.

839
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,091
There is no way in hell I
would find my mom attractive.

840
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,459
I could say my mom is
beautiful, that's different

841
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
but I'm not like,
"Damn, check out my mom!

842
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:52,198
"Look at her ass, it's so fine!"

843
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,201
No, I'm not gonna
do that to my mom.

844
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,370
I have a friend that
I grew up with that

845
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,575
he knew he was gay
when he was young.

846
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,612
Most of us kind of had the
idea but he came out the closet

847
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,647
when he was about 16 and

848
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,649
his parents

849
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,587
sent him on an LDS mission and
basically just told him that

850
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,291
if he didn't come back from
the mission and not be gay

851
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,760
he was gonna be cut
out of the will.

852
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,130
And very wealthy family,

853
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,269
[Erin] Did he go
on this mission?

854
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,570
He did go this mission,
he came back early

855
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:33,605
and didn't do the
whole two years.

856
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,775
And he came back
gay, imagine that.

857
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,245
I identify as gay.

858
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,347
[Erin] Oh you
do Ok, all right.

859
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,415
Did you come out when
you were younger?

860
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:47,353
No, it's still not
out really to family.

861
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:54,160
So if they see this,
hi, surprise, surprise!

862
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,827
[Erin] You found out
your son was gay recently?

863
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:59,231
Yeah, he came out
in January 2012 at 13,

864
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,133
which was about a
little over a year ago.

865
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,201
[Erin] How did he tell you?

866
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,337
Well we kind of discovered.

867
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,838
I was snooping
through his journal.

868
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,141
'Cause he left it out and I
was really worried about him.

869
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,642
He was becoming really,
really depressed

870
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,144
and I just had a
feeling to read it.

871
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,812
And he had put some
comments in there about

872
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:17,416
some boys that he
had found attractive.

873
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,352
And it completely threw me off.

874
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,455
I should have seen it coming,
knowing my son but I didn't.

875
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:29,161
So it was probably a
couple of weeks before ...

876
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,198
We would hint around and
we would say things like,

877
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,932
"If there was ever anything
that you wanted to tell us

878
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,702
"feel free to tell us and
we'll love you no matter what."

879
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,171
And he just didn't and he
didn't and finally my husband

880
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,439
just asked him and he just said,

881
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,175
"Jordan are you having
feelings of homosexuality?"

882
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,777
And at the time he was
kind of leaning against me

883
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,379
and I had my arm around him and

884
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,681
I could feel him start
to tremble and start to

885
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,719
shake, 'cause he was crying
and I could feel him nod

886
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,354
but I couldn't see his face

887
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,557
and my husband said he never
seen a kid look more terrified.

888
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,993
He's this little 13 year old
boy and I had had two weeks

889
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,330
to kind of prepare so there
wasn't the shock for me.

890
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,366
And I think that was
a big blessing for us

891
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,967
because I could just ...

892
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,336
At one point I put my
hands on his cheeks

893
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,070
and I made him look
at me and I said,

894
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,373
"This changes nothing for me.

895
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,575
"I love you 100 percent,
we will get through this.

896
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,210
"I'm so proud of you,
you're a great kid.

897
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,547
"We'll figure this out and
we're by your side 100 percent."

898
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,250
And we're LDS, we're Mormon.

899
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,220
I've come to find out lately
that that is not the normal

900
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:31,390
reaction for Mormon
families which

901
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,393
is so wrong and I can't
even believe that that's not

902
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,594
the normal reaction
because what else do you do

903
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,396
as a parent?

904
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,431
That's the most important
thing is you protect and you

905
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,534
support and help your
child when things are hard.

906
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,036
And I've loved him for 13
years and I didn't know

907
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,172
how to turn it off
and I didn't want to.

908
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,207
[Erin] Do you think your
feelings changed by a little bit

909
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,208
about it?

910
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,343
Oh, absolutely.

911
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,778
[Erin] Once you found
out your son was gay?

912
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,746
Absolutely, more tolerance.

913
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,049
Less of the

914
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,653
intolerance, the snickers,

915
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:07,759
more of, "Ok, I need
to open up a bit."

916
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,262
One of my friends
just came out.

917
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,836
He's really awesome.

918
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,609
He keeps getting
bullied (unclear).

919
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,347
I try to keep him from

920
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,351
getting bullied but
it doesn't happen.

921
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,522
[Erin] Have you had
people ever bully you or

922
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,324
Yeah.

923
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,024
[Erin] What do you
think bullying means?

924
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,296
I think it's not Ok

925
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,498
because

926
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:51,437
it's really hard
to explain because

927
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,408
I don't really think that
other people should bully other

928
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:00,312
people because that
would just not make sense

929
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:05,351
because we're all the same
in some way and so that would

930
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,286
be just like making fun
of yourself in a way

931
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,325
but not really and I think
it's just poopoo to do it.

932
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,960
It's not Ok.

933
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,428
[Erin] Poo poo?

934
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,529
Yes, it's poopoo.

935
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:18,697
(makes poop sound)

936
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,168
[Erin] How have people
bullied you in school?

937
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,338
I've been bullied
for my favorite color,

938
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,341
which is pink and

939
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,347
I've had two people
ask if I'm a girl.

940
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,151
I've had people call me gay.

941
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,389
A lot of bad stuff.

942
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,357
Starting kindergarten

943
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:50,996
just teased wearing clothes
we bought in the boys section,

944
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,902
blue and pink rugby shirt
and some kids are saying

945
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,204
boys don't wear pink and we
tried to talk to him about

946
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,339
what he could say, "Well
yeah, boys wear pink,

947
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,575
"'cause I'm a boy and
I'm wearing pink."

948
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:06,612
But it's hard right, and he's
got different preferences.

949
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:08,780
He started a Hollywood Club.

950
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,884
and he has a fake
eyelash collection.

951
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,686
He doesn't wear them in
school but he talks about it

952
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,756
or Audrey Hepburn but most
kids there embrace him

953
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:20,859
for who he is, it's just
been a few sour apples

954
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,530
who've chosen to pick on him.

955
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,898
He even got a concussion
at the hand of a boy

956
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,600
in first grade,

957
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,335
who intentionally hit him
in the head with a rock

958
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,205
and we're not sure what caused
it but it's the same boy

959
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,542
who this year is teasing him
and asking his if he's gay

960
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,245
or calling him, girly boy and
asking him if he's a girl.

961
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:45,917
* I see an atrophy what
I thought we deserved

962
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:52,390
* I'm feeling victimized
by the lies that were yours

963
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,727
* Take back the sudsies
you brought to me

964
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,864
* And take back your words

965
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,399
One of my best friends,
her name is Shaniya,

966
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,570
she had had suicidal
thoughts before.

967
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,005
And I stopped her
from doing that

968
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,477
'cause I told her that there
are other people that think that

969
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,811
and you're not the only one.

970
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,981
[Mikey] It started
in fourth grade.

971
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,416
There was a new kid in class and

972
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,887
we used to hang out
and then in sixth grade

973
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,155
it kind of changed 'cause
more people got there

974
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,726
and I started dressing like

975
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,628
I wanted to dress.

976
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,930
I wear skinny jeans, high tops.

977
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:36,067
People call me gay, I'm a fag
and it kind of messes with me

978
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,769
but I'm like, "You know what?

979
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,538
"Ok, It ends here!"

980
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,343
Maybe I am gay and I
probably won't know it

981
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,680
until I'm older, there's this
kid that wants to jump me

982
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,349
but one day, I told
him to please stop,

983
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,351
it's really getting on my nerves

984
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,321
and I please would
appreciate it, he said no.

985
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,958
So I kind of went on a
full rage and I said,

986
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,394
"Ok, if you're not gonna stop

987
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:08,366
"I will freak out on
the teachers, on you and

988
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,336
"the teacher will do something
about it 'cause I will

989
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,704
"make sure it will happen."

990
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,574
And he pushed me
down on the floor,

991
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,577
people were huddling me saying,

992
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,146
"You're a fag, you're a loser."

993
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,381
When it gets serious
and I have to report it

994
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,017
and they don't do
anything, I feel like

995
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,554
no ones helping me anymore.

996
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,189
People are just
ignoring you because

997
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,725
they're brushing you
off, like you're nothing.

998
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,361
I have suicidal
thoughts some times.

999
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,395
I don't want to but

1000
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:41,499
I feel like it's the
only option for me.

1001
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,715
High school was kind of like
an ignorant phase for me.

1002
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,651
I would call people
faggot, I would people gay

1003
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,486
and stuff like that.

1004
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,421
Some times it was just like
jokingly, other times it was

1005
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:04,723
being serious.

1006
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:05,691
[Erin] How would you say it?

1007
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,726
In like what context?

1008
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,595
Well,

1009
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,936
I knew this one kid, he
was a wrestler and he was

1010
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,438
homosexual and I was like,

1011
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,707
"I don't wanna wrestle you
because you're a faggot

1012
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,709
"and you're gonna
feel me up and stuff."

1013
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,111
It was like that and

1014
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,214
I don't like talking
about it 'cause

1015
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:32,050
it just really makes me
think of all the bad things

1016
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,318
I said to people in my past

1017
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,754
for being a little
bit different.

1018
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,355
[Erin] We are basically
on a one lane road

1019
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,457
and we're up so high this
is like the most scariest

1020
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,692
road I've ever seen.

1021
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,260
You have to keep
pulling over for

1022
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:43,762
each person that's coming by.

1023
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,798
it's really scary.

1024
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:48,900
So now these people have to
back up just to let us pass.

1025
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,068
[Sonya] Everybody's
just going slow

1026
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,402
so you can get by.

1027
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,739
[Erin] Thank you.

1028
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,641
[Man] You're welcome.

1029
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,781
[Sonya] All right, this
looks like a better road.

1030
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,368
[Erin] How do you
define marriage?

1031
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,705
What does marriage mean to you?

1032
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,240
That's not a good
question for me.

1033
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,843
I've been married four times.

1034
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,845
One time you're allowed.

1035
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,547
Two, you're kind of
dumb, three God help you.

1036
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,649
Please don't let me do it again.

1037
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,858
[Erin] Do you guys feel
like it should just be

1038
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,259
between a man and a woman?

1039
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,694
Or it should be for
anyone to get married?

1040
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:24,362
Or what do you guys
think about marriage?

1041
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,032
We have different
opinions about that.

1042
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,701
I don't see a problem with it,

1043
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,670
it's just the same.

1044
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,206
[Erin] What's your opinion?

1045
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,144
I don't think that it should
be a marriage considered

1046
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,912
because it's based on the
bible and the bible says,

1047
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:42,513
man and woman.

1048
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,916
So i feel like you're pushing
the preacher to do something

1049
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,753
that's going against
his religion, basically.

1050
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:49,320
Everybody's argument is,

1051
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:52,090
"Well marriage is a religious
thing" and blah, blah, blah.

1052
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,024
And if it's not through religion

1053
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,425
then it shouldn't be allowed.

1054
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,261
Well, we should not have
allowed to be married then

1055
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:59,397
because there was no
religion whatsoever, at all

1056
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,398
in any of our ceremony.

1057
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,933
This is a cultural issue.

1058
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:06,504
And it's deeply
ingrained in us the idea

1059
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,539
of how marriage should be.

1060
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:10,575
The marriage should be
man and woman I think.

1061
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:14,846
It's meant to have children
and you can always adopt

1062
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,382
(mumbles) but you don't
populate or anything like that.

1063
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,485
Gay people can't do that
obviously in terms of

1064
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,353
having a baby.

1065
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,924
Gay mentality is only one
sided, for that kid especially.

1066
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,327
Artificially inseminated or not.

1067
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:35,133
But then, it's done,
it's genetic now.

1068
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,906
It's the thought process is
already there, it's inbred.

1069
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,274
The unfortunate reality of
it is that you kind of need

1070
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:47,578
that federal regulation but
hopefully that one day that

1071
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,915
people just look beyond
sexuality and gender

1072
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:52,283
as part of marriage
and just see it as

1073
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,452
two people who are in love.

1074
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,854
[Erin] So you
just got married?

1075
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,655
About two weeks ago.

1076
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,791
[Erin] Here, let me see
your rings, you guys both

1077
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:00,826
have 'em on?

1078
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:01,960
No?

1079
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:02,861
Don't ask.

1080
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:04,762
[Erin] You don't wear yours?

1081
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,464
Yeah, but don't ask.

1082
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:10,235
I lost mine (mumbles).

1083
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,469
The ocean sucked
it off his hand.

1084
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,004
Apparently, it's
pretty common here.

1085
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:16,141
We got married legally
married in Washington D.C.

1086
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,677
April 10th, 2012?

1087
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,481
2010 sounds good,
I think it was 2011.

1088
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,853
Whenever they made
it legal we flew

1089
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:29,487
We ran over there quickly.

1090
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,022
And planned a quickie wedding.

1091
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:32,924
It was like a shotgun
wedding, like I was pregnant.

1092
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,560
I totally am into having the

1093
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:38,463
government recognition and
then the legal aspect as well

1094
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,298
but for myself personally

1095
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,901
from here on in, it's
not my top choice to

1096
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:44,936
do the paperwork.

1097
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,305
When we received our
recorded marriage license

1098
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,474
back from the county.

1099
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,177
It came back in a manilla
envelope that wasn't damaged

1100
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,312
but when we opened it
up, our marriage license

1101
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,047
had been pretty much mutilated.

1102
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,283
Ripped, holes punched
in it, torn up.

1103
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,118
which clearly sent a message.

1104
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,221
Whoever processed it,
the LA County saw it,

1105
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,690
obviously wasn't happy
about our marriage.

1106
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:07,859
[Erin] I was surprised to
hear that you guys are married

1107
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,030
I'm gay and she's straight.

1108
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,199
We married because we
needed medical insurance

1109
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,068
and you can't get that
when you're not married.

1110
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,504
Even though they do
consider you common law.

1111
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,206
[Erin] How long have
you two been together?

1112
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,875
[Both] Since '89.

1113
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:26,277
Married in 95' so
almost married 20 years,

1114
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,379
married 18 years.

1115
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,847
[Erin] What's the key to
your marriage lasting as long?

1116
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,083
We're friends.

1117
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:33,251
[Erin] You guys ever seen
each other naked or no?

1118
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:34,285
Hell no!

1119
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,923
I mean she has only
because of her operation

1120
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,857
and that type of
thing in the hospital.

1121
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,227
I don't change in front of her

1122
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,194
and she don't change
in front of me.

1123
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:48,866
(stammers) sorry.

1124
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,037
I like looking at women
don't get me wrong,

1125
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,205
I admire, I'm an artist.

1126
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,007
And I have no problem
looking at another man.

1127
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,742
Sexually, I could care less.

1128
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,177
[Erin] Isn't that hard for you

1129
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,211
since you're attracted to men?

1130
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:03,448
No, it's not hard for me.

1131
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:04,916
"Scenery, aisle four!"

1132
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,084
(laughter)

1133
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:07,285
Man that is.

1134
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:09,887
[Erin] So it wasn't just
like only an arrangement?

1135
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,723
There is more to it but no
completely the relationship?

1136
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,425
No sexual, that's it.

1137
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,893
Everything else is the marriage.

1138
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,899
And unfortunately, you already
know that in most cases

1139
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:25,003
some marriages stop having sex
after the age of 50 anyway.

1140
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,372
[Erin] What if it got
legalized in all 50 states,

1141
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,839
would that change
your relationship?

1142
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,308
Our relationship?

1143
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:35,413
No because Gilbert has
had friends in the past,

1144
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,015
male relations in the past.

1145
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:39,951
And it didn't really matter.

1146
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,086
[Erin] The relationships
you've had with men

1147
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,087
just haven't been permanent,

1148
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,921
like long lasting as
this relationship?

1149
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,257
None of them were even
thinking about trying

1150
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,026
to be serious.

1151
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,265
And still in the respect, I
still wouldn't've done that

1152
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,167
only because that's not
really what I wanted.

1153
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,805
I wanted to try and fit in.

1154
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:04,442
I remember in high school
being attracted to guys

1155
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:08,013
and there was an article in
Time Magazine about that time

1156
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,282
talking about two guys in
California that were gonna

1157
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:14,285
get married and so there
way this whole sort of thing

1158
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,189
about that and I remember
hiding in a closet

1159
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,425
reading through
this magazine going,

1160
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,060
"Really, that's possible?"

1161
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:28,266
It's kind of like one of
those things I grew up knowing

1162
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,636
that it wasn't something
that I would be able to do

1163
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:38,209
and it makes you feel not
very valuable as a person

1164
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:45,216
And I've just sort of
blocked that whole thought

1165
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,151
from my mind.

1166
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,418
If you want to get married,

1167
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,122
I shouldn't have to fight
that battle for you,

1168
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:53,191
that's your battle,
that's not my battle.

1169
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,860
Nowadays, things are changing.

1170
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,201
I can't hold any differences
between one or the other.

1171
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,237
If a man wants to marry a man or

1172
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:08,073
a woman wants to marry a woman,

1173
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,178
I think it's all cool, that's
what America is all about.

1174
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,480
Our journey is not
complete until our gay

1175
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,349
brothers and sisters are
treated like anyone else

1176
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:23,020
under the law for if we
are truly created equal

1177
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:25,156
then surely the love we
commit to one another

1178
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,258
must be equal as well.

1179
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,603
* Take a walk in the valley

1180
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:43,574
* Take a break from all
your cares and concerns *

1181
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,443
When I wanted to
ask Erin to marry me

1182
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,446
I wanted to bring her
here to Boldt Castle.

1183
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,880
on Heart island.

1184
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:51,182
I thought it would be a
really romantic place,

1185
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:52,417
she beat me to it.

1186
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,352
She proposed a couple of
days before I was going to

1187
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,187
but we had plans to

1188
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,256
come to Boldt Castle anyways.

1189
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,625
This is where I was
gonna propose to you.

1190
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:03,394
Right here, my favorite
spot in this castle.

1191
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,930
It's just so beautiful, I
have so many fond memories

1192
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,266
I wanted to bring you here
and share them with you.

1193
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:12,403
We met with this coordinator
right here on the island

1194
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,274
and he was completely
discouraging and disdainful

1195
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:17,442
of us getting married.

1196
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:20,411
We went in the office and
asked about weddings in general

1197
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:22,347
and he was like, "Oh, who's
getting married here?"

1198
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,149
and I said, "We are.

1199
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:25,350
And he was like, "Wow,
that's what I thought."

1200
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,285
And we don't approve of that.

1201
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:28,686
"This is a family place."

1202
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:31,422
And pretty much right
off the bat it was a bad

1203
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:33,624
first impression
for Erin because

1204
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,327
I had said such good
things about this place

1205
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:38,163
and spoke so highly
of it and then

1206
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:41,466
pretty much instantly before
we even step foot in the castle

1207
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,335
we have this guy being a
complete douche bag to us.

1208
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,803
[Erin] Once we were denied
the right to get married

1209
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,807
at the Boldt Castle, I did
a search online and decided

1210
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:52,610
it just makes more sense
to look into states

1211
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,345
that had already
legalized gay marriage

1212
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,647
and Vermont popped up first.

1213
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,017
I stumbled upon a place
called the Reluctant Panther.

1214
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:03,454
We went there and
visited and Sonya and I

1215
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,190
fell in love with it instantly.

1216
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,294
* I'll be still as (unclear)

1217
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,163
* Take my hand

1218
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:15,866
* I can be your
lantern in the dark

1219
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:19,304
* Lean on me for assurance

1220
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:22,373
* Don't let it go
this ship will row

1221
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,975
* But it won't fall apart

1222
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:28,145
* I got you

1223
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:32,217
* It's all about you

1224
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,225
* Something old something new

1225
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,460
* Something borrowed
something blue

1226
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,094
* Until I'm through

1227
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,834
* Something old something new

1228
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:52,337
* Something borrowed
something blue

1229
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,205
* Until I'm through

1230
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,342
Erin, I'm so proud

1231
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,009
of all that you've
accomplished in life

1232
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:02,847
and all your fagbug
accomplishments in life

1233
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:05,416
and adventures, the
start of your life

1234
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,951
with a wonderful woman.

1235
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:10,187
It's kind of weird but
you're a super sister

1236
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,356
and an awesome aunt.

1237
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14,425
My kids really do adore you
and I love you very much.

1238
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:15,726
[Erin] What was your
favorite part of the

1239
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,328
weekend for the wedding?

1240
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:21,432
I think it was
spending time with family

1241
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,301
and the wedding happening.

1242
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:26,337
And I really liked
going around Vermont

1243
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,539
and seeing all the
stops and things.

1244
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,040
[Erin] What do you guys think

1245
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:31,041
of Sonya and I being married?

1246
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,411
Weird.
Weird.

1247
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,545
Why is it weird?

1248
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:38,583
Because you guys
are both girls.

1249
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,385
Yeah.

1250
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,586
[Erin] And why do
you think that's weird?

1251
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,953
Because it is.

1252
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,255
[Erin] Who told you
that it was weird?

1253
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:46,391
Nobody.
We did.

1254
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,359
[Erin] Nobody?

1255
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,395
Do you think that two
girls can be married?

1256
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,129
No.

1257
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,398
Can two boys be married?

1258
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,432
[Erin] Yeah, what do you
think of two boys being married?

1259
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,233
No, no!

1260
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,404
[Erin] No, why not?

1261
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:00,338
Because.

1262
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:02,273
[Erin] You don't know why?

1263
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:04,642
Where did you learn that?

1264
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:09,246
No, no, I just know it.

1265
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,980
[Erin] You just know it?

1266
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,215
And how old are you?

1267
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,417
Five!

1268
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,851
[Erin] You're five and
you just know it, huh?

1269
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,320
Yes.

1270
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,154
[Erin] What would you say
to us about our husbands?

1271
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,989
I asked where the
husbands are and you guys

1272
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:20,257
told me you guys are married

1273
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,326
so that's actually
really cool too.

1274
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,429
Sonya and I were
thinking of getting

1275
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,197
wedding band tattoos
while we were here.

1276
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:28,165
Where?

1277
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,967
Tattoo your face.

1278
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,369
[Erin] The guy's
name is Desmond

1279
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:34,104
No way.

1280
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:35,406
Why, make a statement
man, that's the only way.

1281
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,342
You don't see any tattoos on
my body or anything like that

1282
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,143
yet it's all clean.

1283
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,511
[Erin] you don't usually
wear your wedding ring?

1284
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:42,012
Yeah, I hardly wear it.

1285
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,015
Well I took it off today because
I had to go through TSA but

1286
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:46,851
even when I'm at
work I don't wear it

1287
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:50,020
because it just
gets in the way so

1288
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:51,956
I'm actually thinking
about the same thing.

1289
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,458
[Erin] So I see you
have a lot of tattoos,

1290
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:54,625
did you get those
done in Hawaii?

1291
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,627
Yeah, all mine
are done in Hawaii.

1292
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,563
[Erin] Are tattoos
pretty popular there?

1293
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,132
Some what, I mean yeah but

1294
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,001
most of them just
have meanings to them.

1295
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:13,344
* It's only pain for love
It's only pain for love

1296
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,147
* Only pain for love dear
Only pain for love dear

1297
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,717
* It's only pain for love
It's only pain for love

1298
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:24,021
* Only pain for love dear
Only pain for love dear

1299
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:38,202
I've got the key,
got it in my pocket

1300
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,504
and everything, all
the paperwork's set.

1301
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,138
Everything is good so

1302
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,374
we travel on with the
journey and take the car

1303
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:44,709
to the next location.

1304
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,110
Why don't you
leave the car here?

1305
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,380
I don't mind
driving that around.

1306
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:51,449
I'll get a blast.

1307
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,518
I don't ever want
to go back to work.

1308
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:56,421
I don't want to ever
have normal jobs.

1309
00:55:56,454 --> 00:56:00,224
I just want to move to
Maui and sell our art

1310
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:01,492
and make it here.

1311
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:02,727
[Erin] My wife's saying that
she wants to move here now.

1312
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,361
Oh right on!

1313
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:05,396
When'd you girls get married?

1314
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,097
[Erin] A year and a
half ago in Vermont.

1315
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:07,732
Congratulations.

1316
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:08,666
[Erin] Thank you.

1317
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,401
Maui absolutely needed this.

1318
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:13,203
We have a great gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgendered

1319
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,573
community over here and over
the past couple of years

1320
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,508
it's really started to coalesce.

1321
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:20,210
So to have you come
here, raising awareness

1322
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:22,680
for gay rights is so
important for Maui.

1323
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,415
* Don't give up the fight

1324
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:26,016
* Love is gone bite

1325
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,485
* Love is gonna reign

1326
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,687
* We've got to sacrifice here

1327
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,288
* Every single night

1328
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,923
* Looking for a dream

1329
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:34,725
* We'll build it every time

1330
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,427
* The heart is gonna beat

1331
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,155
[Erin] This trip I have
four events and I'm driving.

1332
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:08,693
Drive to Alaska back home out
of 20 days I'm on the road

1333
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,495
I only have four events
the rest is driving.

1334
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,396
So I brought Hoosick
with me on this trip.

1335
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,464
[Voiceover] He's
a cute little guy.

1336
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:15,566
And you know if he goes
missing, I didn't take him.

1337
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,334
[Erin] So I'm
right outside where

1338
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:19,504
my car's getting
shipped, I'm at the port.

1339
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,472
It seems like the company
that handled my shipping

1340
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:23,508
didn't put it on the right
boat because they said that

1341
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:27,144
the cars coming in from Hawaii,
they come in once a week.

1342
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:28,679
So obviously my
car didn't get on

1343
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:30,781
the right shipment
leaving Hawaii.

1344
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:33,584
USDA doesn't come and
they're located about a half

1345
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:34,985
hour away, they don't come.

1346
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,723
They only come on Tuesdays
so asking them to come

1347
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,391
when they usually come
and check all the cars.

1348
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,728
So like tons of cars
they check in one day

1349
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,496
that they're not gonna
want to come here,

1350
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,764
half hour away just
to check one car.

1351
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,568
They take a glove they
go underneath your wheel

1352
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,472
where your tire is and if
there's any dirt on the glove

1353
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,542
your car gets held for
another day or two,

1354
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:00,410
which will be going into
Wednesday, Thursday.

1355
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,180
So if I don't get my car
until Thursday and I have an

1356
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,115
event Saturday
night in Anchorage,

1357
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,517
which is 45 hours away,

1358
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:08,285
I'm definitely not
gonna make it in time.

1359
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,920
I just got a text
message from my mom

1360
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:15,392
asking if I made it to Oregon
Ok, if I was still in Oregon

1361
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,530
and she asked when I'm
beginning to drive to Alaska

1362
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,266
and just add or did
you change your mind?

1363
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,902
Yeah, I feel like I just
came too far to just go home

1364
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,171
without doing it,
you know what I mean?

1365
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:28,673
Just waiting here for
a week for a few days,

1366
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:29,874
I wouldn't wanna
just, I don't know.

1367
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,542
I have to figure something out.

1368
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:43,087
So in response to a
Facebook update that I posted.

1369
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:49,259
I posted there was no delay
on the boat coming over here

1370
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,228
the car just didn't get
on the ship in time,

1371
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,597
it got on a week late.

1372
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,898
So in response to that,

1373
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:59,303
this person named
Ray wrote and said,

1374
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,706
"Have you considered
that maybe this mess

1375
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,841
"is the universe's way
of letting you know

1376
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,243
"that it's perhaps not an
altogether bright idea to take

1377
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,946
"a sometimes unreliable
vehicle on a 45 hour

1378
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,115

1379
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,684
"Having car trouble when
you'll be traveling isn't like

1380
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:15,519
"anything you've had
to deal with elsewhere

1381
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,954
"in the country.

1382
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,756
"I just don't have
a good feeling about
this leg of things.

1383
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,728
"Not on the tail end of all the
recent car troubles you've had."

1384
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:26,296
* I've opened my refrigerator
500 times ("Bored" by Astrogin)

1385
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,433
* I keep on hoping but
there's nothing inside

1386
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:31,101
* I'm checking my messages

1387
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:32,569
* Every five or 10 minutes

1388
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:35,539
* Searching my mind but
there's nothing in it

1389
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,941
* Well I'm bored

1390
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,910
* Out of my mind

1391
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:46,116
* I'll be crazy in good time

1392
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:49,720
Today is Saturday and I'm
just stuck waiting in Tacoma

1393
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,589
Washington, today is Sunday
and I'm still waiting

1394
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:55,793
waiting it out.

1395
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:59,596
Today is Monday, I'm still
waiting in Tacoma Washington

1396
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,266
I should be getting a
call in about 10 minutes

1397
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,268
from the port, just
with an update.

1398
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:17,782
* The road is clear now I
see all the way ("My Luck
Today" by Los Blancos)

1399
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,786
* And all the lights are green

1400
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,521
* And everybody's out my way

1401
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:40,304
* Oh I can't believe
my luck today

1402
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,642
* And Oh I can't
believe my luck today *

1403
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,819
I know it's something that

1404
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,054
she's got her mind set to do

1405
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,189
and I'm proud of her and

1406
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:03,560
it's kind of nerve
wrecking worrying about her

1407
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,930
but I hope everything
works out well,

1408
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,832
especially this trip to Alaska.

1409
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:10,400
I always just use
my GPS for traveling.

1410
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,869
I'm really horrible
at reading maps.

1411
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:15,906
I've been to Canada and used it.

1412
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,943
I assumed that Alaska
will be in the GPS.

1413
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:21,311
And I just went
to type in Alaska

1414
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,880
and three states came up for A,

1415
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,082
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas.

1416
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,285
So Alaska is not showing
up on my GPS which presents

1417
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,487
a little problem.

1418
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,722
Do you know how to
get there from here?

1419
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:34,358
Yeah, you get on the
freeway and go north.

1420
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:35,726
[Erin] Go north?
Yeah.

1421
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,426
[Erin] And what freeway?

1422
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,361
High Five.

1423
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:38,262
[Erin] How far away is that?

1424
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,265
50 kilometers, 30 miles.

1425
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,000
The intersection up top there,

1426
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,401
you should have turned right.

1427
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,936
And you probably
went straight down

1428
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,404
and came down on
this street here.

1429
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,873
[Erin] Any advice
for getting to Alaska?

1430
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,041
If you see a sign that
says, "Bump", you better

1431
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,510
slow down for it or it
might cost you some money.

1432
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,213
Have fun, what
else can you do?

1433
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,815
Don't pick up strangers.

1434
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,217
[Erin] Do a lot of people
come through here for gas?

1435
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,886
[Voiceover] Yes,
there is a lot.

1436
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,854
[Erin] A lot of truck drivers?

1437
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:06,356
[Voiceover] Not
Americans to Alaska.

1438
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,058
[Erin] Are there a lot
of gas stations on the way?

1439
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:11,528
Well, when you see one
you better stop and gas up.

1440
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,597
So far I have kept my gas tank

1441
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:18,202
three quarters of a tank
full at all times or higher.

1442
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,638
So every time I'm getting down
to three quarters of a tank,

1443
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,040
I'm filling up.

1444
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,910
* If you could see me now
("Ghost" by Envoi)

1445
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:30,781
* You would take back
all the things that

1446
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:32,917
* You never said to me

1447
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:37,754
* How I tried to
make you love me

1448
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:40,991
* But how can you

1449
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:42,559
* Love a ghost

1450
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,030
* Love a ghost of
what was meant to be

1451
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:49,433
* You'll never know

1452
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,972
* How much I loved you

1453
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,306
[Erin] So if one
of you had to go

1454
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,441
would you guys stay
with each other

1455
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:58,408
if it was like two months?

1456
01:02:58,442 --> 01:02:59,276
Yes!

1457
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,879
I can't sleep without him.

1458
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,814
His snoring puts me to sleep.

1459
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:07,551
And I don't think he sleeps
very well without me either.

1460
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,820
[Erin] That's really
sweet, how about you?

1461
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,322
If she had to go for
like work or something

1462
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:13,924
for like a month
or two would you

1463
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,325
[Kerry] leave me behind?

1464
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,226
Heck no!

1465
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,528
(laughs) He'd miss this!

1466
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:21,531
One of the great things
about her and one of the

1467
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:27,004
things about her that
sometimes is a set back is

1468
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:30,207
that she is very
trusting and very honest.

1469
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,543
So meeting so many
different people,

1470
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,013
so many different places she

1471
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,717
tends to put herself in a
very vulnerable situation

1472
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:42,486
[Erin] Would you ever
drive a car like this?

1473
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,488
It's better than walking.

1474
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:47,491
(laughs) Beggars
can't be choosers.

1475
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,227
Over the past three
and a half years,

1476
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,230
I've seen her be a little bit
more keen with her judgment

1477
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:56,466
and have a little bit better
discernment about people

1478
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,068
that she interacts with.

1479
01:03:58,102 --> 01:03:59,403
So I have something
to tell you.

1480
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,240
You're not gonna be
happy about it but

1481
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,910
I don't know, I just
have to tell you.

1482
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:11,181
So I was driving along
after I talked to you and

1483
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,918
there was this guy
like basically our age

1484
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,520
that was hitchhiking and I
ended up giving him a ride.

1485
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,657
Well, he's fine, he's in
the car with me right now

1486
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,060
so I just wanted to tell
you but he's actually fine.

1487
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:25,862
[Nathan] Hello!

1488
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:33,070
No, I know you would be upset

1489
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,838
but I just wanted to let
you know but it's fine

1490
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,373
he's just like going
a certain distance

1491
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,175
and I'm dropping
him off on my way.

1492
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,244
He was hitchhiking
a lot of hours.

1493
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:45,615
[Nathan] You're in trouble.

1494
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,284
[Erin] So you have
some maps right?

1495
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:48,452
I sure do.

1496
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:49,920
[Erin] Can you show
me on your map again

1497
01:04:49,954 --> 01:04:51,455
where I'm going?

1498
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:52,222
[Nathan] You're going
to be going up the Alaska

1499
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:53,257
Highway here

1500
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,459
and you're going to
be going past 101

1501
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,063
through Pink Mountain
and all the way up there

1502
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,031
and this is Alaska.

1503
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,232
[Erin] I'm on the
right track so far?

1504
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:04,101
Sure, that I know of.

1505
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:08,205
Your dog seems to be very
affectionate to me, yeah.

1506
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,373
[Erin] Do you like him?

1507
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,408
It's quiet and cute.

1508
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:13,277
That's just a little guy.

1509
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:15,845
You want me to go
out and on the road?

1510
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,714
[Erin] No, that's Ok.

1511
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,383
[Nathan] We can
document what not to do.

1512
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,286
I got a knife and if I got
to fight a bear, I got to.

1513
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:25,489
You do what you got
to do, there's no
point in being afraid.

1514
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,126
We're looking at a bunch of
sheep in the middle of a ditch,

1515
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,195
that's very random.

1516
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,763
[Erin] Have you ever
seen this on any of your?

1517
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:36,433
Nope, I have not seen
the sheep in the ditch yet

1518
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,502
on my nine travels
back and forth.

1519
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:40,637
[Erin] Well hopefully
they'll be Ok out here.

1520
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,040
[Nathan] Yeah, with that bear

1521
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:44,841
(laughter)

1522
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,643
that we just saw.

1523
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,246
He might be having the
lamb chops I think.

1524
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,148
(laughs)

1525
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:54,851
* I'm in a senseless
struggle for security

1526
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:58,088
* Ignorance is a song
I don't wanna sing

1527
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:03,060
* I wonder how they ever let
this pass the eyes of everybody

1528
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,997
* I'm taking back (unclear)

1529
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:10,000
* I'm calling you out
just remember that

1530
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:11,968
* To get to them you have to

1531
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:15,639
* Get through me

1532
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,178
* Feeling's the same

1533
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,381
* Making you lame

1534
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:27,551
* Hope we can be their voice

1535
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,219
Thanks for picking me up.

1536
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:31,221
You're welcome, keep
in touch on Facebook Ok?

1537
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:32,189
I will.

1538
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,358
Send me a friend
request, I'll accept it.

1539
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,559
Thanks for the map.

1540
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,260
No problem.
[Erin] Very helpful.

1541
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:37,827
All right, good luck.

1542
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:38,695
Have a safe trip.

1543
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,030
Ok, you too.

1544
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:40,797
[Erin] You're Ok giving
him a ride from here?

1545
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,332
Sure thing.

1546
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,367
[Erin] Do you guys trust
giving people a rides here?

1547
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,568
Do you think it's
pretty friendly?

1548
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:46,670
I think he's
fine, looks alright.

1549
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,338
I think we're pretty good.

1550
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,174
We've got two guys so I
think we're all right.

1551
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,208
[Erin] Nothing to worry about?

1552
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:52,242
We're pretty safe out up here.

1553
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:54,244
Plus we've got guns
in the truck so.

1554
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:55,179
(laughter)

1555
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,214
Sorry (laughs).

1556
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:58,048
[Erin] Guns in the truck?

1557
01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:58,815
Yep.

1558
01:06:58,848 --> 01:06:59,216
[Erin] Really?

1559
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,150
Oh yeah.

1560
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:01,351
[Voiceover] In bear country.

1561
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:03,087
We're in bear
country, big bears too.

1562
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,654
The guy that just went in
there seen a 600 pound bear

1563
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,056
there yesterday.

1564
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,191
[Erin] How do you
feel about the bear?

1565
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,860
I would just go in my
dad's room and grab the gun.

1566
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:14,164
And I'll just sit on the
couch with the gun in my hand.

1567
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,333
[Erin] So you're just hanging
out at this pub over here?

1568
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,068
[Cole] Yeah, at
this strip club yeah.

1569
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:19,103
[Erin] All right, having a

1570
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,204
couple of drinks
with your friends?

1571
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:21,405
One or two.

1572
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:23,940
[Erin] Ok, and then I
was about to get in my car

1573
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,142
and what did you say?

1574
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,478
I said, "Hey what's up,
that's you in the fagbug?"

1575
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,680
[Erin] And you said
you wanted to be friends?

1576
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,249
Yeah.

1577
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,117
[Erin] What made you want
to come over and talk to me?

1578
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,784
'Cause you're fucking hot

1579
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,120
and I wanted you to come
and have a drink with me.

1580
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:37,454
Why the fuck not?

1581
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:38,388
[Erin] Do you
have a girlfriend?

1582
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,423
Yeah.

1583
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:40,657
[Erin] Why you talking
to me like that then?

1584
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,227
I don't know, it's
wrong, whatever.

1585
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,129
It doesn't matter.

1586
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:47,097
Do I care, you're a lesbian
anyways, don't worry about it.

1587
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:49,233
[Erin] Hey I know
you're nearly sleep so

1588
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,834
I'm just going to be
going to get a hotel now.

1589
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,251
* Whoa whoa

1590
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,819
* Whoa whoa

1591
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:11,255
* (unclear)

1592
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:14,691
* Whoa whoa

1593
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:26,603
I always appreciate it when

1594
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,373
people go out to

1595
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:36,413
go out of their element
to educate others.

1596
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,981
[Erin] The roads
are Ok this way?

1597
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:41,151
You'll run into a
bunch of frosties.

1598
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:43,420
[Erin] What is it?

1599
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,521
[Darcy] Frosties.

1600
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:45,822
[Erin] What's that?

1601
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,192
[Darcy] A bunch of
bumps in the road.

1602
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,627
* Why you always
kicking up the sand

1603
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,196
* Always kicking up the sand

1604
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:56,200
* Man you're angry and
it makes my eyes hurt

1605
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,302
* Why you always
kicking up the sand

1606
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,337
* Kicking up the sand

1607
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,205
* You block your (unclear)

1608
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:04,241
* So the sunbeams miss it

1609
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,222
Right here in
black spray paint

1610
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:19,689
right on the edge
of the overlook

1611
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,392
somebody wrote,
"Fuck you faggot".

1612
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:25,562
Is that not what I was
expecting to see when I pull

1613
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,364
over here for a second.

1614
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,566
We saw another one with
a big penis on a rock wall

1615
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,201
and we were kinda trying
to figure that out as well.

1616
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,559
I've never in my entire
life seen a body of water

1617
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:58,428
this bright green and blue.

1618
01:09:58,462 --> 01:09:59,396
Beautiful!

1619
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,751
We have seen a lot of bears

1620
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:57,454
and we have seen also

1621
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:02,459
grizzly near Jasper.

1622
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:08,031
It was six meters far away.

1623
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,801
But I don't go out the car.

1624
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:16,473
Only we have make
photos from the car.

1625
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,508
Even think about
going to the bathroom

1626
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:21,411
I never even thought of
that as a concern but

1627
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,512
like you have to really
go to the bathroom

1628
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:23,813
and there was nowhere to go.

1629
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,515
I had to go on the
side of the road twice.

1630
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,317
So I was on the main Alaskan
highway and I pulled off

1631
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,985
to go to the bathroom
somewhere outside.

1632
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,587
But once I pulled off
onto this dirt road,

1633
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,990
I saw there were actually two
unexpected outhouses here.

1634
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:36,993
And somebody that must have
seen my car on the highway

1635
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,463
followed me in here and
so I was just going to go

1636
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:42,332
into the outhouse but they
just drove back and forth

1637
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:45,101
a couple times and I didn't
know if they worked here

1638
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,371
or what they were doing
and finally they just took

1639
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:49,406
a picture so see,
even in the middle of

1640
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:54,110
the Yukon, I have no
privacy just because I'm

1641
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,111
driving my car.

1642
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,546
Time is going by very fast

1643
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,549
and miles are going
by very slowly.

1644
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,386
I still have no cell reception
so I'd like to figure out

1645
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:03,453
if I'll ever have it.

1646
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:06,122
If I can get to a place
that has reception

1647
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,191
so I can at least
send an update.

1648
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:10,226
I'm probably gonna figure
out where I'm staying

1649
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,361
so when I get to the city,

1650
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:13,329
somewhere that has
a place to stay,

1651
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,532
I don't want to be
driving too late at night

1652
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:16,533
or otherwise Hoosick
and I will just be stuck

1653
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:18,902
sleeping in the car.

1654
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:23,206
On this road basically
nobody leaves anybody stranded.

1655
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:25,509
So if you broke
down on this road

1656
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,577
you could flag down a car

1657
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:28,812
[Erin] Somebody would
stop and help you?

1658
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,547
Absolutely.

1659
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,015
[Erin] That car
way ahead of me,

1660
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,451
I pulled over for a second
and they was passing me.

1661
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:37,587
I waved to them to see
if they would stop but

1662
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:39,589
it was a woman driving,
she looked right at me

1663
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:41,324
and didn't stop.

1664
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,359
There's a tractor trailer
coming maybe I'll see if they

1665
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:44,761
can give me some help here.

1666
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:51,701
Ok so I tried flashing
the tractor trailer down

1667
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:53,803
and they didn't stop either.

1668
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:55,572
Flashed my lights and

1669
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,307
they didn't stop.

1670
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:01,411
I just saw another sign
for Contact Creek Lodge

1671
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:03,613
and I see it here on my left.

1672
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:06,450
Doesn't look like it's open.

1673
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:08,384
I'm gonna stop and see.

1674
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,320
This place has there
business hours are from

1675
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:13,557
seven AM to nine PM.

1676
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,493
It's only 9:15 so I just
missed it by 15 minutes.

1677
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,229
I'm sure Sonya is panicking and

1678
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,466
completely distressed right now.

1679
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,967
And I have no way
of calling her.

1680
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:27,971
Just leaving

1681
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,740
this hotel that is not open

1682
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,408
and there is a bear
walking across the street.

1683
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,622
Obviously that doesn't
make me feel good knowing

1684
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,524
bears are gonna be
coming up to my car.

1685
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:51,495
So I don't know what to do.

1686
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:54,764
I'm gonna drive to the next
place to see if there's a hotel.

1687
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:04,173
* I just want to pick you up

1688
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,211
* Pick you up and run you off

1689
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:13,517
* But there all

1690
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,787
* That

1691
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:21,157
* All that's (unclear)

1692
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,861
I just woke up it's right before
six o'clock in the morning

1693
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:26,563
so I got four hours of sleep.

1694
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:30,567
From what I heard I have
about an 18 hour drive today.

1695
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,504
I have a little less than
three quarters tank in my

1696
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,509
gas tank, so I'm gonna
fill up right here.

1697
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:42,546
So like a total idiot I
was getting gas and then

1698
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:44,347
talking to some
people next to me

1699
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,015
and I drove off and

1700
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,483
completely forgot the ...

1701
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,686
I didn't put the gas thing back.

1702
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,387
I drove off with it
still attached to my car,

1703
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,889
The guy in the white
truck behind me

1704
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,658
told me, I asked
him what should I do

1705
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:57,527
since I just did that
and he said go to the

1706
01:14:57,561 --> 01:15:00,296
Three Bears grocery store up
the street and let them know.

1707
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,498
I think you're really
encouraging people to use

1708
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,401
a really bad word by using
that on your car and you're

1709
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:10,373
progay, lesbian, whatever
you got to get that off there.

1710
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:11,575
Well if they start
calling you a fag

1711
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,477
you'd know you want to
know what that means.

1712
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,345
There's no other definition
for fag that I know of

1713
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,547
then being

1714
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,551
I guess gay or

1715
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:23,987
not being normal.

1716
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,523
If you know that my
weakness is being gay

1717
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:30,727
then, which I'm not, but
I'm just saying if you did

1718
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,196
then you know that's my
weakness and you keep

1719
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,397
messing with me I'm
finna find out what your

1720
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:36,532
weakness is and I'm
finna fuck with you!

1721
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,534
One thing I'm
really happy about is

1722
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,638
the fact that my car hasn't
had any mechanical problems.

1723
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:43,272
I'm very thankful that

1724
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,942
the good 'ole fagbug is

1725
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:50,479
pushing through and so far,
holding up like a champ.

1726
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,281
If you break down,

1727
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,118
I don't know how they'd do it,

1728
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,953
obviously you'll have
it fixed somehow.

1729
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,622
But it's a very
difficult situation.

1730
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:02,592
I guess if I'm gonna break
down, I'll have a pretty view.

1731
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,193
My wheels really
tight right now.

1732
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,394
It needs to be filled up.

1733
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:07,964
It must be out of fluid.

1734
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,634
I got out and checked
the power steering

1735
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,336
for my car, just to see
what's going on with it and

1736
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,273
I just filled it up less
than 20 minutes ago.

1737
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,043
and I just checked it,
it was completely empty.

1738
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,711
I filled it all the
way up to the top so

1739
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:25,915
(mumbles) it's been
leaking but it's obviously

1740
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:28,051
something more
severe has happened.

1741
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,721
The parts of the lines is
over $500 so it's something

1742
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,623
I've been putting off just
because they said you can

1743
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:36,559
keep filling it up and
for the last year or two,

1744
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,094
that's been working so

1745
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:42,265
what a time for something
further to develop with that.

1746
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:43,332
Trying to turn around,

1747
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,034
let's see how difficult
it is to turnaround with

1748
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,535
my wheel like this,

1749
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,172
my steering wheel,

1750
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:54,310
It's not going to be easy.

1751
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,657
We're gonna get there Hoosick,
we're gonna get there.

1752
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:17,500
* Tell me you don't know why

1753
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:22,672
* You can't fall asleep at night

1754
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:28,244
* Everything looks just fine

1755
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:33,516
* But you're in need of a life

1756
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:37,153
There's a dog on the side of
my car that won't let me go.

1757
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,322
Every time I try to go he's
running in front of my car.

1758
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:40,690
He's not letting me leave.

1759
01:17:40,724 --> 01:17:42,525
I gotta go and I feel
like I'm gonna hit him.

1760
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:44,761
I'm sorry dog, gotta go.

1761
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:47,463
You can't keep up with my car.

1762
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,498
You're a car, you're a dog.

1763
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,936
I gotta go, go away.

1764
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:58,674
* Far away from here and we run

1765
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:02,511
* Far away from here

1766
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:07,516
* And we ran far away from here

1767
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,289
* Say that you're out of line

1768
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:18,895
* Fall a bit short this time

1769
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:24,133
* Who knows if
you're wrong or right

1770
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:29,272
* But you're in need of a life

1771
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:35,745
* Oooh

1772
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:40,449
* Oooh

1773
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,487
* And we ran

1774
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:47,456
* Far away from here

1775
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,125
* And we ran

1776
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,962
* Far away from here

1777
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:54,931
* And we ran

1778
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:58,267
* Far away from here

1779
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:00,069
* And we ran

1780
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:08,477
* Ooooh

1781
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:12,481
* Ooooh

1782
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:14,650
Now traffic has stopped
in the middle of nowhere.

1783
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,953
There's a makeshift stop light

1784
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,456
and I'm guessing there's some
kind of construction ahead but

1785
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,258
I've been sitting here
for over five minutes now.

1786
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,060
We got another truck
coming so I hope these

1787
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,330
dumpsters load and we'll be
able to go in a few minutes.

1788
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,550
About 100 cars have
passed me on this trip.

1789
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:50,253
There's finally a car
ahead of me that's going

1790
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:55,024
way slower than I'm driving
so first car I'll be passing

1791
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:56,359
on this entire trip.

1792
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,327
Where are we now?

1793
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:00,129
[Voiceover] Almost into
the border of Alaska.

1794
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:01,330
[Erin] Where are
you guys coming from?

1795
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:02,698
[Voiceover] New Mexico.

1796
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,967
[Erin] Oh really and
you wanted to come over

1797
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,468
and take a picture
of my car, how come?

1798
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:07,470
[Both] 'Cause,
we're supportive.

1799
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:29,492
(mumbles) I made it to
the border for Alaska.

1800
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,028
Finally, we're here.

1801
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,500
Been something I've been
wanting to do for six years.

1802
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,302
The fact that you've
made it to the 50th state

1803
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,970
is pretty incredible.

1804
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:43,639
All 50 states and you went a
long way to get to this one.

1805
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,275
I mean, it is an epic
drive to make it.

1806
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:50,079
And you know it's well worth the

1807
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:52,415
credit that you
get for doing it.

1808
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:53,883
[Erin] So you think
for my 50th state it's,

1809
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:56,419
with my car, you think it's
a good thing that I did that

1810
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:57,921
as a finale kind of thing?

1811
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,522
Oh, I think you
earned your badge.

1812
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,891
Coming up to Alaska, yeah!

1813
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,274
[Erin] The car has taught
me a lot about myself

1814
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:19,943
and my own strengths,
my capabilities

1815
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,545
and people told
me my whole life,

1816
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:25,814
certain things in
my innate nature,

1817
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:29,618
that I was crazy or messed
up and I've lived a lot of

1818
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,988
my life questioning
myself, unsure of myself

1819
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,623
and not that confident.

1820
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:36,759
This project really
made me realize that

1821
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,861
all those things that
I've had all these years

1822
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,264
weren't weaknesses, they
were always strengths

1823
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:44,267
and it just makes everything
about me that so much crazier,

1824
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:48,204
off the kilter, out of
the box, it takes all that

1825
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:50,940
packs it up in a package and
makes it look really good.

1826
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:52,976
[Voiceover] The one,
the only fagbug right here

1827
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:54,910
from the streets of New York.

1828
01:21:56,012 --> 01:21:57,947
Come on give her some love!

1829
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,249
Took me 90 hours to
get here from Seattle

1830
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:03,286
driving nonstop over five
days on 15 hours of sleep.

1831
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:07,723
(whoots and applause)

1832
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,892
So I just got here at
five in the morning.

1833
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,227
I told her personally

1834
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,462
that I think she should
just keep on going

1835
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:16,332
because frankly, the
message it never stalls.

1836
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:24,140
What you're doing with
driving around with this

1837
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,642
word on your car is that
you're changing the social

1838
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:29,078
atmosphere and it'll
never be the same again.

1839
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:32,281
Well I mean after
seeing what you're doing

1840
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,184
and obviously meeting
you and getting to take

1841
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:37,020
pictures with your car,

1842
01:22:37,053 --> 01:22:40,089
I don't ever wanna say
fag or somebody's gay,

1843
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,290
I don't wanna say that again.

1844
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:44,293
I went out to my car to get
my bags after checking in.

1845
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,697
Saw there was a note on the
car once I started driving

1846
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:51,067
away I was heading
to the bank and

1847
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,668
pulled over and got
the note, it says,

1848
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:54,670
"Thank you so much
for what you just did.

1849
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:59,908
"You're probably wondering
what exactly it is you did.

1850
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,512
"Being extremely depressed,
I was about to go here

1851
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:07,050
"and cry my eyes, I
would hurt myself.

1852
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,219
"But instead I saw your
car and it made me smile.

1853
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,856
"That was a little ray of
sunshine on my cloudy day.

1854
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,158
"Thank you" with a heart.

1855
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:17,660
When somebody else
actually writes you a note

1856
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:20,196
and says, I was
gonna hurt myself and

1857
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:23,366
your car being here basically
helped me not do that,

1858
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:27,736
I think that's one of the
best ones that you can get.

1859
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,212
[Erin] Do you
think I should just

1860
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:37,246
keep driving this car forever?

1861
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,747
Would you want to like
give it up at some point?

1862
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:41,084
No, I think you
should, why not?

1863
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:44,053
It get's peoples attention,
it certainly got mine.

1864
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:46,189
Well, I think there's
gonna come a point where

1865
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,393
the project is done and
there's a point in which

1866
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:54,097
the work is done and
it's time to just say,

1867
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:57,300
"Ok, I've done
everything I can do and

1868
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,236
"now it's time to move
on to the next thing."

1869
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:02,538
And there's something about
leaving at the right time.

1870
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:06,409
So I hope, that you'll now
what that right time is

1871
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,112
and then all that stuff
can come off the car

1872
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:12,281
and you can start being Erin
the artist, the teacher.

1873
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,251
I think what really
happens with those of us who

1874
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:19,222
and I'm including you in
that, those of us who feel

1875
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:20,823
the activist call,

1876
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:25,394
sometimes there's no
rest for us because

1877
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:31,234
we sometimes feel if
we lay that burden down

1878
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:35,238
then no one else
maybe will take it up.

1879
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,743
At this point I feel like
there's all these weird things

1880
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,878
like people keep pressuring
me to make a decision

1881
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,413
and I would probably
say at this point,

1882
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:46,682
if I could just say something
like a line to my car

1883
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:49,652
and maybe I would just say,
I don't wanna let you go.

1884
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,656
It's really nice to plan
some things and things

1885
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,824
obviously don't go the
way you plan but then

1886
01:24:56,292 --> 01:25:01,297
to actually get to that
end point and look back

1887
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,599
at everything you had to
go through to get there and

1888
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,402
you feel accomplished for
getting through all those

1889
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,237
ups and downs and making it

1890
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:10,839
to that place you
wanted to get to.

1891

1919

We're in Maui right
now on vacation.

1945
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:00,563
We're taking a week away from

1946
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:02,831
everything nasty
that's going on in life

1947
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,634
and just being with
Chuck and the guys here

1948
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:07,536
at the Maui Sunseeker.

1949
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,637
I used to work with Chuck

1950
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:11,507
and then he came here fulltime

1951
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,476
and he's always
wanted us to come

1952
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:16,479
so Mikey and I took
time to be here

1953
01:30:16,512 --> 01:30:18,413
and we're just having
the most wonderful time.

1954
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:20,483
Chuck and the staff
are spoiling us rotten

1955
01:30:20,516 --> 01:30:22,518
and it's perfect.

1956
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,558
We've been fighting
for a marriage equality

1957
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:31,326
for a long time and

1958
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,729
it is getting better and
it's one of those places

1959
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:36,431
that I think more visibility
makes things better

1960
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:37,500
'cause people start
talking about it.

1961
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:38,967
When people don't talk about it,

1962
01:30:39,201 --> 01:30:41,269
it creates fear.

1963
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,971
* I'll pick you up on
my shoulder ("Into the
Woods" by Andrew Halliday)

1964
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:46,609
* And run you off into the woods

1965
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,614
* Into the woods

1966
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,052
* Into the woods
