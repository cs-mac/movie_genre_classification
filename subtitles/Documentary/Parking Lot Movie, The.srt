Because I'm not the same girl
you met three years ago.

I mean, I'm the same girl,

Right.
I understand.

How can you live in LA
and not have a car?

407
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:52,213
I had a car, then I sold it.
I needed the capital for my business.

408
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:55,122
That's right.
The plan. The ducks.

Is your beautiful wife gonna live in your
parents' basement with you?

413

- I don't live with my parents.
- Just visiting?

414
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:12,006
No, I was just pickin'
some stuff up 'cause I'm moving.

"Diaper-rush-dot-com"?

416
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,913
That's what it says.
We sell diapers on the Internet.

417
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,450
I thought the whole
Internet thing was done already.

418
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:24,284
- Just need a good business plan.
- Diapers?

419
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,349
So, how's Bon Jovi?
Does he still rock?

420
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,588
Who?

421
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:35,155
Oh, him. He switched bands
and moved to Seattle.

422
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:39,192
Nice. Hope he knows how to steam milk
and make those little chocolate shavings.

423
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:41,364
Big talk coming from a diaper salesman.

424
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,067
Oh, OK.

425
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,042
And the latest breakup?
What's he do?

426
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:49,410
- Is he a baseball player or a cosmonaut?
- Who said I had a breakup?

427
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:53,918
You did. In your kitchen
during your hypoglycemic rant.

428
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,745
So?
Spill it. Who's the guy?

429
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,586
I'm not telling you.

430
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:04,960
Did you dump him?
No. He dumped you.

431
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,624
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
- OK.

432
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:10,099
Fine.
Then I'm not talkin' at all.

433
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,432
- You're not talking?
- You ain't gettin' boo outta me.

434
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,904
Fine, I'm not talking either.

OK, fine.
I'll tell you.

Mmm. My brother's deaf, Em.

440
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,163
I can go days without talking.

441

Can we have the check, please?

442
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:05,571
- I met him in class.
- Yeah?

443
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:08,669
- You went back to school?
- Acting class.

444

- Ah, he's an actor.
<i>- (chuckles)</i>

445
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,251
Wow, actors. That's like
one rung up from musicians.

446
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,910
He was a writer.
Is a writer.

447
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,456
Hm.
Hi. Could I get a coffee?

448
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:21,355
- Mm-hm.
- Just very black.

449
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,984

- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

450
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,360
- Frappuccino, please.
- All right.

451
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,328
I believe the question
was who dumped whom?

452
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,430
He left me.

453
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:39,104
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

454
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,907
No. But I appreciate the reach.

455
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,540
The acting classes are really
paying off, but I got it.

456
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,844
Shut up, I got it.

457
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,688
So what are your plans?

458
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,518
- Plans for what?
- Tonight.

459
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,358
It is New Year's.

460
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:03,233
Yeah.
I'm not a really big New Year's guy.

Oh, jeez, spare me the pickup line.
Here.

618
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,632
No, it wasn't a pickup line.
I do know you.

619
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,177
Michelle's wedding.
Michelle Foster.

620
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:45,204
- I went to school with her husband.
- Oh. Yeah, wait. Ben something.

621
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,612
That's right.
Ben Miller. That's right.

No, just take it.
Seriously, I feel bad. Take it.

Dude.
Dude, this is what I want.

633

All black like Batman.

Yo, you should get one, too,
like Batman and Robin.

637
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,444
Except without the tights.

638
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,346
It's like...
Where you gonna park it?

639

This thing?
Wherever I want.

we wow 'em in New York, it's a lock.

Come on, hop in.

643

You know what? I'm gonna
stick around here and finish some stuff up.

644
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,966
Would you relax, please?

645
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:18,699
Dude, take a step back, man.
You're startin' to depress me.

646
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,608
Go take a weekend off.
Do somethin' for yourself, all right?

647
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,451
Beautiful.

648
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,050

- Come on, Hailey.

649

Wait. Hailey!

650
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:14,497
Hailey, hold on.
Sweetie.

651
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:20,302
Oh, my God, are you guys kidding?
Get a room.

Oh, I can't help it,
he's so hot.

653
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,538
Hi. Emily.

654
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,975
Oh, thank God you can't get pregnant
when you're pregnant.

655
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:30,036
Hi.

656
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:35,779
- So, you and Ben went on a little date?
- Yeah. We had lunch.

657
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,683
It was nice.

658
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,315
- That's all I'm gonna get outta you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

659
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:44,792
Well, then I should probably
get back to work.

660
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:46,556
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, sexy.

661
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,258
- See ya.
- Bye.

662

Lunch? What's the matter?
You don't like him?

663
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,834
Why do you say that? Just 'cause
we didn't jump right into the sack?

664
00:54:55,906 --> 00:54:59,034
What's jumpin' in the sack?

665
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:02,704
It's a game people play
at picnics, honey.

666
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,724
Hey.

667
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:35,910
I do weddings, head shots, baby showers -
you know, for the money.

668
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:38,504
But I met a girl at a party,
she owns a gallery,

669
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:41,550
and she said she might show
my work there, so...

670
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,677
That's really cool.
How'd you do that?

671
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:46,984
You leave the shutter open.
The hard part's staying still,

672
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:50,754
otherwise you're just a blur
like the cars in the background.

673
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:55,524
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face.

674
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,432
So make yourself at home.

675
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:06,402
Wait, he just landed on your doorstep?
Honey, that's perfect.

676
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,274
Don't get excited,
he lives 400 miles away.

- He's not the type.

I mean, she owned a business, right?

686
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,775
Like, selling antiques. And she used to
work for the mayor's office as an advisor.

687
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:46,782
- But she said she didn't like it. So...
- Wow, two careers already.

688
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:50,650
Yeah. So I thought that
she would understand,

689
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:54,680
you know, the kinda work that you gotta
put in when you're first startin' out.

But...

691
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:04,062
She said that she couldn't be

Sounds stupid when I say it out loud.

stupid, you don't deserve to be in love.

- Yeah.

873
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:05,737
I met someone.

874
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,315
You met someone?

875
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:12,047
Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're
getting married or anything, but...

876
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:14,486
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

877
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:17,916
This... this is someone different?
Not the writer guy?

878
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:20,929
Yeah, no, a different guy.
A new guy.

879

A different guy?

880
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,724
What?

881
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:31,733

01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:42,644
So...

884
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:57,363
Don't.

885
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,458

886
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,582

887
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:31,624

Pitch and go, keep up the pace.

888
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:33,464
It's not a big deal.
I'm sorry.

889
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:37,097
It actually is quite a big deal.
But don't go too fast.

890
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:39,141
Ollie, you get really jittery
when you go too fast.

891
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,870
And I need to make sure that you don't
speed through the whole thing

892
01:11:41,944 --> 01:11:44,344
in such a way that nobody understands
exactly what you're saying.

893
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:46,040
Because we invested a lot of time,
and everything that we're that we're do...

894
01:11:46,115 --> 01:11:48,606
Jeet-o, I need you to shut up.
All right?

895
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:52,916
- This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

<i>(mouths)</i> Client.

900
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,336
The client inputs the child's data

01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,271
and the baby actually tracks its growth.

902

Does the baby have a name?

906
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,886
Does the baby have a name?
Yes.

907
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,426
What were we saying
for the baby's name?

908
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:40,560
Freddy.

909
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,536
Freddy.

910
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,570
- Doesn't have to be Fred.
- Gabe...

911
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:49,770
was another choice that we came up with.

912
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:53,741
Gabe the babe.

913
01:12:54,684 --> 01:13:01,021
My point is, is that there are
10,000 babies born every hour.

914
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:05,287
That's 254,000 babies a day.

915
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:09,889
And somebody's gotta figure out
where to put all that shit.

916
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,834
I wanna be that guy.

917
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:21,600
10,000 babies an hour.
Wouldn't that be 240,000 babies a day?

918
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,677
Yes.

919
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,460
It was good, Ollie.
You were great.

920
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:42,691
I mean, there was that one little thing,
but I don't think it was a big deal.

921
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:43,732
How about you?
You think it was good?

922
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:46,427
