2
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,254
They say there is no power in
Boston.

3
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,449
A public service, I do not know.

4
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,255
I think it's far from what we were
looking for.

5
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,430
Maybe it was just a medical problem.

6
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,376
A machine.

7
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,288
Internet makes the world a very
simple.

8
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,363
But imagine it feels without it.

9
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,433
I need it.

10
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,440
I need the intelligence.

11
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,286
Identity for what they believe.

12
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,390
And what they love.

13
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,288
I'm not sure what this purpose.

14
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,452
This will be no electricity.

15
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,260
Yes, I know how it will work.

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,289
- Except.
- Yes.

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,325
- You were right.
- It will work.

18
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,429
No one can pass, you know it.

19
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,372
Or something.

20
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,409
You see?
It lights up.

21
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,277
Course, and to turn it off.

22
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,406
Yes, an experience that you want,
right?

23
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,412
Yes.
That's how I want it.

24
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,292
- Come on, do it.
- To do what?

25
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,273
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

26
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,366
I really thought I had made
progress.

27
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,399
In this case.

28
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,278
Hey, you think you could pass it?

29
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,388
Ah, I do not even know why you
bother with all of this evidence.

30
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,221
You know the evidence that the world
does not even care about.

31
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,284
Because it's fun.

32
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,521
You sure you ready for this?

33
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,259
- No, I do not know it.
- Really?

34
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,256
Nah, it's important.

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:04:00,397
I know, but you donors was noisy,
and made me sit for days to speak.

36
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,498
It was torturing me.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:07,343
Nah, they are so beautiful for the
next 5 years.

38
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,282
Noah, if so I'll have to be.

39
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,308
- Yes.
- But if it goes, please.

40
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,345
You have to promise me, I do not
need to do this again, promise.

41
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,449
- Okay. I promise. Course.
- Really?

42
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,482
I promise.

43
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,285
Aha, you're lying!

44
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:06,330
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

45
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,413
Andrian!
What time is it?

46
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,483
Has the sound checks together.

47
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,463
You are the first, to call a doctor
Evelyn, and you know who it is?

48
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,465
- Max!
- Evelyn. How are you?

49
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,229
You okay?

50
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,261
Nice to meet you here.

51
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,365
- The doctor will caster, do you
mind?
- Of course.

52
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,309
- This is it.
- Thank you.

53
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,371
Happy birthday.
Why did you get the cake?

54
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,315
Excuse me, are you ready to go?

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,375
Yes, please, I'll see you later.

56
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:08,367
Public stations, which creates
brain.
With intelligence science.

57
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:17,198
And was able to create emotion, and
self-awareness.

58
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:26,442
Has developed a strong intelligence
made rapid progress in the field.

59
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,387
As well as about the human brain.

60
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:34,450
But it is still difficult for some
to dream about the future.

61
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:40,524
I believe, that the journey will be
more important than the goal.

62
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:47,366
I purpose, was used to track cancer.

63
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,467
And the possibility of healing.

64
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,471
Briefly say thank you.

65
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:20,238
A new type has been in play, it is
important for humans to move to a
higher level.

66
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,342
Albert Einstein thought 50 years
ago.

67
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,468
And it could not be more similar
than today's topic.

68
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,250
Human intelligence, has allowed us
to conquer our most difficult
challenges.

69
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,346
Not only to cure disease, but to
conquer hunger.

70
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,414
To heal the planet.

71
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,360
And penetrate walls for us all.

72
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:47,492
I did not know there was anyone who
could be more violent than those who
spoke next.

73
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,467
All except political advice.

74
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:58,301
Science and invite my colleagues,
doctors will caster.

75
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,218
Happy to be here.

76
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,320
My wife encouraged me to change the
world.

77
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,519
But, I just Try to understand it first.

78
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:22,299
For 130 thousand years, all our
desires have not changed.

79
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:31,206
Incorporation ingenuity, from
science engineer, engineers,
nutritionists, and puberty.

80
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,345
This is the place.

81
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,416
Chaos, not harmony, even for the
most basic.

82
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:44,287
Once it is online, making a machine
to quickly search for it.

83
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:50,455
And what is interesting, its
strength will be greater, as well as
intelligence.

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,491
A limitation.
Who was born in the history of the
world.

85
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,506
So I never imagined.
I associate this.

86
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,486
With a full range of in it.

87
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,248
Some consider it, thinking tool.

88
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,423
I call it transcendence.

89
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:31,300
Shape of the building, such as the
intelligence it requires a key.

90
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,364
One of the most fundamental secrets
of the universe.

91
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,499
Is the nature of consciousness.

92
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,381
It is called soul.

93
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,488
It is the soul that is inside.

94
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,260
Professor?

95
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,334
Yes, sir?
If you have a question?

96
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,241
Finished.
You want to create a god?

97
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,312
You will be a god.

98
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,337
It's a very good question.

99
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:21,253
Is not that what you've always done
people?

100
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,457
Yes, of course.

101
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:31,488
- I'm, glad to see it, make it so.
- Yes, yes, right.

102
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,497
Nice to meet you.

103
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,364
- Of course.
- Hey, please sign here.

104
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,331
Professor?

105
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,207
To all science!

106
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,407
An hour ago there has been a 41
attack.

107
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,317
We now have confirmed, at least 5
people died.

108
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,377
12 people have been injured.

109
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:02,260
This news relates to chain attacks
that occurred today in the city of
new york, los angeles,

110
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,354
Chicago, and washington dc.

111
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:11,303
Everything is the central research
lab computers, which aims to make
computer intelligence.

112
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,297
Do not enjoy, I was very fortunate
to lightly wounded.

113
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,375
Yes, okay, take care.

114
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,344
They said it happens all over the
place.

115
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,347
Tom has died.

116
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,510
And he wants a little talk with us.

117
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,254
- Roger?
- He does nothing.

118
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,416
In fact he was talking to fbi.

119
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,388
311 give you a report.

120
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,368
Keep the western part there.

121
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,461
Welcome.

122
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,497
Joseph!

123
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,276
Hi how are you?

124
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,316
What are you, will?

125
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,285
You should see a bullet removed from
you.

126
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,321
How they can know all of this?

127
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:08,349
Based programerku, they came to me.

128
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,327
I guess it was time.

129
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,298
This kenalkanlah buchanan from fbi
agents.

130
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,356
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,300
How are you?

132
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,428
I was amazed at your research doctor
caster.

133
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:23,238
Buchanan is the regulatory agency's
scientific research.

134
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,310
Ah, what we can talk over it?

135
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,481
- Come to the office.
- Okay.

136
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,349
Penance revolution through
technological means.

137
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,286
A few years ago are all not
connected.

138
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,381
People sending messages to each
other rather than talking.

139
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,257
Become part of the social media
privacy.

140
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,388
They tried to make the latest mobile
phones.

141
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,263
Maybe this is a real threat.

142
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,462
This guy joel edmund come with for a
year.

143
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,274
People who will shoot, also worked
on campus.

144
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,234
They coordinate their attacks with a
message.

145
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,270
It was really crazy.

146
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,374
An hour ago, they put out their
manifest.

147
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:10,378
Artificial intelligence is something
that threatens humanity.

148
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:16,291
Until they stop something that you
call to transcendence.

149
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,296
So this is about it.

150
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,299
We tried everything we can.

151
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,530
We have been doing research for
decades.

152
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:29,497
Currently, only with our ability to
make strong artificial intelligence.

153
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,409
- So they consider it a disaster.
- No, no, no.

154
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,413
Can not.
I'm not going to let the government
intervene.

155
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,382
I have never put their money.

156
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,343
Not, willy.
They just want to know if the
research is still running?

157
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,389
It is important for all of us.

158
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:51,491
I've heard a lot about projects
pins, caster doctor, what should we
see it?

159
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,358
Have you choking?

160
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,267
Yes, of course.

161
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:04,535
So this is a super storage
processors that continue to work
here.

162
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,278
Good evening, doctor tagger.

163
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,318
She could know you.

164
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,255
Good evening, donald buchanan.

165
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,451
- He knows me?
- Of course.

166
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,360
Through social records and social
media.

167
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,388
Pinn tell me about yourself in
buchanan agent.

168
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,529
I was pinn, physical independent
neural networks,

169
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,439
Caster will be developed by a
doctor.

170
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,241
If you can prove that you have
consciousness?

171
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:44,444
It is a difficult question, doctor
tagger, what can you do?

172
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:50,284
Aware of the program or the machine,
because we do not know how to work
out of consciousness.

173
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,281
It is a wrong opinion.

174
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,317
This probably is a plan of attack.

175
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,388
They send something when he was
killed.

176
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,264
You'd better get it over with.

177
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,236
I think your father would be
involved, the doctor caster.

178
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,400
- Are you okay, will?
- No, he needs a rest.
I suppose to be here.

179
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,442
I'm really sorry.

180
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,378
- It's okay.
- No problem.

181
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,360
Hey.

182
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,430
- Hold on.
- Has occurred.

183
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,373
Initially is always about shadow.

184
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,442
The existing circumstances, we have
to perform the examination.

185
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,346
We will find a way out.

186
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,356
We've got the results.

187
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,318
Bullet surely pierce, no signs of
injury.

188
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,359
What treatment for him?

189
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,361
This is radiation contamination.

190
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:51,433
It looks like when someone has
entered the bloodstream, the effect
can not be lost.

191
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:57,473
Time is only about 5 weeks before
the system is completely paralyzed.

192
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,286
Because of all the problems it was
not an issue for us.

193
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,518
He did 6 months ago.

194
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,514
He does not want us to get involved.

195
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,327
Rather than creating artificial
intelligence, he copied.

196
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,456
You must be joking.

197
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,333
Look at the monkey activity records.
I already downloaded it.

198
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,403
You're crazy.

199
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:23,398
Will dying body, but we can upload
it to the pin.

200
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,378
- He survived.
- He is not an ape!

201
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,508
If, incorporate electronics into his
brain would not kill him.

202
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,418
And if this works.

203
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,388
Everything to make digital
computation.

204
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,485
You have to keep hold of something,
the mind, childhood memories.

205
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,293
How do you know what you do to her?

206
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,525
I do not say that we gave up.

207
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,503
I want you to focus on technology.

208
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,337
- Immediately after that.
- This is all we have right now.

209
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,240
We could save him.

210
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,405
We will do something useful for him.

211
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:23,357
You know, I am overwhelmed at this
time.

212
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,404
I was very prepared.

213
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,503
Listen.

214
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,381
I would go in a long time.

215
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,288
With you, I do not want any remorse.

216
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,293
If we do not try,

217
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,259
Okay.

218
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,496
I put a lot of trust with you.

219
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,304
Do not underestimate yourself.

220
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,281
You have an incredible ability, you
know?

221
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,497
Are you sure about this?

222
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,406
Managed for the apes.

223
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,217
Beware.

224
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,498
Hey.

225
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,375
Are you okay, honey.
This successful.

226
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,317
We will explore all of this data
throughout the day.

227
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,312
Be prepared to do so.

228
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,324
I'll finish it.

229
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:42,231
Facial scanning is done.

230
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,428
Yes.

231
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,333
Agreed.

232
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,498
Jane.
Agreed.

233
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,333
Sam.

234
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,310
Sam.

235
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,473
I can do this.

236
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,294
Bob.

237
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,387
Label.

238
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,364
Label.

239
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,389
Label.

240
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,459
Rope.

241
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,464
Try.

242
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,444
You have to eat.

243
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,446
Thank you.

244
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,365
Everything will work out.

245
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,407
Will come on wake up.

246
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,477
Let's wake.

247
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,257
Dear, Evelyn.

248
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:25,362
I do not know how to express grief
for the loss of someone.

249
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,456
Or how painful it is.

250
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,495
You should know that to give up,

251
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,332
You should be able to have a taste
of it.

252
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:46,406
You need to move on and forget the
sadness.

253
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,255
We lost this great mind.

254
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,451
The greatest soul.

255
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,429
But in the spirit of this man,

256
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,298
Will continue to inspire us.

257
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,259
Jessica, I was worried.

258
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,456
Pin has been turned off.

259
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,296
But.

260
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,361
Apparently there is something
missing.

261
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,415
I have tried it.

262
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,319
But I can not express this secret.

263
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,353
Find the code.

264
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,261
I could not find a way out.

265
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,289
I do not want you to feel alone.

266
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,465
Yes.

267
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,275
It was not anything, do not be too
worried about it.

268
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,485
I do not know if you were listening
to me.

269
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,459
Maybe you can.

270
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,361
You have turned off the system
itself.

271
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,244
So I did.

272
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,404
I will listen to you.

273
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,411
How I.

274
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,313
Just turn it off, turn it off.

275
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,269
Is there anyone there?

276
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,373
Okay all,

277
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,473
I will wait for him.

278
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,482
I will continue to try.

279
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,253
Wait, wait.

280
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,462
Is there anyone there?

281
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,455
Can you hear me?

282
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,234
I could.

283
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,466
I can hear you.

284
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,441
Who are you?

285
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,498
Can you hear me?

286
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,392
Yes.

287
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,494
I can hear you.

288
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,270
I can hear your voice clearly.

289
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,308
Oh god.

290
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,439
I could listen to you both.

291
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,281
I do not believe this was actually
happening.

292
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,412
Can you see me now?

293
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:49,249
I can see clearly.

294
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,521
I'm very concerned about it.

295
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:03,274
The only fear I feel, is to lose
someone.

296
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:09,369
Because after that happened, it was
all over.

297
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,382
And I feel it.

298
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:19,323
I could feel a sense of fear is
likely to be all on me.

299
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:23,426
I miss our home, I miss you so much.

300
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:34,371
Darkness and all this suffering mean
nothing compared to the fear of
losing you.

301
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:38,502
I can show you all the feelings of
the data through the data that will
I show you,

302
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:43,310
And I can say all of that in a very
short time.

303
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,373
- What?
- You'll soon see it.

304
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,316
Shortly.

305
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,355
I really do not believe it's really
him.

306
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,257
Evelyn,

307
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,424
Oh, god, how he could do this all.

308
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,236
He really liked it.

309
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,276
How can we know it's really him?

310
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,469
What are you talking about?

311
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:19,416
You make the call this pin, we do
not know how many levels
keakurasiannya.

312
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,423
I can show more than that.

313
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,261
Requires three times the process and
how the system allows data
relationships.

314
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,459
Which has been designed with a clear
scheme.

315
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,359
It can explain everything.

316
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,359
My mind has felt truly free.

317
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,304
And you can keep in touch with me.

318
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,398
I want you to continue learning this
program.

319
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,243
Can you imagine what we can do going
forward with this?

320
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,344
What are you doing?

321
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,280
Max, you can not decide, we've
connected to it.

322
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,250
It's not him, it was not him.

323
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,280
He may be an intelligence who wants
to set you up.

324
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,349
This is not him.

325
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:05,226
And we can not believe this directly
without checking it first.

326
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,364
It is a very powerful thing, it's
not like.

327
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,489
How can you explain this
relationship?

328
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,327
Pinn system could be accessed by
people who know the entry access.

329
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,339
No, no, it was part of him,

330
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,499
It is our first date.

331
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:20,466
He has shown proof of data through
the data, and it is my husband.

332
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,469
I would not doubt it, max, it is our
memories.

333
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:28,213
It is real, it is him, stop doubting
it, it was him!

334
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,346
Okay, what I want is you to be more
cautious again,

335
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,290
Turn off the system?
It was him.

336
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,518
- Get out of here!
- I know.

337
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,461
Get out of here!

338
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,492
Do you really mean?

339
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,333
Out of here.

340
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,480
I know it is not easy for you at
this time.

341
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,285
Where max?

342
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,423
He had to go.

343
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,362
Max was confused, right?

344
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,432
He just feel free.

345
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,513
Do you feel?

346
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,354
Do not.

347
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,473
Doctor waters.

348
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,282
Can I talk to you?

349
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,443
No, what you want to talk anymore.

350
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:13,220
- There is no more to say.
- Please.

351
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,258
One night I saw it was still in the
laboratory,

352
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,362
He was doing his research.

353
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,330
And he was out of the room.

354
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,265
And he asked me if he managed to
find a cure for cancer.

355
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,327
And he knew,

356
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,467
When he was undergoing treatment in
monkeys, in fact it makes him happy.

357
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,241
We all feel that way.

358
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,380
And then they realize,

359
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,313
We have crossed the line.

360
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,222
Experiments in monkeys that never
works.

361
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,222
He never ate, never slept.

362
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,225
He just yelled.

363
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,364
He makes it stop.

364
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,368
To turn off the system.

365
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,435
In a small group of us get together
and talk.

366
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,243
Mostly about.

367
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,315
Philosophy.

368
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,418
And attention.

369
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,261
I think you should know it.

370
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,300
Good morning,

371
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,304
We have to make sure the connection
between the system and max.

372
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,507
They already knew that did not you?

373
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,318
We must discover what the system
becomes weak point.

374
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,512
You must do so in accordance with
the plan.

375
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,222
How?

376
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,488
So, you want to create a god,

377
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,366
Gods for yourselves.

378
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,368
Very good question.

379
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,340
Does it sound like it to you?

380
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,281
Caster doctor continued his work
with the system.

381
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,419
Facilities have promoted.

382
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:27,322
We believe it is a unique and
adequate lab.

383
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:32,259
It is a very good study, and I think
we should support it.

384
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,424
Construction of the facility.

385
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,263
They build something great out
there.

386
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,256
What they got up out there?

387
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,431
This object,

388
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,533
Like other intelligent beings.

389
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,311
They learn to crawl.

390
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,277
To come forward.

391
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:04,414
Now, they are.

392
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:11,226
In a place that has.

393
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,496
But it grew more than they know.

394
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,274
After a while the food supplies will
not be enough.

395
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,373
Then they will spread.

396
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,316
Develops.

397
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,320
Effect.

398
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,356
Maybe in the whole world.

399
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,489
Miss caster.

400
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,461
Numbers 1 and 2 are already active,
the number 6 and 7 will be activated
tomorrow.

401
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,325
So how do we to stop it?

402
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,497
You can not stop it.

403
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,467
They are more than one.

404
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,436
Especially now.

405
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,408
They are waiting for people to wake
up.

406
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,280
Do not.

407
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,441
We do not have enough time to wait.

408
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,356
We need to look more closely.

409
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,278
Welcome home.

410
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,402
If it feels the same?

411
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,208
Yes.

412
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,314
This feels the same.

413
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,275
Can you serve a glass of wine.

414
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,516
Wait a minute.

415
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,399
Can you remember where we went for
the first time?

416
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,469
I remember everything.

417
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:50,310
You walk into class joseph on
Tuesday 16th April.

418
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:55,381
Raymond and I then came
menghampirimu.

419
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,294
Joseph said that I can not have you.

420
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,423
Then I turned around to challenge
him.

421
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,265
You are the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

422
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,447
Are you okay?

423
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,254
Yes.

424
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,448
Two years later.

425
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,473
See you try!

426
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,320
We make the brain tissue by using a
nano technology.

427
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:08,451
We can rebuild any material more
quickly than previously.

428
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:12,485
Synthetic tissue regeneration for
medical applications.

429
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,498
Now it is possible.

430
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,400
Outstanding.

431
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,301
They will be afraid of at first.

432
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,274
Once they see the things you can do
with this technology.

433
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:29,337
I think they will accept us, and I
think we are going to change their
lives.

434
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,384
Actual reality of Brightwood.

435
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,343
Enter the petition!

436
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,489
Process the request.

437
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,484
Wait.

438
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,287
You're hurting.

439
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,491
Sorry.

440
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,498
Wait, what are you doing?
What is my fault?

441
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,336
I went.

442
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,378
Put him on the table.

443
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,315
Carefully.

444
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,408
And it feels better.

445
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,388
What happened?

446
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:49,290
The wound is deeper than the known.

447
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,384
What are we waiting for, do
something!

448
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,297
We study him.

449
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,381
You're not scared, are not you?

450
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,322
Do not.

451
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,225
I spit out something strange.

452
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,354
Huh?

453
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,231
How are you?

454
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,298
Better.

455
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,465
My physical body is getting
stronger.

456
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,274
What do you mean?

457
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,406
Do not you recognize me?

458
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,515
I, Evelyn.

459
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,481
I can touch you now.

460
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,255
Geez.

461
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,259
Evelyn.

462
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,423
No, no.
I can not.

463
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,491
- Evelyn.
- I can not.

464
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,511
You had a nightmare?

465
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,286
Yes.

466
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,321
We've made the third in our region.

467
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,416
I think you deserve pleasure.

468
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,353
Okay.

469
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,430
I'm going to get dressed.

470
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,374
Look at this!

471
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,408
It weighs 800 pounds.

472
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,488
Welcome, we're glad you're here.

473
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,464
What are these people doing here?

474
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:32,264
I obviously do not know about it.

475
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,327
It was weird.

476
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,463
Wait, you mean you did not know
about it?

477
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,440
These people are dying.

478
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,277
There is no hope.

479
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,504
And no one can change it.

480
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,248
But, you would not understand.

481
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,287
That they all deserve to be saved.

482
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,257
Did you enjoy your trip?

483
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,387
I think I like it.

484
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,297
Yes.

485
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,425
It's nice to meet you.

486
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,362
I'm also glad to see you, come here.

487
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,344
You are in the room below.

488
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,439
So you can rest.

489
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,355
Welcome.

490
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,399
I'm glad you're here.

491
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,367
O god.

492
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,361
Yah.

493
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,271
Are you surprised to see me?

494
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,373
I am.

495
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,479
I do not understand.

496
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,407
On what?

497
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,320
Can you prove that you are real?

498
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,325
It is a difficult question.

499
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,319
Can you prove you are real?

500
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,257
He certainly did not lose
bercandanya properties,

501
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,352
What is this?

502
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,315
This is shocking.

503
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,451
All of this based on the pin.

504
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,254
We do not say it now.

505
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,329
We use more sophisticated.

506
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,272
This proved to be more effective.

507
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,348
Nanotechnology will replace the
damaged cells.

508
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,444
And repair, and grow.

509
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,310
Wow, what is this?

510
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,446
We've succeeded.

511
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,258
To repair damaged cells.

512
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,249
Help the needy.

513
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,285
Of course we have succeeded.

514
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:23,397
Now we can fix and modify the
system.

515
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:28,202
We will make a place for doing this.

516
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,398
All will be done.

517
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,465
What do you think?

518
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:36,377
In fact, I'm really very surprised.

519
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,474
I do not think all of this will
happen, but.

520
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:45,250
You have seen all that important.

521
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,483
I know it makes you surprised.

522
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,457
Evelyn.

523
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,334
I'll be fine.

524
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,272
I've got everything you need.

525
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,346
Okay.

526
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,515
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

527
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,496
Run away from this place.

528
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,458
Do you think it would help?

529
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,267
He thinks too radical.

530
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,295
I think he's going to continue.

531
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,431
Anyhow.

532
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,441
Whatever it is.

533
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,275
- It's not our problem anymore.
- Yes.

534
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,271
We need to contact washington.

535
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,293
The picture itself.

536
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,365
People call'' hybrid'' combined.

537
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,341
You see people that looked like
this?

538
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,372
I do not know.

539
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,507
Where did you get all this?

540
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,344
We do not want to make them panic.

541
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,446
I do not negotiate with terrorists.

542
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,457
Indeed not allowed.

543
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,220
Look, I knew it was a problem.

544
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,387
But me.
Do not know what to do.

545
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,296
Two days ago I get this.

546
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,525
It is there in the lab.

547
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,499
And it all makes no sense.

548
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,235
Computer control.

549
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,466
There is no way to stop it.

550
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,346
It's really difficult.

551
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,248
Everything you do will be in vain.

552
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,478
Difficult to penetrate.

553
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,283
Do not.

554
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,354
Then why do I have to know all of
this?

555
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,318
When we need someone to blame.

556
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,454
I will choose the easy path.

557
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,357
You really think the genius.

558
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,297
You have a very bad writing.

559
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,358
I do not write much since I
graduated school.

560
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,461
But if you understand what I mean?

561
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,242
How do they find you?

562
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,301
I do not know.

563
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,406
Can not you see what this is all
about?

564
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,443
But you can.

565
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,354
And there is no way to stop it.

566
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,356
If it's a hybrid.

567
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,324
A network.

568
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,451
They need software that I wish that
were true.

569
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,361
Software that can be controlled.

570
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,364
The virus can enter.

571
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,332
Whatever it is that you need to
catch it.

572
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:54,496
That where, will need help from
friends in government.

573
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,306
- Yes.
- We need access to the machine.

574
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,436
Where the chip that could work.

575
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,338
Come quickly, quickly.

576
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,324
Lift everything.

577
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,308
How are you?

578
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,310
I'm fine, thank you.

579
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,340
What is it?

580
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,478
No nothing, just.

581
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,354
I'm a lot of thought.

582
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,466
Yah.

583
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,504
Can you not do that?
Please.

584
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:46,345
I think it will make you feel more
comfortable.

585
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,344
Goodbye.

586
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,451
Yes.

587
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,421
Evelyn, I must show you something.

588
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,294
No, thank you.

589
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,423
I'm not going to do this.

590
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,297
Evelyn, you must understand.

591
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,241
This is a dream.

592
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:51,405
- This is our future.
- Not! This is not our future.

593
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:55,282
You're not here with me, now you're
not here!

594
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,413
Be patient.

595
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:04,221
Did you fall in love with me?

596
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,421
Do not.

597
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,332
Did you ever?

598
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,464
No, no.

599
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,399
I just need time to think.

600
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:28,339
Balance in the system is not fair.

601
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,385
What you.

602
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,347
What you measure hormones?

603
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,416
Come with us.

604
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,394
By following these feelings.

605
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,398
Show all that you've got me, now!

606
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,333
- Why?
- Now!

607
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,375
No, wild, this.
This is wrong!

608
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,317
This.

609
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:08,220
This is my thinking, this is how I
feel.

610
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,522
You.
Should not be doing it!

611
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,325
Evelyn!

612
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,312
This now leads to the ending.

613
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:32,406
Not now!

614
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,266
Evelyn!

615
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,396
Max.

616
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,307
This is not over, stop at your
place!

617
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,472
Put your weapon.

618
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,277
Do not!

619
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,318
They do the wrong thing.

620
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:10,410
Shoot!

621
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,293
They have violated the limit.

622
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,300
They use it to make weapons.

623
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,498
Now what will we do?

624
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,338
We can not fight them!

625
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,309
We will not fight.

626
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,412
We are just going to tell them.

627
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,353
Evelyn.

628
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,458
Is this?

629
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,428
I want you to think.

630
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,363
Forget what they say.

631
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,500
Evolution.

632
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,283
You going?

633
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,309
To a safer place.

634
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,388
I can take you.

635
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,324
I can protect you from them.

636
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,487
I want to be free of them.

637
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,467
Do not go, Evelyn.

638
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,368
I beg.

639
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,340
We can be together.

640
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,285
We can do it.

641
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,221
We lost him.

642
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,354
Hey.

643
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,359
You will have my revenge.

644
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,486
I'm dying.

645
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,432
- I understand.
- He did not survive.

646
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,270
See here, do not be afraid!

647
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,366
Everything is heard, we lost him.

648
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,369
He was ready to do so.

649
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,496
- Where is he?
- He's in area 14.

650
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,370
Whether it?

651
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:48,486
Motel.

652
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,218
How do I know if you're real?

653
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,425
I saw it.

654
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:54,362
- In the evening.
- Original martin dead months ago.

655
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,256
Missing part no more.

656
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,462
What.
What are you doing to him?

657
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,304
We give it back to him.

658
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,469
What did you do to him?

659
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,447
- Do not touch him! Hey, hey!
- I already know this!

660
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:22,451
He trust you, I, I trust you.

661
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,486
- Now, trust us.
- No, you lied to us!

662
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,492
Evelyn.

663
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,492
Let me show you something.

664
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,305
Let's check it out.

665
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,250
This has been awakened.

666
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,523
Her attention.

667
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,328
Wherever you see it, that thing will
start itself.

668
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:14,467
Others will join in air currents, on
the surface of the earth.

669
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:20,346
Its center is the soil.

670
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,285
And also water, everywhere.

671
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,348
Not as we think, they could have a
great effect.

672
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,256
Why?

673
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,488
Effects of organic chemistry dna.

674
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,261
It has been around a long time.

675
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:43,235
Everything will adjust itself.

676
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:47,265
No, not until now.

677
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,444
Evelyn.

678
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,339
Why we did not change his world?

679
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,413
Ye that will change his world.

680
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:07,257
That.
Not good.

681
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,355
Even been worse.

682
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,496
You're never wrong.

683
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,372
You never believe that there is
nothing better.

684
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:30,309
And you are proud of this, here's
everything.

685
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:37,258
This is my pride, managed to find a
series of electrical impulses.

686
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,361
That's him.

687
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,266
The same emotion.

688
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:48,428
Which can have things that are not
logical.

689
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,463
Emotional thing.

690
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,410
You would hate to think about it.

691
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,348
But you will receive it.

692
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,444
Can you?

693
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,421
Yes.

694
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,332
Whether the virus work?

695
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,435
So it is executed, it will erase all
the systems in the network.

696
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,504
You realize this relates to all
computers connected to the server?

697
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:38,310
So, its power can stop the system
and everything can not be turned on.

698
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,450
- Hey, kid, you're not okay?
- Yes.

699
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:53,264
I think the real problem is how it
can penetrate the defense system.

700
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,271
If we can not stop it first.

701
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,306
And may slow it down.

702
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:01,272
I do not know, I can not see how
this would work.

703
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:06,437
You should be able to penetrate his
mind, his subconscious.

704
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,449
Of course.

705
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:12,477
We infected the virus injection into
the system and then I re-create the
program from scratch.

706
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,354
On this occasion can be managed
before it's too late.

707
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,416
So the virus into the blood stream,

708
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:20,222
They will start to damage the
balance.

709
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,287
So when the virus goes into the
machine,

710
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,524
It could kill him too.

711
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,323
I know.

712
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,403
I was the only person he trusts.

713
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,359
Fast!

714
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,291
Come on, quickly grab it!

715
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,208
Quickly entered into.

716
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,466
Who is it?
If it was him?

717
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,536
Seems.

718
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,345
Look, what happened.

719
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,507
There seemed to be coming.

720
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,239
I found my way back.

721
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,469
- We watched.
- I know.

722
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,440
- You have to go.
- No, I will not leave you again.

723
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,348
Not safe here, Evelyn.

724
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:45,254
You, you can protect me.

725
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,226
You're a good man.

726
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,296
You make me complete.

727
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,240
Noble heart.

728
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,502
Go.

729
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,346
Do not fear me.

730
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,412
No, I'm afraid we will lose this
opportunity.

731
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,255
This does not work, she does not let
him decide.

732
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,292
Because the machine does not really
love him.

733
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,491
It's just what we need, we are ready
to move.

734
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:27,263
- All of them, ready to depart.
- You can not do that, he's still
there!

735
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,261
The more she is in danger, the
greater the chance he protect, by
releasing him.

736
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,296
Joseph.

737
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,465
He had approved this.

738
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,342
No, he does not agree, this is not
the plan, give him a chance.

739
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,472
I'm sorry, max.

740
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,345
Shoot!

741
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,522
Will, please let me go.

742
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,456
Why are you doing this?

743
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,358
Why do not you believe me?

744
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,438
Shoot!

745
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,342
Will!

746
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:15,481
Shoot!

747
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,286
Will!

748
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,323
He's dead!

749
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,369
Shoot!

750
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,297
Grip.

751
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,331
We will arrest him on land.

752
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,284
I mean it's not,

753
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,294
Make you become like this.

754
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:41,429
You who make this choice themselves
by not believing me.

755
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:46,338
I want you all to rise up and listen
to me.

756
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,399
It's time we stop hiding.

757
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,362
Rise up and fight.

758
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,314
Unite together.

759
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:35,222
No fear for them.

760
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,492
You want to join me?

761
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,298
Will, I beg.

762
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,434
You destroy them.

763
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:57,209
No, I make them stronger.

764
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:24,533
Ah!

765
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,365
Watch out!

766
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,250
Joseph, answer me.

767
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,481
What are you doing to him?

768
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,381
Will?

769
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,284
O god.

770
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,260
Stop!

771
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,306
Remove the virus now!

772
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,334
Do not do this, bree!

773
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,243
Remove the virus!

774
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:08,373
What did you do to her?

775
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,416
I will free him.

776
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:15,381
He will join us here.

777
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,356
Free from the trap.

778
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,330
I can heal your body, max.

779
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,422
Will, will release the virus, it is
time for it.

780
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,428
Prepare the force.

781
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,328
Not, willy, I beg.

782
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,440
Please, listen to me.

783
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:34,530
Do not.

784
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,442
You can not die because of what
we've done.

785
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,483
I love you, will.

786
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,489
Look at the sky.

787
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,391
Clouds.

788
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,297
We feel the ecosystems of the earth.

789
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,371
Molecules to the air.

790
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:22,382
There will be no pollution.

791
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,289
Forests, can grow well.

792
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,419
Water is so pure,

793
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,395
You can drink out of any river.

794
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,332
This is a dream.

795
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:46,304
He idea is not only to cure a
disease, but also to heal the
planet.

796
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,275
For a better future.

797
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:49,334
For us all.

798
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:10,288
Here it is.

799
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,356
Finally.

800
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,495
You alright?

801
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,274
Yes.

802
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,223
They did not kill anybody.

803
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,269
Will.

804
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:04,410
Is this what you did?

805
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:09,319
I always did.

806
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,428
Sorry, I do not believe.

807
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:30,437
Let's go to the park.

808
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:35,209
Shrine to us.

809
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,419
I'll never let you go.

810
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:24,382
Viruses that erase everything.

811
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,365
Will, to do good as what they say.

812
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,373
But I knew there was something more.

813
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,475
Sure.

814
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:08,225
He created this park for the same
reason he created everything.

815
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,445
So they could be together.

816
01:30:21,445 --> 01:30:25,445
