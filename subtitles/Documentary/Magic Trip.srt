1
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,033
AND THERE WAS JUST...

2
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:34,634
...OF ELECTRICAL IMPULSES.

3
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,868
IT WAS ALL
SLIGHTLY UNBELIEVABLE.

4
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,868
CAN SOMEBODY GIVE ME A MIKE?

5
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:43,634
AND WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
TURN OFF THE FUCKING REVERB?

6
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,767
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,601
NARRATION -- TAKE ONE.

8
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,400
WHEN DID THE '60s BEGIN?

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,634
THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS.

10
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:02,000
EVERYONE REMEMBERS THEM
THIS WAY.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
BUT REALLY THE EARLY '60s
LOOKED LIKE THIS --

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A BLACK-AND-WHITE, PICKET-FENCE
WORLD STILL STUCK IN THE '50s.

13
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:14,133
BUT IN 1964,
THIS MAN, KEN KESEY,

14
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:17,167
TOOK AN LSD-FUELED BUS TRIP
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

15
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,400
THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,200
KESEY LIT THE FUSE
FOR THE EXPLOSION OF THE '60s.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
WHO WAS KEN KESEY?

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,734
HE LOOKS INNOCENT ENOUGH,
DOESN'T HE?

19
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:33,868
NOT LIKE THE KIND OF GUY
TO TAKE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF LSD.

20
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,834
WHILE IN COLLEGE,
KESEY MARRIED

21
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,834
HIS JUNIOR-HIGH-SCHOOL
SWEETHEART, FAYE.

22
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,801
AS A COLLEGE ATHLETE,
KESEY SHOWED PROMISE

23
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,367
BOTH AS A FOOTBALL PLAYER
AND A WRESTLER.

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:50,634
KESEY ALSO LIKED PERFORMING
AS AN ACTOR AND A VENTRILOQUIST.

25
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:52,000
HE LOVED THE MAGIC TRICK

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,767
OF SPEAKING
THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE.

27
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:58,267
KEN, WHEN DID YOU DECIDE
TO BECOME A WRITER?

28
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,501
I NEVER SAID
I WANTED TO BE A WRITER.

29
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,000
I'M A MAGICIAN.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,033
WRITING IS JUST ONE
OF THE TRICKS THAT I DO.

31
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,467
AND QUITE A TRICK IT WAS.

32
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,334
BY 1964, AT THE AGE OF 29,

33
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:14,434
KESEY WAS ONE OF AMERICA'S
GREATEST WRITERS.

34
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,534
HIS FIRST TWO
PUBLISHED NOVELS WERE

35
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,234
"ONE FLEW OVER
THE CUCKOO'S NEST"

36
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:21,133
AND "SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION."

37
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,300
YET, AT THE HEIGHT
OF HIS SUCCESS,

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,767
KEN TRADED HIS TYPEWRITER
FOR A MOVIE CAMERA.

39
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:29,667
IF SHAKESPEARE
WERE WRITING TODAY,

40
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,334
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD USE
A QUILL PEN.

41
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:37,000
SO I STARTED GOING OUT
AND TAPING WITH TAPE RECORDERS

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,100
AND FILMING TO SEE IF...

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,501
PEOPLE TALKED LIKE THEY DO
IN NOVELS, AND THEY DON'T.

44
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,267
WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS,

45
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,701
KESEY SET OUT
TO MAKE A ROAD MOVIE.

46
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,601
THEIR TRIP
WOULD BECOME A LEGEND,

47
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:52,434
BUT FEW EVER SAW THE FILM.

48
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,734
THERE WERE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS.

49
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:58,067
THEIR VOICES ARE ON AUDIO TAPE

50
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,968
BUT ALMOST NEVER IN SYNC
WITH THE PICTURE.

51
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,767
AGAIN, THE TRANSMISSION
OF THE '27 BUICK

52
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,968
INTO SECOND GEAR

53
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,033
AROUND THE CORNER
AT 34th AND DEARBORN --

54
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:09,667
OR WAS IT CLARK?
IT WAS SOMEWHERE.

55
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,133
HERE'S A SCENE
WITH NEAL CASSADY,

56
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,534
THE FAMOUS SPEED-TAKING,
REAL-LIFE INSPIRATION

57
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,701
FOR JACK KEROUAC'S FAMOUS NOVEL
"ON THE ROAD."

58
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,100
BET HE -- UH-OH, SAY...

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,634
FOR 40 YEARS, KESEY
AND HIS FRIENDS EDITED THE FILM,

60
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,567
NEVER GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED.

61
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,367
THEN IT WAS BOXED AWAY,
FORGOTTEN, COLLECTING DUST.

62
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,834
NOW WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE VAULTS,

63
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,400
USING THE RARE
FILM AND AUDIO INTERVIEWS

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,734
OF KEN AND HIS FRIENDS
TO BRING THE STORY BACK TO LIFE.

65
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:42,133
LET'S GO, PRANKSTERS!

66
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,601
UNNECESSARILY,
MR. CASSADY PROCEEDED NORTH.

67
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,801
HA HA HA!

68
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,033
* YEAH *

69
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,934
* YEAH *

70
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,000
CAR WRECK.
CHILDREN, TO THE LEFT -- WRECK.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,100
IT'S A JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE,
YOU KNOW.

72
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:30,734
WHEN DID THE IDEA FOR
THIS TRIP FIRST OCCUR TO YOU?

73
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:35,267
1963 CAME,
AND EVERYTHING CHANGED.

74
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:40,133
WE'D GONE BACK -- ME AND GEORGE
AND FAYE -- TO NEW YORK.

75
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:43,834
NEW YORK CITY
EXTENDS ITS WELCOME.

76
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,100
THE SHOPS ON THE AVENUES.

77
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,033
THE NEW HOTELS.
RESTAURANTS.

78
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,701
THE SIDEWALK CAFES.

79
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,601
THE HIT SHOWS.
THE TINSEL OF BROADWAY.

80
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,868
WE HAD GONE BACK

81
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:03,834
TO SEE THE OPENING OF
"CUCKOO'S NEST" ON BROADWAY,

82
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,133
WITH KIRK DOUGLAS
PLAYING McMURPHY,

83
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,601
AND HE WAS TERRIFIC.

84
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,501
AFTER THE PLAY,

85
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,200
PART OF OUR DAYTIME DIVERSION

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,868
AS WE WERE CRUISING
AROUND THE CITY,

87
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,534
WE TOOK A DRIVE OUT TO QUEENS,

88
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:22,467
WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION WAS
GOING ON FOR THE WORLD'S FAIR.

89
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,567
HERE ON THIS VERY SITE
IS TO BE ERECTED --

90
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,734
THEY'RE DOING IT
AT THE MOMENT --

91
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:31,434
THE SYMBOL OF THE THEME
OF THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR.

92
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,367
THE UNISPHERE!

93
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,667
AND BY DIALING 1964,

94
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:43,467
I LAUNCH THE FINAL PHASE
OF THIS GREAT EFFORT.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,200
WE LOOKED AT IT AND
SAID, "BOY, THIS IS SPECTACULAR.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,300
WE'RE GONNA WANT
TO COME SEE THIS."

97
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,033
WE VOWED NEXT YEAR
WE'D GO BACK TO NEW YORK

98
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,601
TO THE WORLD'S FAIR.

99
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:04,501
ON THE WAY BACK,
I WAS DRIVING ACROSS COUNTRY

100
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,567
IN A BIG OLD NICE STATION WAGON

101
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:10,000
WITH A COUPLE OF MY BUDDIES,
NIBBLING ON CACTUS.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,300
HERE IN THE ABC NEWSROOM
IN NEW YORK,

103
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,968
WE FIRST RECEIVED A FLASH --

104
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,200
AS WE WERE DRIVING ALONG,
KENNEDY BEGAN TO BE KILLED.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,300
THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED
AT PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S MOTORCADE

106
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,767
IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS.

107
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,467
THE FIRST REPORTS
SAY THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY

108
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,901
HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED
BY THIS SHOOTING.

109
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:30,567
THE CROWD OUTSIDE IS QUIET

110
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,767
AND WAITING FOR SOME WORD

111
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,367
ON THE CONDITION
OF THE PRESIDENT.

112
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,534
THE PRESIDENT'S DEATH
IS OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED.

113
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,367
PRESIDENT KENNEDY
AND GOVERNOR JOHN CONNALLY

114
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,200
HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN
BY ASSASSIN'S BULLETS

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,968
IN DOWNTOWN DALLAS.

116
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,934
EVERYWHERE YOU WENT,
YOU LOOKED IN PEOPLE'S EYES,

117
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:56,868
AND THEY ALL FELT
THE SAME THING.

118
00:07:56,868 --> 00:08:00,033
IT WASN'T JUST SADNESS.

119
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,033
IT WAS A LOSS OF AN INNOCENCE,

120
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,133
THE LOSS OF THE IDEA

121
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,968
THAT ALWAYS THE GOOD
IS GOING TO PREVAIL.

122
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,667
THE TRAGEDY OF THIS DAY

123
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:11,968
IS BEYOND
ANY INSTANT COMPREHENSION.

124
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:14,968
THERE'S NO WAY
TO EVEN NEARLY DEPICT THE PAIN

125
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,400
AND THE FEELING OF CRISIS,

126
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,834
THE THING
THAT ALL OF US SORT OF FEEL

127
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,200
WHEN IT'S REAL DARK.

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,834
THIS IS NOT
AN ORDINARY SATURDAY.

129
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,167
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

130
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:31,701
THIS WORLD THAT I WAS
PRESENTING WITH THESE WORDS,

131
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,701
I BEGAN TO SUSPECT
MIGHT NOT HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO DO

132
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,400
WITH THE WORLD OF THIS.

133
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,701
SO, WE DECIDED TO GO TRAVEL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY --

134
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,834
I LOVE TO DRIVE
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES --

135
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,767
GO TO THE WORLD'S FAIR,
AND COME BACK ACROSS,

136
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,334
JUST TO EXPERIENCE THE...

137
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:53,834
THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE
AND "HEARTSCAPE."

138
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,334
WE WERE GONNA TAKE THE SAME
STATION WAGON WE CAME BACK IN,

139
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,834
AND PRETTY SOON BABBS WAS HOME,
AND HE WANTED TO GO.

140
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,334
I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS
FOR FIVE YEARS,

141
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,167
FLEW HELICOPTERS IN VIETNAM,

142
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,067
AND CAME OUT IN MAY OF '64.

143
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,734
GOT OUT OF THE MARINE CORPS --
I HAD ENOUGH OF THAT.

144
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,334
BABBS WAS STALKING AROUND.

145
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,167
THIS IS JUST AFTER
HE GOT OUT OF THE MARINES.

146
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,000
HE BEGAN TO ASSIGN NAMES
TO THEM.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,601
HE BECAME
"THE INTREPID TRAVELER,"

148
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,133
AND THESE WERE
HIS "MERRY BAND OF PRANKSTERS."

149
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,167
"SWASHBUCKLER"
BECAME MY NICKNAME.

150
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,234
GRETCH HAD COME DOWN
FROM OREGON. WE'D MET HER.

151
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,033
I WAS AN ART STUDENT
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON.

152
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,801
MY INTENTION WAS TO GET A RIDE.

153
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,067
I WAS GONNA WORK IN NEW YORK,

154
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:37,033
SWIMMING AT THE WORLD'S FAIR
IN WATER BALLET,

155
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,901
'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING
I KNEW HOW TO DO --

156
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,234
THE ROCKETTES IN WATER.

157
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,167
PRETTY SOON,
HAGEN WAS THERE,

158
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,934
WHO'S AN OLD FRIEND FROM OREGON,

159
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,567
FRATERNITY BROTHER --
HE HAD A CAMERA.

160
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,033
SANDY.
HE WAS A PHENOMENON.

161
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,400
HE WAS IN THE NUTHOUSE.

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
HE WAS LIKE THE ID
STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,234
HE WAS JUST THERE.

164
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,701
AT HIS WORST, HE WAS CRAZY.

165
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:07,634
AND AT HIS BEST,
HE WAS A GENIUS.

166
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:14,567
JANE BURTON WAS A PROFESSOR
IN PHILOSOPHY FROM STANFORD.

167
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,901
SHE WAS PREGNANT,
AND SHE WAS HUNGRY ALL THE TIME.

168
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,234
SO, SHE SAYS,
"WELL, I'M GENERALLY FAMISHED."

169
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:23,601
AND SO SHE BECAME KNOWN AS
"GENERALLY FAMISHED."

170
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,167
IT GOT TO BE
KIND OF A PARTY.

171
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,634
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE IT,

172
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:30,901
JUST A BUNCH OF LUNATICS
RUNNING AROUND ACTING IDIOTIC

173
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,601
TRYING TO GET TO THE EAST COAST
SOMEHOW.

174
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,033
I MET KEN ON PERRY LANE.

175
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:42,067
CHLOE WAS
THE GERTRUDE STEIN OF OUR SCENE.

176
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:45,300
I THOUGHT IT WAS
PRETTY INSANE, ACTUALLY.

177
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,534
I REALLY DUG EVERYBODY
FOR DOING IT.

178
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,400
ZONKER WAS JUST THERE.

179
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,133
WE WEREN'T PLANNING TO TAKE HIM.
WE BARELY KNEW HIM.

180
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,467
EVERY TIME SOMETHING
WOULD HAPPEN, HE'D FALL ASLEEP.

181
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,601
AND HE HAD THIS SNORE...

182
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,968
OKAY, HERE'S STARK NAKED.

183
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:04,467
NOW, I'M ATTRACTED TO HER.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

184
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,601
BUT SHE'S JUST SO STRANGE.

185
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,400
MICHAEL HAGEN INVITED ME
TO KEN'S HOUSE FOR A WEEKEND,

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
AND THAT'S HOW I MET EVERYBODY.

187
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,767
THERE WAS JUST A GREAT DEAL
OF GENERAL JOVIALITY

188
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,300
AND TALKING AND LAUGHING
AND DANCING.

189
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,200
AND EVEN THEN IT WAS LIKE
A TROUPE OF MINSTRELS AND MIMES.

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,634
THEIR PRESENCE
WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

191
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:28,300
THE NOTION OF US BEING
WILD CRAZIES WASN'T TRUE.

192
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,033
WE WEREN'T LONG-HAIRED,
AND WE WEREN'T IRRESPONSIBLE.

193
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,934
THERE WAS AN AMERICAN SENSE.

194
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:35,767
THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS WORE
RED, WHITE, AND BLUE

195
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,534
AND FLEW THE FLAG.

196
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,467
IT WAS TO TRY TO COOL
THE PEOPLE OUT AND SAY,

197
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,334
"THIS MAY LOOK STRANGE TO YOU,
BUT GET USED TO IT.

198
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,501
IT'S AMERICAN, AND WITHOUT IT
WE'RE A DEAD NATION."

199
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,434
SINCE IT TURNED OUT
THAT THERE WERE SO MANY OF US,

200
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,801
FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING,

201
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,000
TOO MANY OF US
TO GO IN ONE OR TWO CARS,

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,167
WE DECIDED WE'D BUY A BUS
AND WE'D ALL TRAVEL TOGETHER.

203
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:58,801
* PUT ON YOUR RED DRESS, BABY *

204
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,968
* 'CAUSE WE GOING OUT TONIGHT *

205
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,200
WE TOOK

206
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,400
A 1939 INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER'S
SCHOOL BUS.

207
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:10,968
I GOT OUT THERE
WITH A BLINDFOLD.

208
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:13,734
IT WAS YOUR LEFT BRAIN WORKING

209
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,300
BEFORE IT EVEN KNEW
IT WAS THE LEFT BRAIN.

210
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,067
* I'M PRETTY SURE NOW, BABY *

211
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:24,534
* 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA KNOCK 'EM DEAD *

212
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,434
ROY WAS
THE REAL PAINTER AMONG US.

213
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,000
* YEAH *

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,734
AT FIRST,
IT DIDN'T APPEAL TO ME AT ALL,

215
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,467
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT LOOKED
REALLY GOOD THE WAY IT WAS,

216
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,267
ORANGE WITH BLACK STRIPES.

217
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,467
ONCE IT WAS OBVIOUS
THAT IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN,

218
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,767
I JUST WENT AHEAD.

219
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,400
THE CHALLENGE WAS
TO MIX IT UP THERE

220
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,033
SO IT WOULD BE
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT.

221
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,834
SOMEBODY JUST TOOK AN OLD BROOM
UP ON THE TOP

222
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,234
AND SPILLED SOME PAINT AROUND,

223
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,801
AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WALKED
AROUND WITH THEIR BARE FEET

224
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:55,767
ON THE BUS,
LEAVING FOOTPRINTS OF PAINT.

225
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,334
FIRST IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE,

226
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,601
THEN A MILLION DIFFERENT
PSYCHEDELIC COLORS,

227
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:01,534
AND THEN IT
WOULD BE PAINTED OVER.

228
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:05,234
I THINK THEY MUST'VE
PAINTED IT OVER 5 OR 10 TIMES.

229
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,734
AND WE DECIDED, "WELL, HEY,
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS BUS TRIP,

230
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,367
LET'S FILM IT."

231
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,601
WE BOUGHT
REAL COLOR FILM, 16 MILLIMETER,

232
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:20,434
AND WE'D GOTTEN SEVERAL
REAL 16-MILLIMETER CAMERAS

233
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,767
AND WE DECIDED WE'RE
GONNA MAKE A FILM.

234
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,701
SO WHAT KIND OF FILM
WERE YOU MAKING?

235
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,901
A FEATURE LIKE
"GONE WITH THE WIND"?

236
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,734
YEAH.

237
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,934
DID ANYONE ON BOARD KNOW
HOW TO USE THE CAMERAS?

238
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:35,067
NONE OF US KNEW HOW TO DO
ANYTHING THAT WE WERE DOING.

239
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:38,467
* I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE
GONNA KNOCK 'EM DEAD *

240
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,067
I HEARD THE BUS WAS
CALLED "FURTHER."

241
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,167
RIGHT.

242
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,467
WHAT DOES
"FURTHER" MEAN?

243
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,767
OH, I GET THAT QUESTION
A LOT.

244
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,868
IT ALWAYS KIND OF
DISAPPOINTS ME.

245
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,067
WHAT, THAT PEOPLE ASK YOU
WHAT "FURTHER" MEANS?
UH-HUH.

246
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,767
WELL, I COULD LOOK IT UP
IN THE DICTIONARY

247
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,033
AND TELL YOU THAT IT MEANS
FARTHER ALONG THAN THIS, BUT --

248
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,167
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M PRETTY DISAPPOINTED
IN MYSELF.

249
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,801
"FARTHER"
IS A DISTANCE.

250
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,734
FURTHER IS A BUS.

251
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,501
ONE IS
A PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT,

252
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:03,767
THE OTHER IS
A MEASUREMENT.

253
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,400
WHAT DO YOU THINK, KEN?

254
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
WE NEEDED TO DO
SOME MODIFICATIONS.

255
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,133
WE WERE AT A WELDING SHOP
THAT WAS ALSO A JUNKYARD

256
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,167
AND WE SAW THIS BIG
COMMERCIAL CLOTHES DRYER

257
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,567
AND IT LOOKED LIKE
A TANK TURRET,

258
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,300
AND WE DECIDED
WE WANTED A TURRET ON THE TOP.

259
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,133
SO WE HAD THIS WELDER GUY

260
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:27,267
CUT A BIG HOLE
ON THE TOP OF THE BUS.

261
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,934
I HAD A MOTORCYCLE
THAT WE TOOK ALONG,

262
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,801
SO WE HAD THE PLATFORM
WELDED ON THE BACK OF IT

263
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,801
THAT WE COULD CARRY THE
MOTORCYCLE AND A GENERATOR ON.

264
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:41,567
CHUCK HAD DONATED
A 5-K.W. GAS GENERATOR.

265
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,100
KEN, WHY WAS THE IDEA
OF A ROAD TRIP SO APPEALING?

266
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,934
WE WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH
TO BE BEATNIKS,

267
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,033
AND WE WERE A LITTLE
TOO OLD TO BE HIPPIES.

268
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:57,434
BUT EVERYBODY I KNEW
HAD READ "ON THE ROAD,"

269
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,367
AND IT OPENED UP
THE DOORS TO US

270
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,701
JUST THE SAME WAY
DRUGS DID.

271
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,534
IT GAVE US A NEW WAY TO LOOK AT
AMERICA, AND IT STIRRED US UP.

272
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:10,567
"SO, IN AMERICA,
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN

273
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,434
"AND I SIT ON THE OLD
BROKEN-DOWN RIVER PIER

274
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:16,300
"WATCHING THE LONG, LONG SKIES
OVER NEW JERSEY

275
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,534
"AND SENSE ALL THAT RAW LAND
THAT ROLLS

276
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,467
"IN ONE UNBELIEVABLE HUGE BULGE
OVER TO THE WEST COAST,

277
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,567
"AND ALL THAT ROAD GOING,

278
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,267
"I THINK OF DEAN MORIARTY,

279
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:30,868
I THINK OF DEAN MORIARTY."

280
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,434
* OH *

281
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:36,033
* WELL, I'M THE TYPE OF GUY
WHO WILL NEVER SETTLE DOWN *

282
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:40,534
* WHERE PRETTY GIRLS ARE, WELL,
YOU KNOW THAT I'M AROUND... *

283
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:43,767
A TWO-TONE
PINK-AND-PURPLE DODGE

284
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,434
RIDING LOW ON TORTURED SHOCKS,

285
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:48,167
SPURTING SMOKE,
RACES ACROSS THE CURB,

286
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:51,767
OVER THE BRIDGE, AND SKIDS
TO THE PORCH, SLAMS,

287
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:56,367
AND KESEY STANDS, HANDS ON HIPS,
WATCHING THE ARRIVAL.

288
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,801
THE CAR MADE A RAPID APPROACH,
AND HE FIT INTO THIS PLACE.

289
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:03,567
THERE WAS 8-5
ON YOU GETTING THROUGH THERE.

290
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,434
PEOPLE WERE HOLLERING,
"NOBODY COULD PARK THERE!

291
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:06,567
"YOU CAN'T FIT IT THROUGH!

292
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,767
NO, NO, COME ON, CASSADY,
COME ON, MAN."

293
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:13,868
* WITH MY TWO FISTS OF IRON,
BUT I'M GOING NOWHERE *

294
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:18,701
* OH, YEAH, I'M THE TYPE OF GUY
THAT LIKES TO ROAM AROUND *

295
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,634
* I'M NEVER IN ONE PLACE *

296
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,133
* I ROAM FROM TOWN TO TOWN *

297
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,734
BEFORE THE SMOKE HAD CLEARED,

298
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,467
THERE WAS THIS GUY WITH NO SHIRT
ON TALKING A MILE A MINUTE.

299
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,701
WE ALL KNEW WHO HE WAS.

300
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,200
THIS WAS DEAN MORIARTY --
WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT --

301
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
OUR FAMOUS DEAN MORIARTY.

302
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,300
* YEAH, I'M A WANDERER *

303
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,334
* YEAH, A WANDERER *

304
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:35,801
* I ROAM AROUND, AROUND... *

305
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:37,033
I'D READ "ON THE ROAD,"

306
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:39,100
SO I KNEW HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
DEAN MORIARTY,

307
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,133
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THAT
CHARACTER IN THE BOOK TOO MUCH,

308
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,567
AND I LIKED NEAL BETTER.

309
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:48,434
ALL OF A SUDDEN, OUT POPS
THIS MAN, ALMOST FROM NOWHERE.

310
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:51,801
HE REMINDED ME MORE
OF AN IRISH LEPRECHAUN AT FIRST.

311
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,367
WHEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH,
HE SAID ABOUT 40 WORDS,

312
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,901
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

313
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:59,968
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WAS
AND IS ALL RIGHT

314
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:03,234
AND ALL BEAUTIFUL
AND ALL FUNNY AND MEANINGFUL,

315
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,701
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

316
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:08,634
* YEAH, I'M THE TYPE OF GUY
THAT LIKES TO ROAM AROUND *

317
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,300
* I'M NEVER IN ONE PLACE... *

318
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,467
FOR ME, I'M WATCHING IT
ALL AND THINKING,

319
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:15,601
"WOW, HE KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE MY DAD,

320
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,567
AND MY DAD IS GONNA DRIVE
THE BUS!"

321
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,901
* ...DRIVE AROUND THE WORLD *

322
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,734
* 'CAUSE I'M A WANDERER *

323
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:25,501
* YEAH, A WANDERER *

324
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,934
HE CAME ALONG
KIND OF AS A FATHER FIGURE.

325
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,868
SAYS, "I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU BOYS, UNDERSTAND,

326
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:31,000
"CHANGE YOUR TIRES.

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,400
HERE, I GOT THIS 8-TON JACK.
I GOT THIS LUG WRENCH."

328
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,467
HE GOES, "YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A
LUG WRENCH IN YOUR GODDAMN BUS."

329
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,534
"HERE, LOOK, I GOT US
A COUPLE OF SPARE INNER TUBES,

330
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,234
"THOSE BOOT THINGS --
YOU NEVER SAW A BOOT BEFORE,

331
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,868
"PROBABLY GOES
INSIDE THE SPARE TIRE,

332
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,667
AND A BIG TIRE,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 10..."

333
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,367
WE STARTED OUT IN LA HONDA,

334
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,767
AND THERE WAS ALL THIS BIG DEAL,

335
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,501
AND WE HAD BEEN
GETTING READY FOR DAYS

336
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:53,100
AND PACKING AND FIXING,
AND FINALLY IT WAS THE MOMENT.

337
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,868
WE WERE LEAVING LA HONDA,

338
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,434
AND EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND
AND WAVED US GOODBYE

339
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:00,234
AND WE CLIMBED ON THE BUS.

340
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,934
HONK THE HORN!

341
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:10,100
AND IT STARTED OFF
AND IT WENT OUT THE GATE

342
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,334
AND ACROSS THE BRIDGE
AND RAN OUT OF GAS!

343
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,033
WELL, THE MOMENT
OF DEPARTURE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

344
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,200
WE RAN OUT OF GAS
ON KESEY'S BRIDGE.

345
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,033
WE FIGURED, AT THAT RATE,
YOU KNOW, 25 FEET AN HOUR --

346
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,667
WE HAD A WEEK
TO GET TO NEW YORK.

347
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,000
WE WEREN'T WORRIED.

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THIS IS TAKING
DISORGANIZATION

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
TO SOME SORT OF PEAK.

350
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,868
IT WAS JUST LUDICROUS.

351
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,534
AND IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER,
THAT WAS JUST, LIKE,

352
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,567
THE PERFECT OMEN
FOR THE START OF THIS TRIP.

353
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,634
I USED TO THINK
I WAS NAPOLEON, TOO.

354
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,701
WE SET OUT
JUST LIKE IN "EASY RIDER"

355
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:46,467
OR "TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY,"

356
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:52,133
WHERE STEINBECK SETS OUT
TO SEEK THE SOUL OF AMERICA.

357
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,467
IT LOOKED LIKE
A TRAVELING PLEASURE PALACE.

358
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:00,234
WE COULD RIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
IN TOTAL COMFORT.

359
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,868
IT WAS BIG
AND ROOMY AND SPACIOUS --

360
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,167
UNTIL WE GOT
ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT.

361
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,734
THEN IT WAS CROWDED.

362
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:10,868
IT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF A PLEASURE PALACE.

363
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,267
I WAS ON THE FIRST 24 HOURS

364
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,968
THAT IT TOOK US TO GET
FROM LA HONDA TO SAN JOSE.

365
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,200
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT IS IT, 40 MILES?

366
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,133
IT TOOK US 24 HOURS
TO GET TO SAN JOSE.

367
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,334
WE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR,

368
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,567
AND MECHANICAL SPASMS
STARTED HAPPENING ON THE BUS,

369
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:34,400
AND THE ENGINE WAS SPUTTERING,
SO WE PULLED INTO A GAS STATION.

370
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,133
SOME OLD GAS STATION MAN
TOOK A LOOK AT THAT THING,

371
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,767
LOOKED AT THE ENGINE AND SAYS,

372
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:45,167
"YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT THING
PAST OKLAHOMA."

373
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,133
WELL, I'M SAYING TO MYSELF,

374
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,501
"JESUS CHRIST,
THIS THING IS FUCKED."

375
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,934
LOOK, IT'S PAINTED WEIRD,

376
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:55,133
THE MECHANICS BEHIND IT
ARE EQUALLY AS WEIRD.

377
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,467
WHILE EVERYBODY
WAS WORKING ON THE ENGINE,

378
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,300
I WAS MESSING AROUND WITH
THE HEADSET AND WAS GOING,

379
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,968
"WE'RE ON OUR WAY-AY-AY-AY...

380
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:07,400
TO SAN JOSE-E-E-E!"

381
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,167
HOW WAS YOUR STAY...

382
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,834
IN SAN JOSE?!

383
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,868
WHILE I WAS DOING THAT,
I HAPPENED TO TURN AROUND,

384
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,667
AND I NOTICED CHLOE
LOOKING REALLY GLUM.

385
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,267
I SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG?"

386
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:23,167
AND SHE SAYS, "IF IT TAKES US
THIS LONG TO GET TO SAN JOSE,"

387
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,033
SHE SAYS, "WE'LL NEVER
MAKE IT TO NEW YORK CITY!"

388
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,000
SHE SAYS, "I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
THIS IS TOO CHAOTIC."

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,033
AND THAT WAS AS FAR
AS SHE LASTED ON THE BUS.

390
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,868
YEAH, I WAS
PRETTY GLAD TO GET OFF.

391
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:41,434
I MEAN, THANK GOD I'M NOT
CROSSING THE COUNTRY IN IT.

392
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,100
AND YOU GOT BACK
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

393
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,634
BY MORE CIVILIZED MEANS,
I IMAGINE?

394
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:49,133
T.W.A.

395
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,801
* T.W.A.'s YOUR WAY *

396
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,968
THERE'S BEEN
A ONE-STEP REMOVAL, I THINK,

397
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,000
FROM OUR CONNECTION TO LIFE.

398
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,033
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE
YOU CAN SEE IT. GO TO L.A.

399
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:13,100
WE CAN'T SEE ANYMORE,
WE CAN BARELY HEAR ANYMORE.

400
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,701
WHEN WE LOOK,
WE'RE NOT LOOKING <i>AT.</i>

401
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,300
WE'RE LOOKING <i>FOR.</i>

402
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,934
I TELL YOU, HOLLYWOOD IS
AS SOULLESS AN IDEA

403
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,801
OF WHAT LIFE LOOKS LIKE.

404
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,067
* I'M GOING OUT WEST
WHERE I BELONG *

405
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,434
WHAT COLOR IS WORLD WAR II?

406
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,100
WORLD WAR I IS EVEN
A BETTER EXAMPLE.

407
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,434
WHAT COLOR IS WORLD WAR I?

408
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,567
IT'S BLACK AND WHITE,

409
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,534
WHEREAS THE CIVIL WAR
IS IN TECHNICOLOR.

410
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:34,100
* THEY WALK, AND I'LL WALK *

411
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,801
* THEY TWIST, AND I'LL TWIST *

412
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:40,000
WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL OF THIS
STUFF THAT'S BEING SOLD US

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,334
HAS DAMN NEAR CLOSED THE DOOR

414
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,801
ON ANY POSSIBILITY
OF OUR DOING ANYTHING NEW,

415
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,234
ON OUR DOING ANYTHING

416
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,300
EXCEPT TRAVELING
IN THE SAME LITTLE CIRCLE?

417
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,534
AND, IF THAT IS TRUE,
HOW DO WE BREAK OUT OF IT?

418
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,801
SO YOU DONATE BLOOD,
THEN THERE'S A SICK CAT,

419
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:59,200
NOT BEING APPROVED OF AND ALL,
AS THE SON, YOU SEE, WOULD BE,

420
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,801
SO YOU HAVE A MANIA...

421
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:04,400
ALL YOU CAN DO
IS EXPERIENCE THIS THING.

422
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,734
THIS, AS NEAR AS I CAN SEE,
IS WHAT'S GOING ON,

423
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,234
AS NEAR AS I CAN RECORD IT.

424
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,801
IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE.

425
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,300
I'M JUST TRYING
TO OPEN UP LIKE A CAMERA

426
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,133
AND SEE IT CLEARLY FOR A MOMENT.

427
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
I REMEMBER WHEN
WE FIRST HEADED OUT OF LA,

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,934
OUT OF KEN BABBS' PLACE,
WHERE WE SPENT A COUPLE DAYS

429
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:28,601
PAINTING HIS SWIMMING POOL
AND SO FORTH.

430
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,334
WHEN THE BUS HEADED OUT,

431
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:34,033
BABBS WAS LIVING
IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO

432
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,968
WITH HIS WIFE, ANITA,
AND HIS KIDS.

433
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,601
AND WE WENT THROUGH CAPISTRANO,

434
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,801
AND HE REALIZED THIS IS HIS
MERRY BAND OF PRANKSTERS

435
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:45,400
AND HE BETTER CLIMB ABOARD.

436
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,334
THE ORIGINAL PRANKSTER CREDO

437
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,000
THAT STARTED
THE WHOLE PRANKSTER MOVEMENT

438
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,767
WAS ONE OF --

439
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:55,634
YOU START OFF BY SAYING,
"NEVER TRUST A PRANKSTER."

440
00:22:55,634 --> 00:23:00,467
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW I TRY,

441
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:04,167
I WILL EVENTUALLY...

442
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,501
LIE TO YOU, EVEN THOUGH
I MAY NOT WANT TO.

443
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,367
IF I SAY ONE THING TODAY...

444
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,167
GO AHEAD. WOULD YOU
REPEAT THAT AGAIN?

445
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,734
"AWOOOOOOO."

446
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,400
VERY FUNNY.

447
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:31,300
WHEN WE STARTED OUT
WITH THE BUS,

448
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,767
I REALIZED I WASN'T GONNA BE
ABLE TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THIS.

449
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:36,267
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE.

450
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,868
THIS WASN'T LITERATURE ANYMORE,

451
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,767
THIS JUMPED OFF THE PAGES
AND ONTO THE STREETS.

452
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:55,200
WE TOOK OFF,
WENT ACROSS THE DESERT,

453
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,801
AND HEADED FOR ARIZONA.

454
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,534
CASSADY TALKED A LOT.

455
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:19,067
WE'D TAKE TURNS
RIDING SHOTGUN WITH HIM

456
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:22,300
SO HE'D HAVE SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO WHILE HE WAS DRIVING.

457
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,534
HE WAS A RADIO.

458
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,667
HE JUST WENT ON AND ON AND ON.

459
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,534
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO EVER SHUT OFF.

460
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,167
HE COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.

461
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,133
IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH SPEED.

462
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,534
MAJOR PORTION,
CRITICAL POINT...

463
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:51,734
Shh! Shh! Shh!

464
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:54,501
OKAY, SETTLE IN, SETTLE IN.

465
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,467
ATTRACTING THE COPS,
AND HOW TO DEAL WITH

466
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,167
CONCEALING THE DRUGS
THAT WE HAD,

467
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,033
THAT WAS ALWAYS
A CONSIDERATION

468
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,501
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BUS TRIP,

469
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,300
BECAUSE THE COPS
WERE STOPPING US

470
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,267
BECAUSE THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

471
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:09,067
I WASTED YOUR TIME,
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT --

472
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,634
CASSADY WOULD ALWAYS BE
OUT THERE TALKING TO THEM,

473
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,133
AND HE'D SAY, "OH, YEAH,
OFFICERS," HE'D SAY.

474
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,501
"YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
BACK THERE," HE SAID,

475
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,801
"BUT I'M DOING MY BEST
TO KEEP THEM IN CONTROL."

476
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:18,067
WE'RE HAVING
A BRIEF EQUIPMENT...

477
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:21,601
OUR INSTANT COVER WAS ALWAYS TO
GET THE CAMERAS OUT AND RUN OUT

478
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,501
AND SAY WE WERE MAKING A MOVIE.

479
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:25,100
WE DON'T HAVE
A CAMERA WITH ANY FILM.

480
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,501
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE HIPPIES

481
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,100
OR THAT WE WERE DRUG FREAKS.

482
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,868
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE
OCCURRED TO ANYBODY

483
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,367
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
IN THE NEWS YET.

484
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,434
SHUT UP!

485
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:46,701
HOW DID YOU GET MIXED
UP WITH LSD IN THE FIRST PLACE?

486
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,334
I CAME OUT OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON

487
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:52,033
THE PRETTIEST LITTLE BOY
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

488
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,234
I DIDN'T SMOKE.
I DIDN'T DRINK.

489
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:59,834
I WENT TO STANFORD ON
A FORD FOUNDATION FELLOWSHIP.

490
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:02,033
AND WHILE AT STANFORD,

491
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:05,501
I WAS...GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY

492
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,133
TO GO TO THE STANFORD HOSPITAL

493
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,167
AND TAKE PART
IN THE LSD EXPERIMENTS.

494
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,200
HOW DID YOU BECOME A
VOLUNTEER FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS?

495
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,634
I, AT THE TIME,
WAS TRAINING FOR

496
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:19,033
THE OLYMPICS TEAM
AND WAS --

497
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,968
AS A WRESTLER?
YEAH, AS A WRESTLER.

498
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:24,467
I'D NEVER BEEN DRUNK ON BEER,
LET ALONE DONE ANY DRUGS,

499
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:27,767
BUT THIS IS
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

500
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:32,567
THE STUDY OF LSD CONTINUES
IN LABORATORIES AND HOSPITALS

501
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,100
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

502
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,033
THEY PAID US $25 A DAY
TO COME DOWN THERE

503
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,400
AND THEN
THEY GAVE US STUFF.

504
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,033
WHAT IS LSD?

505
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,834
HOW DOES IT WORK?
WHEN DID IT ALL BEGIN?

506
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:49,868
IT ALL BEGAN IN A LABORATORY
VERY MUCH LIKE THIS ONE.

507
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:53,300
IN 1938, DR. ALBERT HOFFMAN
IN SWITZERLAND

508
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,334
WAS LOOKING FOR NEW DRUGS

509
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,601
IN THE TREATMENT
OF MIGRAINE HEADACHES.

510
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:15,300
HE HAD BEEN STUDYING MOLD
THAT GROWS ON RYE PLANTS.

511
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,400
NOW, IT TURNED OUT THAT THESE
SUBSTANCES WERE OF NO USE

512
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,300
IN THE TREATMENT
OF MIGRAINE HEADACHES.

513
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,200
HOWEVER, IT WAS FOUND THAT THESE
SUBSTANCES COULD PRODUCE

514
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,334
A CHANGE IN MENTAL STATE

515
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:29,734
CLOSELY RESEMBLING
SOME FORMS OF INSANITY --

516
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,300
IN PARTICULAR, SCHIZOPHRENIA.

517
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,234
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DO
THESE DRUG EXPERIMENTS,

518
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:40,000
I THOUGHT THESE DRUGS
MIGHT GIVE US A WAY

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,601
TO CURE INSANITY,
TO OVERCOME DEPRESSION.

520
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:48,234
THAT WAS PART OF WHAT
WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING.

521
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,367
WHAT KIND OF PREPARATION
WERE YOU GIVEN FOR IT?

522
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,267
WERE YOU GIVEN ANY?
NONE AT ALL.

523
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,300
I'D READ A LITTLE PIECE
IN <i>LIFE</i> MAGAZINE

524
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,267
ABOUT HOW THEY'D
GIVEN IT TO CATS,

525
00:27:56,267 --> 00:28:01,067
AND CATS WERE AFRAID OF MICE
ONCE THEY'D HAD LSD.

526
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,267
WHAT WAS THAT VERY FIRST
TRIP LIKE, THOUGH,

527
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,100
UNDER THE EXPERIMENTAL
CONDITIONS?

528
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,534
IT WAS ON A WARD,
ON A NUTHOUSE WARD.

529
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,234
YOU'D GO
IN A LITTLE ROOM.

530
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:13,767
THERE'D BE A BED AND A STAND
WITH SOME WATER ON IT

531
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:16,100
AND A TAPE RECORDER
AND NOTHING ELSE.

532
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,734
THERE WAS A LITTLE
WINDOW RIGHT HERE

533
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,067
WITH A WIRE THROUGH IT,

534
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,367
AND YOU COULD LOOK OUT
AND SEE THE PEOPLE

535
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,734
OUT IN THE OTHER ROOM.

536
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:25,033
AND WHEN I CAME OUT OF IT,

537
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:27,734
I FELT LIKE IT WAS LIKE
DISCOVERING A HOLE

538
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,000
THAT WENT INTO
THE CENTER OF THE EARTH

539
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,434
AND YOU COULD SEE
JEWELRY DOWN THERE

540
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:33,667
AND YOU WANTED YOUR PEOPLE
TO GO DOWN AND ENJOY IT.

541
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:40,033
* TRAILER FOR SALE OR RENT *

542
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:44,767
* ROOMS TO LET 50 CENTS *

543
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:47,601
* NO PHONE, NO POOL, NO PETS *

544
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,567
* AIN'T GOT NO CIGARETTES *

545
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:55,601
CASSADY DROVE ALL NIGHT, AND
EVERYBODY SLEPT OR DIDN'T SLEEP,

546
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,267
DEPENDING
ON WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

547
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,434
BUS SUPPOSED TO
HIT TO TUCSON, ARRIVED...

548
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:03,100
OH, THERE, YOU CAN'T --

549
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,868
JUST AS IT WERE --
POLICE, HOW YOU DOING?

550
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,000
* KING OF THE ROAD *

551
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,834
A BUNCH OF PREVIOUS PLANS '69 --
OH, ALL RIGHT, HONEST.

552
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,267
ESPECIALLY SOUTH.

553
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:13,601
IN 1964,

554
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:15,801
THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE
BARRY GOLDWATER

555
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,501
WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

556
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,834
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF KESEY'S
GOLDWATER STUNT IN PHOENIX?

557
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,767
I WAS KIND OF PUZZLED
BY THE NEED TO GET INTO

558
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:29,000
THE POLITICS OF BARRY GOLDWATER.

559
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,400
I KIND OF THOUGHT THE WHOLE
THING WAS SORT OF RIDICULOUS.

560
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,133
A VOTE FOR BARRY
IS A VOTE FOR FUN.

561
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,200
IT WAS
A TONGUE-IN-CHEEK THING.

562
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,167
WE WANTED TO WAVE THE FLAG,

563
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:45,234
BUT WAVING THE FLAG
IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX

564
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,968
KIND OF SEEMED LIKE
YOU'RE FOR GOLDWATER,

565
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:49,400
SO WE PAINTED "A VOTE
FOR BARRY IS A VOTE FOR FUN"

566
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,934
AND THEN DROVE DOWN
THE MAIN STREET OF PHOENIX.

567
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,400
BACKWARDS.

568
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,934
EVEN AS YOU WERE DRIVING THE BUS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

569
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,767
REVIEWS WERE COMING IN
FOR "SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION"

570
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,334
AND THEY WERE PECULIAR.

571
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:13,534
YES. THEY DIDN'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.

572
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,334
"CUCKOO'S NEST" WAS
A PHENOMENON.

573
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:18,868
IT RECEIVED NOTHING
BUT GOOD REVIEWS.

574
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,133
MOST PEOPLE ARE
SURPRISED TO LEARN

575
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,267
THAT YOU'D NEVER EVEN
SEEN THE MOVIE.

576
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,801
YOU EVEN THREATENED
TO SUE THE PRODUCERS.

577
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,801
I TOLD THESE LIARS,
"I'LL NEVER SEE THE MOVIE."

578
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:31,400
THEY EMPHASIZED
THE MELODRAMA.

579
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,501
WHO'S THE VILLAIN
IN "CUCKOO'S NEST"?

580
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,434
THE NURSE.
NO.

581
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:37,000
THE COMBINE
IS THE VILLAIN,

582
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,100
AND THE BIG NURSE
IS THE MINION OF THAT,

583
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,400
BUT SHE'S NOT
THE VILLAIN.

584
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,934
"I'M MOPPING NEAR THE WARD DOOR

WRITING THAT STORY FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW OF THAT INDIAN,

605

THAT'S WHAT MAKES THAT BOOK.

606

AND I DON'T KNOW ANY INDIANS.

607

I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THAT INDIAN CAME FROM.

608
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,567
THOSE FIRST FEW PAGES
OF "CUCKOO'S NEST"

609

WERE WRITTEN ON PEYOTE.

610
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:49,934
I'VE ALWAYS FELT HUMBLED
BY THAT CHARACTER.

611
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,801
WITHOUT THE CHARACTER
OF THAT INDIAN,

612
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:56,234
THE BOOK IS A MELODRAMA.

613
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:58,067
YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRAIGHT BATTLE

614
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:02,100
BETWEEN McMURPHY
AND THE BIG NURSE.

615
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,734
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT
THE INSPIRATION FOR THE BOOK

616
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:07,133
CAME FROM YOUR
REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES?

617
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,834
I GOT A JOB AT THE NUTHOUSE

618
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,734
AND WORKED
FROM MIDNIGHT TO 8:00.

619
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,100
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.

620
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,634
BEING CRAZY IS PAINFUL.

621
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,667
LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE LITTLE
WINDOW, THROUGH MY CRAZED EYES,

622
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,734
I SAW THAT THESE PEOPLE
HAVE SOMETHING GOING,

623
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:23,234
AND THERE'S A TRUTH TO IT.

624
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,100
IT GAVE ME AN EMPATHY.

625
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:33,534
THIS WAS, TO ME, SUPPOSED TO BE
A REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL.

626
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,567
IT WASN'T FREUDIAN,
MAN AGAINST WOMAN.

627
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,567
IT WAS MAN AGAINST MACHINE.

628
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:44,501
"I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND
BENT OVER AND TOOK THE LEVERS.

629
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,234
"I HEAVED MY LEGS UNDER ME

630
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:48,834
"AND FELT THE GRIND
OF WEIGHT AT MY FEET

631
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,667
"AND HEARD THE WIRES
AND CONNECTIONS

632
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,634
"TEARING OUT OF THE FLOOR.

633
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:55,467
"I WAS ABLE
TO GET AN ARM AROUND IT

634
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,200
"AND MY OTHER HAND UNDER IT

635
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,701
"AND LET THE MOMENTUM
CARRY THE PANEL

636
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:03,300
"THROUGH THE SCREEN
AND WINDOW WITH A RIPPING CRASH.

637
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,701
"I PUT MY HAND ON THE SILL
AND VAULTED OVER THE PANE.

638
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:18,067
"I RAN ACROSS THE GROUNDS.

639
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,067
"I FELT LIKE I WAS FLYING.

640
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:21,567
FREE."

641
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,167
BOY, IT WAS JUST HOT
ACROSS THAT DESERT.

642
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,767
AND BEING HOT AND WHAT WE'D DO,

643
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:44,701
WE'D JUST GO LOOK
FOR A COOL PLACE.

644
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:48,400
MERGING TRAFFIC,
MERGING TRAFFIC.

645
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,868
MERGING TRAFFIC.

646
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,701
YIELD, YIELD!

647
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:54,767
RIGHT OF WAY!

648
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:56,634
WE'D RIDDEN ALL NIGHT
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

649
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,767
AND I'D GONE TO SLEEP
IN ONE OF THE UPPER BUNKS,

650
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,133
AND MY PURSE HAD SLIPPED DOWN

651
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,100
BETWEEN THE BUNK
AND THE SIDE OF THE BUS

652
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,300
AND GONE OUT THE OPEN WINDOW.

653
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,701
IT HAD EVERYTHING IN IT.

654
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,133
HERE I WAS, PREGNANT, TRAVELING
WITH A BUNCH OF MAD MEN

655
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,567
AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DIME.

656
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:17,534
WATERMELONS, WATERMELONS,
WATERMELONS, WATERMELONS!

657
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:20,601
IF I'D HAD MY MONEY, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE BOTHERED ME AT ALL,

658
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:23,100
BECAUSE I COULD HAVE
WALKED OFF AT ANY STAGE.

659
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,300
I COULD HAVE GONE TO
THE NEAREST BUS AT ANY TIME.

660
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,100
NOW I WAS TRAPPED.

661
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,801
SUDDENLY, CASSADY
DROVE RIGHT OFF THE ROAD

662
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:36,033
AND STARTED DRIVING
TOWARDS THIS LITTLE POND

663
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:37,901
AND GOT STUCK RIGHT IN THE SAND.

664
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,100
HE DROVE IT -- "VROOM!"

665
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,701
AND THERE WE WERE,
SHOCKED AS CAN BE.

666
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:48,634
AH, YES, STUCK.

667
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:52,300
STUCK IN THE MUD IN ARIZONA
DESERT IN THE SUMMERTIME.

668
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,200
CASSADY --
GOD, HE WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

669
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,501
IT WAS HOT, BOY.
LET ME TELL YOU, IT WAS HOT.

670
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,501
IT WAS BLAZING HOT --
THERE I AM.

671
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:01,601
THAT'S ME, AND THERE'S KESEY

672
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,267
RIGHT BEHIND ME
IN THE SUNGLASSES.

673
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:06,501
AND WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT IT,
AND WE'RE STUCK DEEP IN THE MUD.

674
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:13,167
FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN THE FACT THAT...

675
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,934
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT,
GET OUT.

676
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:16,367
HEY!

677
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,501
KESEY HAD SENT SOMEONE
OFF ON THE MOTORCYCLE

678
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:20,968
TO GO LOOK FOR HELP.

679
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,234
AND THEN KESEY HAD
THIS BRAINSTORM THAT,

680
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:25,400
SINCE WE WERE GONNA BE
STUCK FOR A WHILE,

681
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,501
WE SHOULD TAKE LSD.

682
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,567
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME LSD.

683
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,834
I WANT BABBS
TO TAKE SOME.

684
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,467
CASSADY,
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE SOME?

685
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,334
I WOULD.
YES, I WOULD.

686
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,267
THE RIDICULOUS THING
WAS THAT THE ACID

687
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,601
WAS JUST MIXED
INTO A JAR OF ORANGE JUICE

688
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,133
THAT WAS IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

689
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:45,567
NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA
WHAT THE DOSAGE WAS,

690
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,367
IT WAS THIS SORT OF DEAL
WHERE YOU SHOOK UP THE JAR

691
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,567
AND PASSED IT
AROUND AND TOOK A SWIG.

692
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:54,167
AS THE ACID CAME ON,
THE SETTING UP OF THE FILMING

693
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,801
WAS STARTING TO HAPPEN, TOO.

694
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,968
WHAT ELSE WE GOT UP THERE?
ANOTHER CAMERA, DON'T WE?

695
00:39:57,968 --> 00:40:03,234
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE ARRIFLEX, TWO MAGAZINES.

696
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,267
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ONE MAGAZINE ON THE ARRIFLEX.

697
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:09,934
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE OTHER
CAMERA WITH THE ZOOM LENS

698
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:12,868
ALSO MOUNTED ON A TRIPOD.

699
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,634
WE'RE GONNA RUN THE ZOOM LENS
ON THE TRIPOD.

700
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:19,634
WAS HE FILMING THAT?

701
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:25,334
THAT'D BE UNGODLY.

702
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:26,701
MY MERRY BAND
OF PRANKSTERS

703
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,868
WON'T BE WANDERING AROUND
IN THE DIRT.

704
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:30,000
COME ON, COME ON.

705
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,567
NO, NO,
NONE OF THIS MISERY STUFF.

706
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,601
COME ON, THIS IS
THE MERRY GANG.

707
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,767
KEEP IT MOVING.

708
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:41,133
THAT'S STRETCHIN' GRETCHEN,
SHE'S MIGHTY FETCHIN'!

709
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:45,434
ALWAYS SCRATCHING THE KITCHEN
MATCHES AND NEVER ITCHING!

710
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:46,934
THERE SHE IS OUT THERE.

711
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,734
* YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE A DREAM *

712
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:53,834
* WHERE WHALES
CARRY YOU OUT TO SEA *

713
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:58,634
ONCE I HIT THE POND,
I REALIZED I WAS REALLY HIGH.

714
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:03,801
* THE LITTLE CREATURES
HAD THEIR LITTLE WINGS *

715
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:07,601
THE WATER OPENED ITSELF UP TO ME
IN A NEW DIMENSION.

716
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,501
THERE WAS NO MURKINESS,

717
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,901
IT WAS SUPER CLEAR,
REAL CRYSTAL.

718
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,567
IT WAS JUST THERE,

719
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,567
FOR MYSELF AND ITSELF
TO GROOVE ON EACH OTHER.

720
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,434
* IF THE BIRDS
FLY IN THE OCEAN *

721
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,267
* AND THE WHALES SWIM
IN THE CLOUDS *

722
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,300
IT WAS A JOY.

723
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,634
FAREWELL FOREVER, PAULA.

724
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:29,467
AS SHE SINKS BENEATH THE DEPTHS.

725
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:34,667
IN THE NEXT FEATURE, YOU SHALL
SEE EMERGE A SLIME QUEEN.

726
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:38,200
THE HIGH PRIESTESS
OF PRANKSTERS.

727
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,901
THAT'S THE SLIME, THE ALGAE.

728
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,767
IT WAS TALKING TO ME,

729
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:48,567
IT WAS WELCOMING ME
INTO ITS REALM OF EXISTENCE.

730
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,667
* WHERE THE SUNRISE SETS *

731
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,634
* AND THE SUNSET RISES *

732
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,501
IT WAS LIKE THE NATURE SPIRITS,

733
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,701
THE STUFF IN THERE,
IT WAS SAYING,

734
00:41:56,701 --> 00:42:00,167
"FINALLY WE'RE
IN CONTACT WITH A HUMAN BEING,

735
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:04,033
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THROUGH
TO YOU GUYS FOR A WHILE."

736
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,534
THEY WERE HAPPY,
AND I WAS HAPPY.

737
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,901
* WHALES WANT TO
LOVE YOUR FACE *

738
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:13,434
* WHALES WANT TO BE
YOUR FRIEND *

739
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:17,033
* WHALES WANT TO HUG YOU *

740
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:20,334
THAT'S MISS SLIME OF 1964.

741
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,868
* CARRY OUR SOULS *

742
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:33,501
* THROUGH THE CLOUDS *

743
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:38,567
* IN THE SKY *

744
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:42,834
THESE HORSES JUST SHOWED UP

745
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:46,734
AND ADDED SUCH A NICE
KIND OF BACKDROP EFFECT.

746
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,667
OH, THERE ARE THE HORSES.

747
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,267
IT WAS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL.

748
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:54,467
I DON'T REMEMBER
MUCH REACTION TO THESE HORSES.

749
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:57,834
TO ME, THEY LOOKED
KIND OF OLD AND FLEA-BITTEN.

750
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:05,267
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HOW NICE IT WOULD LOOK

751
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:08,067
TO POUR SOME OF THOSE PAINTS --
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

752
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:10,534
AFTER WE TOOK THE ACID,
I THINK IT WAS KESEY'S IDEA,

753
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,868
WE TOOK BOTTLES OF DOPE PAINT,

754
00:43:12,868 --> 00:43:15,400
WHICH ARE USED FOR
PAINTING MODEL AIRPLANES,

755
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,300
AND IT'S ENAMEL-BASED PAINT,

756
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,067
SO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE WATER,
IT FLOATS.

757
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,133
I'LL NEVER DRINK
DOWNSTREAM

758
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:25,200
FROM THE MERRY PRANKSTERS'
CAMPSITE.

759
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,534
SO, WE HAD LOTS OF COLORS,

760
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:31,234
SO WE WERE DIPPING
THE COLORS IN THERE

761
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,901
AND WATCHING IT ALL MARBLEIZE.

762
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:35,734
WE TOOK ZONKER'S WHITE T-SHIRT

763
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:40,601
AND PUT IT IN THE WATER WITH
THE PAINT AND INVENTED TIE-DYE.

764
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,300
GOD, I WAS PISSED.

765
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,634
THEY SAID, "OH,
IT'S WATER-SOLUBLE.

766
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:47,100
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MAN."

767
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,167
"WORRY ABOUT WHAT? THAT'S
ONE OF MY CLEAN T-SHIRTS."

768
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,901
"FUCK YOUR CLEAN T-SHIRTS,"
SOMEBODY SAID.

769
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:55,634
GEORGE SAID, "BACK UP,"
JUST LIKE I DO.

770
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,234
"SPIN AROUND."

771
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,934
FUCK YOU.

772
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:01,067
GOD, WATCH THIS THING.

773
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:02,734
ACTUALLY, I WAS
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

774
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:10,367
STARK NAKED
REALLY STARTED WIGGING OUT.

775
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,968
SHE'S DEFINITELY STONED ON ACID.

776
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:16,267
WE PUT ALL OUR ACID IN
ONE-QUART BALL JAR OF LEMONADE

777
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,834
AND I REMEMBER SEEING HER
RUN DOWN TO THE REFRIGERATOR

778
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:21,634
AND GET IT OUT AND UPEND IT.

779
00:44:21,634 --> 00:44:24,167
GET A PICTURE OF THAT
OVER HERE, MIKE, WITH THE...

780
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,767
GET THAT.

781
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,734
KATHY WAS LOADED.

782
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,701
HAGEN SAYS, "I'M GONNA MAKE
A MOVIE STAR OUT OF HER

783
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,067
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES."

784
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:34,901
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE PRETTY GIRL,
MOVIE-STAR TRIP.

785
00:44:34,901 --> 00:44:36,567
THE GUY WITH THE CAMERA
COMES ALONG AND SAYS,

786
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:37,767
"HEY, PRETTY GIRL,
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO

787
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:39,133
STAND IN FRONT OF MY CAMERA?"

788
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,234
"SURE, WHY NOT?
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME A STAR."

789
00:44:41,234 --> 00:44:44,968
JUDY GARLAND IN THE DRUGSTORE,
WHATEVER THAT TRIP IS, YOU KNOW.

790
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:48,501
HEY,
HERE'S THE PAINT.

791
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:49,901
NO, NO,
TWO MORE OF THESE,

792
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:52,534
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE
TO START USING FILM.

793
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:57,434
THE FIRST SIGNS OF STRAIN
WERE BEGINNING TO SHOW

794
00:44:57,434 --> 00:44:59,801
ON SOME OF THE HEALTHY,
YOUNG FACES.

795
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:02,200
AND I WAS TRYING TO KEEP
THINGS TOGETHER THERE,

796
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,300
BECAUSE I COULD SUDDENLY SEE
EVERYTHING COMING TO PIECES.

797
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,267
THERE WAS THIS
MAD WOMAN ON MY HANDS.

798
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:09,434
WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO?

799
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,200
THROUGHOUT THE BUS TRIP

800
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,734
YOU SEEMED TO ENJOY THE CHAOS

801
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:18,501
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,
GENTLY GUIDE THE ACTION.

802
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:22,300
PEOPLE FELT
THAT ENLIGHTENMENT

803
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,133
WAS GOING ENTIRELY
WITH THE FLOW.

804
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,367
BUT THAT'S LIKE BEING
THE BALL IN A FOOTBALL GAME.

805
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:29,801
I'D RATHER BE THE QUARTERBACK.

806
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,567
I WANT TO HANDLE THE BALL.

807
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:34,734
I DON'T WANT TO
JUST BE THROWN AROUND.

808
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:40,501
KEN WAS TRYING TO RUN THIS WHOLE
THING AND BE ALL PHILOSOPHICAL,

809
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,501
AND HE WAS CAUGHT UP
IN A MILLION DIFFERENT TRIPS.

810
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:47,901
* AND HOW LONG
WILL IT GO ON? *

811
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,033
* HOW LONG CAN WE WAIT
FOR HELP? *

812
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,000
* WHEN NO HELP
IS COMING FOR... *

813
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,734
IT REMINDS ME OF MAD OPHELIA.

814
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:57,133
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS AT ALL.

815
00:45:57,133 --> 00:46:02,167
I REMEMBER SWIMMING IN THE LAKE,
BUT NONE OF THIS.

816
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:08,234
FOR STARK, OBVIOUSLY,
IT WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR.

817
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:12,067
FOR GRETCH AND BABBS,
THEY FELL IN LOVE.

818
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,567
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
PLAY MY FEET?

819
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,901
STARTING THE BUS TRIP,
I WAS KESEY'S LOVER,

820
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,200
BUT AFTER I MET BABBS,

821
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,334
HE AND I BECAME LOVERS
AND STAYED SO.

822
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:25,367
I WISH
I COULD ALWAYS...

823
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,133
OKAY!

824
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:30,501
THE CAMERA'S
FUCKED UP AGAIN.

825
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,601
HEY, HEY!

826
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:33,901
THE TRACTOR HAS INDEED ARRIVED,

827
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:36,634
THEY'RE GOING TO PULL US OUT
OF THIS SWAMP.

828
00:46:36,634 --> 00:46:38,601
SANDY'S THERE,
SCRATCHING HIS BALLS.

829
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:41,434
OKAY, LET'S GO!

830
00:46:41,434 --> 00:46:42,501
COME ON!

831
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:44,400
COME ON, FASTER!

832
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,834
WHOA!

833
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,801
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

834
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,100
TRY TO REVERSE THAT.

835
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,634
I THINK YOU'RE PULLING
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

836
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,434
WE'RE GOING!
OHH!

837
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:03,300
KEEP HER MOVING,
KEEP HER MOVING!

838
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,133
KEEP HER MOVING,
KEEP HER MOVING!

839
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:09,901
SHE AND BABBS HAD
DEVELOPED A GREAT AFFAIR

840
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:12,067
SINCE ROMEO AND JULIET.

841
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:16,567
* I GOT MY MOJO WORKING, BABE *

842
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,300
* AND I'M GOING TO
TRY IT ON YOU *

843
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,167
THE LOVE RELATIONSHIPS WAS ONE
OF THE VERY OBVIOUS THINGS

844
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,567
THAT WAS GOING ON.

845
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:27,767
I MEAN, NOTHING WAS HIDDEN,
YOU KNOW?

846
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:30,901
* AND I'M GONNA
TRY IT OUT ON YOU *

847
00:47:30,901 --> 00:47:32,367
BABBS WAS REALLY WORRIED

848
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,100
THAT KESEY
WOULD BE REALLY PISSED OFF,

849
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,767
BECAUSE KESEY WAS SINGLE,
BECAUSE HIS WIFE WASN'T THERE,

850
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,367
SO HE WAS UNATTACHED,
SEXUALLY.

851
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:42,667
* NOW I'M GONNA TRY IT ON YOU *

852
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:43,968
* OH YEAH *

853
00:47:43,968 --> 00:47:45,067
HE DID SULK FOR A WHILE,

854
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,734
BUT HE KIND OF
WOKE UP OUT OF HIS STUPOR

855
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:49,701
AND LOOKED OVER AND SAID,
"NOTHING LASTS."

856
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,234
SO THAT BECAME ONE OF
THE PRANKSTER MOTTOS, TOO --

857
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:55,501
"NOTHING LASTS."

858
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,334
ALL THIS STUFF
THAT WE WENT THROUGH,

859
00:47:57,334 --> 00:48:00,234
ALL THESE "INTERTANGLEMENTS"
OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS,

860
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:02,868
OUR MARRIAGES,
AND OUR LOVES AND LOVERS,

861
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:07,200
I THINK ALL OF THIS
IS SOAP OPERA 101.

862
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,634
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL
IN THIS CLASS TOGETHER

863
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:15,901
AND WE WENT THROUGH IT
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS ON THE BUS.

864
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:19,467
STARK NAKED NEVER
QUITE RECOVERED FROM WIKIEUP.

865
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:21,400
ALL HER MOLECULES,
I DON'T THINK,

866
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,300
CAME BACK TOGETHER.

867
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,567
THEN SHE CLIMBS OUT ONTO
THE PLATFORM IN THE BACK

868
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:29,300
AND PRETTY SOON ALL THE TRUCKERS
WERE HONKING BEHIND US --

869
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,300
HONK, HONK, HONK, HONK.

870
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,300
AND CASSADY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

871
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,334
SO SOMEBODY
LOOKED OUT THE BACK WINDOW,

872
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:40,234
AND THERE SHE HAD TAKEN
THE BLANKET OFF HER

873
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:43,701
AND SHE WAS JUST
STANDING OUT ON THE BACK DECK

874
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:45,534
JUST FLAUNTING HERSELF.

875
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:49,567
SHE HAD ALL THE SEMIS HEADING
FOR HOUSTON BACKED UP BEHIND US.

876
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:54,934
NOBODY WANTED TO PASS US BECAUSE
THEY WERE ALL WATCHING HER.

877
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,167
THAT KIND OF MADNESS IS
ONLY TERRIFYING AND MISERABLE

878
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:07,767
TO THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF IT.

879
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,834
TO SOMEONE WHO'S <i>INSIDE</i> OF IT,
IT'S REALLY NOT.

880
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:13,334
I JUST WANTED TO GO
INTO THE DARKNESS

881
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:15,767
AND BE ALONE
WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.

882
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:37,267
I THINK MY PSYCHIC VISION
IN RELATIONSHIP TO MYSELF

883
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:40,434
WAS THAT I WAS GETTING
A LITTLE BIT HOMESICK.

884
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:43,901
THEN, NOT LONG AFTER THAT, WE
PULLED INTO LARRY McMURTRY'S,

885
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,667
WHICH WAS KIND OF A NICE,
MIDDLE-CLASS,

886
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,467
VERY TIDY NEIGHBORHOOD.

887
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:51,000
LARRY LIVES IN THIS
UPPER-UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS

888
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,734
COLLEGIATE SECTION OF TOWN,

889
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:57,467
AND THIS ELECTRIC, MULTICOLORED
CIRCUS BUS SHOWS UP.

890
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:00,000
LARRY APPEARED AT THE BUS
WITH A LITTLE CHILD,

891
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,067
AND IT REMINDED ME
OF MY DAUGHTER.

892
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:03,501
I JUMPED OFF THE BUS

893
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,634
AND, I GUESS, MUCH TO HIS
AMAZEMENT, GRABBED THE BABY.

894
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:08,968
AND SHE OPENS HER ARMS WIDE,

895
00:50:08,968 --> 00:50:12,234
AND THE BLANKET THAT SHE HAD
WRAPPED AROUND HER DROPPED.

896
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:15,601
AND SHE'S
STANDING THERE STARK NAKED.

897
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:18,834
I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED JUST FINE,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

898
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:20,300
I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

899
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,100
A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM
FOR LARRY McMURTRY,

900
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,901
AS FAR AS HIS NEIGHBORS
WERE CONCERNED.

901
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:30,400
THINGS JUST KIND OF CONTINUED
TO GO DOWNHILL FROM THEN ON.

902
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,767
I GUESS I WAS GOING THROUGH
A THING WITH MICHAEL HAGEN.

903
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,400
AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HIS ATTENTION

904
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,334
THAT HE PAID TO OTHER WOMEN
THAT DISTURBED ME.

905
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,868
IT MUST'VE BEEN ABOUT 2:00
OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

906
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:42,367
I COULDN'T SLEEP,

907
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:45,133
AND I JUST FELT LIKE
KIND OF WALKING IT OFF.

908
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:47,400
I WAS IN A BAD MOOD, ACTUALLY,

909
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,133
AND I WENT OUT IN MY BARE FEET.

910
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,701
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS?

911
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:19,667
DO MY FRIENDS KNOW I'M HERE?

912
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,734
THEY HELD ME IN A CELL
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

913
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:23,801
THEN THEY HAD SOMEONE
COME TO TALK TO ME.

914
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:27,334
BY THIS TIME,
I WAS JUST A COMPLETE WRECK.

915
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,601
WHERE AM I?

916
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:30,100
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

917
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,534
PEOPLE WERE ASKING ME
A LOT OF STRANGE QUESTIONS,

918
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:34,167
AND I JUST DIDN'T
ANSWER ANY OF THEM --

919
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:38,100
EXCEPT I THINK I GAVE THEM
MY NAME, AND THAT WAS ALL.

920
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,901
NAME, RANK AND SERIAL NUMBER,
SO TO SPEAK.

921
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:43,000
RIGHT AROUND HERE
TO THE DESK.

922
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

923
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,567
HELLO, I'M A NURSE.

924
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,534
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

925
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,701
WHAT HAPPENED TO STARK NAKED?

926
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,367
ONE OF HER FRIENDS
IN SAN FRANCISCO CAME OUT

927
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:55,167
AND GOT HER, AND SHE ENDED UP
GOING BACK HOME WITH HIM,

928
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:59,267
AND THAT WAS AS FAR
AS SHE GOT ON THE TRIP.

929
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:02,367
HURRY UP, HURRY UP, WE'LL GET
THERE IN THE NICK OF TIME.

930
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,801
HURRY UP, HURRY UP,
HURRY UP,

931
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,567
WE'LL GET THERE
IN THE NICK OF TIME.

932
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:06,834
WE SORT OF ABANDONED HER.

933
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,968
WE FIGURED ANYBODY THAT COULDN'T
HOLD THEIR SHIT TOGETHER

934
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:11,501
JUST WASN'T
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

935
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,367
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A TRIP TO DO,
WE HAD TO KEEP MOVING.

936
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,834
AND IT ALSO
MADE ME NERVOUS, THINKING,

937
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:17,634
"WHO'S GONNA BE
LEFT BEHIND NEXT?

938
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,367
IS IT GONNA BE ME?"

939
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:26,400
WEREN'T YOU CONCERNED THAT THIS
TRIP WAS BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL?

940
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,601
I'LL TELL YOU
A THING THAT I LEARNED

941
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,434
WHILE I WAS WORKING
IN THE ASYLUM

942
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:32,534
THAT I THINK
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

943
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:33,934
I'VE EVER LEARNED.

944
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,167
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
ALL THE POWER,

945
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,801
THE ATTENTION THAT YOU HAVE

946
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:40,200
COMES TO BEAR ON
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING

947
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,000
AND DOESN'T DECIDE
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD,

948
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,334
JUST DECIDES THAT IT <i>IS,</i>

949
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:49,767
AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO
IS ENJOY THE RIDE.

950
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:53,434
* HE'S COMING IN
TO NEW ORLEANS *

951
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:57,067
* WHEN THE SAINTS
GO MARCHING... *

952
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:58,734
* IN *

953
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,968
WELL, CASSADY
WANTED TO SHOW US NEW ORLEANS

954
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,501
BECAUSE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH IT,

955
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:28,801
AND HE WAS SO EXCITED
TO BE IN NEW ORLEANS.

956
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:32,934
IT WAS A BIG, BIG DEAL.

957
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:36,701
HE HAD HIS FAVORITE HAUNTS.
HE WAS KIND OF A TOUR GUIDE.

958
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:49,567
WE WENT DOWN TO THE HEART
OF THE JAZZ DISTRICT.

959
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:52,334
CASSADY WAS
A BIG JAZZ AFICIONADO.

960
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:54,234
HE LOVED JAZZ.

961
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,801
AH, THE OLD ABSINTHE BAR.

962
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:57,234
THE OLD ABSINTHE BAR.

963
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,400
I REMEMBER THAT
I WAS THERE ONCE.

964
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,634
I WAS THERE ONCE.

965
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:03,567
...WARM, 11:00 IN THE MORNING
ON CANAL STREET

966
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:05,200
IN NEW ORLEANS.

967
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,467
IT'S THIS FEELING OF EVERYTHING
MOVING SLOWER AND SLOWER...

968
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:12,167
SLOWER AND SLOWER,

969
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:16,167
CAUGHT IN SOME KIND OF
MOLASSES MIND WARP, WE WERE.

970
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,534
THAT WAS WHERE
WE STARTED TO DRINK MINT JULEPS.

971
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:23,367
I THINK WE WENT
DOWN IN A BASEMENT, TOO.

972
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:28,100
WE SAW -- SOMEBODY HAD
JUST MOVED INTO THE OTHER ROOM.

973
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,968
THERE WAS A PIANO.

974
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:34,300
AND HE WENT IN THERE AND SAT
DOWN, AND HE STARTED TO PLAY.

975
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,033
* MY BABY LEFT ME *

976
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:48,801
* MY BABY LEFT ME
A LONG TIME AGO *

977
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,934
I KNOW KESEY
WAS JUST CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

978
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:52,234
GOD, HE'D COME OVER
AND HE'D SAY,

979
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:55,868
"WOW, THIS GUY IS GREAT!"

980
00:54:55,868 --> 00:54:58,801
HE WANTED TO TAKE HIM WITH US
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

981
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:05,634
* ...WALKED OUT THE DOOR *

982
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:07,634
AIR'S STILL THICK
WITH DUST MOTES

983
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:09,634
SWIRLING AND FOLLOWING US
OUT THE DOOR

984
00:55:09,634 --> 00:55:12,701
AND UP AND INTO --
ONTO THE BUS, AND THERE WE WENT,

985
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:15,167
"MOONLIGHT SINATRA"
BOARDING WITH US.

986
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,634
AND WE REALIZED WE GOT TO
DIP THIS SUCKER IN THE WATER

987
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:19,467
BEFORE HE GOES OFF.

988
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,501
SO WE SAID, "WE'RE GONNA FIND
SOME WATER," AND HE SAYS,

989
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:23,701
"GO TO LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN."

990
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:27,667
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS.
HE'D JUST HEARD ABOUT IT.

991
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:34,234
* LEAD *

992
00:55:34,234 --> 00:55:37,467
* LEAD *

993
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:41,968
* LEAD ME ON *

994
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:49,434
* TO THE LIGHT *

995
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:52,267
YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE
'60s AND WHAT STARTED THERE.

996
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:54,167
MUSIC WAS CHANGED FOREVER.

997
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,667
THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT
STARTED THERE,

998
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,400
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

999
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,334
WHILE WE WERE DRIVING THAT BUS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

1000
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,434
MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS IN SELMA.

1001
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:06,200
EITHER YOU GIVE THE NEGRO
HIS GOD-GIVEN RIGHT

1002
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,400
AND HIS FREEDOM,

1003
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,033
OR YOU FACE THE FACT

1004
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:16,067
OF CONTINUAL SOCIAL DISRUPTION
AND SOCIAL CHAOS.

1005
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:18,901
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,
THIS IS 1964,

1006
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,968
AND IT'S RIGHT WHEN
THE CIVIL RIGHTS THING

1007
00:56:20,968 --> 00:56:23,000
WAS IN A VERY EARLY INFANCY,

1008
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,767
SO WHITE-ONLY,
BLACK-ONLY CONSCIOUSNESS

1009
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:30,033
WAS STILL REALLY PREVALENT
IN THE SOUTH.

1010
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,534
AND THE STORY ABOUT
LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN WAS THAT

1011
00:56:32,534 --> 00:56:35,901
WE'D PULLED INTO
A BLACK-ONLY AREA, THE LAKE.

1012
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:37,868
OF COURSE, THE PRANKSTERS
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1013
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:39,434
THEY JUST PULLED UP TO THIS LAKE

1014
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:44,200
BECAUSE THEY SAW IT
AND WANTED TO GO SWIMMING.

1015
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,934
WE GOT OUT --
I'M LOADED ON ACID, RIGHT?

1016
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:51,534
OKAY, AND ALL THESE OTHER GUYS
ARE LOADED ON ACID.

1017
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:53,701
OKAY, HERE WE ARE.

1018
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,234
I THINK I DON'T NOTICE
THAT ANYTHING IS ODD,

1019
00:56:56,234 --> 00:56:59,200
EVEN AT THIS POINT.

1020
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,334
AS WE'RE SWIMMING AROUND
ON THIS HOT, HOT, HUMID

1021
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:06,834
FIRST-DAY-OF-SUMMER
LOUISIANA DAY,

1022
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:09,033
I REMEMBER LOOKING AROUND
THE SWIMMING HOLE

1023
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:13,400
THAT WE'D ALL JUST
PRACTICALLY RAN AND JUMPED INTO.

1024
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,234
I THOUGHT, "GOD, THERE'S A LOT
OF COLORED PEOPLE HERE,

1025
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,100
"AND THERE'S NOT
VERY MANY WHITE PEOPLE.

1026
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,767
WELL, THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S
ONE AND THERE'S ONE..."

1027
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:21,968
AND I LOOKED AROUND,

1028
00:57:21,968 --> 00:57:24,000
AND I HAD THIS
SUDDEN REALIZATION

1029
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,734
THAT I KNEW EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THE WHITE PEOPLE

1030
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,901
IN THAT SWIMMING HOLE.

1031
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:29,567
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME.

1032
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:33,634
"SHIT, WE JUST
INTEGRATED THIS PLACE."

1033
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:35,367
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

1034
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:39,767
THIS WAVE OF PARANOIA
WENT THROUGH US ALL.

1035
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,767
TALK ABOUT BEING IN THE
WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.

1036
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:47,200
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
COULD HAVE STARTED A RACE RIOT.

1037
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:50,534
I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD WAS SAID.

1038
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:54,968
WE ALL JUST GRABBED EVERYTHING,
JUMPED ON THE BUS, AND LEFT.

1039
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,167
BABBS JUST FELL DOWN IN
THE YARD IN PENSACOLA, FLORIDA.

1040
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,234
WE WENT TO THIS PLACE
WHERE HIS OLD ROOMMATES

1041
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:21,667
STILL LIVED IN PENSACOLA,

1042
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,334
WHERE THEY'D BEEN
MARINES TOGETHER.

1043
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,300
WE ARRIVED, AND BABBS'
MARINE BUDDY WAS STILL AT WORK,

1044
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,000
AND SO KESEY HAD
THE IDEA OF MAKING

1045
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,567
A LITTLE THEATRICAL THING
TO FILM.

1046
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:37,467
THE SLIME QUEEN
WILL LEAD THE WAY!

1047
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:48,133
OH, THIS IS FUNNY.

1048
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:50,167
I REMEMBER THIS REALLY WELL.

1049
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,434
I CONSIDER THIS TO BE ONE
OF THE MOST FUCKED-UP DAYS

1050
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:54,868
ON THE WHOLE TRIP.

1051
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,300
BEING PREGNANT, I WAS MISERABLE.

1052
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,601
IT WAS JUST REALLY HOT,

1053
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,234
AND THERE WAS NO REASON
TO BE THERE,

1054
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:03,734
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO DO,
SO WE DID THIS.

1055
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:05,367
I WAS TRYING TO BE COOPERATIVE,

1056
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:10,300
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT
REALLY HAD NOTHING GOING FOR ME.

1057
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,400
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF ABSURD DANCE, AS I RECALL.

1058
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,868
I ENJOYED IT.

1059
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:19,634
I JUST WISH I COULD'VE PLAYED
THE TROMBONE BETTER.

1060
00:59:19,634 --> 00:59:21,267
PLAYING THOSE INSTRUMENTS.

1061
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:22,701
GOD DAMN IT.

1062
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,133
SOMEBODY STARTS PLAYING THE
SAXOPHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1063
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:28,501
WELL, THEY WANT IT TO SOUND
LIKE JOHN COLTRANE.

1064
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:31,000
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GONNA
SOUND LIKE JOHN COLTRANE.

1065
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,100
THAT'S WHAT MADE ME SO MAD.

1066
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,801
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD
JUST BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO.

1067
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:39,133
BUT YOU DON'T.
IT TAKES PRACTICE.

1068
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:47,968
HERE'S BABBS' FRIEND
FROM VIETNAM WHO ROLLS IN.

1069
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,634
AH, PLEASED
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

1070
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:55,133
YES, INDEED,
IT'S BEEN QUITE SOME TIME.

1071
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,634
YES, IT'S A LITTLE
STRANGE SINCE THE CORPS,

1072
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,200
DON'T YOU THINK?
UH-HUH.

1073
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,667
I'VE CHANGED MY UNIFORM
SLIGHTLY.

1074
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:05,200
AND THIS IS
MY NEW BATTALION.

1075
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,067
YES, QUITE.

1076
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:10,667
YEAH, WE'VE GIVEN UP
HELICOPTERS.

1077
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:12,968
MOST OF THESE GUYS
CAN ONLY FLY AT NIGHT.

1078
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:15,100
SO WE'VE GIVEN UP HELICOPTERS
AND WE NOW TRAVEL BY BUS.

1079
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,634
IT'S SLOWER
BUT MORE DELIBERATE.

1080
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:25,133
WE MUST PRESS ONWARD
AT ALL FORWARD SPEED, FAST.

1081
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:28,167
AHEAD FAST LAKE.

1082
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:31,000
TENNIS ANYONE?
TENNIS?

1083
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,934
OHH!

1084
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:34,601
WHERE IN THE HELL
ARE WE?

1085
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:36,567
WELL, NOW,
JOHN, JOHN BABBS.

1086
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:40,534
JOHN BABBS BECAME KIND OF
THE SEMI-QUASI NAVIGATOR,

1087
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:42,334
AND BECAME KNOWN
AS "SOMETIMES MISSING,"

1088
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,167
BECAUSE ONE TIME WHEN HE WAS
MAPPING US THROUGH ONE TOWN,

1089
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,601
WE WENT THROUGH ANOTHER,

1090
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,534
AND WHEN EVERYBODY GOT OFF
THE BUS TO TAKE A LEAK

1091
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:51,200
AND WENT ON AGAIN,
HE WASN'T THERE,

1092
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,601
AND NOBODY NOTICED IT
TILL ABOUT 100 MILES LATER.

1093
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:56,601
BUT THEN, AS WE TURNED AROUND
TO GO PICK HIM UP,

1094
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,133
HERE CAME A CAR
AND HE JUMPED OUT.

1095
01:00:58,133 --> 01:01:00,267
HE HAD HITCHHIKED
AND CAUGHT UP WITH US.

1096
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:03,601
JOHN BABBS WAS IN THE BACKSEAT
WAVING HIS ARMS LIKE THIS

1097
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:05,200
AND TRYING TO GET OUR ATTENTION.

1098
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,133
SO WE PULLED OVER
AND PICKED HIM UP.

1099
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:13,200
THAT'S HOW HE GOT THE NAME
"SOMETIMES MISSING."

1100
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,901
* WELL *

1101
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:19,834
* YOU KNOW YOU TOOK MY HEART *

1102
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:22,000
WELCOME TO NEW JERSEY.

1103
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,801
SPEED 50.

1104
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:26,434
NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE.

1105
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,067
* YEAH, YEAH *

1106
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:40,734
IN A WAY, CASSADY SAW HIMSELF

1107
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:43,400
AS A GUARDIAN OF THAT TRIP,
AND HE WAS.

1108
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,834
HE WAS DRIVING, BUT HE WAS NOT
MASTERMINDING THE SITUATION.

1109
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,834
THAT WAS KESEY'S TRIP.

1110
01:01:58,267 --> 01:02:00,200
PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM
ALL THE TIME,

1111
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,100
EGGING HIM ON TO GREATER
HEIGHTS OF SELF-INDULGENCE.

1112
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,667
AND HE ALWAYS DID IT,

1113
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:09,234
HE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE
MORE OF THIS HERO

1114
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:15,000
THAT WAS THIS SELF-INDULGENT,
"ON THE ROAD," EPIC LEGEND.

1115
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,234
YES, SIR.

1116
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:21,267
LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION.

1117
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:22,801
OF COURSE!

1118
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:24,033
WHERE YOU HEADING?

1119
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:25,834
I THINK IT'S
MADISON AVENUE.

1120
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:28,000
WE ALL LEARNED
A GREAT DEAL FROM NEAL CASSADY.

1121
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,834
THIS IS A GUY
THAT KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING,

1122
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,100
AND THIS IS HIS MEDIUM.

1123
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,033
IT'S WORDS, IT'S CARS,
AND IT'S DRUGS.

1124
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,734
YES, SIR,
AND THAT'S WHY --
BACK ON THE BUS.

1125
01:02:38,734 --> 01:02:41,100
EVERYBODY
GET BACK ON THE BUS!

1126
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,868
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANYBODY OUT HERE.

1127
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:45,000
WE COULD ALL DO MAKING NOISE,
HITTING STICKS TOGETHER,

1128
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,667
BUT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE MOST
ADVANCED OF INSTRUMENTS,

1129
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,567
WHICH IS OUR MIND AND OUR VOICE.

1130
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:54,167
CASSADY COULD DO IT BETTER
THAN ANYBODY, USING WORDS.

1131
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:08,067
* LOVE POTION NUMBER 9 *

1132
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,000
HE WAS LIKE A BUS DRIVER
COMING INTO HIS LAND.

1133
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,667
YOU KNOW, HE'D SPENT A LOT
OF TIME IN THE EAST.

1134
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,267
HE WASN'T FROM NEW YORK.
HE WAS FROM DENVER.

1135
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,734
BUT HE'D SPENT A LOT OF TIME
BACK THERE,

1136
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:25,934
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAYS,
WITH KEROUAC AND GINSBERG

1137
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,534
AND THOSE GUYS.

1138
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:29,534
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE FIRST LEARNED TO DRIVE

1139
01:03:29,534 --> 01:03:31,934
AS A PARKING-LOT ATTENDANT IN
NEW YORK, AS A MATTER OF FACT.

1140
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:34,767
* I HELD MY NOSE,
I CLOSED MY EYES *

1141
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:36,334
* I TOOK A DRINK *

1142
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:40,133
* I DIDN'T KNOW
IF IT WAS DAY OR NIGHT... *

1143
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:47,100
* ...BUT WHEN I KISSED A COP
DOWN AT 34th AND VINE... *

1144
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,434
EXIT 9, EXIT 9.

1145
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:52,634
* LOVE POTION NUMBER 9 *

1146
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:55,868
LOVE POTION NUMBER 9.

1147
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:58,801
I LOST LOVE POTION NUMBER 9.

1148
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,767
LOOK, THERE'S THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING, DEAD AHEAD.

1149
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:03,801
SEVEN MILES, FIVE MILES --

1150
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:06,734
SEVEN -- POSSIBILITY --
SEVEN MILES, EMPIRE.

1151
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:08,267
MANHATTAN ON YOUR RIGHT.

1152
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,467
WELL, COMING
INTO NEW YORK WAS EXCITING

1153
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:11,701
BECAUSE THAT WAS
OUR DESTINATION.

1154
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:13,701
WELCOME TO THE BRONX.

1155
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:16,534
I WAS THERE, THIS WAS IT.

1156
01:04:16,534 --> 01:04:19,133
I'D MADE IT TO NEW YORK.

1157
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:21,934
WHAT AN UNNATURAL ENVIRONMENT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK,

1158
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:24,267
WITH THE STREETS AND THE CARS.

1159
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:30,167
* LOVE POTION NUMBER 9 *

1160
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,667
* LOVE POTION NUMBER 9 *

1161
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,767
WE ARE THE MERRY BAND
OF PRANKSTERS.

1162
01:04:40,968 --> 01:04:44,467
WHEN WE WENT INTO NEW YORK CITY,
WE WERE ALL ON TOP OF THE BUS

1163
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,634
PLAYING INSTRUMENTS AND
TOOTLING AROUND TO EVERYBODY.

1164
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,133
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN
INTERACTING WITH THE PEOPLE.

1165
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,767
* YOU WOMEN HAVE
HEARD OF JALOPIES *

1166
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:56,501
* YOU'VE HEARD THE NOISE
THEY MAKE *

1167
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:59,634
* BUT LET ME
INTRODUCE MY NEW ROCKET 88 *

1168
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:02,834
* YES, IT'S GREAT,
JUST WON'T WAIT *

1169
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:05,701
* EVERYBODY LIKES MY ROCKET 88 *

1170
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,534
* BABY, WE'LL RIDE IN STYLE *

1171
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:10,200
* MOVIN' ALL ALONG *

1172
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,434
YOU KNOW, I GOT ON THE BUS
WHEN IT PULLED UP IN NEW YORK,

1173
01:05:13,434 --> 01:05:16,000
AND WE'D DRIVE
ALL OVER NEW YORK.

1174
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,133
IT SURE FELT LIKE
YOU WERE IN AN AQUARIUM

1175
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,133
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

1176
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:30,200
THE PUBLIC ALWAYS GRINNED
WHEN THEY SAW THAT BUS.

1177
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,501
IT'S LIKE KIDS
WHEN THEY SEE AN EASTER EGG.

1178
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:35,400
IT'S SIMPLE.

1179
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,200
THERE IT IS.
IT'S COLORED. IT'S AN EGG.

1180
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,300
NOBODY FELT THE SLIGHTEST BIT
THREATENED BY IT.

1181
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:46,534
KEN REALLY BELIEVED
THAT THINGS COULD BE CHANGED,

1182
01:05:46,534 --> 01:05:49,234
THAT CONSCIOUSNESS
COULD BE CHANGED.

1183
01:05:49,234 --> 01:05:52,467
HE SAW HIMSELF AS A KIND OF
LIBERATOR FOR THE GENERATION,

1184
01:05:52,467 --> 01:05:56,167
AND HE SAW THE BUS TRIP
AS A KIND OF GOING TO NEW YORK,

1185
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:59,968
A KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
NAPOLEON GOES TO PARIS.

1186
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:13,033
THE BEST THE BUS EVER WAS WAS
WHEN WE DROVE THROUGH HARLEM.

1187
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:15,000
HAD ALL THESE PEOPLE

1188
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,834
RUNNING OUT AND FOLLOWING US
ALONG IN HARLEM,

1189
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:19,934
ALL THESE KIDS.

1190
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,667
SOME TWO WEEKS LATER,
THE BUS HAS SOMEHOW MANAGED

1191
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,334
TO GET ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

1192
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:30,300
AND, ONCE AGAIN,
YOU ENCOUNTERED THE BUS.

1193
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,434
YES, 1239 MADISON AVENUE

1194
01:06:33,434 --> 01:06:35,834
WAS WHERE THIS APARTMENT WAS
THAT I KNEW ABOUT.

1195
01:06:35,834 --> 01:06:38,300
THE NEXT MORNING,
THE PRANKSTERS SHOWED UP.

1196
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,968
AND THEY ALL CAME IN

1197
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:44,434
WITH ABOUT 500 POUNDS
OF EQUIPMENT.

1198
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:49,133
I MEAN, THEY JUST HAD WIRES
AND CAMERAS AND LIGHTS,

1199
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:51,434
AND IT WAS INSTANTLY STREWN

1200
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:53,868
FROM ONE END OF THE APARTMENT
TO THE OTHER.

1201
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,000
IT LOOKED LIKE THE BUS!

1202
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,167
IT LOOKED LIKE
THE INSIDE OF THE BUS.

1203
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:06,634
AND SO, THAT NIGHT,
THERE WAS THIS FANTASTIC PARTY

1204
01:07:06,634 --> 01:07:08,400
THAT GOT SORT OF OUT OF HAND,

1205
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,067
AND THE POOR DOORMAN
KEPT COMING UP

1206
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,834
AND SAYING
EVERYBODY WAS COMPLAINING,

1207
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:13,434
AND IT WENT ON
AND ON AND ON AND ON.

1208
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,167
AND EVERYONE WAS VERY EXCITED
THAT KEROUAC WAS THERE,

1209
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:25,701
AND HE WAS GETTING REALLY
DRUNK, AND GINSBERG CAME.

1210
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:28,133
"I SAW THE BEST MINDS
OF MY GENERATION

1211
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:32,968
"DESTROYED BY MADNESS,
STARVING, HYSTERICAL, NAKED,

1212
01:07:32,968 --> 01:07:35,801
"DRAGGING THEMSELVES THROUGH
THE NEGRO STREETS AT DAWN

1213
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,767
LOOKING FOR AN ANGRY FIX..."

1214
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:39,734
GINSBERG IS LIKE A SPONGE.

1215
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:42,133
HE CAN SOP UP ALL OUR POISONS.

1216
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:43,767
I BOUGHT THE RECORD "HOWL,"

1217
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,601
AND HE WAS KIND OF LIKE
A FOLK SINGER, TO ME,

1218
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:46,701
MORE THAN A POET.

1219
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:48,501
I KNEW THE SOUND OF HIM READING

1220
01:07:48,501 --> 01:07:50,667
BEFORE I READ ANY OF HIS STUFF.

1221
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,067
"...SAT UP SMOKING
IN THE SUPERNATURAL DARKNESS

1222
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,501
"OF COLD WATER FLATS

1223
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:58,267
FLOATING ACROSS THE TOPS OF
CITIES, CONTEMPLATING JAZZ..."

1224
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:00,601
AND WHEN WE
HEADED OFF ON THE BUS,

1225
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:04,200
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL
THAT WE SHOULD HEAD TO NEW YORK

1226
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,200
AND TRY TO FIND
GINSBERG AND KEROUAC.

1227
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,334
UNFORTUNATELY, IT
WASN'T LIKE MEETING THE AUTHOR.

1228
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:12,767
IT WAS MORE LIKE,

1229
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:15,367
SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM
TO RESPOND TO OUR ANTICS.

1230
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,501
WHICH DIDN'T HAPPEN.

1231
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:21,334
HE WAS NOT ENTHUSED
WITH OUR CRAZINESS.

1232
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:25,367
THE THING YOU GOT TO
REALIZE ABOUT KEROUAC,

1233
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,767
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
ALREADY SORT OF AN OLD GUY

1234
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:29,434
AND KIND OF OUT OF IT.

1235
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:31,801
HE WAS ALREADY CRYSTALLIZED.

1236
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:34,834
HE WAS KIND OF A SAD CHARACTER.

1237
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,601
WE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED
BY THE OLD GUNFIGHTERS.

1238
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:46,434
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS THE REAL
HEAVIES IN OUR MYTHOLOGIES --

1239
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:50,133
KEROUAC, CASSADY, GINSBERG.

1240
01:08:50,133 --> 01:08:51,901
NEAL WAS MORE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK

1241
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:55,334
WHEN HE GOT STARTED
WITH THE BEAT MOVEMENT.

1242
01:08:55,334 --> 01:08:59,601
KEROUAC AND I MET HIM
IN '45, SO HE WAS ONLY 20 THEN,

1243
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,033
AND WITHIN THAT YEAR,

1244
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:05,033
HE AND I HAD A ROMANCE THAT
LASTED...ON AND OFF, FOR...

1245
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:07,934
WELL, TILL -- AT LEAST,
I THINK THE LAST TIME

1246
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:09,701
WE WERE IN BED TOGETHER
WAS '66,

1247
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:12,133
SO THAT'S 21 YEARS.

1248
01:09:12,133 --> 01:09:14,501
I GOT A WHOLE THEORY
ABOUT THIS MAN.

1249
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:16,868
WHAT HE WAS
WAS THE REAL SMART CATHOLIC BOY

1250
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:19,701
WHO GOT SUCKED UP BY KEROUAC.

1251
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,567
BUT HE WAS REAL POETIC, LIKE
ALL THESE IRISH CATHOLICS ARE,

1252
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:26,734
AND HE GOT IN WITH SOME POETS
AND HE GOT ASPIRATIONS.

1253
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:29,667
AND SOMEBODY PLANTS A LITTLE
SEED OF HOW GREAT YOU COULD BE

1254
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:33,801
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GREAT,
SO -- SO SEXY, SO POETIC.

1255
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:35,434
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT IDEA,

1256
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:38,567
WHICH WAS SOMETHING
HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY ACHIEVE.

1257
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:41,033
SO THEN HE WAS
SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

1258
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:45,467
HE COULDN'T CREATE ANYTHING
FOR HIMSELF.

1259
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:48,801
HE COULDN'T GET IT TOGETHER WITH
A LADY AND HAVE A GOOD FAMILY.

1260
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:51,834
HE COULDN'T GO OFF AND BE
A FAGGOT WITH GINSBERG.

1261
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:54,334
HE COULDN'T BE ANYTHING.

1262
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:58,234
IT'S AN EXACT MIMICRY
OF GINSBERG 20 YEARS AGO.

1263
01:09:58,234 --> 01:09:59,901
GINSBERG
USED TO BE WILD.

1264
01:09:59,901 --> 01:10:01,701
GINSBERG'S
SO COOL NOW.

1265
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,868
HE USED TO RUN OVER
COLUMBIAN ROOFTOPS

1266
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:05,968
WAVING GENITALS
AND MANUSCRIPTS.

1267
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:09,067
THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE TRIP, SUPPOSEDLY --

1268
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:10,267
AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING --

1269
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,601
WAS THAT EVERYONE WAS
GONNA GO TO THE FAIR.

1270
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,634
ALL THE PRANKSTERS
WERE SO EXCITED.

1271
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:18,100
THIS DAY, WE DROVE TO THE FAIR,

1272
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,133
AND IT WAS LIKE THE HOTTEST
29th OF JUNE THAT EVER HAD BEEN.

1273
01:10:22,133 --> 01:10:25,501
PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IN
THE WORLD IS COMING TO THE FAIR.

1274
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,801
* I MADE MY RESERVATION *

1275
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:29,701
* I'M LEAVING TOWN TOMORROW *

1276
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:31,667
* I'LL FIND SOMEBODY NEW AND *

1277
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:33,801
* THERE'LL BE NO MORE SORROW *

1278
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,334
* THAT'S WHAT I DO EACH TIME *

1279
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:37,067
* BUT I CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH *

1280
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,000
* I CAN'T BREAK AWAY *

1281
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,934
* THOUGH YOU MAKE ME CRY *

1282
01:10:40,934 --> 01:10:43,534
* I CAN'T BREAK AWAY... *

1283
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:47,200
WELCOME TO THE WORLD
OF TOMORROW.

1284
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,267
WELL, SEE,
THE WHOLE IDEA --

1285
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:52,968
THIS IS WHAT DROVE ME
UP THE WALL --

1286
01:10:52,968 --> 01:10:55,467
WAS IT WAS GOING TO
BE MADE INTO A MOVIE

1287
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:57,367
OF EVERYBODY RUNNING ABOUT
AT THE FAIR.

1288
01:10:57,367 --> 01:11:00,767
WELL, NOBODY KEPT TOGETHER.
THERE WAS NOTHING TO FILM.

1289
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:02,601
IT WAS ALL JUST SO DISPERSED.

1290
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:05,167
WE LOST SOMETIMES MISSING AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.

1291
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:08,934
KEN AND BABBS
WERE SO MANIC AND SO HIGH.

1292
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:12,734
THEY DRANK THIS
VILE YELLOW CONCOCTION.

1293
01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:14,801
SWASHBUCKLER,
I'LL PULL OUT MY SWORD.

1294
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,434
WELL, OF COURSE,
THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SEE

1295
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:22,200
WAS WHERE THE WATER BALLET
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

1296
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,868
MY WHOLE REASON
FOR GOING TO NEW YORK

1297
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:26,667
WAS TO TRY TO LOCATE
A JOB POSSIBILITY.

1298
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,434
BABBS AND I SEARCHED

1299
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:30,667
AND FINALLY FOUND
THIS BEAUTIFUL POOL

1300
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:34,601
AND FOUND OUT THEY HAD CANCELED
THE WHOLE WATER BALLET.

1301
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:42,100
AND THESE SAME PEOPLE PROBABLY
ALSO TAKE IN THE EXHIBIT

1302
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,334
WHERE THE WIZARDRY
OF MODERN CHEMISTRY

1303
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,701
IS PRESENTED
WITH ENTERTAINING SHOWMANSHIP.

1304
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:51,267
* BETTER THINGS FOR BETTER
LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY *

1305
01:11:51,267 --> 01:11:54,601
* FOR THE FINER WORLD WE WANT *

1306
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,834
* BETTER THINGS FOR BETTER
LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY *

1307
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:05,033
* THAT'S THE PROMISE OF DuPont *

1308
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:16,701
THE FAIR WAS TRIPPY AND GREAT.

1309
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:20,300
WHEN YOU'RE HIGH,
THE MORE VARIETY, THE BETTER.

1310
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,000
YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE
A JOURNEY OUT OF THIS WORLD

1311
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,234
INTO THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE.

1312
01:12:26,234 --> 01:12:30,767
FORGET THE WORLD AROUND YOU.
FORGET THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

1313
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:33,968
YOU ARE ENTERING FUTURAMA,

1314
01:12:33,968 --> 01:12:36,267
ALONE WITH YOUR OWN THOUGHTS.

1315
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:43,434
THE WORLD'S FAIR WAS ON,
WHICH WAS A GREAT THING.

1316
01:12:43,434 --> 01:12:48,467
IT WAS A VISION
OF THE FUTURE OF AMERICA,

1317
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:50,801
AND I -- KEN SAW IT THAT WAY.

1318
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:53,501
THE IRONY IS
THAT CURVED, FINNED,

1319
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:55,534
CORPORATE AMERICA
"TOMORROWLAND,"

1320
01:12:55,534 --> 01:12:58,934
AS PRESENTED
AT THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR,

1321
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:00,934
WAS OVER BEFORE IT BEGAN.

1322
01:13:00,934 --> 01:13:03,567
'64 -- THINGS WERE CHANGING.

1323
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:05,267
WE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WORLD'S FAIRS

1324
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:07,834
WERE A THING OF THE PAST.

1325
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,000
* I CAN'T BREAK AWAY *

1326
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,667
* THOUGH YOU MAKE ME CRY *

1327
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:16,667
* I CAN'T BREAK AWAY... *

1328
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:18,033
BY THEN,

1329
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:20,267
THE TRIP BECAME MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE DESTINATION.

1330
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:21,567
NEVER MIND WHERE WE'RE GOING,

1331
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:22,901
IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

1332
01:13:22,901 --> 01:13:24,501
THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE TRIP,

1333
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:28,033
TAKING ACID TRIP,
CAME OUT OF THAT SUMMER.

1334
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,133
THE EFFECT IS SOMEWHAT LIKE
LOOKING THROUGH A MICROSCOPE.

1335
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:32,367
SUDDENLY, WHEN YOU LOOK
THROUGH A MICROSCOPE,

1336
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,434
YOU DISCOVER THAT THERE'S
AN INVISIBLE WORLD AROUND YOU

1337
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:36,934
THAT YOU HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT
BEFORE YOU DID IT.

1338
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,100
THE SAME THING IS TRUE
OF THE PSYCHEDELIC DRUG.

1339
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,334
* TIMOTHY LEARY'S DEAD *

1340
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,667
AFTER THE DISAPPOINTMENT
OF THE WORLD'S FAIR,

1341
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,901
YOU HEADED TO
TIMOTHY LEARY'S COMPOUND,

1342
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:50,000
THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION
FOR INTERNAL FREEDOM.

1343
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,400
WAS IT CALLED "IFIF"?

1344
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,667
IFIF.

1345
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,934
IT WAS LIKE A 4,000-ACRE
FARM OUTSIDE OF POUGHKEEPSIE

1346
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:58,534
IN MILLBROOK, NEW YORK.

1347
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,167
WE TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO TURN ON,

1348
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:02,801
OR HOW TO GO OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

1349
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:05,734
BY "TURN ON,"
WE MEAN TUNE IN,

1350
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:10,667
TO GET BEYOND
YOUR ROUTINE WAYS OF THINKING

1351
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,334
AND ACTING AND EXPERIENCING.

1352
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:15,701
* TIMOTHY LEARY'S DEAD *

1353
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,467
GINSBERG IS THE ONE
THAT SET IT ALL UP

1354
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,434
BECAUSE HE KNEW
THOSE GUYS AT IFIF

1355
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:22,534
AND HE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

1356
01:14:22,534 --> 01:14:23,801
FOR US TO MEET EACH OTHER.

1357
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:26,634
IT WAS LIKE
THE WEST COAST ACIDHEADS

1358
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:28,400
MEETING THE EAST COAST
ACIDHEADS

1359
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,767
AND HAVING A POWWOW.

1360
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:33,534
WE PULLED INTO THEIR SCENE,
MAKING A LOT OF NOISE.

1361
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:35,133
WE SET OFF THESE SMOKE GRENADES.

1362
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:36,334
SMOKE-BOMB DELIGHT.

1363
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:37,734
SMOKE-BOMB DELIGHT.

1364
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:41,200
PRANKSTERS
AT THE VERY CASTLE.

1365
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,834
AND I HAVE TO INFORM YOU,
JUST WHAT'S EXACTLY GOING ON?

1366
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,901
WE'RE HIGH AND THEY'RE
COMING DOWN, IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

1367
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:52,200
* TIMOTHY LEARY *

1368
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,133
YOU KNOW,
THAT QUIET TIME AFTER A TRIP

1369
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,234
WHEN YOU JUST WANT TO BE
VERY MELLOW,

1370
01:14:57,234 --> 01:15:02,734
AND UP DRIVES THE BUS
WITH THESE SPEED FREAKS,

1371
01:15:02,734 --> 01:15:08,400
AND THEY COME TO HAVE FUN
AND PLAY WITH FLUTES AND --

1372
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,734
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE
TOOK ONE LOOK AND FLED,

1373
01:15:10,734 --> 01:15:13,767
LEAVING ME TO WELCOME THEM.

1374
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:18,133
* SO RAISE YOUR GLASS,
WE'LL DRINK A TOAST *

1375
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:21,901
* TO THE LITTLE MAN WHO SELLS
YOU THRILLS ALONG THE PIER *

1376
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:23,667
THE WHOLE MILLBROOK SCENE,

1377
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:26,767
IT WAS JUST THE OTHER END
OF THE SAME STICK, I THINK.

1378
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:29,300
WE WERE "SCUFFY"
AND DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY

1379
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,133
AND PULLED INTO THIS MANSION,
WHICH WAS UPPER CRUST.

1380
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,667
WE FELT A KINSHIP TO THEM,

1381
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:37,901
BUT WE COULD ALSO TELL THAT THEY
WERE WISHING THAT WE'D LEAVE.

1382
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,267
WHAT EVERYBODY
ANTICIPATED DIDN'T TURN OUT,

1383
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:42,501
IT KIND OF FIZZLED.

1384
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:47,167
WE WAITED ALL DAY FOR LEARY TO
SHOW UP, AND HE JUST AVOIDED US.

1385
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,767
AND THEN HE SORT OF DISAPPEARED
WITH CASSADY,

1386
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:52,267
AND CASSADY WENT UPSTAIRS
AND HUNG OUT WITH --

1387
01:15:52,267 --> 01:15:56,100
THEY DIDN'T WANT US
TO GO UPSTAIRS.

1388
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:03,267
ALPERT WAS VERY FRIENDLY.
HE WAS THERE.

1389
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,267
JUST LISTENING
TO ALPERT TALK, MAN,

1390
01:16:05,267 --> 01:16:08,200
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
A FUCKING CRAZY MAN.

1391
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,267
ALL OF MY GAMES WERE, LIKE,
GOING OFF INTO THE DISTANCE.

1392
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,634
I GOT THIS TERRIBLE PANIC

1393
01:16:13,634 --> 01:16:17,033
BECAUSE, INDEED,
I WAS GONNA CEASE TO EXIST.

1394
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:19,634
AND I GOT THE PANIC,
WHICH IS THE PANIC

1395
01:16:19,634 --> 01:16:21,701
THAT PRECEDES
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEATH,

1396
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,801
BECAUSE, INDEED,
RICHARD ALPERT WAS DYING.

1397
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:27,200
THESE PEOPLE SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME, MAN.

1398
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,968
THEY WERE VERY CLINICAL
AND CONTROLLED,

1399
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:32,033
AND WE WERE REALLY FREE-FORM.

1400
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:36,234
WE WERE THE EXPLORERS,
AND THEY WERE THE SCIENTISTS.

1401
01:16:39,734 --> 01:16:43,701
AND SO WE JUST ENTERTAINED
OURSELVES AT THIS WATERFALL.

1402
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,634
* SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW *

1403
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,400
* SHAKE IT UP, BABY *

1404
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,000
* TWIST AND SHOUT *

1405
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,300
* COME ON
AND TWIST AND SHOUT *

1406
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,267
* COME ON, BABY, NOW *

1407
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:54,667
* COME ON, BABY *

1408
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,567
AND THAT'S WHERE
KATHY VAN LEEUWEN

1409
01:16:56,567 --> 01:17:00,133
GOT <i>HER</i> NICKNAME,
"SENSUOUS EXPERIENCE."

1410
01:17:00,133 --> 01:17:02,067
SENSUOUS X,
YES, I REMEMBER HER WELL.

1411
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:05,133
HER NAME WAS IMPLIED
IN HER VERY BEARING --

1412
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:08,934
THAT IS TO SAY,
HER BODILY EXAMPLE.

1413
01:17:08,934 --> 01:17:11,734
KATHY WAS ZONKER'S
GIRLFRIEND IN COLLEGE,

1414
01:17:11,734 --> 01:17:14,200
AND THAT'S WHY
ZONKER WENT ON THE TRIP.

1415
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,968
* SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW *

1416
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:18,467
SENSUOUS.
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT HER.

1417
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,234
OH, SHE'S SO MUCH LIKE
MARILYN MONROE, RIGHT?

1418
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:23,868
* COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, BABY, NOW *

1419
01:17:23,868 --> 01:17:25,467
* COME ON, BABY *

1420
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,100
NOW, I'M WONDERING,
AT THIS POINT,

1421
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,267
WHETHER MY GIRLFRIEND HAS BEEN

1422
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:31,000
HAVING SEX WITH THESE PEOPLE
OR NOT.

1423
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,200
AND THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH
KESEY STARTED FLIRTING WITH HER,

1424
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,234
TRYING TO GET HER ATTENTION,

1425
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:38,334
AND HE <i>DID</i> GET HER ATTENTION.

1426
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:40,400
* HAVE YOU *

1427
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,767
* EVER HEARD THE STORY ABOUT *

1428
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:46,601
* PEGGY THE PISTOL? *

1429
01:17:46,601 --> 01:17:49,067
HE SAYS, "ALL MY DOPE IS YOURS,"
AS HE'S FUCKING MY GIRLFRIEND.

1430
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:50,534
THANKS, KESEY.

1431
01:17:50,534 --> 01:17:53,400
I WANTED TO GET OUT OF NEW YORK
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE,

1432
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,634
AND I WAS BASICALLY TELLING HER
THAT SHE COULD GET ON THE BUS,

1433
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,467
BUT I WAS GONE.

1434
01:17:57,467 --> 01:17:59,200
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO

1435
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,734
LEAVE HER
WITH ALL THESE FUCKERS.

1436
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:08,734
WHEN THEY WERE GETTING READY TO
LEAVE TOWN, I HAD TO DECIDE,

1437
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:12,167
YOU KNOW, WAS I GONNA STAY,
OR WAS I GONNA GO?

1438
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:15,868
AT THAT POINT, I WAS STILL
PLANNING ON STAYING TO WORK.

1439
01:18:15,868 --> 01:18:17,601
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY.

1440
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:22,334
I GOT SUCKED INTO THE PRANKSTER
SCENE TOO MUCH, TOO HEAVILY.

1441
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:26,100
SO I STAYED ON THE BUS.

1442
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,100
I WASN'T THERE ON THE WAY BACK.

1443
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,234
I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE OFF OF IT.

1444
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:41,200
COMING BACK'S
A WHOLE 'NOTHER TRIP.

1445
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,901
CASSADY --
HE DIDN'T COME BACK WITH US.

1446
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:47,601
THE TRIP ACROSS WAS BASICALLY

1447
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:50,667
LENGTHS OF NEAL'S
DRIVING CONSCIOUSNESS,

1448
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,067
AND THEN, ON THE WAY BACK,

1449
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:57,067
SUDDENLY THE DRIVING DUTIES
WERE THRUST UPON THE REST OF US.

1450
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,400
EVERYBODY TOOK TURNS --
THE GUYS, ANYWAY.

1451
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,934
THAT WAS ON THE WAY BACK.

1452
01:19:09,934 --> 01:19:13,467
WE JUST STARTED DRIVING THE BUS
DOWN THIS ABANDONED DIRT ROAD

1453
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:16,200
AND ENDED UP
AT THIS INCREDIBLE LAKE,

1454
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,234
AND THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
BUT US.

1455
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:28,501
WE DECIDED WE WANTED TO
FIND A SPOT TO TAKE I.T.-290.

1456
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:30,467
WELL, I.T.-290 WAS FAMOUS.

1457
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:34,267
THAT'S THE ROLLS-ROYCE
OF PSYCHEDELICS.

1458
01:19:34,267 --> 01:19:36,868
KESEY HAD STOLEN A JAR.

1459
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:42,400
HE CLAIMED IT WAS THE LAST JAR
OF I.T.-290 ON THE PLANET.

1460
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,200
AND SO HE WANTED
A VERY SPECIAL PLACE

1461
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,467
FOR EVERYBODY TO TAKE IT.

1462
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:54,534
SO WE BUILT A LITTLE FIRE
AND MADE A LITTLE CAMPGROUND

1463
01:19:54,534 --> 01:19:59,801
AND POPPED THE I.T.-290
AND HAD THE TRIP.

1464
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:10,167
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL,
IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN ACID.

1465
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:12,868
IT'S A HALLUCINOGEN,
BUT VERY CALM.

1466
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:16,367
ACID CAN HAVE A HARD EDGE
TO IT SOMETIMES,

1467
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:19,467
BUT THIS IS VERY CALMING.

1468
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,868
COLORS VERY VIVID.

1469
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,501
IT WAS VERY COMMUNAL,

1470
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,968
IN THAT YOU FELT
CONNECTED TO EVERYBODY.

1471
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:39,834
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS
AS AMERICAN AS YOU COULD GET,

1472
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:43,567
BECAUSE WE WERE
EXPLORING A NEW TERRITORY,

1473
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:45,934
JUST THE SAME WAY
WE WENT TO THE MOON

1474
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:50,901
OR SENT LEWIS AND CLARK
EXPEDITION HERE TO OREGON.

1475
01:20:50,901 --> 01:20:54,501
IT WAS PART
OF OUR AMERICAN PERSONALITY.

1476
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:56,667
YOU FIND A CAVE,

1477
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,334
NOBODY'S BEEN IN IT,
YOU GO IN IT.

1478
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:01,067
YOU TRY TO GO DOWN
DEEPER INTO THE OCEAN

1479
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:02,534
AND UP HIGHER IN THE SKY,

1480
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:08,901
AND THESE DRUGS WERE OPENING
A DOOR TO NEW LANDSCAPES.

1481
01:21:08,901 --> 01:21:10,501
ONCE YOU'RE THROUGH THAT DOOR

1482
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:13,634
AND YOU LOOK OUT INTO
THIS VAST ROOM

1483
01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:17,534
WITH ALL THESE
WINDOWS ONTO NEW VISTAS,

1484
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:19,701
YOU BECOME TREMENDOUSLY EXCITED

1485
01:21:19,701 --> 01:21:24,334
AND WANT TO DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO EXPLORE IT,

1486
01:21:24,334 --> 01:21:25,834
BECAUSE YOU COULD LOOK AROUND
AND YOU SAW

1487
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:27,634
THAT THERE WEREN'T
HUMAN FOOTPRINTS

1488
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,400
ALL OVER THIS LANDSCAPE.

1489
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:36,634
* I SAW HER
STANDING ON THE CORNER *

1490
01:21:36,634 --> 01:21:39,901
HOW DID THE DYNAMICS
ON THE BUS CHANGE

1491
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:42,968
WHEN SOME OF THE WIVES
JOINED THE TRIP BACK?

1492
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:44,601
AT ONE POINT,
IT GOT ALL COUPLES.

1493
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:46,367
AT ONE POINT, THERE WERE
14 OF US ON THE BUS,

1494
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:48,334
7 MEN AND 7 WOMEN.

1495
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:49,667
LOTS OF THEM WERE MARRIED,

1496
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:52,100
BUT NOT TO THE PERSON
THAT THEY WERE COUPLING WITH.

1497
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:58,133
I REMEMBER ONE MORNING, WE WOKE
UP, AND EVERYBODY WAS FUCKING.

1498
01:21:58,133 --> 01:21:59,367
THE WHOLE BUS WAS SHAKING.

1499
01:21:59,367 --> 01:22:00,567
* YOU'RE THE ONE *

1500
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,200
* YOU'RE THE ONE *

1501
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,601
* YOU'RE THE ONE *

1502
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:08,434
* YOUNG GIRL *

1503
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:10,667
IT GOT A LOT HEAVIER
ON THE WAY BACK.

1504
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:13,734
THAT WAS FERVOR-PITCH STUFF.

1505
01:22:13,734 --> 01:22:15,067
I THINK I TALKED WITH KESEY

1506
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:17,501
ABOUT OUR
FUCKING STRANGE SITUATION.

1507
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:19,467
THE THING WAS WEIRD, MAN,

1508
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,434
BUT YOU COULDN'T BE MAD AT HIM.

1509
01:22:21,434 --> 01:22:24,000
HE WAS REALLY COMPASSIONATE.

1510
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,634
I LIKED SENSUOUS,

1511
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:28,601
AND THAT WAS
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART IS,

1512
01:22:28,601 --> 01:22:30,000
HAVING BEEN LOVERS,

1513
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,334
NOT BEING LOVERS ANYMORE
AND CONTINUING TO BE FRIENDS.

1514
01:22:33,334 --> 01:22:37,200
* I CAN'T GET YOU
OUT OF MY MIND *

1515
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:51,801
THE THING THAT CREATES PROBLEMS

1516
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:55,868
IN ALL THOSE HUSBAND-AND-WIFE
TRIANGLE SITUATIONS

1517
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:59,534
IS EVERYBODY'S HANG-UP
WITH THEIR OWN ATTACHMENT

1518
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:03,133
TO SOME KIND OF BELIEF
OF THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE.

1519
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:20,467
WHEN I CAME THROUGH
YELLOWSTONE PARK WITH THIS BUS,

1520
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:24,434
I SAW A SIGN THAT SAID,
"BEWARE OF THE BEAR,"

1521
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:26,968
AND SOMETHING CLICKED
WHEN I SAW THIS,

1522
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,400
AND I THOUGHT,
"THERE'S THE PROBLEM.

1523
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,901
"THERE'S THE WHOLE HANG-UP
THAT STOPS ME FROM WRITING,

1524
01:23:32,901 --> 01:23:36,100
"STOPS PEOPLE FROM SINGING,
STOPS PEOPLE FROM LIVING.

1525
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,267
"'BEWARE OF THE BEAR.'
WHAT DID THAT USED TO MEAN?

1526
01:23:40,267 --> 01:23:43,667
"IT USED TO MEAN
BE <i>AWARE</i> OF THE BEAR.

1527
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:46,100
NOW IT MEANS BE <i>SCARED</i> OF HIM."

1528
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,901
THIS LITTLE PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE,

1529
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:55,033
YOU CAN PLUG IT INTO ANY PERSON

1530
01:23:55,033 --> 01:23:58,300
WHO IS NOW BEING HASSLED WITH
THE WAY THE WORLD IS CHANGING.

1531
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,300
GOLDWATER AND HIS BUNCH
ARE SCARED.

1532
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,968
THAT EXTREMISM...

1533
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,100
IN THE DEFENSE OF LIBERTY...

1534
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,734
IS NO VICE.

1535
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:09,934
THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING

1536
01:24:09,934 --> 01:24:12,567
THAT IS SCARING THESE PEOPLE.

1537
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:15,434
WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING THAT'S SO NEW,

1538
01:24:15,434 --> 01:24:18,334
THEY'RE SCARED BEYOND
ANY POWERS OF REASONING.

1539
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:19,601
8, 9...

1540
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:23,734
10, 9, 8, 7...

1541
01:24:23,734 --> 01:24:27,834
6, 5, 4, 3...

1542
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:31,767
2, 1, ZERO!

1543
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:35,834
THESE ARE THE STAKES --

1544
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:40,601
TO MAKE A WORLD IN WHICH
ALL OF GOD'S CHILDREN CAN LIVE

1545
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:43,968
OR TO GO INTO THE DARK.

1546
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:48,400
WE MUST EITHER
LOVE EACH OTHER...

1547
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,968
OR WE MUST DIE.

1548
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:53,167
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT JOHNSON
ON NOVEMBER 3rd.

1549
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:56,567
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH
FOR YOU TO STAY HOME.

1550
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,901
ALL THE THEMES OF MY WORK
HAVE TO DO WITH AMERICA --

1551
01:25:24,901 --> 01:25:27,300
TRAVELING ACROSS THIS LAND,

1552
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,300
COMING TO THIS EDGE,
AND THEN WHAT?

1553
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:52,467
MY MEMBRANES HAVE PASSED
INTO AN OXYGENATION STATE.

1554
01:25:52,467 --> 01:25:55,868
AFTER WE GOT BACK TO
LA HONDA, AFTER THE BUS TRIP,

1555
01:25:55,868 --> 01:25:58,234
WE HAD A VERY PURPOSEFUL RITUAL

1556
01:25:58,234 --> 01:26:00,234
TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER THIS BUS THING.

1557
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:01,567
WE TOOK ALL OF OUR BUS CLOTHES

1558
01:26:01,567 --> 01:26:03,167
AND PUT THEM IN A PILE
AND SET FIRE TO THEM,

1559
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,701
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO BE DONE WITH IT.

1560
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,133
I WANTED TO GET BACK
TO BUSINESS.

1561
01:26:06,133 --> 01:26:08,100
I HAD BOOKS TO WRITE
AND KIDS TO RAISE.

1562
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,133
BUT IT WOULDN'T DIE.

1563
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:12,200
PEOPLE JUST KEPT COMING AROUND.

1564
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,033
LIKE LITTLE JACKRABBITS
GAILY CROSSING THE PASTURE

1565
01:26:15,033 --> 01:26:16,501
THAT MORNING, SO...

1566
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:18,200
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US,
WE WERE MAKING THAT MOVIE

1567
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,133
AND PRETTY SOON, ON SATURDAYS,
WHEN WE SHOWED IT,

1568
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,133
PEOPLE WERE COMING
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS.

1569
01:26:22,133 --> 01:26:24,200
...AND THE RED BARN
AND THE KIDS ON THE BEACH

1570
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,968
IN THE STREAM SAYING...

1571
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:28,200
WE REALLY DIDN'T PROJECT IT
UNTIL I'D FINISHED EDITING IT,

1572
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,901
REEL TO REEL,
IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.

1573
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:32,801
AND WE SHOWED IT FROM BEGINNING
TO END WITHOUT STOPPING,

1574
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:37,067
SO 30 HOURS STRAIGHT.

1575
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,567
AND SO, FOR PART OF IT,

1576
01:26:38,567 --> 01:26:40,667
EVERYBODY SLEPT THROUGH IT,
OF COURSE.

1577
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,467
CASSADY, OF COURSE --
HE TOOK SPEED --

1578
01:26:42,467 --> 01:26:45,434
WAS AWAKE AND WAS THE ONE WHO
ENDED UP RUNNING THE PROJECTOR

1579
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:46,968
AND TALKING VERY SOFTLY --

1580
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:49,801
"AND NOW WE'RE COMING
TO NEW YORK."

1581
01:26:49,801 --> 01:26:52,267
ENJOYING EVERY SECOND OF IT.

1582
01:26:52,267 --> 01:26:54,367
BUT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE AWAKE.

1583
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:58,033
ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP.

1584
01:26:58,033 --> 01:27:00,667
HE'S OUT OF HIS NUT!

1585
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,601
EVERY SATURDAY, THEY'D
COME AROUND MORE AND MORE,

1586
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:06,367
BECAUSE WE WOULD DO
THESE SATURDAY-NIGHT TRIPS.

1587
01:27:06,367 --> 01:27:09,100
AND FINALLY, THERE WERE
JUST TOO MANY COMING AROUND.

1588
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,634
I REALIZED, "I GOT TO
GET THIS OUT OF MY HOUSE

1589
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,734
"BECAUSE OTHERWISE, THEN I'LL
BE CLEANING UP ALL WEEK LONG

1590
01:27:13,734 --> 01:27:15,067
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."

1591
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:16,934
SO WE JUST SAID,
"OKAY, NEXT TIME,

1592
01:27:16,934 --> 01:27:19,934
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS IN
SANTA CRUZ AT BABBS' HOUSE."

1593
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,801
WHICH IS REALLY THE BEGINNING
OF THE ACID TESTS.

1594
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:25,901
* EVERYWHERE
AND ALL OF THE TIME *

1595
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:30,567
* IT'S BENDING MY MIND *

1596
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,133
AND THEN, AFTER THAT, HE SAID,
"I DON'T WANT IT AT MY PLACE."

1597
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:37,701
HE SAID, "OKAY, NEXT TIME,
WE'LL DO IT IN SAN JOSE."

1598
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:40,934
SO, EACH TIME, WE JUST SAID,

1599
01:27:40,934 --> 01:27:44,734
"NEXT WEEK, ON SATURDAY,
IT'LL BE HAPPENING THERE."

1600
01:27:44,734 --> 01:27:47,567
* I'M FLYING DOWN
DESERTED STREETS *

1601
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:50,334
* WRAPPED IN MOTHER'S
WINDING SHEETS *

1602
01:27:50,334 --> 01:27:53,200
* ASBESTOS BOOTS
ON FLAMING FEET *

1603
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,767
* DREAMING OF FORBIDDEN TREATS *

1604
01:27:55,767 --> 01:27:58,901
* WHEN UNIFORMS
ON NIGHTTIME BEATS ASK ME *

1605
01:27:58,901 --> 01:28:00,467
WHEN WE STARTED
DOING THE ACID TEST,

1606
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:04,334
WE TOOK ON THE DEAD
AS SORT OF OUR BACKUP BAND.

1607
01:28:04,334 --> 01:28:05,801
* I CAN'T COME DOWN *

1608
01:28:05,801 --> 01:28:07,067
* IT'S PLAIN TO SEE *

1609
01:28:07,067 --> 01:28:09,234
WE'D HEARD ABOUT
KESEY AND THE BUS,

1610
01:28:09,234 --> 01:28:10,968
THEY'D BEEN DOING OUTRAGEOUS
THINGS FOR QUITE A WHILE

1611
01:28:10,968 --> 01:28:12,400
AND HAD A REPUTATION FOR IT.

1612
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,234
AND -- AND FOR US, IT SEEMED
LIKE A REAL INTERESTING THING

1613
01:28:14,234 --> 01:28:15,868
TO GO AND CHECK OUT.

1614
01:28:22,067 --> 01:28:25,234
* WELL, SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO TELL ME WHERE IT'S AT *

1615
01:28:25,234 --> 01:28:28,067
AND THEY WERE OUR FIRST
AND BEST AUDIENCE,

1616
01:28:28,067 --> 01:28:29,167
THE PRANKSTERS WERE, YOU KNOW.

1617
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:31,133
THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES
TO GET OFF ON US.

1618
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:33,267
* LITTLE WINGS
LIKE A VAMPIRE BAT *

1619
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:36,000
* I FLY AWAY TO MY
COLD-WATER FLAT *

1620
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,601
* AND EAT MY WAY... *

1621
01:28:37,601 --> 01:28:39,734
THEY WEREN'T JUST PLAYING
WHAT WAS ON THE MUSIC SHEETS.

1622
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:41,534
THEY WERE PLAYING
WHAT WAS IN THE AIR.

1623
01:28:41,534 --> 01:28:43,434
* I CAN'T COME DOWN *

1624
01:28:43,434 --> 01:28:44,801
* IT'S PLAIN TO SEE *

1625
01:28:44,801 --> 01:28:46,133
* I CAN'T COME DOWN *

1626
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:47,801
WHEN THE DEAD ARE AT THEIR BEST,

1627
01:28:47,801 --> 01:28:50,934
THE VIBRATIONS THAT ARE
STIRRED UP BY THE AUDIENCE

1628
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:52,734
IS THE MUSIC THAT THEY PLAY.

1629
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:56,067
THAT MEANS THAT THE BAND
HAS TO BE SUPPLE ENOUGH

1630
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:59,767
TO REALLY READ THE NOTES
WRITTEN ON THE WALL.

1631
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:03,234
* THEY SAY I'VE BEGUN
TO LOSE MY GRIP *

1632
01:29:03,234 --> 01:29:06,100
* MY HOLD ON REALITY'S
STARTING TO SLIP *

1633
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,734
* TELL ME TO GET OFF
OF THIS TRIP *

1634
01:29:08,734 --> 01:29:11,934
* THEY SAY THAT IT'S
LIKE A SINKING SHIP *

1635
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:14,901
IT MOVED ON FROM THAT,
EXPONENTIALLY,

1636
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:17,868
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE.

1637
01:29:17,868 --> 01:29:18,968
* I CAN'T COME DOWN *

1638
01:29:18,968 --> 01:29:20,367
* IT'S PLAIN TO SEE *

1639
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:21,767
* I CAN'T COME DOWN *

1640
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:23,767
* I'VE BEEN SET FREE *

1641
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:25,834
LSD IS A REALLY GROOVY WAY
TO FIND OUT MORE

1642
01:29:25,834 --> 01:29:27,167
ABOUT THE THINGS AROUND YOU.

1643
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:29,667
LSD HELPS ME UNDERSTAND
THE WHOLE WORLD BETTER.

1644
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:32,868
LSD HELPS YOU TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR OWN MIND.

1645
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:37,067
ONCE PANDORA'S BOX IS OPEN,

1646
01:29:37,067 --> 01:29:39,634
YOU CAN'T REGULATE
WHO GETS TO USE

1647
01:29:39,634 --> 01:29:42,701
THE STUFF THAT FLIES OUT OF IT.

1648
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:45,467
Pres.
WELL, I'M TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
BY THE PROBLEM OF LSD.

1649
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:48,234
I THINK THERE'S BEEN
A GREAT DEAL OF MISINFORMATION

1650
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:51,334
BY THOSE WHO SEEM
TO SEE NO HARM IN IT.

1651
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:53,334
BUT AS A PARENT AND AS A CITIZEN

1652
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:55,300
AND CERTAINLY
NOW IN THIS POSITION,

1653
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,267
I AM GREATLY CONCERNED.

1654
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,667
A POWERFUL NEW DRUG

1655
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:01,334
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WEIRD
AND DANGEROUS HALLUCINATIONS

1656
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:03,100
HAD FOUND ITS WAY
ONTO THE STREETS.

1657
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,801
WE HAD TO TRY AND STOP IT.

1658
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:12,334
THE GOVERNMENT SAID,
"STOP THAT EXPERIMENT.

1659
01:30:12,334 --> 01:30:13,801
"ALL THESE GUINEA PIGS
THAT WE'VE SENT UP THERE

1660
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:15,400
"INTO OUTER SPACE,
BRING 'EM BACK DOWN,

1661
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,300
"AND DON'T EVER LET 'EM
GO BACK UP THERE AGAIN,

1662
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,200
BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE
THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES."

1663
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,968
HE'S CLEAN, JOE,
EXCEPT FOR THESE.

1664
01:30:24,968 --> 01:30:26,868
SUGAR CUBES.

1665
01:30:26,868 --> 01:30:29,467
I'LL MAKE YOU BOOK HE'S
BEEN DROPPING THAT ACID
WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT.

1666
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:32,367
EVIL! EVIL, EVIL!

1667
01:30:32,367 --> 01:30:35,133
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, SON.
SETTLE DOWN.

1668
01:30:35,133 --> 01:30:37,634
OH, NO, NO...

1669
01:30:37,634 --> 01:30:40,267
HOSPITAL PEOPLE,
WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT,

1670
01:30:40,267 --> 01:30:41,701
ARE BECOMING EXPERT
IN THE HANDLING

1671
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:43,534
OF LSD USERS IN TROUBLE.

1672
01:30:43,534 --> 01:30:45,400
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

1673
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,834
SOME PEOPLE
HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE

1674
01:30:46,834 --> 01:30:48,834
THE FIRST TIME
THEY TAKE THE DRUG.

1675
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:52,834
OTHERS TAKE IT 30, 60,
OR EVEN 100 TIMES

1676
01:30:52,834 --> 01:30:54,501
BEFORE THEIR BAD TRIP.

1677
01:30:54,501 --> 01:30:57,567
AND THE BAD TRIP --
INSTANT INSANITY.

1678
01:30:57,567 --> 01:30:59,901
OFTEN, A NEVER NEVER LAND
OF NO RETURN.

1679
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:02,000
NO, NO, GET AWAY!

1680
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,267
SOME OTHERS WHO TAKE LSD

1681
01:31:04,267 --> 01:31:07,133
WILL HAVE EVEN MORE TRAGIC
FREAK-OUTS.

1682
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:10,767
MANY LOSE
ALL CONTACT WITH REALITY.

1683
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:13,434
SOME FORGET WHAT HEIGHT MEANS

1684
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:16,033
AND, IN A TURNED-ON
OR EUPHORIC STATE,

1685
01:31:16,033 --> 01:31:19,601
STEP OR ATTEMPT TO FLY
FROM CLIFFS AND HIGH WINDOWS,

1686
01:31:19,601 --> 01:31:22,067
WITH REAL-LIFE,

1687
01:31:22,067 --> 01:31:25,434
PERMANENT,
NON-PSYCHEDELIC RESULTS.

1688
01:31:25,434 --> 01:31:28,167
OTHER TRIPPERS ATTEMPT
TO MERGE THEIR BEINGS

1689
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:31,901
WITH LARGE, FAST AUTOMOBILES.

1690
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:33,868
AAAAH!

1691
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:43,801
WITH ALL THE HYPE ABOUT LSD,

1692
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:46,133
YOU WERE BUSTED
WITH MARIJUANA?

1693
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:47,767
IT WASN'T EVEN GRASS CHARGES,

1694
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:53,000
IT WAS BEING IN A PLACE
WHERE MARIJUANA WAS.

1695
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,734
MR. KESEY, DO YOU FEEL
YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG?

1696
01:31:55,734 --> 01:31:57,734
I FEEL LIKE YOU ONLY COME
TO THIS MOVIE ONCE,

1697
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:59,767
AND IF YOU DON'T
GET SOMETHING REWARDING

1698
01:31:59,767 --> 01:32:01,801
OUT OF EVERY MINUTE
YOU'RE SITTING THERE,

1699
01:32:01,801 --> 01:32:03,734
THEN YOU'RE BLOWING YOUR TICKET.

1700
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:09,334
LET'S ASSUME THE WORST.

1701
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:11,234
SUPPOSING THEY DO COME BACK
WITH A CONVICTION,

1702
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:12,467
WOULD YOU APPEAL?

1703
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:16,334
WELL, IF I COULD
JUST CONCEDE IN SOME WAY

1704
01:32:16,334 --> 01:32:20,033
AND LET THEM STICK ME IN JAIL
AND DO MY TIME,

1705
01:32:20,033 --> 01:32:22,334
I WOULD DO IT
AND SAVE THE TAXPAYERS

1706
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:24,567
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

1707
01:32:26,767 --> 01:32:29,868
THE AIM OF THE SHERIFF
AND THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

1708
01:32:29,868 --> 01:32:32,434
HAS BEEN TO REHABILITATE
MR. KESEY,

1709
01:32:32,434 --> 01:32:34,567
TO GET HIM
BACK INTO WRITING,

1710
01:32:34,567 --> 01:32:38,767
BACK INTO THE CAREER WHERE HE
SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST TALENT.

1711
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:45,300
* WALK ME OUT IN THE
MORNING DEW, MY HONEY *

1712
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,501
IN SIX MONTHS,
YOUR KIDS GROW A LOT.

1713
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:49,601
THAT'S WHAT THEY TAKE AWAY
FROM YOU IN JAIL.

1714
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:52,000
IT'S A DRAG.
I DON'T WANT TO EVER GO TO JAIL.

1715
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,601
* YOU DIDN'T HEAR NO BABY
CRY TODAY *

1716
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:11,667
ONE FLEW OUT
OF A CUCKOO'S NEST TODAY --

1717
01:33:11,667 --> 01:33:14,367
THAT IS, IF YOU CONSIDER JAIL
A CUCKOO'S NEST.

1718
01:33:14,367 --> 01:33:17,501
FEDERAL CHARGES WERE DROPPED,
AND THE LAST OBSTACLE,

1719
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:21,501
SAN FRANCISCO BAIL, WAS SET
AT $3,500 PLUS PENALTIES.

1720
01:33:22,767 --> 01:33:26,367
KESEY WILL BE BACK IN COURT
NOVEMBER 9th, HOPEFULLY.

1721
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:28,734
IN THE MEANTIME,
HE WILL TELL THE TEENAGE WORLD

1722
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:30,734
OF THE EVILS OF DRUGS

1723
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:32,801
AND PROBABLY DESCRIBE
A LONG TRIP.

1724
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:35,834
ARE YOU REPUDIATING LSD
AND OTHER HALLUCINATORY DRUGS?

1725
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:38,267
THERE'S ENOUGH LSD
AROUND NOW

1726
01:33:38,267 --> 01:33:40,801
AND ENOUGH
YOUNG KIDS AROUND

1727
01:33:40,801 --> 01:33:43,167
WHO ARE ABLE
TO MANUFACTURE THIS

1728
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:46,200
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

1729
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,834
FOR THE POLICE
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

1730
01:33:47,834 --> 01:33:51,200
YOU THINK THIS NEW LAW
IS TURNING THEM OFF, THEN?

1731
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,868
I DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF,

1732
01:33:53,868 --> 01:33:55,767
BUT I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE
TO MOVE THEM ON.

1733
01:33:55,767 --> 01:33:57,367
DO YOU CONSIDER
YOURSELF

1734
01:33:57,367 --> 01:34:00,734
BECOMING ONE OF US SQUARES,
PERHAPS?

1735
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:03,033
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

1736
01:34:03,033 --> 01:34:08,400
THE COMMENCEMENT
EXERCISES FOR LSDU

1737
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,400
WILL BE HELD
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

1738
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,734
THAT'S HALLOWEEN.

1739
01:34:11,734 --> 01:34:13,601
AND, OF COURSE,
THE MAN WHO IS GOING TO BE

1740
01:34:13,601 --> 01:34:16,767
PASSING OUT THE DIPLOMAS
IS KEN KESEY.

1741
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:20,934
KEN, WHAT'S THE THEME
OF THIS COMMENCEMENT EXERCISE?

1742
01:34:20,934 --> 01:34:23,200
TRIP OR TREAT.

1743
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,100
WHEN I FIRST PROPOSED THE IDEA
TO JERRY GARCIA,

1744
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,534
THE LEADER
OF THE GRATEFUL DEAD,

1745
01:34:28,534 --> 01:34:31,033
WHO'S PLAYING
UP THERE NOW,

1746
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:34,634
THAT IT'S TIME
TO GRADUATE FROM ACID,

1747
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:36,000
HE SAYS, "HALLELUJAH."

1748
01:34:43,634 --> 01:34:45,734
IT WAS A TEST, AND THERE
WERE PEOPLE THAT PASSED,

1749
01:34:45,734 --> 01:34:50,300
AND THERE WERE PEOPLE
THAT <i>DIDN'T</i> PASS.

1750
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,300
AND WE GAVE OUT DIPLOMAS
FOR PEOPLE

1751
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,567
THAT WE FELT LIKE
REALLY HAD PASSED IT.

1752
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,901
ARE YOU A MEMBER
OF THE GRADUATING CLASS TONIGHT?

1753
01:34:58,901 --> 01:35:02,000
NO, I FLUNKED
THE ACID TEST.

1754
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,934
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT
DOING THAT?

1755
01:35:04,934 --> 01:35:09,100
WELL, THE STIPULATIONS
THAT KEN PUT UP, I DIDN'T PASS.

1756
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,801
WE WENT WILD FOR A WHILE.

1757
01:35:11,801 --> 01:35:16,934
WE WENT WILD BECAUSE WE'D BEEN
CAGED UP FOR 50,000 YEARS.

1758
01:35:16,934 --> 01:35:18,200
WE WENT WILD AND FOUND OUT

1759
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,701
THERE WAS MORE THAN WE
HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.

1760
01:35:20,701 --> 01:35:24,067
AND NOW, UNLESS WE START
FINDING THE LITTLE PIECE OF IT

1761
01:35:24,067 --> 01:35:26,234
THAT WE CALL THE REINS,

1762
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:27,634
IT'S GONNA GET AWAY FROM US.

1763
01:35:27,634 --> 01:35:30,767
THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN
YOU STOP TAKING ACID,

1764
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,167
BUT YOU STOP
REPEATING THE TRIPS.

1765
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:38,067
EVERY HEAD KNOWS
THAT HE TAKES A DRUG

1766
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:40,868
TO EVENTUALLY STOP TAKING IT,

1767
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:44,868
AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR
A GREAT NUMBER OF THEM TO STOP.

1768
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,300
I BELIEVE THAT DRUGS HAVE NOW
BECOME A FASHION.

1769
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,901
THE HAIGHT SCENE
HAS CHANGED, ALL RIGHT.

1770
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:59,701
THE FLOWER NOT ONLY HAS WILTED,
IT'S DEAD.

1771
01:35:59,701 --> 01:36:03,267
* GOING TO LEAVE *

1772
01:36:03,267 --> 01:36:07,334
* THIS BROKEDOWN PALACE *

1773
01:36:07,334 --> 01:36:11,734
* ON MY HANDS AND MY KNEES *

1774
01:36:11,734 --> 01:36:16,434
* I WILL ROLL, ROLL, ROLL *

1775
01:36:16,434 --> 01:36:19,300
THE HIPPIES IS OFTEN
A STRANGE WORLD

1776
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,634
IN WHICH THEY LIVE IN.

1777
01:36:20,634 --> 01:36:22,434
THEY TAKE MANY TRIPS.

1778
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:32,067
AND THE TRIP OF A HIPPIE
IS GENERALLY AN UNUSUAL ONE.

1779
01:36:32,067 --> 01:36:36,801
AND MARIJUANA, OF COURSE,
WITH LSD,

1780
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:38,467
IS BEING USED.

1781
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,901
ALL OF THESE DRUGS WERE BEING
FED INTO THE CULTURE BY THE CIA.

1782
01:36:49,901 --> 01:36:51,868
THE LSD WAS NOT
THE WHOLE STORY.

1783
01:36:51,868 --> 01:36:53,968
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT FOR A LONG
TIME WHILE ALLEN GINSBERG SAYS,

1784
01:36:53,968 --> 01:36:55,801
"YOU KNOW WHO WAS PAYING
FOR THAT WAS THE CIA."

1785
01:36:55,801 --> 01:36:58,267
I SAID, "OH NO, ALLEN,
YOU'RE JUST PARANOID."

1786
01:36:58,267 --> 01:36:59,868
BUT HE FINALLY GOT
ALL THE RECORDS,

1787
01:36:59,868 --> 01:37:02,000
AND IT DID TURN OUT THE CIA
WAS DOING THIS,

1788
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,667
AND IT WASN'T BEING DONE
TO TRY TO CURE INSANE PEOPLE,

1789
01:37:05,667 --> 01:37:07,167
WHICH IS WHAT WE THOUGHT.

1790
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:09,434
IT WAS BEING DONE
TO WEAKEN PEOPLE

1791
01:37:09,434 --> 01:37:13,701
AND TO BE ABLE TO PUT THEM UNDER
THE CONTROL OF INTERROGATORS.

1792
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,501
I WAS SO NAIVE.

1793
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:20,734
I BELIEVED THESE DOCTORS KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

1794
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:23,701
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

1795
01:37:23,701 --> 01:37:26,734
HOW COULD THEY MAKE A MISTAKE?

1796
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:31,901
* FARE YOU WELL *

1797
01:37:31,901 --> 01:37:33,701
* FARE YOU WELL *

1798
01:37:33,701 --> 01:37:37,801
* I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN WORDS CAN TELL *

1799
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:39,467
* LISTEN TO THE RIVER *

1800
01:37:39,467 --> 01:37:44,667
* SING SWEET SONGS
TO ROCK MY SOUL *

1801
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:48,133
* DOO-DOO-DOO *

1802
01:37:48,133 --> 01:37:50,133
* DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO *

1803
01:37:50,133 --> 01:37:53,067
WE FINALLY GOT OUT OF JAIL.

1804
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:55,934
WE WERE PERFECTLY WILLING
TO LEAVE

1805
01:37:55,934 --> 01:37:57,434
THAT WHOLE AREA DOWN THERE,

1806
01:37:57,434 --> 01:38:03,167
WHICH OFFERED EXCITEMENT
BUT NO STABILITY.

1807
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,667
IT'S FUNNY --
IN YOUR PRANKSTER DAYS,

1808
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:20,267
YOU WERE SEEN AS BEING
PART OF A GROUP

1809
01:38:20,267 --> 01:38:23,534
THAT HAD MADE SUCH
A BREAK WITH THE PAST,

1810
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:25,934
AND YET HERE YOU ARE LIVING
ON A FAMILY FARM,

1811
01:38:25,934 --> 01:38:27,634
YOU'RE, I BELIEVE,
STILL MARRIED TO THE WOMAN

1812
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:31,033
WHO YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED TO
SINCE -- WHAT IS IT, 1956?

1813
01:38:31,033 --> 01:38:32,300
LONG TIME, YEAH.

1814
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:33,634
YEAH, SO, I MEAN,
THERE'S BEEN THIS

1815
01:38:33,634 --> 01:38:35,467
INCREDIBLE CONTINUITY
IN YOUR LIFE

1816
01:38:35,467 --> 01:38:37,367
BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT,
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

1817
01:38:37,367 --> 01:38:39,801
YEAH.

1818
01:38:39,801 --> 01:38:43,067
MY WIFE AND I
MET IN JUNIOR HIGH,

1819
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,367
AND ALL OF OUR FAMILIES
ARE STILL VERY CLOSE.

1820
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:50,534
THIS SCHISM BETWEEN
THIS ONE CONSCIOUSNESS

1821
01:38:50,534 --> 01:38:52,033
AND THIS CONSCIOUSNESS,

1822
01:38:52,033 --> 01:38:55,734
I BELIEVE, HAS BEEN
ARBITRARILY FORCED ON US.

1823
01:38:55,734 --> 01:38:58,901
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A FAIRLY RELIABLE,

1824
01:38:58,901 --> 01:39:01,267
"STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROAD" CITIZEN

1825
01:39:01,267 --> 01:39:04,834
THAT JUST HAPPENS
TO BE AN ACIDHEAD.

1826
01:39:07,701 --> 01:39:09,467
KEN'S A BORN LEADER.

1827
01:39:09,467 --> 01:39:12,067
I MEAN, HE'S GOT JUST CHARISMA
COMING OUT OF HIS EARS.

1828
01:39:12,067 --> 01:39:14,934
CASSADY WAS NOT
THAT KIND OF PERSON.

1829
01:39:14,934 --> 01:39:16,400
HE REALLY WASN'T.

1830
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,300
ONCE HE DIDN'T
HAVE THE BUS TO DRIVE,

1831
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,701
OR A FUNCTION, HE WAS --

1832
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:23,601
HE WAS REALLY LIKE A LIABILITY.

1833
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:26,100
YOU'VE HEARD THE STORIES
ABOUT HIM AND ANNE MURPHY.

1834
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,868
OH, DON'T YOU KNOW THIS?
OH, GOD.

1835
01:39:28,868 --> 01:39:32,234
THEY WERE ON A HEAVY,
SADO-MASOCHIST TRIP.

1836
01:39:32,234 --> 01:39:35,534
I'M REALLY OLD-FASHIONED WHEN
IT COMES TO STUFF LIKE THAT.

1837
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:38,334
I DON'T THINK A RELATIONSHIP
IS WORTH JACK SHIT

1838
01:39:38,334 --> 01:39:40,434
IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING THINGS
GOOD AND HAPPY.

1839
01:39:40,434 --> 01:39:43,167
COMPARE THIS WITH KEN AND FAYE.

1840
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:44,968
THEY'VE BEEN GOOD
FOR EACH OTHER.

1841
01:39:44,968 --> 01:39:47,567
SEE, THEY --
THEY TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

1842
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,501
THEY DON'T LET EACH OTHER
JUST GO DOWNHILL

1843
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:51,467
AND GET MORE AND MORE FUCKED UP.

1844
01:39:51,467 --> 01:39:55,000
ON THE CONTRARY, THEY TAKE
GOOD CARE OF EACH OTHER.

1845
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,234
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO LEARN
THAT CASSADY WAS FOUND DEAD

1846
01:39:59,234 --> 01:40:01,601
BESIDE THE RAILROAD TRACKS
IN MEXICO?

1847
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:03,434
WHEN HE DIED,
I FELT LIKE

1848
01:40:03,434 --> 01:40:07,000
THAT HE'D ACCIDENTALLY
KILLED HIMSELF ON PURPOSE.

1849
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,133
I CAN PICTURE MYSELF
IN HIS SHOES EXACTLY,

1850
01:40:10,133 --> 01:40:13,167
AND THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE
TO GO, REALLY.

1851
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:15,934
MIGHT AS WELL MEET THE ANGELS.

1852
01:40:35,834 --> 01:40:38,534
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU
DECIDE TO GIVE UP

1853
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:40,033
THE KIND OF
PRANKSTERS LIFE?

1854
01:40:40,033 --> 01:40:41,534
THE STORY
THAT I'VE HEARD

1855
01:40:41,534 --> 01:40:43,434
IS THE PRANKSTERS
WENT TO WOODSTOCK.

1856
01:40:43,434 --> 01:40:44,934
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

1857
01:40:44,934 --> 01:40:46,234
AND WHEN
THEY CAME BACK,

1858
01:40:46,234 --> 01:40:48,167
THEY CAME BACK TO A SIGN
HUNG IN YOUR DRIVEWAY

1859
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,834
THAT JUST SAID, "NO."

1860
01:40:49,834 --> 01:40:52,467
WELL, THERE WAS 61 PEOPLE WHEN
THEY HEADED OUT TO WOODSTOCK,

1861
01:40:52,467 --> 01:40:54,767
AND AFTER
THEY WERE GONE,

1862
01:40:54,767 --> 01:40:56,601
I WENT UPSTAIRS --
AND WE LIVE IN A BARN.

1863
01:40:56,601 --> 01:41:00,033
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS STILL
HAY IN THE LOFT OF THE BARN,

1864
01:41:00,033 --> 01:41:02,334
AND I FOUND ONE OF THESE
LITTLE HIPPIE WARRENS,

1865
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:04,501
WHERE THEY DUG IN WITH THEIR
RATTY OLD SLEEPING BAGS

1866
01:41:04,501 --> 01:41:06,133
AND THEIR COPY
OF <i>ZAP</i> MAGAZINE.

1867
01:41:06,133 --> 01:41:08,501
AND STUCK RIGHT DOWN
IN THE HAY BALE

1868
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:11,334
WAS A CANDLE WHICH HAD BURNED
RIGHT DOWN TO THE HAY

1869
01:41:11,334 --> 01:41:12,734
BEFORE IT'D GONE OFF,

1870
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:14,234
AND I THOUGHT,
"THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS

1871
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:16,067
THAT TAKE PRECEDENT
OVER ENLIGHTENMENT."

1872
01:41:16,067 --> 01:41:18,100
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SENT
EVERYBODY HOME, BASICALLY.

1873
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,601
YEAH.

1874
01:41:23,133 --> 01:41:25,901
HOW MUCH WRITING HAVE
YOU BEEN DOING OVER
THE PAST FEW YEARS?

1875
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:27,767
OH, QUITE A LOT.
I WRITE ALL THE TIME.

1876
01:41:27,767 --> 01:41:29,801
I JUST DON'T PUBLISH
THAT MUCH.

1877
01:41:29,801 --> 01:41:32,567
I'VE GOT FOUR KIDS

1878
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:34,167
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF THE SAME ENERGY

1879
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:35,634
THAT GOES INTO RAISING A FAMILY

1880
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:39,734
THAT GOES INTO PUTTING A BOOK
TOGETHER LIKE "NOTION."

1881
01:41:43,501 --> 01:41:45,968
WHICH, ONCE YOU GET
A LOT OF STUFF IN THE AIR,

1882
01:41:45,968 --> 01:41:47,901
YOU CAN'T STOP
BECAUSE YOU'LL FORGET IT.

1883
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:52,968
AND THAT KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS
I HAVE NOT HAD,

1884
01:41:52,968 --> 01:41:55,267
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE...

1885
01:41:55,267 --> 01:41:57,000
YOU KNOW,
I'M RUNNING A BIG FARM.

1886
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,868
THAT'S WHAT OCCUPIES MY MIND.

1887
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:01,133
EITHER THAT
OR I FRIED MY MARBLES,

1888
01:42:01,133 --> 01:42:03,501
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY THINKS.

1889
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,767
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHAT I THINK MY BEST WORK IS,

1890
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:15,734
I ALWAYS SAY THE BUS.

1891
01:42:15,734 --> 01:42:17,434
NOVELS ARE A DIME A DOZEN,

1892
01:42:17,434 --> 01:42:20,234
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE BUS
FURTHER.

1893
01:42:23,834 --> 01:42:25,434
WHAT IT MEANT

1894
01:42:25,434 --> 01:42:28,334
WAS THAT EVERYBODY
HAD TO CONSIDER

1895
01:42:28,334 --> 01:42:30,634
A NEW WAY FOR THINGS TO BE.

1896
01:42:32,501 --> 01:42:35,133
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT WE'RE ALL ONE?

1897
01:42:37,367 --> 01:42:39,501
THE DEEPER I GOT INTO IT,

1898
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:42,834
THE MORE I REALIZED IT WAS
A DIFFERENT FORCE WORKING.

1899
01:42:45,267 --> 01:42:48,534
THE ONLY BIG MISTAKE
WE EVER MADE, AS A FORCE,

1900
01:42:48,534 --> 01:42:52,467
WAS THINKING FOR A WHILE
THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIN.

1901
01:42:52,467 --> 01:42:56,601
WE DEVELOPED VESTED INTERESTS
IN THE VICTORY TO COME.

1902
01:42:56,601 --> 01:42:59,634
WE BEGIN TO PARCEL OFF
INTO LITTLE GROUPS,

1903
01:42:59,634 --> 01:43:02,534
WHETHER IT'S FEMINISM
OR POLITICS,

1904
01:43:02,534 --> 01:43:04,267
FOR MONEY, RELIGION.

1905
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:05,601
WHATEVER IT IS,

1906
01:43:05,601 --> 01:43:08,567
EVERYBODY IS JUMPING UP AND DOWN
IN FRONT OF IT

1907
01:43:08,567 --> 01:43:11,033
UNTIL NOBODY
CAN SEE IT CLEAR ANYMORE.

1908
01:43:13,834 --> 01:43:16,467
NOW, IF WE'D NEVER
MADE THAT MISTAKE,

1909
01:43:16,467 --> 01:43:17,801
WE'D BEEN WAY AHEAD,

1910
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:21,067
AND THIS IS KIND OF WHY
I'M RETIRING FROM THE RANKS.

1911
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:30,701
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS THAT WE'RE MEANT TO LOSE...

1912
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:32,033
EVERY TIME.

1913
01:43:32,033 --> 01:43:34,667
YOU MAKE THESE FORAYS,
YOU WRITE THESE BOOKS,

1914
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,133
AND YOU PERFORM THIS MUSIC,

1915
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:39,000
BUT THE BIG JUGGERNAUT
OF CIVILIZATION CONTINUES,

1916
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,934
AND YOU GET
KIND OF BRUSHED TO THE SIDE.

1917
01:43:40,934 --> 01:43:42,534
BUT I THINK,
ALL THROUGH HISTORY,

1918
01:43:42,534 --> 01:43:46,067
THERE'S BEEN
THESE KIND OF DIVINE LOSERS

1919
01:43:46,067 --> 01:43:49,400
THAT JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND GO AHEAD,

1920
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,968
KNOWING THAT SOCIETY'S
NOT GONNA UNDERSTAND IT,

1921
01:43:51,968 --> 01:43:54,767
NOT EVEN CARING, 'CAUSE
THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1922
01:44:02,501 --> 01:44:08,133
* SOMETIMES THE LIGHT'S
ALL SHININ' ON ME *

1923
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:15,300
* OTHER TIMES
I CAN BARELY SEE *

1924
01:44:17,701 --> 01:44:22,934
* LATELY IT OCCURS TO ME *

1925
01:44:22,934 --> 01:44:30,267
* WHAT A LONG, STRANGE TRIP
IT'S BEEN *

1926
01:44:35,334 --> 01:44:38,834
* TRUCKIN',

1927
01:44:38,834 --> 01:44:43,033

1928
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:47,100
* TOGETHER,
MORE OR LESS IN LINE *

1929
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:52,400
* JUST KEEP TRUCKIN' ON *

1930
01:44:58,868 --> 01:45:02,234
* ARROWS OF NEON AND FLASHING
MARQUEES OUT ON MAIN STREET *

1931
01:45:02,234 --> 01:45:03,734
* CHICAGO, NEW YORK, DETROIT *

1932
01:45:03,734 --> 01:45:06,000
* AND IT'S ALL
ON THE SAME STREET *

1933
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,934
* YOUR TYPICAL CITY
INVOLVED IN A TYPICAL DAYDREAM *

1934
01:45:09,934 --> 01:45:13,968
* HANG IT UP AND SEE
WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS *

1935
01:45:13,968 --> 01:45:18,067
* DALLAS, GOT A SOFT MACHINE *

1936
01:45:18,067 --> 01:45:21,968

TOO CLOSE TO NEW ORLEANS *

1937

* NEW YORK,
GOT THE WAYS AND MEANS *

1938
01:45:25,567 --> 01:45:30,901
* THAT JUST WON'T LET YOU BE *

1939

* MOST OF THE CATS
THAT YOU MEET ON THE STREETS *

1940
01:45:38,801 --> 01:45:40,701
* SPEAK OF TRUE LOVE *

1941
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:44,334

1942

* ONE OF THESE DAYS
THEY KNOW THEY GOTTA GET GOIN' *

1943
01:45:48,167 --> 01:45:52,334

ON THE STREET ALL ALONE *

1944
01:45:52,334 --> 01:45:56,133
* TRUCKIN',
LIKE THE DOO-DAH MAN *

1945
