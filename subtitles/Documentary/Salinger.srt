1
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,724
So it's 1979.

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,605
I'm 20 years old.

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,108
I get an assignment
from 'Newsweek' magazine

4
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,269
to photograph this author.

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,153
I'm like, "Great."

6
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,610
And they were like, "It's not
quite that easy this time, Mike,

7
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,320
"because he doesn't like
to be photographed.

8
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,703
"We don't have an address or
a telephone number to give you,

9
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,740
"but we do know he picks up
his mail in Windsor, Vermont."

10
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,035
So the first day, after
sitting here for four hours,

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,922
drinking Pepsi and eating
Cheetos, making myself sick...

12
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,792
...didn't happen.

13
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,177
I decided, "It's 5:30.
The post office is closed.

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,337
"Nobody's gonna come
get their mail that day."

15
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,804
Then I just walked the streets
of Hanover late at night.

16
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,391
Started to wonder
if somebody tipped him off.

17
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,521
So the next day, I came back.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,774
One man came out
of the post office.

19
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,776
I photographed him, wrote down
the license plate number,

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,778
but it wasn't him.

21
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,359
So I waited.

22
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,447
And then this Jeep pulls up,
but I don't see his face.

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,659
He gets out and he goes into
the post office really quickly,

24
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,415
and as he came back out...

25
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,336
Newsroom.

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,300
McDERMOTT: I got it.

27
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,932
I got Salinger.

28
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,752
Thinking back on the guys
who sat around the poker table,

29
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:53,220
what distinguished Jerry
out of that pack was that

30
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:58,309
there was in him no doubt
he was going to be published,

31
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,189
no doubt that he had
an enormous talent

32
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,568
and no doubt that everybody else
at the poker table

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,728
was inferior to him.

34
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,899
His work was ordained by God.

35
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:14,741
His work was his way
to enlightenment.

36
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:19,158
He was put on this earth
to work, to write.

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,122
'Catcher in the Rye'
caught my attention

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,957
when it first came out.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,043
There had not been
a voice like that -

40
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,503
so personal, so revealing.

41
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,259
It seemed like somebody

42
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,341
stripping the layers
away from his soul.

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,554
It said on the cover, "This
book will change your life."

44
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,223
And I bought the book,
but I was afraid to read it

45
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,813
because I didn't
want my life changed.

46
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,569
It's magical - you're a little
like, "How'd he do that?

47
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,776
"How did he put it
all together that way?"

48
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,157
And lead me through it
in such a way

49
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,819
that I would just land like
that in that final statement,

50
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,705
where you're just
so grateful to him

51
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,334
and you wanna go find him -
like you're doing now.

52
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,331
It is
an extraordinary phenomenon

53
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,797
how many millions and millions
and millions of people

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,552
came to that book.

55
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,464
'Catcher in the Rye' has
sold 60 million copies.

56
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,724
That's an unprecedented figure.

57
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,308
And continues to sell, by
the way, 250,000 copies a year.

58
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,100
It's defined who we are
as an American culture.

59
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,112
A long-lost sibling had arrived,
and it was Holden Caulfield,

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,989
and he became
part of our conversation.

61
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,650
Like a whole generation,

62
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,443
I thought he was
writing about me.

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,238
To be on the cover
of 'Time' magazine in 1961

64
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,283
was something that went to
statesmen and Nobel Laureates.

65
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,122
"You owe us another book.

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,286
"I mean, after all,
we rewarded you

67
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,296
"with fame, with money.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,957
"We said you're one of

69
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,716
"the important writers
of the century.

70
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,502
"Now, come on,
let's have some more."

71
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,136
And then he doesn't give it.

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,922
"How dare you
turn your back on us?

73
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,682
"We're your fans. You've
gotten inside our heads."

74
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,014
The great mystery is
why he stopped.

75
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,310
Jerry had
scaled heights, big success.

76
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,147
At the height of that success,
he disappears.

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,859
I've heard that
he has a huge bunker.

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,399
There has been a rumour
for many years

79
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,364
that Salinger
continues to write.

80
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,996
And there would be
long stretches of time

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,623
where he wouldn't come out
of the bunker at all.

82
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,956
He sort of became
the Howard Hughes of his day.

83
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,774
- Mr A.E.
- Oh, there he is!

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,614
- How the hell did you get here?
- How are you? My God.

85
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,370
It was the year
after the war ended,

86
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,873
and the only person I knew
who had a job

87
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,329
was a man named Don Congdon,

88
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,745
who was the fiction editor
of 'Collier's magazine.

89
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,539
And we used to play poker,
maybe twice a week -

90
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,959
nickels and dimes,
not much of a game.

91
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:21,258
And one of the players was
a tall, lanky, dark gentleman

92
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,551
named Jerry Salinger.

93
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,096
Do you remember down here with
Jerry? After the poker games?

94
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,730
- Well, of course. Yeah.
- Yeah?

95
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,687
The end of the evening,

96
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,773
we would go over
to Chumley's bar and grill,

97
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,779
which is an old, old
hangout for writers.

98
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,611
So everybody in here
was convinced that

99
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,491
they were the next Hemingway
or whatever,

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,073
except for Salinger, who didn't
wanna be the next Hemingway.

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,238
Jerry himself said,

102
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,955
"There's been no great writers
from Melville until me."

103
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,666
He dismissed everybody -
Theodore Dreiser,

104
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,082
Hemingway, Steinbeck - they were
all second-rate talents.

105
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,546
And then it dawned on me -
of all those writers,

106
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,757
Herman Melville was
the only one that was dead,

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,672
so it was all right.

108
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,849
He was the only writer
I ever knew

109
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,560
who talked about his characters
as if they were real people.

110
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,565
And it was very strange,
this thing,

111
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,399
because he made them
real in his stories,

112
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,780
they became real for him.

113
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,237
And because they were
so real for him,

114
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,697
I began to think of them
as real,

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,329
I began to see them as real.

116
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,332
His attitude,
and he lived as if

117
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,664
he was really one of us -

118
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,875
scrabbling and trying to
get along best as we could.

119
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,416
And I was pretty shocked
to discover that

120
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,334
he literally lived
with his parents

121
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,095
in a very posh apartment
on Park Avenue,

122
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,349
that he had been to a succession
of posh eastern schools -

123
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,055
kicked out of most of them -

124
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,768
that he really came from
a country club society.

125
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,729
But it didn't seem to make
any difference with him.

126
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,065
He wasn't impressed at all
with the life that he had lived.

127
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,356
And I think that all
becomes very apparent

128
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,366
when eventually he writes
the one book that he writes,

129
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,277
and that's 'Catcher in the Rye'.

130
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,578
Salinger's father, Solomon,

131
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,246
was the son of a rabbi,

132
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,292
an importer of cheese
and meats - very unkosher.

133
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,926
His mother was Catholic -
her name was Marie,

134
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,632
which she changed to Miriam

135
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,049
to be accepted by
her husband's Jewish family.

136
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,060
He was very down on education.

137
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,893
"Don't believe everything
your professors say.

138
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,682
"They're just giving you
information.

139
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,194
"Get your own information
on your own terms."

140
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,480
I think
that Salinger understood

141
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,398
something about the culture

142
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,739
long before the culture
understood it about itself.

143
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,575
He saw fakes everywhere.

144
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,615
A woman asked Salinger,

145
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,830
"Mr Salinger, what does
the 'J.D.' stand for?"

146
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,839
And he smiled sheepishly and
said, "Juvenile delinquent."

147
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,842
After getting
kicked out of prep school,

148
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,878
his father decided
he needed discipline,

149
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,592
he needed structure,

150
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,133
and he shipped him off
to a military academy.

151
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,890
Valley Forge is important

152
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,559
for two real reasons.

153
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,318
Number one - that's where

154
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,445
Salinger really
got his act together.

155
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,608
And number two - that's where
Salinger first began to write.

156
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,950
Salinger wrote at night
by flashlight under the covers.

157
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,705
He was always writing.

158
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,538
What I have here
is J.D. Salinger's yearbook

159
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,998
from the Valley Forge
Military Academy.

160
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,038
It's an extraordinary item.

161
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,299
He signed it not only
in his own name

162
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,006
but he signed the names of
the characters that he played

163
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,341
in the various plays
in which he performed,

164
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,132
because he wanted
to be an actor.

165
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,596
When he was in high school,

166
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,603
he announced that his ambition
was to succeed Robert Benchley

167
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,856
as the theatre critic
for the 'New Yorker'.

168
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,068
His father thought
it was ridiculous

169
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,774
that he was going to write,

170
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,610
'cause his father
very much wanted him

171
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,524
to join him
in the cheese business,

172
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,692
which he had
no intention to do,

173
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,954
and I think that caused
a lot of friction.

174
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,583
His mother, on the other hand,
approved of everything he did.

175
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,636
Salinger enrolled in

176
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,514
Whit Burnett's
short story class at Columbia.

177
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,051
It was a very important move
for Salinger.

178
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,562
Whit Burnett was also editor
of 'Story' magazine.

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,348
'Story' magazine
published the very first work

180
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,940
of an extraordinary number
of American writers -

181
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,322
John Cheever, Carson McCullers,
Tennessee Williams,

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,235
Erskine Caldwell,
Jean Stafford, Peter de Vries.

183
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,621
Whit Burnett
ended up being a father-figure.

184
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,407
And based on
Burnett's encouragement,

185
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,704
Salinger went home and wrote a
story called 'The Young Folks'.

186
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,291
And much to
Salinger's surprise,

187
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,301
Burnett accepted the story
for 'Story' magazine

188
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,929
and paid him $25.

189
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,434
It was the first money J.D.
Salinger ever made as a writer.

190
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,478
Salinger always had
one goal in mind -

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,483
he wanted to be
in the 'New Yorker'.

192
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,236
The 'New Yorker'
was considered the best place

193
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,818
for a writer to be published
in terms of prestige

194
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,483
for the simple reason that

195
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,276
it was hard to
get published there.

196
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:38,165
J.D. Salinger's entrance
into 'New Yorker' was not easy.

197
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,577
The response to
Salinger's early stuff

198
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,416
was one word - no.

199
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,125
- No.
- No.

200
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,086
You can go to the
'New Yorker' archives

201
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,875
in the New York Public Library

202
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,295
and read rejection
after rejection.

203
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,589
"It would have worked out
better for us

204
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,010
"if Mr Salinger had not
strained so for cleverness."

205
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,895
"We think Mr Salinger
is a very talented young man

206
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,897
"and wish to God you could

207
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,229
"get him to write
simply and naturally."

208
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,941
"If Mr Salinger is around town,
perhaps he'd like to come in

209
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,652
"and talk to us about
'New Yorker' stories."

210
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,948
His reaction
was, "They want me to write

211
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,866
"an O. Henry type
of short story,

212
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,377
"but I have to find
my own voice, and this is it,

213
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,912
"and they'll catch up to me."

214
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,128
He wrote a letter
to Wolcott Gibbs, the editor,

215
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,543
where he took
the 'New Yorker' to task

216
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:37,057
for not really publishing
major, big short stories.

217
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,058
He said they were too tiny.

218
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,016
I mean,
this was a kid lecturing

219
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,148
the editors of the 'New Yorker'
on what they should publish.

220
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,101
He was published
in other magazines.

221
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,770
It wasn't good enough.

222
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,609
He was determined -

223
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,773
"The 'New Yorker'
was going to publish me."

224
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,783
And, by George, they did.

225
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,582
He had a story accepted
in 1941, towards the end,

226
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,038
called
'Slight Rebellion Off Madison',

227
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,624
about a kid named
Holden Caulfield.

228
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,219
December 7, 1941.

229
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,137
A date which
will live in infamy.

230
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,268
Before they could get it
into the magazine,

231
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,100
World War II broke out,

232
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,105
and suddenly
this wonderful story

233
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,141
about a young man
named Holden Caulfield

234
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,185
and this personal rebellion
he was going through

235
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,319
seemed trivial
and beside the point

236
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,572
and, you know, it just
didn't seem appropriate

237
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,450
to put in the magazine,
and so they put it on the shelf.

238
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,578
And Jerry
was infuriated at this.

239
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,990
That was
his whole thrust in life,

240
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,330
was to be published
by the 'New Yorker'.

241
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,255
"A man is in Cornish.

242
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,722
"Amateur, perhaps,
but sentimentally connected.

243
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:07,390
"The saddest - a tragic figure
without a background.

244
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,525
"Needing a future
as much as your past.

245
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,606
"Let me."

246
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,397
I wrote this note
to J.D. Salinger

247
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,907
which I thought that
only he could understand,

248
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,115
practically begging him
for an audience.

249
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,451
Do I go left here?
'Cause I don't go left.

250
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,834
There's been
countless fans now for decades

251
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,539
who have done this.

252
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,047
They leave notes for him, they
go up to his house unannounced,

253
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,833
they knock on his front door.

254
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,128
They're showing up to try
to find out from Salinger

255
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,548
some answer
to something in their lives.

256
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,896
1978, I remember driving
on this road alone

257
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,026
feeling very lonely,
next to the Connecticut River,

258
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,108
hoping that J.D. Salinger,
my hero,

259
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,695
would give me
a few minutes of his time.

260
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,030
One day, I said to my wife,
"I've gotta try it.

261
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,821
"I've gotta go,"
and I kissed her goodbye

262
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,787
and drove 450 miles to the
Vermont/New Hampshire border

263
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,419
and tried to find him.

264
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,796
I knew this was a hard thing
because I found

265
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,707
the neighbourhood people
protected him,

266
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,548
and they wouldn't exactly
tell me where he lived.

267
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,213
He may be the only writer
in American history

268
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,599
who's created
such a story around himself

269
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,135
that just catching
a glimpse of him

270
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,680
becomes an important experience
in your own life.

271
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,440
I drove about six miles to where
I thought Salinger lived.

272
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,320
I wasn't 100% sure.

273
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,239
I knew that he lived
on top of this mountain,

274
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,746
this wise man living in this
cabin in the White Mountains.

275
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,500
So I waited below this long,
winding gravel driveway

276
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,756
where I thought he lived.

277
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,128
Sure enough,
probably in the midmorning,

278
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,888
two cars
came down the driveway.

279
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,390
One was his son,
Matt Salinger, a teenager.

280
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,553
And J.D. Salinger
stopped his car, his BMW,

281
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,519
got out, walked over
to the driver's side.

282
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,351
I said,
"Are you J.D. Salinger?"

283
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,235
Because I did not recognise him
from the photographs.

284
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,192
He says, "Yes.
What can I do for you?"

285
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,901
I said to him very dramatically,

286
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,566
"I was hoping
you could tell me."

287
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,202
And he said, "Oh, come on.
Don't start that kind of thing.

288
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,158
"Are you under
psychiatric care?"

289
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,118
And he got out of that BMW
in the middle of the forest -

290
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,788
to me, it was almost like
he stepped out of a dream.

291
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,584
He talked about my life as if
it was as important as his life.

292
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,844
He asked me
why I left my family,

293
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,723
why I drove 450 miles,
why I left my job,

294
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,009
and I said to him
it was his writing.

295
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,677
I thought he felt like I did

296
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,096
and I wanted to talk to him
about deep things.

297
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,980
Then he kind of got
very frustrated.

298
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,062
And then he stepped back
from my car.

299
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,727
It was almost like
he grew six inches.

300
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,315
"I'm a fiction writer.

301
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,230
"For all you know,
I'm just a father.

302
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,114
"You saw my son
go down the road.

303
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,071
"I'm not a teacher or seer.

304
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,158
"There's people come and see me
like you every year,

305
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,369
"from all over North America,
from Canada, from Europe.

306
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,830
"I've had to run
from people on the street.

307
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,665
"There's nothing
I can tell these people

308
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,670
"to help them
with their problems.

309
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,800
"I may present questions
in my writing in a certain way,

310
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,212
"but I don't pretend
to know the answers."

311
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,131
He was sick of it.
He'd had 25 years of this.

312
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,426
He said, "Do you have any other
income besides your writing?"

313
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,061
Because I told him I wanted
to become a published author.

314
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,813
I told him I was a reporter.

315
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,022
He got a little bit angry,
got into his car and drove off.

316
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,233
And as I sat there,
I felt that I blew it,

317
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,616
my chance to talk intimately
with J.D. Salinger.

318
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,580
I sat in my own car, writing him
another note, telling him

319
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,331
that I was
a little disappointed -

320
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,494
I'd driven all this way and he'd
only given me a few minutes.

321
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,413
And as I was finishing the note,
he came back in his car.

322
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,127
And he says,
"Haven't you left yet?"

323
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,167
And I said, "No,
I was just gonna actually

324
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,301
"pin this note up
by your door."

325
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,134
He says, "Well, come over here
and give it to me."

326
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,144
I gave him the note.
His face became long and drawn.

327
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,849
"Jerry, I'm sorry.

328
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,106
"It was probably a mistake
coming to Cornish.

329
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,687
"You're not as deep,
as sentimental as I had hoped,

330
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,273
"the person who wrote
those books I love."

331
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,236
And then that seemed to defuse
his frustration from earlier,

332
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,153
and he says, "Well, I understand
it, but I'm not a counsellor.

333
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,447
"I'm a fiction writer."

334
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:48,007
In 1941,
J.D. Salinger was 21 years old,

335
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,922
living with his parents
in New York City,

336
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,059
when he met Oona O'Neill,
who was then 16 years old.

337
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,222
Salinger was absolutely floored
with her beauty.

338
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,981
- Say something!
- What?

339
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,392
It's a silent film.

340
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,026
- Is it silent?
- Yes.

341
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,062
What'll I say?
Shall I turn over here?

342
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,573
- No, turn around there now.
- All right.

343
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:14,033
Oona O'Neill was the daughter
of Eugene O'Neill,

344
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:18,701
still America's only
Nobel Prize-winning dramatist.

345
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,745
He was a dedicated genius

346
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,336
and a really rotten father.

347
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,421
And he always said
his real children

348
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,257
were his characters
in his plays.

349
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,968
Oona O'Neill was someone

350
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,053
who was clearly
attracted to genius.

351
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,015
Between the ages of 16 and 18,

352
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,102
Oona dated Peter Arno,
Orson Welles

353
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,232
and then J.D. Salinger.

354
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:48,647
It's interesting
to think of a 16-year-old girl

355
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,360
holding such fascination

356
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,652
for such
an illustrious group of men,

357
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,321
but remember, we're talking
about a young woman

358
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,833
who was intellectually astute,

359
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,791
beautiful, shy, loving,

360
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,922
quite an extraordinary
young woman.

361
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:11,757
She was original.
She wasn't like everyone else.

362
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,593
I think this is why
Salinger liked her so much,

363
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,851
because the one thing
that she was never guilty of

364
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,432
was any clichés
or any banalities.

365
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,438
She was totally original.

366
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,020
He had a lot of things
going for him.

367
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,437
He was handsome, he was
intelligent, he was published -

368
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,355
he was everything.

369
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,241
After school,
Oona would do her homework

370
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,200
and then get dressed up,
and she'd go to the Stork Club.

371
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:53,462
"Oh, my! Look at Oona O'Neill -
debutante of the year."

372
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,095
They always photographed her
with a glass of milk,

373
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,851
because, of course,
she was under-age.

374
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,762
It was a tremendous love story.

375
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,556
They truly loved each other.

376
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,441
In 1941, 22-year-old
Jerry Salinger

377
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,401
wanted to join the army.

378
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,031
But when he went to enlist,

379
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,784
the military doctors
rejected him.

380
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:24,125
This distressed him terribly.
He got very angry about this.

381
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,207
Salinger was
determined to serve.

382
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,747
He wrote letters
arguing to be accepted,

383
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,212
and then,
in the spring of 1942,

384
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,502
he was finally
allowed to enlist.

385
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,096
What a mindset -

386
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,308
to come from an existence
of absolute ease and luxury.

387
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,439
And what do you aspire to?

388
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,477
To being in the trenches.

389
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,271
Oona loved hearing from Jerry.

390
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,405
He wrote wonderfully seductive,

391
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,487
totally delightful,
wonderful letters.

392
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,153
Salinger bragged to
all his army buddies,

393
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,821
"This is my girlfriend,"

394
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,706
and he showed them pictures
of Oona O'Neill.

395
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,459
But when Oona moved
to California,

396
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,416
she never answered his letters.

397
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,047
He had to know
something was up.

398
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,756
In Hollywood, Charlie
Chaplin was working on a film

399
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,887
that called for
a very young girl.

400
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,593
And he walked into a room

401
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,384
and Oona was sitting
on the floor by the fireplace

402
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,428
and the light was playing on her

403
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,768
and she looked up,
and he just...

404
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,894
When I went to Austin

405
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,564
to look at the Salinger
collection there...

406
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,242
...I read a number of letters.

407
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,529
And...

408
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,039
...I have to say that...

409
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,792
...reading them,
I felt like a voyeur.

410
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,080
And I was reading
Salinger's letters.

411
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,125
A number of them
were about Oona O'Neill.

412
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,591
Some of them were about Oona
O'Neill and Charlie Chaplin.

413
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,754
And...

414
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,843
...there were some
distasteful bits.

415
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,514
Imagine you're J.D.
Salinger, you're in the army,

416
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,775
getting ready to fight
in the great war in Europe,

417
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,403
you've professed your total
and complete love to this woman

418
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,612
and she goes off and marries,
on her 18th birthday,

419
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,869
the most famous movie star
in the world.

420
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,407
Chaplin was 53 going on 54.

421
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,247
The headlines -
all over the world.

422
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,754
Salinger found out
that he lost her

423
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,336
by reading about it
in the newspaper.

424
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,172
He was humiliated
in front of everyone.

425
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,214
He was very upset about this.

426
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,680
He did speak about this.
You could feel his anger.

427
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,346
You could feel
his terrible anger about...

428
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,392
...his rejection,
her rejection of him.

429
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,484
For the rest of
his life, Salinger was haunted

430
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:04,369
by the love affair that he could
have had that didn't happen.

431
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,756
The Second World War
created J.D. Salinger.

432
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,755
It's the ghost in the machine
of all the stories.

433
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,182
Well, I think in the beginning,

434
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,722
Jerry felt very patriotic.

435
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,563
I remember he said
it was extraordinary...

436
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,399
...you know, to feel that

437
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,316
he was part of something
doing good in the world.

438
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,029
Of all the days

439
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,115
for someone to be
initiated to combat...

440
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,622
...Salinger's was D-day.

441
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,409
On D-day,
Salinger was carrying

442
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,454
six chapters of
'Catcher in the Rye'.

443
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,087
He told Whit Burnett
that he needed those pages

444
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,252
to help him survive.

445
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,098
Salinger was in a landing craft

446
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,555
coming in towards Utah Beach.

447
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,846
Shells were flying.

448
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,185
The artillery shells
were coming in.

449
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,532
I lost my first man
by a sniper.

450
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,739
Shot right between the eyes.

451
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:32,077
You take a quick look, you know
that's it, and you're off.

452
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,556
At the end of the day,
you can sit back and...

453
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:53,094
.. "Man. Hoagie's gone."

454
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,110
The Americans thought that

455
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,646
landing would be
the hardest thing.

456
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,405
The day after D-day,

457
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,532
that's when the fighting
really started,

458
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,865
when the 4th Division,
that Salinger belonged to,

459
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,532
went into the ancient
fields and hedgerows.

460
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,200
They learned basically that

461
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,540
everything that they'd learnt
in basic training didn't apply.

462
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,516
Every field was gonna
cost them 20, 30 guys.

463
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,393
One field,
100 yards by 100 yards,

464
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,975
would sometimes cost
a whole platoon.

465
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,895
Killing ground, absolutely,
for us, like a meat grinder.

466
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,741
That's where our casualty rate
began to climb tremendously.

467
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:01,003
Salinger was a part of
the Counter Intelligence Corps

468
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,916
whose job it was to interview
enemy prisoners and civilians.

469
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,460
Salinger played
a very important role.

470
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,879
GIs, young guys, in squads,

471
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,548
being asked
to attack a village,

472
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,466
they wanted to know
every single thing

473
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,385
they could possibly know
about that village -

474
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,522
where the machine gun nests
were, where the alleyways were,

475
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,274
where the avenues of fire were.

476
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,278
Men like Salinger, their job
was to provide information

477
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,905
that would have kept
more of those guys alive.

478
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,701
He had a lot of latitude

479
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,787
to move behind and near
the enemy lines,

480
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,418
to understand the culture,
to understand the people,

481
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,205
to understand what
war did to the local people.

482
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,920
It was a more intellectual,
probing war for him

483
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,880
than the average grunt.

484
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,298
My dad was actually 21
when he met Mr Salinger,

485
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,683
and Mr Salinger was 25,
so he's four years his senior.

486
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,765
And they were in
the Counter Intelligence Corps.

487
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,600
The four gentlemen
you see here,

488
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,764
Mr Salinger, Mr Altaras,

489
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,308
Mr Keenan,

490
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,851
and my father, Paul Fitzgerald,

491
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,395
they refer to each other

492
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,938
as the Four Musketeers.

493
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,527
They corresponded
for nearly 65 years,

494
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,988
and there's really a bond.

495
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,621
My dad used to comment that
Altaras and Keenan would say,

496
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,157
"There was really no time
for us to do anything,

497
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,951
"because we always had to stop

498
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,960
"for Salinger
to sit by the roadside,

499
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,713
"working on short stories
or his novel."

500
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,922
And my father took the only
photo that anybody's ever seen

501
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,928
of Salinger writing
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

502
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:55,117
I took five students
to Princeton.

503
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,119
They wanted to see
what they could find,

504
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,997
what they could discover of
Salinger at Princeton Library.

505
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,664
After we got into
the reading room,

506
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,625
we turned the last page
of something and came across

507
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:12,840
a 3-by-5-inch light green

508
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,424
spiral-notebook-bound paper.

509
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,801
And I remember, at that moment,
everybody's pulse sort of jumped

510
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,096
because it was handwritten.

511
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,771
Ostensibly,
it was written by Salinger,

512
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:33,235
about the Allies
coming into Paris.

513
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,162
He talked about
driving in the jeeps into Paris

514
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,126
and the Parisians
holding their babies up

515
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,337
for the Americans to kiss.

516
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,719
And he said that you could
stand on the hood of your jeep

517
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,222
and take a leak on it, and it
wouldn't matter, it would be OK.

518
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,475
Anything you did would be fine.

519
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,382
I think one of the great
stories of literary history

520
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,643
is the meeting of Ernest
Hemingway and J.D. Salinger

521
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,020
in Paris during the liberation.

522
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,352
Ernest Hemingway was his icon.

523
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,688
He loved the way
Ernest Hemingway wrote.

524
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,274
At the time that Salinger met my
grandfather, Ernest Hemingway,

525
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,984
in World War II,

526
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,572
he was the most famous writer
of the 20th century,

527
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,364
and so you can see why Salinger
would seek him out.

528
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,782
And I think that would have been

529
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,872
a kind of romantic vision
for my grandfather

530
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,413
to see in Salinger
a talented young writer

531
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,378
in the Infantry division
fighting during World War II.

532
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,795
And Jerry actually
gave him a manuscript

533
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,886
and asked Hemingway
to look at it.

534
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,647
Which took a great deal
of derring-do

535
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,604
on his part, really.

536
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,690
But Hemingway saw what
he'd written and loved it.

537
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,651
Jerry was thrilled that

538
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,283
Hemingway appreciated
his writing.

539
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,409
This was like getting

540
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,196
the greatest accolade
he could possibly have.

541
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:53,792
I didn't think that Jerry would
ever push up to see anybody...

542
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,463
...'cause he seemed
rather shy and reclusive.

543
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:11,021
J.D. Salinger is a recluse who
likes to flirt with the public

544
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,477
to remind them
that he's a recluse.

545
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,486
He's not a recluse. He appears
whenever he feels like it.

546
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,738
The Cornish Fair would start,

547
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,194
and we'd see all our friends
and all our neighbours,

548
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,485
and Jerry Salinger
was one of 'em.

549
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:28,372
He came to all the fairs
and enjoyed them immensely.

550
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,252
A friend of mine said, "Oh,
I met J.D. Salinger tonight,

551
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,003
"popped in backstage
to meet the cast.

552
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,164
"And he was very jovial
and very cheery."

553
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,091
He's not reclusive
in the total sense of the word.

554
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:49,018
He's in touch with people.
He travels to Europe.

555
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,679
He comes to New York.

556
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,440
We were just
hanging around the house

557
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,693
when the phone rings.

558
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:02,106
I answered it. This male voice
asked for Lacey Fosburgh.

559
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:07,403
Salinger has to do everything
exactly on his own terms.

560
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,914
The true recluse
would never pick up the phone

561
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,121
and call a reporter
from the 'New York Times'.

562
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,503
Lacey was the first woman

563
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,255
to ever cover the police beat
for the 'New York Times',

564
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,042
and now working out of
the San Francisco bureau.

565
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,587
She picked up the phone,
and his first line was,

566
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,256
"This is a man
called Salinger."

567
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,095
He enjoys the game.

568
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,261
Reclusivity is a great
public relations device,

569
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,145
among other things.

570
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,682
By being out of the picture,
he's in the picture.

571
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,024
I think that is probably an
intentional paradox on his part.

572
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,655
She goes...
"Salinger! It's Salinger!"

573
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,066
This was the first interview

574
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,736
that Salinger had granted
since 1953.

575
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,779
"Give me some paper!
Give me some paper!"

576
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,200
He says, right off the bat,
"I can only talk for a minute."

577
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,993
So I'm scurrying around,
grabbing some paper,

578
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,753
she's furiously writing notes
on anything that's around.

579
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,505
Then, of course,
the conversation ends up

580
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,382
being a half an hour long.

581
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,171
He sets the scene - it was
a cold, windswept, rainy night

582
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,964
in New Hampshire
as he was talking to her.

583
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,555
And the point of the call was
he was concerned that

584
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,687
pirated editions of
his uncollected short stories

585
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,768
were being sold
across the country.

586
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,979
J.D. Salinger
paperbacks.

587
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,519
Two little volumes.

588
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,155
He referred to them as
"the gaucheries of his youth".

589
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,192
The stories that he never
wanted published at all,

590
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,156
that he had written
in the 1940s.

591
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,992
He called her because
he was clearly upset

592
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,657
about this pirate publication.

593
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,202
These were stories that
he did not want in circulation.

594
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,292
He didn't have to do that.
He just had to file a lawsuit.

595
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,458
One of the great coups
of the story was that

596
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,423
she was able to get Salinger
to talk about

597
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,509
what he was up to as a writer

598
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,298
and that he was
writing every day,

599
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,593
which was one of the great
mysteries of the literary world

600
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,761
for a decade or so.

601
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,319
He paints
this portrait of someone

602
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,026
who is completely devoted
still to his craft,

603
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,815
still turning out
story after story,

604
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,655
novel after novel, perhaps.

605
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,411
And she got him
to talk about his own feelings

606
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,494
about publishing and being
published and being private.

607
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,752
Salinger said, "I don't have
any intention of publishing.

608
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,414
"There's a stillness that comes
from not publishing."

609
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,676
Lacey immediately
got on the phone

610
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,837
with the national desk
of the 'New York Times'

611
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,133
to say, "Hey," you know,
"I just talked to Salinger."

612
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,677
He knew if he called
a 'New York Times' reporter,

613
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,437
that story would be on the front
page of the 'New York Times',

614
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,189
which is exactly what happened.

615
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,225
Which was
extraordinary at the time -

616
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,564
this was before the 'Times'
format had changed,

617
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:50,858
and so running soft news on
the front page was a big deal.

618
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,867
I didn't have
a lot of money then,

619
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,699
and I didn't know
quite what was going on,

620
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,238
so I bought volume one,

621
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,782
and when I went back
to buy the second one,

622
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,543
not only was the book gone,
both volumes were missing.

623
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,172
The store owners declined
to admit they'd ever sold it.

624
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,631
Salinger had pulled them
from all the bookstores.

625
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,216
I mean, this was a second-hand
bookstore on Telegraph Avenue.

626
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,598
I couldn't even believe
he could reach that far.

627
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,147
It was incredibly eerie,

628
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,190
almost sort of medieval...

629
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,577
...primal fears came out of
the Hilrtgen Forest.

630
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,363
Salinger experienced that
firsthand.

631
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,830
It was basically described
as a meat grinder.

632
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:50,342
Soldiers described
that battle as one where

633
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,003
they wished they could
crawl inside their helmets.

634
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,592
Whole companies of 200 men

635
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,100
would be down to 20 or 30
after four or five hours.

636
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,980
Guys would literally
have their arms blown off,

637
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,187
half a leg missing,

638
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,193
and they'd be laughing as they
were taken off on a stretcher

639
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,195
because they knew
they were going home.

640
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,246
The only way Salinger could have
survived an intense shelling

641
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,658
would have been
to literally hug a tree.

642
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,623
To get close enough
to that thing and pray to God

643
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,708
that somebody else gets it.

644
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,864
"November 10, 1944.

645
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,370
"Dear M,
This poor young man

646
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,202
"has been bombarding me
with poems for a week or so.

647
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,958
"It appears that
he's serving overseas,

648
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,415
"so everything becomes
more touching."

649
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,674
J.D. Salinger and Louise Bogan
first crossed paths

650
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,632
when he wrote to her
in November of 1944.

651
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,843
He may have thought

652
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:23,226
that she was the poetry editor
of the 'New Yorker'.

653
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,638
She wasn't.
She was simply their reviewer.

654
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,853
And she passed the poems along

655
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,518
to her friend at the magazine,
William Maxwell.

656
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,314
"Dear M, I send you another
of Sergeant Salinger's letters.

657
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,859
"I've written him, but it is
better if you write him too.

658
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,871
"Perhaps this would help
stem the tide. Love, Louise."

659
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,297
We don't really know

660
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,709
what she thought about
the poems themselves,

661
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,425
but she was deeply touched
that he had written to her

662
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,555
and his life was in danger.

663
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,329
For a soldier like
Salinger, walking into a camp...

664
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,796
...there was a stillness to it
and a craziness to it.

665
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,925
They were caught off-guard.

666
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,052
These weren't liberations
in the sense of

667
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,555
busting down the gates
or anything like that.

668
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,685
These soldiers were
walking into a place... open.

669
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,272
This was like
falling into a graveyard.

670
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,862
In the case of the camp
that Salinger saw,

671
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,150
that was the Krankenlager,
the camp for the sick.

672
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,621
Naked bodies stacked up,

673
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,703
bodies that looked like
they were dead people,

674
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,747
but sometimes discovering
sounds coming from the bodies.

675
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:19,419
Salinger was an experienced
fighter by this time,

676
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:25,512
but nothing prepared him
for this kind of sight.

677
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,802
This kind of
desecration of humanity.

678
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:35,567
The Germans had locked
prisoners into flimsy barracks

679
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,228
and set them on fire.

680
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,943
They were burned alive.

681
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,750
The sentence that Salinger says

682
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,410
is that you never really

683
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,955
get the smell of burning flesh
out of your nostrils,

684
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,998
no matter how long you live.

685
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,346
The National
Broadcasting Company

686
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,178
delays the start
of all its programs

687
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,887
to bring you a special bulletin.

688
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,348
It was announced in
San Francisco half an hour ago

689
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,434
by a high American official
not identified

690
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,189
as saying that Germany

691
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,021
has surrendered unconditionally
to the Allies,

692
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,981
no strings attached.

693
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,771
There would be
no more firing, no more death,

694
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,736
no more killing,
no more destruction.

695
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,821
It was over.

696
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,543
They could
look forward to life.

697
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,252
The sacrifices
that had been made,

698
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,259
the horrors they'd seen
were over.

699
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,843
V-E Day meant that they were
on their way home.

700
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,022
On behalf of the commanding
officer and his staff,

701
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,405
I wanna extend a hearty welcome
to all of you.

702
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,989
There's no need to be alarmed
at the presence of these cameras

703
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,496
as they're making
a photographic record

704
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,952
of your progress
at this hospital

705
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,289
from the date of admission
to the date of discharge.

706
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,457
As a result of the horrors that
he witnessed in World War II,

707
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,922
J.D. Salinger suffered
a nervous breakdown.

708
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:29,214
Salinger's stuff is
all about innocence, somehow,

709
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,806
and the damage done to
innocence in the world.

710
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,267
J.D. Salinger went from D-day

711
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,398
all the way through to V-E Day -

712
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,980
299 days in combat.

713
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,521
What Salinger experienced

714
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,657
was basically a continual
assault on his senses,

715
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,658
mentally, spiritually,
physically.

716
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,946
He would have been under
immense, unimaginable stress.

717
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,086
The probability
of not making it,

718
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,293
either by being
killed or wounded,

719
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,881
is really... was really there
from day to day,

720
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:11,139
and that makes
people snap later.

721
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,221
The statistic is that anybody -

722
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,852
doesn't matter
how you were raised,

723
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,934
how tough you are mentally -

724
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,226
anybody after 200 days
goes nuts.

725
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,736
After 200 days of combat,
you are insane.

726
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,361
Shortly after he was
released from the hospital,

727
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,245
Salinger wrote
the first short story

728
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,121
narrated by Holden Caulfield.

729
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,328
It was called 'I'm Crazy'.

730
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,546
After his nervous breakdown,

731
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,837
Salinger signed up for
a longer tour of duty

732
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,132
so that he could be part of
the denazification program.

733
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,350
Salinger got to be a
detective, detective in uniform.

734
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,935
His basic job was
to chase down the bad guys,

735
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,647
whether they be Nazis that
were pretending to be civilians,

736
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,188
whether it was collaborators,
black market operators.

737
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,575
He actually got to look into
the dark heart of Nazi Germany

738
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,407
and interrogate the people
who committed

739
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,243
the greatest crimes
in human history

740
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,907
and bring them to justice.

741
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,872
There has been a rumour
for many years

742
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,459
that one of the people Salinger
arrested and interviewed

743
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
was a woman
by the name of Sylvia.

744
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:32,045
She was reported to have been
a member of the Nazi Party.

745
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,511
Salinger and Sylvia supposedly
fell in love and married.

746
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,517
This has led me
to travel in Germany,

747
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,849
following the footsteps
of Salinger,

748
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,561
the various places
where they could have lived,

749
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,442
the hospital in Nuremberg

750
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:50,196
where Salinger was treated
for his nervous breakdown,

751
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,901
but we drew blanks.

752
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,611
So then we hit upon the idea

753
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,323
of looking at
the passenger arrival forms

754
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:01,082
of ships arriving in the United
States in May and June of 1946.

755
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,414
Eureka! When I first saw it,
I couldn't believe it.

756
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,922
I actually jumped up
and people had to shush me.

757
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,459
But there it is. We have
the passenger arrival form.

758
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:16,006
Sylvia Louise Salinger.
Age - 27.

759
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:19,847
Place of birth -
Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

760
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,730
Now we know that woman
really was married to Salinger.

761
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,480
American soldiers
were not allowed

762
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,522
to marry German nationals
during 1945 and 1946.

763
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,439
Salinger took an enormous risk.

764
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,700
He could have been
court-martialled.

765
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,531
It's absolutely
fascinating that

766
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,661
he would actually
do the opposite

767
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,414
of what any so-called
decent American would do,

768
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,167
which was to go
and marry a Nazi.

769
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,299
It suggests that he
really got to a place

770
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,678
intellectually and emotionally,
importantly - emotionally -

771
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,136
whereby he could
identify and sympathise

772
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,097
with the victim and perpetrator.

773
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,568
He told me his first wife
was extraordinary,

774
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,731
that they had
a telepathic communication

775
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,025
and they met in dreams.

776
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,120
When Salinger
brought Sylvia home

777
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,747
to his parents' house,

778
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,623
she walked into
this Jewish household

779
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,456
with a Nazi Party affiliation.

780
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,212
How he ever thought
this would work is beyond me.

781
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,998
My father was best man

782
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,632
at J.D. Salinger's
first wedding,

783
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,419
and my father later on received
a letter from Salinger.

784
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,087
"Sylvia and I separated

785
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,473
"less than a month after
we returned to the States.

786
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,850
"If I gave you all the reasons
for the separation,

787
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,307
"I would have to go
straight back to the beginning,

788
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,722
"as most of the details
would probably depress you.

789
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,515
"Almost from the beginning,

790
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,401
"we were desperately unsuited to
and unhappy with each other."

791
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,439
Within months, Salinger filed

792
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,403
to have the marriage annulled
on the grounds of deception,

793
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,160
which may indicate that
he found something troubling

794
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,572
about Sylvia's past in Germany.

795
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,835
The very next story that
he submitted to the magazine

796
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,871
was one called 'The Bananafish'.

797
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:19,425
Salinger comes back
from the war aware that

798
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:25,344
the devastated and
shell-shocked tone is his tone.

799
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:33,026
Just as the Civil War could
give us Mark Twain and Whitman,

800
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,028
World War II gave us Salinger.

801
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,985
Jerry always said,

802
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,946
"You have to get away
from fantasy.

803
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,202
"Write about something you know.

804
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,659
"There is no passion
otherwise."

805
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
I remember his words.

806
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,368
"There's no fire
between the words."

807
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,551
'A Perfect Day for Bananafish'

808
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,055
is very much about
a man who's suffering from

809
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,216
having gone through
the Second World War.

810
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,761
Seymour Glass on the beach

811
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,851
talking with
a charming little girl.

812
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,606
Goes to his room,

813
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,109
lies down on the bed
beside his sleeping wife

814
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,190
and shoots himself
through the head.

815
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:31,789
♪ You've got to
accentuate the positive... ♪

816
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,420
The story made a huge splash,

817
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,206
and it signalled
a success streak,

818
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,670
a winning streak, for Salinger.

819
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,631
Everyone was

820
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,888
totally captivated
by his writing.

821
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,674
We'd call each other
on the telephone about it

822
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,186
when the 'New Yorker' came,
and, "Have you read this?"

823
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,847
"Have you seen this?
Isn't it wonderful?"

824
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,641
People whom I didn't even know
were talking about,

825
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,277
"Did you read that story?"

826
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,609
"That little girl -
isn't that remarkable?"

827
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,194
It caused a great buzz.

828
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,200
1948 was really a turning point

829
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,952
for Salinger
and the 'New Yorker'.

830
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,954
He published
'A Perfect Day for Bananafish'

831
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,115
and two other stories.

832
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,751
And from then on,
he was known and identified

833
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,752
as a 'New Yorker' writer.

834
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,005
And Jerry was thrilled -
he told me how much

835
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,338
it had meant to him to be
published by the 'New Yorker'.

836
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,630
Salinger was considered
really a shooting star.

837
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,891
A 'New Yorker'
contributor in Hollywood said,

838
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,302
"Everybody out here
talks about Salinger.

839
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,392
"My God, that guy is good.

840
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,023
"Evenings are spent,
and this is on the level,

841
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,105
"discussing the guy
and his work."

842
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,315
I would ask people
who worked with him,

843
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,230
"Did he have a reclusive
personality back then?

844
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,943
"Did you ever see him?"

845
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,609
They said, "Oh, you know,
we saw him all the time."

846
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,278
"We talked to him. He was
very warm. He was Jerry."

847
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,994
He would call up and say,

848
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,330
"I'm going to the Blue Angel
tonight. Wanna come along?"

849
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,212
So we would go to the Blue
Angel, which was a nightspot

850
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:02,045
where young talent
would try out.

851
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,802
When we were at
the Blue Angel together,

852
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,304
he was very sociable.

853
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,216
He talked to people. He even
talked to the performers.

854
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,180
Jerry was
a different person there.

855
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,345
Jerry had a wonderful time,

856
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,981
because he'd identified
with these types

857
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,812
who were trying
to make their mark,

858
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,693
just as he was trying to make
his mark with his writing.

859
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,071
And he was very charitable.
He was very encouraging.

860
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,903
But he wouldn't encourage
a young writer.

861
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,159
That was different.
That was competition.

862
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,160
He was pretty suave
with the women.

863
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,367
He used to lie to them
and tell them

864
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,454
he was a goalie
for a Montreal soccer team.

865
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,665
But it was
a very platonic going out.

866
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:43,378
I mean, he didn't try to kiss
me or hug me or squeeze me

867
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,294
or anything
the way other people did.

868
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,341
Maybe I was too old for him.
I think he liked younger girls.

869
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:55,307
I was only seven years younger.

870
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,894
I think maybe he preferred them
12 years younger.

871
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,730
Or younger than that.

872
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:07,365
♪ Don't mess
with Mr In-between. ♪

873
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,590
We were in Daytona Beach,

874
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,877
and I was sitting at
this rather crowded pool

875
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,590
reading 'Wuthering Heights'.

876
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,757
And this man
sitting next to me said,

877
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,551
"How is Heathcliff?
How is Heathcliff?"

878
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:39,643
And I turned to him, and I said,
"Heathcliff is troubled."

879
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,479
He was in this
terrycloth bathrobe.

880
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:46,691
He was very white,
and his legs were white.

881
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,903
He didn't look like
he belonged at this pool.

882
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,159
It's the classic
veteran's syndrome.

883
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,695
You come back from a war

884
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,455
and see all around you -

885
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,582
people that don't understand,
don't have a clue

886
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,119
about the first thing
that you did

887
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,380
when you were over there,
rather than here.

888
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,918
His mind seemed to skitter
over various topics.

889
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,461
He told me he was a writer,

890
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,928
that he had published stories
in the 'New Yorker',

891
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,842
and he felt that was
his finest accomplishment.

892
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,932
We sat there for quite a while,

893
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,439
and finally he asked me,
"How old are you?"

894
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,225
And I said, "14."

895
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,941
And I do remember very clearly
his grimace.

896
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,276
He said he was 30.

897
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:34,990
He made a point of saying
that he was 30 on January 1,

898
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,371
so that, in a way,
he was just 30.

899
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,076
I finally left,

900
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,334
and as I was going away,
he told me his name was Jerry.

901
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,631
I saw him the next day,
and we began these walks.

902
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,170
We would walk down the beach
to this old rickety pier.

903
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,306
We did this every afternoon
for, say, about 10 days.

904
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,559
We'd walk very slowly
down to the pier.

905
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,765
It was though
he was escorting me,

906
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,558
and he would always have
his left shoulder behind me

907
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,067
and lean down to hear
what I had to say.

908
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,274
He was very deaf
in his right ear.

909
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,109
I think something to do
with the war.

910
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,616
But Jerry Salinger

911
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:18,370
listened like you were the most
important person in the world,

912
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,873
and he wanted
to know about my family.

913
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,999
He wanted to know
about my school.

914
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,627
He wanted to know about
what games I played.

915
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,665
He wanted to know who I was
reading, what I was studying.

916
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,835
He wanted to know whether
I believed in God.

917
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,674
Did I want to be an actress?

918
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,714
He wanted to know
everything about me.

919
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,061
We would end up at the pier,
and we'd sit.

920
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,267
We'd buy popcorn
and we'd buy ice-cream

921
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,400
and we'd feed popcorn
to the seagulls.

922
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,936
He was having a wonderful time.

923
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,235
There's an image
from 'Esmé' which haunts me,

924
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,571
and it's that image
late in the story where

925
00:53:56,734 --> 00:54:00,659
Sergeant X feels his mind
dislodge itself

926
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,198
and begin to teeter,

927
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,742
and he compares that to luggage

928
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,751
on an overhead rack
that's unstable.

929
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,412
Think of 'For Esmé -
with Love and Squalor'.

930
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,675
Surely, there is no better
story in the half-century

931
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,335
on either side of that novel.

932
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,879
You're in a tea shop
in England,

933
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:21,391
and an American soldier
is on his way to war.

934
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,225
And he finds himself explaining
himself to a 12-year-old girl,

935
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,230
whose manners are too good,

936
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,892
and this wish
that she expresses

937
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,278
that he should return
from the battle

938
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,908
with all his, as she says,
F-A-C-U-L-T-I-E-S intact-

939
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,034
with all his faculties intact.

940
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,242
And then he makes this abrupt

941
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,281
kind of shattering
cinematic cut

942
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:48,123
to this soldier
after he's been to battle

943
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,333
writing a letter to Esmé.

944
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:55,878
And he has barely clung to
his F-A-C-U-L-T-I-E-S.

945
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,388
He's barely hung onto his
intelligence and his powers,

946
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,923
and he's gonna return
to America

947
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,591
and he's gonna
be J.D. Salinger

948
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,305
and he's gonna write.

949
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,596
I would do cartwheels
on the beach,

950
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,857
and then I would
flip off into the ocean.

951
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,312
And he would love that.

952
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,103
I was fresh and new,
like a breath of spring,

953
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,522
and I knew I brought him joy.

954
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,736
I think he felt it was

955
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,655
as close to a perfect,
maybe even direct, moment

956
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,869
that he'd had...

957
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,079
...ever... maybe ever had.

958
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,495
These perfect moments,

959
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:34,006
they got him away
from his melancholy,

960
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,337
his angst about the war.

961
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,174
On his very last day,

962
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,680
he asked me would it be all right
for him to write me?

963
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,136
And I said, "Of course."

964
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,892
He also said,
"I'd like to kiss you goodbye,

965
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,769
"but you know I can't."

966
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,437
And then Jerry
went up to my mother

967
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,567
and said very seriously,

968
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,275
"I am going to marry
your daughter."

969
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,820
Years later,

970
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:08,332
he told me that he could not
have written 'Esmé'...

971
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,328
...had he not met me.

972
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,922
Well, I remember talking once
to William Maxwell

973
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,212
about what it was like
to work with Salinger.

974
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,631
He said Salinger
was very specific,

975
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,265
he was a very careful writer.

976
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,303
He knew what he wanted,
even down to his punctuation.

977
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,845
And Maxwell told me the story

978
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,265
of a piece
that Salinger had written

979
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,933
that had been edited,

980
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,897
it had gone all through
the process,

981
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,481
down to the final page proof,

982
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,521
when they were getting ready
to publish the magazine,

983
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,235
and a final proofreader

984
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,821
found a spot that he felt like
needed a comma.

985
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,361
And he went to Maxwell,

986
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,904
Maxwell looked at it,
and he said,

987
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,822
"It looked like it needed
a comma to me."

988
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,366
They couldn't find Salinger,

989
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,785
so they went ahead
and put the comma in.

990
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,328
And when the story came out,

991
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:58,670
Maxwell said Salinger was
melancholy about that comma.

992
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,130
Salinger's idea
of perfection...

993
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,016
...is really perfection
and shouldn't be tampered with.

994
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,680
Samuel Goldwyn was one of
the original Hollywood moguls.

995
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,725
He was one of that group of
a half-dozen Jewish immigrants

996
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,268
who realised early on

997
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,811
that there was not only

998
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,150
a lot of money to be made
in the movie industry

999
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,111
but that there was
a budding art form there.

1000
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,367
And he became famous

1001
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,246
for being the most literary
of the Hollywood producers.

1002
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,781
And it's a great irony

1003
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,825
because he was probably
the most illiterate

1004
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,039
of the Hollywood producers.

1005
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:39,082
The Epstein brothers,
who had written 'Casablanca',

1006
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,251
they came to Goldwyn
with an idea for a movie

1007
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,011
based on a short story
they had recently read

1008
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,547
in the 'New Yorker'.

1009
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,262
And the story was
'Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut',

1010
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,678
and the author
was a young J.D. Salinger,

1011
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,940
who was just being talked about
a great deal.

1012
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,524
So this appealed to Goldwyn,
who bought the rights

1013
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,781
and turned it into a movie
called 'My Foolish Heart'.

1014
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,703
I think every time an author
sells something to Hollywood,

1015
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,455
part of him says to himself,

1016
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:17,586
"Well, my work is so special.
Mine won't get changed."

1017
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,463
You know, "And certainly,
they're not gonna rape it,"

1018
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,796
as I think Hollywood did to
'Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut'.

1019
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,178
Gosh, what about
the rest of YOUR life, El?

1020
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,714
Please, darling, don't you
be crazy. You just go...

1021
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,008
Mary Jane, I'll never tell.

1022
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:37,022
The beauty of the short story
is how much Salinger left out.

1023
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,229
And the great delight
for the Epsteins

1024
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,235
was how much they could put in.

1025
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,692
That's a very aristocratic ear.

1026
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,734
Salinger's response
was extremely violent,

1027
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:52,746
and he vowed never to sell
another work to Hollywood again.

1028
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,952
It's that protectiveness

1029
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,836
that actually led to
the end of our friendship.

1030
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:02,248
Eventually,
I got a job as an editor

1031
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,382
at 'Cosmopolitan' magazine,

1032
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,214
which then was
a literary magazine

1033
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,094
before Helen Gurley Brown
got hold of it

1034
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,971
for 'Sex and the Single Girl'.

1035
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,599
And in the course
of our poker game,

1036
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,135
Jerry handed me a story
and said,

1037
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,601
"Here. I think this is a good
story for 'Cosmopolitan'."

1038
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,859
It was called 'Scratchy Needle
on a Phonograph Record'.

1039
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,690
And he said, "But one thing -

1040
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,571
"you tell your editor,
not one word can be changed,

1041
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,107
"and that's up to you.

1042
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,401
"You gotta watch it,
because they like to cut

1043
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,490
"and they like to
make it fit a space.

1044
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,905
"If they do that,
then there's no go."

1045
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,540
He attached a note to it.

1046
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,121
"Either as is or not at all."

1047
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,661
And it was all fine,

1048
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:45,754
but I forgot to check on
the title that they gave it.

1049
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,386
Instead of 'Scratchy Needle
on a Phonograph Record',

1050
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,344
they changed it to
'Blue Melody'.

1051
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,601
I thought, well,
the best thing I can do

1052
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,433
is meet this head-on.

1053
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,814
So I called him and I said,

1054
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,566
"Can we have a beer
at Chumley's tonight,"

1055
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,602
or whatever.

1056
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,568
And I met him,
and I had the magazine.

1057
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,361
And I had a tough time sort of
getting around to the topic.

1058
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,326
And after hemming and hawing,
he even said,

1059
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,582
"Would you get to the point?
What's bothering you?"

1060
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,084
And I said, "Jerry,
I have to explain this to you.

1061
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:25,293
"I really very carefully
attended to

1062
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,457
"the prose that you wrote

1063
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,422
"so that nothing was changed.

1064
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,588
"But unbeknownst to me, and
I have no control over this,

1065
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,007
"because I am not
the fiction editor,

1066
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,175
"they put
a different title on."

1067
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,891
So he grabbed the magazine
out of my hand,

1068
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,555
and he looked at it.

1069
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,725
And his face turned...

1070
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,482
...apoplectic red.

1071
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,360
And he just spewed...

1072
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,163
...an angry denunciation at me.

1073
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,542
What kind of a friend was I?
How did I let this happen?

1074
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:05,079
And I tried to
get a word in to say,

1075
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,963
"You know, I have no control

1076
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,669
"over what's done
in the final edit."

1077
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,425
He said,
"You had to have control.

1078
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,086
"I told you
you're in charge of it

1079
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,629
"and I trusted you with it,

1080
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,923
"and I'll never trust you again
in anything."

1081
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,433
And he walked out. That's it.

1082
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,766
Left me with my beer
sitting at the table.

1083
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,056
And he took the magazine
with him.

1084
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:38,993
When we next met, after
Daytona, was in the spring,

1085
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,828
when I was in New York
with my family.

1086
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,369
I was 14, and I can remember
exactly what I had on.

1087
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:50,666
I had a little tan suit on,
with little white gloves

1088
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,834
and a little straw hat.

1089
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,174
And we were walking
down a street

1090
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,214
and the straw hat blew off.

1091
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,724
And I thought,
"Oh, how embarrassing."

1092
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:04,354
And... he went
tearing down that street

1093
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,731
laughing and chortling.

1094
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,269
He came back
and formally gave me my hat,

1095
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,153
which was a little bit bashed,

1096
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:15,236
and I put it back on my head.

1097
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,277
And he laughed about it
for about 15 minutes.

1098
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:23,077
This is one of the letters
that Jerry sent me.

1099
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,042
He was at the time writing
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

1100
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:34,210
He felt nervous
about Holden's language.

1101
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:39,257
He was worried about how it was
going to be received by people,

1102
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,675
particularly people he loved.

1103
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,846
He wanted people
to know absolutely

1104
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,391
that he was trying to write
a good book.

1105
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,652
Not just a bestseller -
a good book.

1106
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:04,240
Along came the gentleman about
six years younger than I was.

1107
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,408
And he had a big black dog.

1108
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,703
He told me that all
he would be doing was writing.

1109
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,418
No parties, no visitors.

1110
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,424
He was a loner.
The perfect tenant for me.

1111
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,553
And that's how I met
a man called J.D. Salinger.

1112
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,283
And if his typewriter
was going,

1113
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:43,286
I knew enough
not to intrude into him.

1114
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,322
This was his own world.

1115
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,551
George Orwell once said
that "Writing a book

1116
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,512
"is a horrible,
exhausting struggle.

1117
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,472
"One would never undertake
such a thing

1118
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,262
"if one were not driven
by some demon."

1119
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:13,684
And it looks to me that he had
demons that he was exorcising.

1120
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,240
He came home and wrote about

1121
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,243
this adolescent
at war with society.

1122
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,702
That's when he found
the real Jerry Salinger voice,

1123
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,958
so that he was
Holden Caulfield.

1124
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,290
And he was able to
transmit that onto the page

1125
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:37,549
so that you get
a real feel of the frustration

1126
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,085
of every kid that age.

1127
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,130
Jerry said there was
a great deal of Holden in him.

1128
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,974
Holden was rejecting
the whole world of his parents.

1129
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,761
He hated these prep
schools that he had gone to.

1130
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,272
He had disdain
for all these people.

1131
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,023
Wealth, fame, career,

1132
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,650
possessions,
possessions, possessions.

1133
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,938
Salinger saw America
as this shopping centre

1134
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:03,075
that has lost its mind,
it's lost its soul.

1135
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,747
He hated phoniness.
He just hated it.

1136
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,454
Is it possible
to grow up and not sell out?

1137
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,993
They're all there,

1138
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,254
all of the Salinger diatribes
and all of his prejudices -

1139
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,960
they're all in that book.

1140
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,419
He didn't spend
just 10 years writing that book.

1141
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,587
He spent 30 years writing
'Catcher in the Rye',

1142
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,552
'cause everything in his life
up to that point

1143
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,512
was funnelled into that book.

1144
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,392
A book takes
the time that it needs,

1145
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,398
and you don't
have a choice about it.

1146
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:41,234
But don't worry.
Novels grow in the dark.

1147
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,117
It was a channelling.

1148
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,204
It's some kind
of miracle of ink

1149
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,289
making flesh and blood.

1150
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,878
You see the artist
at the peak of his powers.

1151
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,586
Holden always imagined

1152
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,628
millions of little kids
running to the field of rye

1153
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,967
and having to save them
from going over the cliff.

1154
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,007
The cliff of what?
The cliff towards adulthood.

1155
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,974
It was an accumulation
of everything he had to say.

1156
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,732
The great subversive,
anti-establishment book

1157
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,438
of all time.

1158
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:29,118
Salinger met with
an important editor,

1159
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,824
Robert Giroux,
at Harcourt, Brace.

1160
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,867
Giroux wanted him to publish
a collection of short stories.

1161
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,752
He didn't hear anything
from Salinger for quite a while.

1162
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,381
One morning,
Salinger walks in and said,

1163
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,716
"You know, I don't think
we should publish

1164
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,301
"that collection
of short stories.

1165
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,592
"What we need to do
is publish my novel

1166
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,056
"about this kid
who goes to New York

1167
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,096
"and has an interesting time."

1168
01:06:56,262 --> 01:07:00,438
Eventually,
Salinger did deliver

1169
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,728
'The Catcher in the Rye'
in manuscript

1170
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,862
to Bob Giroux.

1171
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,074
Giroux read the novel.
He loved it.

1172
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,610
He was impressed by it.

1173
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,746
And he said that he'd be proud
to publish it.

1174
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:19,373
But then Giroux showed it
to his boss.

1175
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,881
Eugene Reynal,
who looked at the novel

1176
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,885
and said, "This guy's crazy.
We need to have this rewritten."

1177
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:31,510
Bob Giroux got Salinger
into his office,

1178
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,050
spent a lot of time

1179
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:35,239
looking out of his window
and down into Madison Avenue

1180
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,974
and then turned to Salinger
and had said,

1181
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:40,265
"But of course
Holden Caulfield is crazy."

1182
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,150
And there was no response
from Salinger.

1183
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,529
But then, on closer inspection,

1184
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,612
Giroux saw
that Salinger was weeping.

1185
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:55,072
He rose, went down
into the ground floor

1186
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:58,162
of the office building
and called his agent and said,

1187
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,792
"Get me out of
this publishing house!

1188
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,874
"They think
my Holden Caulfield is crazy!"

1189
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,290
Holden was, in fact,
Jerry Salinger.

1190
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,634
So, to be told
that he was crazy...

1191
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,179
...meant that he had to
take offence.

1192
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,096
Salinger came
to William Maxwell

1193
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,852
at the 'New Yorker' magazine

1194
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:22,187
to read him the manuscript
in its entirety.

1195
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,648
Salinger hoped to have
segments of the novel

1196
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,437
published in the 'New Yorker'.

1197
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,652
"Dear Jerry,
The vote here

1198
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,987
"went, sadly,
against your novel.

1199
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,405
"To us, the notion that in one
family, the Caulfield family,

1200
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,790
"there are four such
extraordinary children

1201
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,416
"is not quite tenable.

1202
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,079
"Another point - this story
is too ingenious and ingrown.

1203
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,873
"Prejudice here against what
we call writer-consciousness."

1204
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,508
If he thought
everything was phoney,

1205
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,964
he thought the 'New Yorker'
was anything but phoney.

1206
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,504
They had the greatest status.

1207
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,220
If you're published there,
you are a real literary person.

1208
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,510
So when that was rejected,

1209
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,895
he wondered if he was
a middle-brow writer.

1210
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,647
Salinger began to lose hope.

1211
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,398
How could you pass up
on 'Catcher'?

1212
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,525
Pages of
'The Catcher in the Rye'

1213
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,732
stormed the beaches on D-day.

1214
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,445
They witnessed the atrocities
of the concentration camps.

1215
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,451
There was no way
that J.D. Salinger

1216
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,580
was going to rewrite
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

1217
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,160
A short time after that,

1218
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,078
he placed the novel
with Little, Brown,

1219
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:28,874
and I guess we might say
the rest is publishing history.

1220
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,465
The publication of
'Catcher in the Rye' in 1951

1221
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,971
was something of a revolution.

1222
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:19,178
He really wanted to be up there,
beyond Hemingway.

1223
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,312
A figure of such
brilliance and wisdom...

1224
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,225
...that we can only
think of people

1225
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,440
like Shakespeare and Beethoven,

1226
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:34,572
and that novel was so popular,

1227
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,200
it meant he was middle-brow.

1228
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,076
Here he was
thinking he's saying

1229
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,033
the most original things
that nobody's ever thought of,

1230
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,572
and the entire world's like,

1231
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,913
"Yes! That's exactly
what we feel."

1232
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,915
How many people actually
read 'The Catcher in the Rye'

1233
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,550
in this class?

1234
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,086
That's pretty amazing.

1235
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,424
There's only one person,
actually,

1236
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,134
who hasn't read it out of 18.

1237
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,558
When you're a kid and
you read 'Catcher in the Rye',

1238
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:10,146
you're just like,
"Oh, my God, somebody gets it."

1239
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,321
You suddenly realise that
you are part of a larger world

1240
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,575
and that that larger world
is no longer reliable.

1241
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,451
I remember that being
the first book

1242
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,453
you take with you
when you walked around.

1243
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,239
Just wanted
to have it with you.

1244
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,828
I think we all thought,
"Ooh, here's this cool guy.

1245
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,584
"He's such a badass.
He's such a rebel.

1246
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,461
"I wanna date him."

1247
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,997
I think 'Catcher in the Rye'

1248
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,040
is one of the funniest novels
ever written.

1249
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,756
I re-read it
and I started highlighting

1250
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,012
lines that I thought were great,

1251
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,764
and almost the entire book
was yellow.

1252
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:44,301
It just crossed
all the lines, on every level,

1253
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,185
between old and young,
rich and poor,

1254
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,097
black and white,
male and female, everywhere.

1255
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,857
Millions and millions
and millions of people.

1256
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,695
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

1257
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,993
The enormous impact
of 'Catcher in the Rye'

1258
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:15,165
overnight transported him into
a major writer and personality.

1259
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,833
I don't think
he was prepared for

1260
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,501
the instant celebrity
of 'Catcher in the Rye'

1261
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,295
when it became
a Book of the Month Club,

1262
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,213
and there was a fantastic,
very soulful picture

1263
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,757
on the back of it.

1264
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,176
And he asked that that picture
be removed from the book.

1265
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,719
It was unheard of

1266
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,887
that an author
would not want his picture

1267
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,807
on the back of the book
or on the back flap of the book

1268
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:36,524
and as big and beautiful
as you could possibly get it.

1269
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,565
♪ As I walk
down the street... ♪

1270
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:44,782
I understand why anyone who was
becoming famous would stop it.

1271
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,163
You're born with
the right of anonymity.

1272
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,698
You're just anonymous.

1273
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,333
You walk the streets,
you do whatever,

1274
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,868
and you can actually
have private thoughts

1275
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,627
while you're amongst
other people.

1276
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,130
People who never had
that change in their life

1277
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,791
don't think about it.

1278
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,550
They don't even question it.
It just is.

1279
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:04,431
He wouldn't
go on a book tour or sign books

1280
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,887
or go on television shows.

1281
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,892
He didn't ever want to be
interviewed.

1282
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,474
He always, always, felt

1283
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:16,017
that what people should know
about an author

1284
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,560
was nothing personal.

1285
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,695
They should know the author
through his work,

1286
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,276
and that's all
that he was willing

1287
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,066
to give people -
his work.

1288
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,826
So I was rather surprised
to go to a cocktail party,

1289
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:29,034
as we did in the time,
someplace on the East Side,

1290
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,200
where... the prominent
young publishers were there,

1291
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,869
some publicity people
and some editors.

1292
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,630
I remember Joe Fox
of Random House was there.

1293
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,165
He and his wife, Jill,

1294
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:42,586
who were the ones that said,
"Salinger's here!"

1295
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,129
And this was terribly exciting.

1296
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,389
And I thought,
"Is it that guy over there?"

1297
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,140
And then they said,
"He's coming to dinner."

1298
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,176
And I remember
we went to this restaurant,

1299
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,597
they'd shoved tables together,
and, sure enough, he was there.

1300
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,391
And I remember
that he sat down at the table.

1301
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,356
We were all excited
about being in his presence.

1302
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,896
He was really there,
the real Salinger,

1303
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,612
and presently he got up and
muttered something to someone

1304
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,276
that he had to
make a phone call.

1305
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,490
Disappeared and never came back.

1306
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,781
When there was this
sudden onslaught,

1307
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,324
he suddenly realised,

1308
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,618
"I don't really need this,
and I don't want this."

1309
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,833
And I think that's the moment
he just turned on his heels

1310
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:22,717
and disappeared into
the mountains of New Hampshire.

1311
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,738
When you read
'Catcher in the Rye',

1312
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,282
you just know
some day, some way,

1313
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,667
Salinger's gonna end up
in a spot

1314
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,045
that he considers
his seclusion.

1315
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,416
In letters, he said to me

1316
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,256
that his friends thought
that he was like Holden

1317
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:10,014
moving west
to run a gas station

1318
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,345
and just bailing out
of the world.

1319
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,638
It didn't mean that he was
a hermit, you know.

1320
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,023
He just didn't want to be
with writers,

1321
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,980
and he certainly didn't want
to be the toast of New York.

1322
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,823
He was protecting himself.

1323
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:35,661
His motives
were really very pure.

1324
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:42,247
He wanted the peace and quiet
to do his work.

1325
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,166
And Cornish
is where he found it.

1326
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,473
I think the world was...

1327
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,180
The world!

1328
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,185
The buzz-status group.

1329
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,144
...was waiting for a big novel.

1330
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,155
And I'm not sure
that's the way Salinger

1331
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,407
really ever wanted to write.

1332
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,990
Everybody wanted him to
write a sequel to 'Catcher'.

1333
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:16,076
He was the guy that
wrote 'The Catcher in the Rye',

1334
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,868
and he was the only one that
really knew what that took,

1335
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:24,130
how much that cost him,
personally, and its true value.

1336
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,087
Never mind what the society
thought or the literary world.

1337
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,720
To him, it was finished,
and he had to move on.

1338
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,851
'Nine Stories' begins and ends

1339
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,058
with a sudden suicide
following a conversation

1340
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,474
in which something
couldn't get said.

1341
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,020
They are characters
who wanna get out of the world,

1342
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:51,942
and the stories end when they're
given permission to leave.

1343
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,202
It's amazing.
It's a strange effect.

1344
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,204
One doesn't bring the
degree of obsession

1345
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,537
that creates perfection

1346
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:06,081
unless there is just
unappeasable hunger,

1347
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,670
unappeasable sadness

1348
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,177
and what I would call a wound.

1349
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,088
You don't get
that kind of perfection

1350
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,429
unless you're trying
to heal something

1351
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,140
that's incredibly badly hurt.

1352
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,937
In 1954, I was in college,

1353
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:29,195
and Jerry would take me
for an evening in New York.

1354
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,980
He would
take me to the Palm Room

1355
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,616
or we'd go to the theatre,
we'd go to the Blue Angel.

1356
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:39,076
I remember once driving back
on that east-side highway

1357
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,412
and seeing
the George Washington Bridge

1358
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,249
and thinking
how absolutely beautiful it was,

1359
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,413
insane how beautiful it was,

1360
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,298
and he laughed.

1361
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:53,962
He said, "Jean, you've got to
learn not to say the obvious."

1362
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:57,883
And I felt,
"Well, you know, he's right."

1363
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,551
I was still young,

1364
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:05,064
but here was this fascinating
man who seemed to like me.

1365
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,816
But in all those letters,
it says,

1366
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,773
"My work has to come first."

1367
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:14,065
And he's sorry to be
such an unromantic man

1368
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:17,030
and I'd have every right to
tell him to go jump in the lake

1369
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,538
and go off with some
less neurotic person.

1370
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:25,619
But once in a while,
he would come and fetch me...

1371
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,918
...and we'd drive up to Cornish.

1372
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:37,426
We would take a walk
in the afternoon and talk

1373
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,886
and then dinner.

1374
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:43,053
And then we'd look at
television by the fire -

1375
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,893
Lawrence Welk or Liberace
or something like that -

1376
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,432
and we'd dance.

1377
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,441
I remember one night,
I said, "Let's dance."

1378
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,068
It was fun.

1379
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,400
We would look at the people
on the television, dancing,

1380
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:57,942
and we just would waltz or...
laughing all the time.

1381
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,452
He seemed filled with joy to me

1382
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,579
a great deal of the time.

1383
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:08,078
But there was never a inkling

1384
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,043
of anything physical
between us.

1385
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:15,130
Jerry Salinger
remembered me always

1386
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,296
on that pier in Daytona Beach.

1387
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,841
I am the one who changed it.

1388
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,805
We were in
the back seat of a taxi

1389
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,187
and I turned and kissed him.

1390
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,145
Not soon after the taxi,

1391
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,186
we went to Montreal
for the weekend.

1392
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:39,776
We went up to our room
and... we went to bed.

1393
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,825
And I told him I was a virgin.

1394
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:46,082
And he didn't like that.

1395
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,290
He didn't want the
responsibility of that, I guess.

1396
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,625
He just didn't like it.

1397
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:56,171
And then the next day,

1398
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,960
we were flying to Boston,

1399
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,256
with me on to New York
and he on to West Lebanon,

1400
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,766
and somehow in the airplane,

1401
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:07,144
he was told that
his plane was cancelled.

1402
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,977
And I began laughing,

1403
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,312
because I was delighted
that we could

1404
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,942
spend the afternoon together,

1405
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:19,153
particularly after what had
just happened the night before.

1406
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:23,411
And I saw this veil
come down on his face.

1407
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,071
Just like this.

1408
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,832
This look of horror and hurt.

1409
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,869
It was a terrible look.

1410
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,755
It was a look
that conveyed everything.

1411
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,667
I think all of a sudden,

1412
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,553
he saw me
in an entirely different light.

1413
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,215
He hustled me
right onto a plane.

1414
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,383
I didn't have a plane
till later in the day.

1415
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,769
He went right to the desk,
got the ticket changed,

1416
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,474
hustled me right on the plane.

1417
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:56,690
I knew I had come
between him and his work.

1418
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,820
And it was over.

1419
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,880
Wow. How do you describe
Claire Douglas?

1420
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:20,467
In many ways, Claire Douglas
will be the widow Salinger.

1421
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,378
You know, there were women
after Claire,

1422
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,639
but she's... she's the wife.

1423
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,014
Salinger
attended a party one night

1424
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:33,272
where he met this
captivating, attractive,

1425
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,603
personable young woman

1426
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,393
who was 19 years old.

1427
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,187
And Salinger, who was 34,

1428
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,573
was instantly attracted to her.

1429
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,359
She's just the kind of a lady
you think with a long dress

1430
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:49,906
and a neat hairdo... and with
a glass of wine in her hands

1431
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,121
talking with lots of
New York people.

1432
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:55,035
Yeah.

1433
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:59,048
Her role... just
didn't seem right.

1434
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,800
Her childhood was not one

1435
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,758
that set her up with
any kind of foundation.

1436
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,297
She was sent off

1437
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,965
to convent boarding school
at age five,

1438
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,726
in and out of
eight different foster homes,

1439
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,637
off to another boarding school,

1440
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:18,560
and the summer between
her junior and senior year,

1441
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,272
met my father.

1442
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,823
Many critics
contend that Claire

1443
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,280
was the inspiration for Franny.

1444
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:31,038
And on February 17, 1955,

1445
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:34,575
J.D. Salinger married
Claire Douglas in Vermont.

1446
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,460
Salinger gave a copy
of the story to Claire

1447
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,667
as their wedding present.

1448
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,130
'Franny' became
a national cultural event.

1449
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,511
It had this kind of
cliffhanger ending

1450
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,343
where the main character,
Franny, fainted.

1451
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,428
And people were wondering
what happened - was she...

1452
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,014
...intoxicated,
pregnant or what?

1453
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,930
On December 10, 1955,

1454
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:57,973
J.D. Salinger became a father.

1455
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,892
His daughter, Margaret,
was born.

1456
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:03,733
The way he viewed Claire
changed after that.

1457
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:06,445
Before that, she had been

1458
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:10,783
the late-teen/early 20s woman
that he was fascinated with.

1459
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,868
Now she was a woman.
She was a mother.

1460
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,533
And I think
the birth of that child

1461
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,293
had a permanent effect
on their relationship.

1462
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,666
When I started
taking care of his kids,

1463
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,679
Claire was due to have Matthew.

1464
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:32,011
And Jerry knew me.

1465
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:35,394
Back in the early '50s,
when I was in high school,

1466
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,101
there was a soda fountain
right in town

1467
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,936
that most of us gathered.

1468
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,693
And Jerry Salinger used to come
right in and be part of that.

1469
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,651
So I knew him from then.
He was just one of the guys.

1470
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:51,944
So Jerry asked me
to help Claire with Margaret.

1471
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,657
We called her Peggy.

1472
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,042
Jerry built a small building

1473
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,548
down over the hill
from the house.

1474
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,800
It was just
a little square house.

1475
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:11,135
And that's where he would go
down, any time, day or night,

1476
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,264
go in and shut the door,

1477
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:16,552
and you wouldn't see him
for a week or longer,

1478
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,517
'cause he got into
a writing mode

1479
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,682
and had to be left
totally alone.

1480
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:24,351
Claire was not allowed
to bother him.

1481
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,277
Nobody could enter the bunker.

1482
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,113
It was the safe place
and a sacred place for him.

1483
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,202
Salinger installed cup hooks

1484
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:41,118
upon which he would place scenes
he had written.

1485
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,629
There were notes tacked up
all over the walls.

1486
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:48,258
It was the place in which
Salinger became the characters.

1487
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:52,388
It was the place that was his
and his Glass family's.

1488
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:53,923
No-one else's.

1489
01:24:54,089 --> 01:25:00,187
So in 1955, Salinger
gave birth to two families -

1490
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,519
his own...
and the Glass family.

1491
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,732
McGOWAN: The Glass family were
seven children, all geniuses,

1492
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,488
who each appeared on a show
called 'It's a Wise Child',

1493
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:12,900
the sons and daughters
of two vaudevillians.

1494
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:16,195
Seymour, the oldest, was the
greatest genius of them all,

1495
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,410
the most spiritual,
the most artistic,

1496
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,541
and he commits suicide.

1497
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,079
And that informs their
entire lives from then on.

1498
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,465
'Franny' was quickly followed
by a wonderful long story

1499
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,377
called 'Raise High
the Roof Beam, Carpenters'

1500
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,796
about characters
of that same family.

1501
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:40,181
The Glass family
and Salinger's real family

1502
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:43,314
would actually compete with
each other for his attention

1503
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,600
and his affection.

1504
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:10,249
How weird is it
when your father is gone

1505
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,167
but you can actually
see where he is,

1506
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,711
but you can't go disturb him?

1507
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,300
What does that do to a child
psychologically

1508
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:19,592
when that's your childhood,
that's your youth?

1509
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,852
No-one said,
"Don't talk about this.

1510
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,387
"Don't think that."

1511
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,648
I mean, you don't
have to to a kid.

1512
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:29,606
Kids pick up what
the elephants are in the room

1513
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,941
that the family's
not talking about.

1514
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,153
By the time Matthew was born,

1515
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,943
you'd think Claire
was a single parent.

1516
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:42,832
And I think that
had to hurt Claire a lot.

1517
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,366
I don't think she thought

1518
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,036
that was gonna be
part of her life with Jerry.

1519
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,842
And she was left to do
all the things for the children

1520
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,846
and to make all the decisions

1521
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,554
for weeks... weeks at a time.

1522
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,390
He put a cot in

1523
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,931
so that he literally
never had to leave the bunker.

1524
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,860
You think about it daily.

1525
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,615
You have flashbacks.

1526
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:24,953
There are times in which I can
be sitting in the living room

1527
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:28,995
and... have artillery
land in my yard

1528
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,584
or in my living room.

1529
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,343
So you do get
those kinds of flashbacks.

1530
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,214
I've never told my wife that.

1531
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:52,442
Sid Perelman, a humorist
and writer for the 'New Yorker',

1532
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,026
did go up to see him
in New Hampshire.

1533
01:27:56,188 --> 01:28:00,910
Sid said, "He's got this
concrete bunker where he works,

1534
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,413
"but he's got a great big statue
of Buddha in the garden

1535
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:09,918
"and he's got a lot of
Buddhist priests around him,

1536
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:13,205
"and they do
a lot of chanting."

1537
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:17,592
And Sid thought
this was very strange.

1538
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:21,506
Salinger's religion
was the central concern

1539
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,048
in his writing.

1540
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:27,095
His championing the ideas
of Vedanta Hinduism

1541
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,637
in his Glass stories.

1542
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,478
The so-called
karma yoga concept

1543
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,358
that comes from
the Bhagavad Gita,

1544
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,235
that you should do your work

1545
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,066
as perfectly
as you possibly can,

1546
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,607
with no thought of rewards,

1547
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:43,903
and only that way can you be
a really happy person.

1548
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,697
When Salinger submitted
the sequel to 'Franny'

1549
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,365
to the 'New Yorker',

1550
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:51,752
this novella called
'Zooey', in 1957,

1551
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:56,211
the fiction editors unanimously
agreed to reject the story.

1552
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,717
William Shawn intervened.

1553
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,601
He was the editor-in-chief,

1554
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,105
and he decreed that the magazine
would, in fact, publish 'Zooey'.

1555
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,608
And since he was the one
who championed it,

1556
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,734
he would edit it himself.

1557
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,271
The 'New Yorker' was Mr Shawn.

1558
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:21,155
There was no other
'New Yorker'.

1559
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,237
He was it.

1560
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,529
Salinger is
the perfect author for him.

1561
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:30,290
Shawn is the perfect editor
for Salinger,

1562
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:34,498
because they're both
strange, brilliant creatures.

1563
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:38,382
William Shawn was a very shy
and introverted person.

1564
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,214
He was a man who was
riddled with phobias.

1565
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,753
Devoted to ideas.

1566
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,172
He wouldn't sit
in the front of a theatre

1567
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,056
because he was
afraid of a fire.

1568
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,934
Has had more books
dedicated to him

1569
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,936
than anyone, probably,
in the history of publishing.

1570
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,599
He carried a hatchet around,
reportedly, in his briefcase.

1571
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,733
He was always afraid
he'd be caught in an elevator

1572
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,270
and have to hack his way out.

1573
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,940
His whole life was really
wrapped up in the 'New Yorker'

1574
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,528
and his writers.

1575
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:08,321
He wouldn't travel if he
had to go through a tunnel.

1576
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:11,990
Salinger truly was grateful
to him for the work he'd done,

1577
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:16,037
and he felt that he had found
a kind of soul mate in Shawn.

1578
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,331
'Zooey' was so successful
that after that,

1579
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,966
all his work was handled
by William Shawn.

1580
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,798
He didn't work with
the other fiction editors

1581
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,507
in the 'New Yorker' anymore.

1582
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:31,931
In the 1960s, 'The Catcher
in the Rye' takes off,

1583
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,312
becoming a cultural phenomenon.

1584
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,269
It literally is
a rite of passage.

1585
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:37,978
It suggested that you had

1586
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,189
lost your literary virginity
in a way.

1587
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:42,901
Everybody loved him -
kids, adults.

1588
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,815
He was an idol, a teen idol.

1589
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,358
Salinger was
the national story.

1590
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,654
In 1961, the big media
really pulled out the big guns.

1591
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,538
'Time', 'Newsweek' and 'LIFE'

1592
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,074
sent out some of
their best reporters.

1593
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,743
Newspaper people
came and did interviews.

1594
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,287
They all started coming,

1595
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,455
and Jerry, he couldn't stop
for a cup of coffee.

1596
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:01,999
They wouldn't allow it.

1597
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,259
'Time' magazine tracked down

1598
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,761
Salinger's sister Doris
at her job at Bloomingdale's,

1599
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,843
and in no uncertain terms,
she basically told them,

1600
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,633
"I would never do anything my
brother wouldn't approve of."

1601
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,643
There was so much attention,

1602
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,770
so much heat, so much light

1603
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:18,057
being focused on J.D. Salinger.

1604
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:19,600
Billy Wilder wanted to make

1605
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,110
a movie of 'The Catcher
in the Rye' so badly

1606
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:24,521
that he had his agents
hound Salinger.

1607
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:27,032
I remember the whole talk
in New York at that time

1608
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,033
was that Elia Kazan
was desperate

1609
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,411
to make a film of
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

1610
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,663
Jerry Lewis, who was,
like, a huge movie star,

1611
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,199
publicly declared
that he was gonna

1612
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:36,958
make a film of
'Catcher in the Rye'.

1613
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,791
And on a fairly regular basis,
he would call J.D. Salinger,

1614
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,330
who would hang up on him.

1615
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,544
Salinger showed up unexpectedly

1616
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,677
at Billy Wilder's
agent's office in New York,

1617
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:50,214
and he starts screaming, "Tell
Billy Wilder to leave me alone!

1618
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,758
"He's very, very insensitive!"

1619
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,894
Elia Kazan going on his
search for 'Catcher in the Rye',

1620
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:59,807
knocking on the door and saying,
"Mr Salinger, I'm Elia Kazan."

1621
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:03,273
And Salinger saying, "That's
nice," and closing the door.

1622
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,608
I hope it's true.

1623
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,569
If they'd made a movie,
Holden wouldn't like it.

1624
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,985
Enough said.

1625
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,700
'Franny and Zooey'
instantly took off.

1626
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,240
It was on the bestseller list
in no time.

1627
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,783
It remained on
the bestseller list

1628
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,872
for weeks and weeks and weeks.

1629
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,381
When J.D. Salinger appears
on the cover of 'Time' magazine,

1630
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,041
it's not a photograph.

1631
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:27,959
It's an imaginary portrait.

1632
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:31,847
It conveys the sense that
the author has enough integrity

1633
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:34,758
not to be part
of the publicity machine.

1634
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,313
I was assigned
by 'LIFE' magazine

1635
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:42,566
to go up and get a picture

1636
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,943
of this man
who was very reclusive

1637
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,899
and had refused
to be photographed,

1638
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:50,532
I guess, for many years.

1639
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,240
The challenge was
to be unobtrusive,

1640
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,904
to not be noticed

1641
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:59,291
and to take advantage
of the terrain,

1642
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:00,951
hiding in the bushes,

1643
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,835
much in the way that one would

1644
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,417
if you were photographing
wildlife.

1645
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,332
You don't walk up there

1646
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,843
with six cameras
hanging round your neck.

1647
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,551
So I put my cameras
in a shopping bag.

1648
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:17,058
I would find my little
hiding place in the bushes

1649
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,436
and stay there all day
shivering.

1650
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,063
Very cold and rainy.

1651
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:27,274
I had a horrible cold,
bordering on the flu.

1652
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,278
The editor had said,

1653
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,405
"If it's more than three days,
forget about it."

1654
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:35,239
Then lo and behold,
on the third day,

1655
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,779
he made an appearance,
to walk his dog, very briefly.

1656
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:40,074
He just emerged
just for a few seconds,

1657
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,710
just enough time for me
to get off a half-dozen frames.

1658
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:45,791
In fact, I was afraid
that I was close enough

1659
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:49,549
that he might be able to hear
the clicking of the shutter.

1660
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:05,023
I remember reading
about him in 'LIFE' magazine.

1661
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,434
I remember reading about
this man who lived in this house

1662
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,977
who didn't want visitors,

1663
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:11,238
didn't want to discuss himself.

1664
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,148
And I remember sort of
being puzzled by that,

1665
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,316
because, again, you know,
you're at that age

1666
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,531
where you're suddenly realising
there are famous people

1667
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,571
and then there's
the rest of us.

1668
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,956
There are people
who have extraordinary lives

1669
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,492
and then there's
the rest of us.

1670
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,457
And here was a man who had
an opportunity to have what,

1671
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,713
at that young age, you thought
was an extraordinary life,

1672
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:32,046
and he was saying, "I'd
rather not. Please go away."

1673
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,128
McGOWAN:
When 'Franny and Zooey',

1674
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:36,672
'Raise High the Roof Beam,
Carpenters,

1675
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,215
'and Seymour, an Introduction'

1676
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:41,260
were published as books,
the literary knives came out.

1677
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:44,054
Joan Didion wrote
that he had a fondness

1678
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,643
for giving instructions
to people on how to live life.

1679
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,275
John Updike wrote,
"Salinger loved his characters

1680
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,277
"more than God loved them."

1681
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:55,066
Lionel Trilling, Alfred Kazin,
Mary McCarthy.

1682
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,575
She wrote an essay
in 'Harper's Magazine'

1683
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,611
called 'J.D. Salinger's
Closed Circuit',

1684
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:03,998
saying the Glass family was an
amoeba that kept splitting off,

1685
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:07,878
each one lovable
and wise and simple,

1686
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,959
and they're all
really one face,

1687
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,624
and they reflect each other
back and forth.

1688
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,384
There's no-one else who
enters this world of theirs.

1689
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:18,672
She saw the entire work he had
done as being narcissistic.

1690
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,887
It is one person reflecting
on his own image.

1691
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,929
You can't get so engrossed
in your own image

1692
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:27,563
without it being
a dangerous thing.

1693
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,145
The fiction went over the edge

1694
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:33,528
with 'Hapworth' in 1965.

1695
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:37,407
It's long on tone
and absolutely devoid of plot.

1696
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:40,865
It was just
the brilliant Seymour

1697
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:44,497
writing as a brilliant
7-year-old from camp,

1698
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:46,374
and it was just too much.

1699
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,955
It was impossible to believe.

1700
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:50,495
They were kind of saying,

1701
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,039
"What happened with
J.D. Salinger?

1702
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,004
"I think he's kind of done.
He's kind of a crackpot."

1703
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:59,967
That was just a little bit too
much theology for most people.

1704
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,474
In the very last piece
of published writing,

1705
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:06,807
Seymour is telling us
that Buddy is gonna have

1706
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,018
the perfect room to write in.

1707
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,433
But we also notice that it's

1708
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,852
sort of like
a solitary confinement.

1709
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:17,192
That's what it takes
to focus that much -

1710
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,403
that's what he needs.

1711
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:24,871
Ultimately, Claire
couldn't stand it anymore.

1712
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:30,414
The isolation, the emotional
distress that she felt

1713
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:32,624
because her husband was

1714
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:35,085
obsessively writing
in the bunker.

1715
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:37,717
And Claire filed for divorce.

1716
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,513
Claire was a lady,

1717
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:45,721
and she deserved
to be treated like one.

1718
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:49,604
But Jerry didn't
treat her like one.

1719
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:56,941
So I was glad to hear
that she was free.

1720
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:30,974
When I was 18,

1721
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,605
I wrote a magazine article

1722
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,141
that changed my life.

1723
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,184
It was published in
the 'New York Times Magazine'

1724
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,604
with a photograph of me
on the cover.

1725
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,944
Within three days of
the publication of that article,

1726
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,983
there were
three enormous sacks of mail

1727
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:45,697
in front of my dormitory room.

1728
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,615
And in among them
was this one letter

1729
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:54,252
that... eclipsed all the rest.

1730
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,412
It began, "Dear Miss Maynard,

1731
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,877
"I bet you're sitting in
your college dormitory room

1732
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,089
"surrounded by letters
from magazine editors

1733
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:05,130
"and book editors
and TV people and radio people."

1734
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,469
All of which was true.

1735
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,681
And then he went on to say that
he knew a thing or two himself

1736
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:14,643
about the dangers, the perils,
of early success.

1737
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:17,730
He said, "People will
try to exploit you,

1738
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,645
"and I urge you to be cautious."

1739
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,406
And it was only when I got
to the bottom of the letter -

1740
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:24,941
and by that time, you know,

1741
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,860
I was already completely
connected to this person -

1742
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,154
that I saw the signature
'J.D. Salinger'.

1743
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,911
He knows
exactly what he's doing.

1744
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:36,374
He knows exactly how powerful
the name J.D. Salinger is.

1745
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,664
It's a name that
with the right girl

1746
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:41,333
creates a spell
that they fall under.

1747
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:44,503
Getting a letter
from J.D. Salinger

1748
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,422
was like getting a letter
from Holden Caulfield

1749
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,842
but written just to me.

1750
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,977
Within three days,
there was a second letter

1751
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,857
and then a third and a fourth.

1752
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:01,189
There was never any question
that we would meet.

1753
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,854
And for my mother,

1754
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,194
it was as if J.D. Salinger
had recognised her,

1755
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,655
because I was her product.

1756
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:11,913
It was as if she had gotten
a letter from J.D. Salinger.

1757
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:15,746
Both of my parents
were brilliant, gifted artists,

1758
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:19,162
both of them sidelined
in this small New Hampshire town

1759
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,672
with no acknowledgement
of their work.

1760
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,629
I had been raised to believe

1761
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,169
that I was going to do
big, important things

1762
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:29,555
and that... this was a sign
that I was going to -

1763
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:32,593
I was going to spend time
with this wonderful man.

1764
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:35,307
My mother was a little unclear
of the boundaries.

1765
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,394
She sewed me a dress
for our meeting.

1766
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:42,652
It was an A-line dress with
very bright primary colours.

1767
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,233
Very short dress.

1768
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,024
My English teacher
from high school

1769
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,614
drove me to the Hanover Inn
where we met.

1770
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:53,279
Jerry was standing
out on the porch.

1771
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:57,121
This tall, lanky person,
and he raised his hand,

1772
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:01,459
and he was waving as if he was
somebody coming in off a boat.

1773
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:03,623
He actually jumped
over the banister.

1774
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:05,757
There was something
very boyish about him.

1775
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,636
I threw my arms around him.
I hugged him.

1776
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:10,717
He hugged me back.

1777
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,224
And the very first thing he said
when he saw me was,

1778
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,009
"You're wearing the watch."

1779
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:19,101
Clearly, he'd really studied
my photograph.

1780
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,561
In the story 'For Esmé -
with Love and Squalor',

1781
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:25,604
the character of Esmé is wearing
a very large man's watch.

1782
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,026
I jumped in the front seat
of his little BMW.

1783
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:33,115
He liked to drive fast

1784
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:36,030
along these
New Hampshire/Vermont roads.

1785
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,541
Covered bridge...

1786
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,499
...winding, winding, winding
up the hill.

1787
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:47,087
His house.

1788
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:52,381
It was just this very quiet,
simple place.

1789
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:57,306
There were no personal items -

1790
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,971
photographs, letters.

1791
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:07,062
The living room had piles and
piles of 'New Yorker' magazines.

1792
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,858
Books stacked everywhere.
Movies stacked everywhere.

1793
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:14,368
Peggy's room - there were stacks
and stacks of movie reels.

1794
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:18,373
'Maltese Falcon',
'Casablanca', 'The 39 Steps',

1795
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:21,910
'The Lady Vanishes' -
all these old movies.

1796
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:23,953
He'd make a bowl of popcorn,

1797
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,418
which he'd sprinkle with
brewer's yeast, as I recall,

1798
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:29,630
and we snuggled up
on this really comfy couch

1799
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,466
and he threaded the films
through the projector

1800
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:35,381
and turned out the lights
and it was movie time.

1801
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:39,185
He loved 'Lost Horizon'.

1802
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:41,220
It's a movie about this place

1803
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,310
where you never grow old.

1804
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:46,271
And he said that the only person

1805
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:50,029
who ever could have played
Holden Caulfield was himself.

1806
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,733
The women in his lives

1807
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:56,118
are really projections

1808
01:41:56,277 --> 01:41:58,200
of his own wishes

1809
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,285
or characters he creates.

1810
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,325
It's a series

1811
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:05,586
of very young women,
because when you're young,

1812
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:08,840
and particularly if you're
a rather lost and insecure

1813
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:11,797
and ungrounded young person,

1814
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:16,806
it's much easier to become
who somebody wishes you to be.

1815
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,841
I was looking for a sage.

1816
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:22,433
I was looking for
some sense of meaning to life.

1817
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,223
And I found it with Salinger.

1818
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,313
But from the moment I moved in,

1819
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:31,025
I could do very little right.

1820
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:35,150
We had a very set routine.

1821
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:39,703
The first thing we did
was have a bowl

1822
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:42,115
of Birds Eye
frozen tender tiny peas,

1823
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,000
not cooked, but with warm water
poured over them.

1824
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,503
So they defrost a little bit.

1825
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:49,130
So they were just cool.

1826
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,165
Then we'd meditate.

1827
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,677
Or at least, he would meditate
and I would try to meditate.

1828
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,554
But my mind kept on wandering
to things of the world,

1829
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:59,886
which was a big problem.

1830
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:04,270
And then we would
get to work writing.

1831
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:07,432
He would put on
a canvas jumpsuit to write.

1832
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:09,817
And he would put it on
like a uniform.

1833
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:12,319
It was kind of like he was,
you know, a soldier,

1834
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:15,823
only he was going off to
wage his war at the typewriter.

1835
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:21,738
He sat on a high chair
at his high desk

1836
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:24,407
in his writing room
and worked on his typewriter.

1837
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,497
A very old typewriter
that clicked.

1838
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:32,836
He cut himself off
from a great deal of the world

1839
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:36,218
but maintained a huge interest
in observing it.

1840
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:39,347
I drew Jerry a lot
back when I lived with him.

1841
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,883
This is a picture of me
sitting on Jerry's lap,

1842
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,393
listening to very old recordings

1843
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,680
of the Andrews Sisters
and Glenn Miller

1844
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:50,225
and an obscure German singer
whose name I don't remember

1845
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:53,190
who was a singer
from World War II.

1846
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:55,980
This is a picture of Jerry and
me dancing, television set on.

1847
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:58,070
Lawrence Welk, no doubt.

1848
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,826
The bubbles would come up
and we'd watch the show

1849
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,908
and we would dance.

1850
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,448
While all of my contemporaries
were off, you know,

1851
01:44:05,614 --> 01:44:10,962
in New Haven doing drugs
and listening to Led Zeppelin.

1852
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:16,259
Every day, I heard typing.

1853
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,511
A lot of typing.

1854
01:44:19,545 --> 01:44:22,298
And there was one space
that was off the bedroom

1855
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:25,218
that was a safe.

1856
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:30,640
I saw two thick manuscripts.
I've written nine books now.

1857
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:33,605
I know what the size
of a book manuscript looks like.

1858
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:36,362
And this... these were thick.

1859
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,945
I never read them,
was never shown them

1860
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,530
and knew better than to ask.

1861
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:44,616
He did show me one thing,

1862
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:47,202
although it wasn't like
I got to sit down and read it,

1863
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:50,368
and that was a kind of
an archive of the Glass family,

1864
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:54,038
who were, in his world,

1865
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:56,128
as real as any relatives.

1866
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:59,089
He was protective
of those characters

1867
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,424
as if they were his children.

1868
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:11,932
Only one time
did I meet friends of his,

1869
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:17,194
and that was this memorable
and, I guess, disastrous lunch.

1870
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:21,074
We drove into New York,
and we went to the Algonquin.

1871
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:24,452
And there was this man,
William Shawn.

1872
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,284
I think Jerry Salinger
really loved William Shawn.

1873
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:29,744
And a writer whose work I did
know, because I had read it

1874
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:32,330
and studied it and admired it -
Lillian Ross.

1875
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:35,747
But I knew from Jerry that
Lillian Ross and William Shawn

1876
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,836
had been lovers for years,

1877
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,342
although William Shawn
was married to somebody else.

1878
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,845
They were known
as Ross and Shawn to Jerry.

1879
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:46,758
So she asked me
what sorts of things I wrote,

1880
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,222
and I prattled on
about my little career

1881
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:51,513
writing for 'Seventeen' magazine

1882
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,602
and judging the
Miss Teenage America Pageant,

1883
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:57,485
and Ross shoots
William Shawn a look.

1884
01:45:57,643 --> 01:46:00,021
And I could well imagine
the 'Talk of the Town' piece

1885
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:02,986
that Lillian Ross would have
written about that lunch.

1886
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,575
This lunch must have
deeply embarrassed Jerry,

1887
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:11,741
because we left the restaurant,
rather hastily,

1888
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:14,285
and we went directly
to Bonwit Teller,

1889
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:18,752
and he bought me a very
expensive black cashmere coat

1890
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:21,633
of the sort that
Lillian Ross might have worn.

1891
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:28,432
I think he was indulging

1892
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:33,597
in a fantasy
of innocence that... that...

1893
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:36,311
...that neither one of us
could hold onto very long.

1894
01:46:38,559 --> 01:46:41,563
One day,
I heard the telephone ring

1895
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:45,859
and I heard him speaking
very briefly and then a click.

1896
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:51,031
And then he emerged
from his office...

1897
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,746
...with a look on his face
I had never seen.

1898
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:56,832
And he said,

1899
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,962
"'Time' magazine

1900
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:01,215
"has got my number.

1901
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:04,172
"You have ruined my life."

1902
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:17,436
For years, I avoided any
information about J.D. Salinger.

1903
01:47:17,598 --> 01:47:23,105
Ask me about him, I said nothing
and I wrote nothing about him.

1904
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:26,607
And I was at a party
in New York City,

1905
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,742
pregnant with my third child,

1906
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:31,575
and there was a woman
who came over to me.

1907
01:47:31,737 --> 01:47:34,411
And she said, "So...

1908
01:47:34,573 --> 01:47:37,417
"You're the one
that lived with J.D. Salinger.

1909
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,578
"He wrote you letters,
didn't he?"

1910
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:42,123
And then she said,
"I had an au pair girl

1911
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:44,712
"who got lots of letters
from him too."

1912
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:51,349
And I remember
feeling my stomach drop.

1913
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:54,727
And that was the first
of what ultimately were

1914
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:58,981
a surprising number
of stories about girls,

1915
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:02,018
always girls,
getting letters from Salinger.

1916
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:06,776
J.D. Salinger's love letters

1917
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:08,862
come back
and kick him in the ass.

1918
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:12,654
14 highly personal letters by
reclusive author J.D. Salinger

1919
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,699
to then 18-year-old writer
Joyce Maynard in the early '70s

1920
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:17,787
are to be auctioned
at Sotheby's.

1921
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,078
Joyce Maynard wrote
a sort of kiss-and-tell memoir,

1922
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:22,167
but when she put up at auction

1923
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,252
the letters that Salinger
had written her,

1924
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:26,338
Peter Norton,
the software developer,

1925
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,753
thought it was such
a terrible act of disloyalty

1926
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:32,139
that he bought the letters
and returned them to Salinger.

1927
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:35,642
When I made
the decision to write that book,

1928
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:37,974
I needed
to go see Jerry Salinger.

1929
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,390
And I didn't do
what the worshippers did,

1930
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:42,558
which was to stand
at the end of the driveway.

1931
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,438
A woman called out to me,
"What do you want?"

1932
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,527
"I've come to see Jerry.

1933
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,863
"Would you tell him
Joyce Maynard's here?"

1934
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:53,949
And then she sort of
turned to me

1935
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:57,786
and looked at me through
the window and smiled, actually,

1936
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:01,703
and I realised that that was
the au pair girl, Colleen.

1937
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:05,539
And then the door opened,
and there he stood.

1938
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,708
And he was
shaking his hand at me,

1939
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,173
and he said,
"What are you doing here?!"

1940
01:49:10,335 --> 01:49:13,760
I said, "I've come to ask you
a question, Jerry.

1941
01:49:15,591 --> 01:49:19,471
"What... what was my purpose
in your life?"

1942
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:23,140
"That question, that question...

1943
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,937
"You don't deserve an answer
to that question."

1944
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:31,482
And then he let loose
this torrent.

1945
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:33,867
"I hear
you're writing something,

1946
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:35,949
"some kind of reminiscence."

1947
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:38,864
And he said it
as if that was an obscene act.

1948
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:42,126
He watches very much
what's going on in the world.

1949
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:48,508
He said, "I always knew this is
what you'd amount to - nothing.

1950
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:54,013
"You have spent your life
writing meaningless garbage.

1951
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:56,845
"And now you mean
to exploit me."

1952
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:02,104
And he said, "The problem
with you, Joyce, is...

1953
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:06,024
"..you...
"..love..."

1954
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:08,402
"..the world."

1955
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,532
Margaret Salinger
is back with us this morning

1956
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,571
to talk some more

1957
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:21,661
about her controversial memoir,
'Dream Catcher'.

1958
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:23,997
The book is an intensely
private look at her famous,

1959
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,628
yet very reclusive, father,
J.D. Salinger.

1960
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:29,757
Do you think, Peggy,
he ultimately went into writing

1961
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:34,011
so he could create characters
or create his own universe

1962
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,263
where people
met his expectations?

1963
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,515
I personally think

1964
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:42,224
that that is certainly,

1965
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:45,230
um, what's going on.

1966
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:50,194
I sat and cried
reading that book.

1967
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:53,231
And I don't know how much
of her book is really true

1968
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:55,320
and how much isn't.

1969
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:59,658
But I think it's
the saddest thing I ever read.

1970
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:06,995
Guess we shouldn't
have got on that. Sorry.

1971
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:09,084
Matthew Salinger told me

1972
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:11,169
that the picture
that his sister painted

1973
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:13,254
of growing up
in the Salinger household

1974
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:16,387
was nothing like
his memories of childhood.

1975
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:18,547
And he was quite adamant
about that.

1976
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,682
How would you characterise
the relationship

1977
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:23,219
you have
with your father today?

1978
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:26,355
- Oh, that's easy. None.
- None?

1979
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:30,522
No!

1980
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:34,771
As a police officer
in the 20th Precinct,

1981
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,815
we got a report of shots fired

1982
01:51:36,982 --> 01:51:39,076
at 1 West 72nd Street -
that's the Dakota.

1983
01:51:39,234 --> 01:51:41,532
I just couldn't wait
till those police got there.

1984
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,618
I didn't know what to do.

1985
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,249
I took 'The Catcher in the Rye'
out of my pocket.

1986
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:49,412
There was a man standing
in the street saying,

1987
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:51,455
"That's the man
doing the shooting."

1988
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:53,465
So I drew my gun,
grabbed Chapman,

1989
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:55,422
and I put him up
against the wall.

1990
01:51:55,584 --> 01:51:58,554
And here is John Lennon
being carried out

1991
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,885
by two police officers
from my precinct.

1992
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:02,971
And at eye-level, I see
John Lennon's face

1993
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:05,010
with his eyes closed

1994
01:52:05,177 --> 01:52:07,100
and blood coming out
of his mouth.

1995
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:09,856
They decided to put him
in the radio car and take him

1996
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:12,768
to the hospital immediately,
try to save his life.

1997
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,812
So I handcuffed Chapman.

1998
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:17,606
I look down on the ground, I
said, "Are these your clothes?"

1999
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:19,696
He says,
"Yes, and the book too."

2000
01:52:19,858 --> 01:52:22,407
I look at the book. You know,
it's 'Catcher in the Rye'.

2001
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:25,118
I was literally living inside
of a paperback novel,

2002
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,408
J.D. Salinger's
'The Catcher in the Rye'.

2003
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:29,497
We have to remember,

2004
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,879
the things we produce,
symbolically

2005
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:34,290
and in language,
we have no control

2006
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:37,005
over what happens to them
once we let them go.

2007
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,465
Salinger put
his depression into Holden.

2008
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:41,551
It's almost like black magic.

2009
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:44,717
Some of his depression may go
away, but the character lives,

2010
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:47,853
and there are some readers
who will take the depression

2011
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:50,105
out of the character
into themselves.

2012
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:52,392
The conversation
Salinger creates

2013
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:55,185
between himself and the reader
is so close

2014
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:57,275
that if you misread it,

2015
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:01,317
you read Holden's antipathy
to the culture

2016
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:03,611
as license to kill.

2017
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:07,577
To have the book with him,
he was right there

2018
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:10,743
with J.D. Salinger,
right there with Holden.

2019
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:12,786
Holden wasn't violent,

2020
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:16,127
but he had a violent thought
of shooting someone.

2021
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:18,167
The word 'kill' is used
a lot in the book.

2022
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:21,633
"This is my people-shooting hat.
I kill people in this hat."

2023
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:24,799
The word 'phoney' is used
over 30 times in the book.

2024
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:27,935
Chapman read an article
in 'Esquire' magazine.

2025
01:53:28,093 --> 01:53:30,016
The theme of the article was

2026
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:32,101
John Lennon was a sell-out,

2027
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,141
John Lennon was a phoney.

2028
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:37,312
I say to myself,
"That phoney. That bastard."

2029
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:40,026
If you are reading the
book through a distorted lens,

2030
01:53:40,188 --> 01:53:43,237
you feel so acutely
Holden's powerlessness,

2031
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,529
and you say,
"Yeah. I feel powerless too."

2032
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:49,790
John Lennon
was talking to a nobody

2033
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:52,292
to sign an album for a nobody.

2034
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:54,579
"Look at this guy.
He's a big rock star.

2035
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:56,873
"He comes in a limousine."
Look, he's a phoney.

2036
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:58,962
"You want me to teach you
what reality is?" Bang!

2037
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:01,377
Mark David Chapman

2038
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:04,342
wrote me a letter
that I should read

2039
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:06,552
'Catcher in the Rye'
to understand

2040
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:09,309
why he committed this murder.

2041
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:12,893
He reads that novel in open
court when he is sentenced.

2042
01:54:13,055 --> 01:54:16,810
This is my statement,
underlining the word 'this'.

2043
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:20,525
If one... person used something
I had written

2044
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:23,236
as their justification
for killing somebody,

2045
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:26,527
I'd say,
"God, people are crazy."

2046
01:54:28,779 --> 01:54:30,702
It didn't end
with the death of John Lennon.

2047
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:32,912
You keep paying for this
over and over

2048
01:54:33,075 --> 01:54:34,952
when you hear
of a death of a celebrity,

2049
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,870
and maybe they've got
'The Catcher in the Rye',

2050
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:38,414
as John Hinckley did.

2051
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,833
Young Hinckley,
the whiz-kid who shot Reagan,

2052
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:43,502
and his press secretary said,
"If you want my defence,

2053
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:47,218
"all you have to do is read
'Catcher in the Rye'."

2054
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:49,634
Rebecca Schaeffer
was expecting a script

2055
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,723
to be delivered to her
for 'Godfather III'.

2056
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:53,762
Rebecca Schaeffer
came to the door.

2057
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:56,023
Like this.

2058
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:59,060
Among the pieces of evidence

2059
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:01,149
was a copy of
'Catcher in the Rye'.

2060
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:03,279
But if three people

2061
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:06,112
use something I had written
as justification,

2062
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:08,777
I would really be
very, very troubled by it.

2063
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:12,323
It's not the one.
It's the series of three.

2064
01:55:20,455 --> 01:55:22,674
I would see him downtown

2065
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:24,756
and I'd say hi

2066
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:27,467
and he'd walk right by
and not even say hi.

2067
01:55:27,629 --> 01:55:29,757
And I knew him well.

2068
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,694
I was talking to
a friend who owned a bookstore,

2069
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:49,360
and I told him, I said, "I'm
really thinking I'll just go

2070
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:51,449
"up to New Hampshire
and find J.D. Salinger."

2071
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:54,160
And he says, "Yeah, well,
I think you oughta call up NASA

2072
01:55:54,322 --> 01:55:57,041
"and, you know, bum a ride
on the next space shuttle too."

2073
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,077
Well, the minute
you go into town

2074
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:01,963
and you say "J.D. Salinger",
everybody becomes your enemy.

2075
01:56:02,122 --> 01:56:05,376
This one lady in the shop would
not sell me an ice-cream cone.

2076
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:08,967
So I thought, "Ooh!
Not my friendliest place."

2077
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:12,432
The owner of the market
suggested that I write a note,

2078
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:14,514
that I didn't need
a mailing address,

2079
01:56:14,676 --> 01:56:16,804
just leave it
at the post office.

2080
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,893
I bought a notebook,
went outside, sat on the kerb,

2081
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:21,854
wrote a note - I was determined
not to go to his property.

2082
01:56:22,017 --> 01:56:23,940
I wasn't gonna
cross that river.

2083
01:56:24,102 --> 01:56:26,355
I thought if he came in
voluntarily to where I was

2084
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:29,616
that no-one could ever say
with any truth

2085
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:31,242
that I had sabotaged the man,

2086
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,324
that I had waylaid him
or any of those things.

2087
01:56:33,487 --> 01:56:35,410
So I was ready.

2088
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:37,700
Sat down where I said
I would be and waited.

2089
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:40,790
He doesn't have to go down
and meet her in her Pinto.

2090
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:43,330
If he really wants to protect
his seclusion that much,

2091
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:45,420
he doesn't go.

2092
01:56:45,582 --> 01:56:47,459
And so here he came.

2093
01:56:47,626 --> 01:56:51,130
He walked across the bridge.
I didn't know what to expect.

2094
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:53,799
We've all seen that photograph
on the back of the book.

2095
01:56:53,965 --> 01:56:55,842
You expect people
to age, but...

2096
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:59,058
...somehow,
it's not the same as seeing it.

2097
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:01,144
There he was,
and I was shocked.

2098
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:03,229
He was as tall
as I thought he would be,

2099
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:06,144
but he had snow-white hair,
and I was not prepared for that.

2100
01:57:07,187 --> 01:57:09,610
We shook hands, and he said,

2101
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:13,118
"If you're a writer, you need
to quit that newspaper.

2102
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:15,529
"Newspapers serve no purpose."

2103
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:20,201
And he said publishing was the
worst thing a person could do.

2104
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:25,464
He insisted that he was
working, working for himself,

2105
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,795
and that's what
writing should be -

2106
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,256
that every writer should write
for their own reasons,

2107
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:32,341
but it should be
for themselves alone.

2108
01:57:32,504 --> 01:57:34,848
The only important thing
was the writing.

2109
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:37,759
According to J.D. Salinger.

2110
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:39,473
What is he writing about?

2111
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:41,559
He said, "I will say this.

2112
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,723
"It is of far more significance

2113
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,611
"than anything
I ever wrote about Holden."

2114
01:57:47,769 --> 01:57:51,023
He said, "I have
really serious issues

2115
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:54,944
"that I'm trying to tackle with
these new writing projects."

2116
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:56,487
And he always said 'writing'.

2117
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:58,576
I persisted - I wanted to know

2118
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,661
if he was writing a sequel

2119
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:02,747
to 'The Catcher in the Rye'.

2120
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:05,583
And he became
rather annoyed, agitated.

2121
01:58:05,745 --> 01:58:08,624
And so I finally just put the
notebook down, put my pen down

2122
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:12,385
and looked up at him and said,
"Why did you come here?"

2123
01:58:12,544 --> 01:58:17,596
He lost some of his intensity,
uncrossed his arms

2124
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:22,558
and he said that he thought
writing Holden was a mistake.

2125
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:39,495
It meant he couldn't live
a normal life.

2126
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:42,077
His children suffered.

2127
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:45,585
Why couldn't his life
be his own?

2128
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:52,881
Then he turned around
and stalked off.

2129
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,966
And so I watched him walk away

2130
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,756
and I took the photo of him
walking back toward the bridge.

2131
01:58:57,922 --> 01:59:02,473
It was just the personification
of his attitude.

2132
01:59:02,636 --> 01:59:04,730
"Just leave me alone."

2133
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,611
J.D. Salinger
is very much a Howard Hughes.

2134
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:19,745
He is still a man in control
of his domain there.

2135
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,826
And it remains to be seen

2136
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:24,992
what, actually,
he is sitting upon.

2137
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:39,347
I think the guy's
earned the right

2138
01:59:39,506 --> 01:59:41,975
to do it his way,
and you know what,

2139
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:45,182
whether he's earned it or not,
he's doing it his way anyway.

2140
01:59:54,813 --> 01:59:57,362
I guess what I'd like to ask
him is what he's written for

2141
01:59:57,524 --> 02:00:00,027
the last 40 years - isn't that
what everybody wants to know?

2142
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,241
It's
the great literary mystery.

2143
02:00:02,404 --> 02:00:05,954
I want to believe.
I want to see more of the work.

2144
02:00:06,116 --> 02:00:08,460
He promised in the back flaps
of 'Franny and Zooey'

2145
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:11,246
and 'Seymour, an Introduction'
that he's writing other stories.

2146
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:12,915
I just wanna see that stuff.

2147
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:15,755
If he published
a book tomorrow,

2148
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:20,172
it would be a number one
bestseller the next day.

2149
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:23,968
He very proudly showed me
a set of files

2150
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:27,604
where a red dot meant "This is
ready to go upon my death,"

2151
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:30,936
a green dot meant
"This needs editing."

2152
02:00:31,099 --> 02:00:32,476
Someone cracks that code, man,

2153
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:34,235
it's gonna be
the story of the century.

2154
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:37,694
If he does publish and
the writing is actually good,

2155
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,779
it will be a second act

2156
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:42,740
unlike almost
any American writer has had.

2157
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:20,061
I wanted you to ask me
if I ever met J.D. Salinger.

2158
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:23,856
Mr Berg, have you
ever met J.D. Salinger?

2159
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:27,700
I've never met J.D. Salinger.

2160
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:30,658
But I came close.

2161
02:03:31,696 --> 02:03:34,575
When I was researching my book
on Max Perkins,

2162
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:37,836
I went up to visit
Max Perkins's sister,

2163
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:40,213
and as we're sitting there
at dinner, I said,

2164
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:42,465
"Gosh," you know, "as I was
driving up to see you,

2165
02:03:42,624 --> 02:03:45,298
"it occurred to me that
across the covered bridge

2166
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:49,340
"is Cornish, New Hampshire, and
J.D. Salinger lives over there.

2167
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:51,974
"Have you ever seen
J.D. Salinger?"

2168
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:54,477
And she said, "Well,
why do you want to know?"

2169
02:03:54,636 --> 02:03:57,310
I said,
"Well, I was just curious."

2170
02:03:57,472 --> 02:04:00,271
And she said, "Well,
as a matter of fact,

2171
02:04:00,433 --> 02:04:03,482
"he sat in that chair you're
sitting in just last night

2172
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,864
"when I served him dinner."

2173
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:08,445
I said, "You're kidding."

2174
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:11,111
She said, "No, no,
he comes over here regularly,

2175
02:04:11,277 --> 02:04:13,450
"'cause he comes over
to pick up his mail.

2176
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:16,992
"He'll stop in. Sometimes
I'll ask him to stay to dinner."

2177
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:19,126
I said, "Really? J.D. Salinger?"

2178
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:41,354
She said, "Well, do you have
anything to say to him?"

2179
02:04:41,516 --> 02:04:44,190
"I mean, if I had
J.D. Salinger and you to dinner,

2180
02:04:44,352 --> 02:04:46,901
"what would you want to know?"

2181
02:04:47,063 --> 02:04:50,909
I said, "Well, I think I'd want
to know if he's still writing."

2182
02:04:52,443 --> 02:04:55,196
She said, "Well, yes,
he's still writing."

2183
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,617
I said, "OK." And...

2184
02:04:58,783 --> 02:05:00,626
She said, "Anything else
you'd want to know?"

2185
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:03,709
I said, "No, just
that he's OK, I guess."

2186
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:05,965
She said, "He's fine."

2187
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,550
♪ Every moment
was so precious... ♪

2188

to ever see him, is there?"

2189
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:18,390
Dinner was over.

2190
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:22,103

to J.D. Salinger.

It's called
'Catcher in the Rye',

2211
02:07:08,788 --> 02:07:11,507
and it has some
very risqué parts.

2212
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:14,886
- All right!
- Strong, vulgar language.

2213
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:16,967
And, in fact...

2214
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:19,303
...many schools across
the country still ban this book

2215
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:21,433
because it's thought to be
so inappropriate.

2216
02:07:21,592 --> 02:07:23,515
Oh, man, I can't wait!

2217
02:07:23,678 --> 02:07:26,272
Tonight, more coverage of
Washington's Foley Follies,

2218
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:29,058
a tribute to one of America's
most underrated presidents,

2219
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:31,819
and I sit down
with author J.D. Salinger.

2220
02:07:31,978 --> 02:07:34,072
Jon?

2221
02:07:35,106 --> 02:07:37,074
J.D. Salinger
is on your show tonight?

2222
02:07:37,233 --> 02:07:39,486
Yeah, got a new book out.
He's doing a junket.

2223
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:41,529
Me, 'Hannity & Colmes'
and 'The View'.

2224
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:43,619
Stephen, you're... you're...

2225
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:46,204
...you're lying, right?

2226
02:07:46,367 --> 02:07:48,665
Well, I did invite
Salinger to come on.

2227
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:50,626
Can we please read this
right now?!
