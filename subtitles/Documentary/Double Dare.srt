[1. You kill the person that I love = YBS]

18
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:03,499
You're really YBS...<br> -That's right, I'm a YBS person.

19
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:05,289
So, what do you want?!

20
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,429
Why are you yelling and causing a ruckus?

21
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:16,232
Because this car has no family insurance registered, <br>you cannot receive any insurance.

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,973
[1. Isn't insured]

[1. My brother is going to kill me.]

Cost of Fixing Foreign Cars is Rising. <br> [The price of the foreign car 3B is rising.]

26
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,822
<i>In most cases, even if it's a simple event, the repair costs <br> are almost $4,000...</i>

[1. Repair Cost $4,000.]

28
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:51,290
I have a slipped disc, I think it's completely broken.

29
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,970
Aiyoo, what do I do?

30
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,425
You were fine until a minute ago.

31
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,926
That's because there was an accident.

32
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,820
Oh, what do I do? I really don't think that I can move.

33
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:04,909
The hospital. I think I'll have to go to the hospital.

34
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:16,023
I reported on disc patients' emergency procedures,

35
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:20,732
and a real disc patient can't straighten their back like this.

36
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:22,604
I'm hurting even more because of you right now.

37
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:24,478
Do I have to live forever like this?

38
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,975
With my back twisted like this?

39
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:31,800
Aigoo, really **** I got caught by the wrong **** person.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,960
Curse. Did you just curse at me, Announcer?

41
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,205
What? You shouldn't curse at me.

42
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:40,660
How can an announcer curse like that?

43
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:44,036
Omo, really, how can you...<br> Aigoo, really.

44
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:47,664
I wanted to just do it nicely through the insurance. But this woman, we can't do it.

45
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:50,390
Let's go to the police station. <br> -Wait one minute.

46
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,578
That's fine.

47
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,489
I'll let you go.

48
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:56,840
Oh, let's just treat it like it never happened.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,399
If you give me only $2,000 to repair my car. <br> -I can't.

50
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:04,268
If only for the good of society,<br> a wench like you has to go to jail.

51
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:06,642
Give me your drivers license<br> and go first to the police station.

52
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,715
I'll follow from behind you. <br>-How can you even use violence?

53
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:14,554
Oh, let go of me.<br> HOLD ONTO THE STEERING WHEEL!

54
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:21,011
Give me your driver's license and start the engine.

55
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,051
You're a broadcast writer?

56
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,118
If something like you comes into a broadcast station, the broadcast will all be ruined.

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,263
Ok, depart.

58
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:52,550
I was wondering who would drive so recklessly,

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,982
you were a beginner!

60
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:57,320
That's what I thought too, 'Who's that driving so recklessly?"

61
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,336
You were driving without a license.

62
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,708
What driving without a license?

63
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,801
The expiration date has passed.

64
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,228
Way over one year.

65
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,730
Here, shall we try to go up against each other earnestly?

66
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:23,612
My waist has gotten better.

67
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,910
For ten minutes now, back and forth.

68
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:34,920
We're not even at the zoo.

69
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:40,925
Aiyoo, my car's repair costs $2,000. If you give me <br>that then it's fine.

70
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:49,671
<i>Kim Shin, you really have no sense.</i>

71
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:52,578
<i>Do you really not understand the atmosphere right now?</i>

72
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:53,603
Fine, fine.

73
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:57,179
I'll give you a big discount, $1,900.

74
00:04:57,241 --> 00:05:00,512
And on top of that, that an announcer cursed,

75
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,230
using my disc as an excuse to hug me from behind,

76
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,086
all kinds of violence, and most importantly not having a license,

77
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:12,045
I will forget everything, ok?

78
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:18,624
Ok.

79
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,223
Then, the money...

80
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,950
I'll turn myself in.

81
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:24,170
Turn yourself in?!

82
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,032
Why? Are you crazy?

83
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:28,230
You're studying to be a broadcast writer, aren't you?

84
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,104
Watch carefully.

85
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,158
While you're doing broadcast work, this type of moment,

86
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,642
"Should I tell the truth or take the lie?" <br>There's a lot of places to get hung up,

87
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,061
then we have to choose the truth, the facts.

88
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:44,502
Aiyoo, your position is very admirable, but

89
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:50,646
I already decided to forgive you and make it as if it never happened. Why...

90
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:54,491
There's you, the viewer.

91
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,883
I'm really ok.<br>-A lie isn't ok.

92
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:59,714
So, let's go in together.

93
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:02,008
Aiyoo, why me?

94
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,462
Driving with no license and a car accident are two different things.

95
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:07,172
You need to pay for the damage.

96
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:11,022
Oh no, wait, wait.

97
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:14,424
I want to see it!

98
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:21,409
I saw your last news broadcast.

99
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,764
You said that you would return to the anchor position,

100
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:27,167
but I felt it so abruptly.

101
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:31,269
In truth, I'm a fan of yours.

102
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,543
The news, every day, I only watched yours.

103
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,987
5 o'clock. Isn't that right?

104
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:45,291
I, as a fan, really respect this kind of form,

105
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,605
but I want to see you return quickly and read the news again.

106
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:53,415
And the driving without a license, it's not really that.

107
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:59,219
Since you're busy, wouldn't it be because you forgot? <br>Isn't that right?

108
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,355
But still, I'm an anchor.

109
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:10,784
As a person who publicly criticizes others, I myself must have no stain in my record-<br>-One year later.

110
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:13,241
One year later, after returning to the anchor's spot, you can explain it then.

111
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,241
Your viewers aren't foolish.

112
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:21,977
If they just feel your sincerity, they'll understand your <br>heart definitely.

113
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,099
That's fine.

114
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:32,107
Then after one year definitely. <br> -Definitely.

115
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:34,541
I'll reveal it.

116
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:37,387
From that meaning, your phone number.

117
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,444
Yes?<br>- I have to receive my car's repair fee, $4,000.

118
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:45,422
You don't have to repay it immediately, so your number.

119
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,619
I'll tell you after I see my cellphone.

120
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,594
You can't memorize that? Your number?

121
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,065
Oh, is there any reason for anyone to call me?

122
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,289
Also, I changed my phone number a little while ago.

123
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,102
Why start the engine.<br>-To turn on the light.

124
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,479
It's so dark that I can't see where my cellphone is.

125
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:18,645
Oh, hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

126
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,058
Oh, there was an accident.

127
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,930
It's urgent right now, so let's talk after I get home.

128
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:48,072
How can she think of running away in that situation?

129
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:51,027
Is she really crazy?

130
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,643
<i>I'm sorry that I ran away.</i>

131
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,644
<i>Right now, I really have no money.</i>

132
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:58,348
<i>But one day, I will definitely repay you.</i>

133
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:00,915
<i>I'm really sorry.</i> <br>-She's really laughable.

134
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,317
Then why did you hide your number?

135
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:07,077
Just wait till you get caught by me...

136
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,471
Mi Rae! You, what kind of accident happened to you?

137
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,303
Were you hurt a lot?

138
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,863
I have to sit down.

139
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,086
Why?

140
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:21,136
Oh...<br> -Hello.

141
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,257
<i>It's my brother.</i><br> -Who are you?

142
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:32,705
Oh, she's my friend. My very close friend, Hae Rim. Hae Rim's closest ahjumma,

143
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:38,017
something happened with their lease on deposit and I told her to stay here for two months.

144
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:40,529
Did you buy this house?

145
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,525
Why didn't you ask if you were going to bring someone in?

146
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,993
I did it because I owed her a personal debt of gratitude.

147
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,946
Since the second floor is empty, couldn't we tell <br>her to stay there?

148
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:50,770
Debt of gratitude? Did you commit a sin?

149
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,017
Oppa!

150
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:04,990
Oh. You look a lot like a person she knows so when I showed her a picture of you earlier, she cried so much.

151
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,370
Oppa. Oppa. Oppa.

152
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:14,068
What's with that Oppa. She called me Oppa.

153
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,713
Isn't there something mentally wrong with that Ahjumma?

154
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:16,760
No, she's fine.

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,076
It's just because she has a lot of emotions.

156
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:23,080
At the broadcast station, is there any extra work?

157
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:25,876
Aiyoo, there's a lot of extra work. The problem is that there's no one who knows how to do it properly.

158
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,047
Hey, that's right. Among your friends is there anyone who knows how to preview?

159
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,770
Forget it.

160
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,346
Would your friends be any different? When you're like that.

161
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,848
That P...What is it? Can't I do it?

162
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,754
Why? If you teach me, I can do it well.

163
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:42,915
In high school I took broadcasting classes, and I won an award in the film contest!

164
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,972
Do you think the broadcast is some sort of high school symposium?

165
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,376
Who hasn't won an award at a film contest?

166
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:51,473
And also, writers are all people who participated in the newspaper writing contest.

167
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:54,766
How can you? You weren't even good at studying.

168
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,661
Who says I'm taking a PD entrance exam?

169
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,890
I just wanted to go to the broadcast station and learn to do some part-time work.

170
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:03,658
Just in case, if I hear that you're doing broadcast work at another broadcast station, I'm going to turn it upside down.

171
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,541
Why?! Why when it's somewhere else?

172
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:07,520
Because it's obvious that you won't be able to do it.

173
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,805
Then just by being your brother, I'll be disgraced.

174
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:14,187
Instead of going to the broadcast station, get married, get married, get married, married...

175
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,222
Why do you keep bothering me?

176
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going to go out.<br> -Give me the car keys.

177
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,184
Why the car keys?<br>-I have to go to work tomorrrow.

178
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:26,213
That's right. Even if the transportation costs come out to a lot, I'm going to take it to the office from now on.

179
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,813
I can't bear to see you going around<br> using my car. Give me the key.

180
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,134
Oppa...

181
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:36,761
You know the saying that good luck comes to the <br>one that endures.

182
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,996
May you receive a lot of good luck.

183
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:45,083
Aiyoo, what do I do about that person? When it becomes tomorrow there's going to be such a commotion.

184
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:48,682
Ahjumma, could it be that the person<br> who's going to die is my brother?

185
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:51,468
It would be good if it was him.

186
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,017
I'm just kidding. A joke.

187
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:55,962
Even if he's bad tempered, he's the one and only family I have so of course he can't die.

188
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,126
It would be big trouble, right?

189
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:01,368
But Ahjumma, why did you cry earlier?

190
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:03,969
I can understand you being happy to see him after <br>such a long time,

191
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:06,802
don't you think crying is a bit overboard?

192
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,850
Okay, fine.

193
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,261
Oh, dust...

194
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,302
Ahjumma, to let the dust out we have to leave that open...

195
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,527
Don't open it. Leave it.

196
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,305
You...

197
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:19,115
should..

198
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,640
promise me... that you'll not go to

199
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,660
the broadcasting station. Okay?

200
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,313
It will be okay if I avoid YBS...<br>-If you don't do as I say,

201
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,324
I will just go back now. All the prizes <br>you would get in the future

202
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:32,902
includes a refrigerator, television, apartment, and a car, but..

203
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,908
I will not go there.

204
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,025
Really?<br>-Yes.

205
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:40,110
Instead, please give me some time.

206
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,482
I absolutely can't become a public servant so help me find what else I might be good at.

207
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,568
I will think about it a little bit more because I'm curious.

208
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,145
Organize it within three days. I don't have the time.

209
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,254
What do you mean that you don't have time? <br>You even went with me to have fun at Jeju.

210
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,755
I told you, right?

211
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:58,055
I came here risking my life.

212
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,977
To me, one day is like one month.

213
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:02,584
I'm getting older.

214
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:06,149
When I turned thirty, time started to go so fast.

215
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,360
They say it goes as fast as the age. When you're 30, 30km/hr, when you're 40, 40km/hr, for ahjumma...

216
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,374
It does seem fast.

217
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:17,109
But still drive safely. Ok?

218
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,313
Ah, pillow! I didn't bring a pillow. I'll be back.

219
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,797
Aigoo, really.

220
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:28,269
I'll be right back.

221

223
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,569
It would be a waste, but

224
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,679

<i>Could it be that you've really done something wrong?</i>

245
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,694
The Police aren't cooperating.

246
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:45,806
The police's wife is a big fan of you, Sunbae Kim.

00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:52,924
I don't want to.

250
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:55,011
Also, to a young person, what do you mean a shoot?

251
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,075
<i>He's famous! Starting at 1 am,</i>

252
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,684
he's number one on the search list.

253
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:04,969
And the things we prepared, they're going to completely take out and they're going to go with the unlicensed storyline.

254
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:08,559
<i>Go to the office. I'm telling you it's been chaotic.</i>

00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,693
Ah, yes. I...

00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,344
Hello!

263
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:43,661
Oh, here's the opening. We changed it to be about unlicensed drivers.

264
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:45,810
Okay, we're starting.

265
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,733
I'm thinking if we should really be doing this.

266
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,393
It's a totally hot issue.

267
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,406
You have a license, right?

268
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,498
Why?

269
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,498
I left it at home.

270
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:01,543
Aiyoo, it's more effective if the MC take his own<br> driver's license there directly.

271
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:05,782
Okay, 30 seconds. This is the last warning.

272
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,720
We'll go. 5 seconds.

273
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,267
4 seconds.

274
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:14,203
3 seconds.

275
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,756
Cue.

276
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:20,481
Hello. I am Kim Shin on Kim Shin's Morning Show.

277
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:25,886
Today at dawn, a famous idol group's leader was caught driving without a license.

278
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,239
He's said he was so busy,

279
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:31,846
he didn't know that his driver's license had expired, and that it was a simple mistake,

280
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,718
but the public's response is cold.

281
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:38,256
<br>

282
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:40,590
Please explain!<br>[Famous idol group's leader Chang Gong, caught driving without a license]

283
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,372
I'm sorry to my fans and to all the citizens.<br><i>Chang Gong (22)</i>

284
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:56,472
A driver's license doesn't just apply to oneself,

285
00:17:56,472 --> 00:18:00,377
it is something that can affect the life or death of another citizen.

286
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,065
The fact that someone has prevented this,

287
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:05,729
is that a person doesn't even have the least consideration for others.

288
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:08,957
Good. Admonish more strongly.

289
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,304
I...

290
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:15,006
would like to say to him, who disregarded the basic responsibilities of a public figure, or even an average citizen,

291
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,906
I want to call him this.

292
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:18,941
A criminal of the roadway.

293
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,400
That he was a speeding

294
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,647
murder weapon.

295
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:27,439
This morning, the announcer who harshly criticized the non-license driving of an idol group leader,

296
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:32,437
Kim Shin, was revealed to have been found driving without a license as well, creating shock in the public.

297
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,238
<i>I'm sorry for running away. I really don't have money right now but I will pay you back. I'm really sorry.</i>

298
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,702
I still have to turn myself in.

299
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,727
This is so dirty that I really...

What's this?

306
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:03,363
Pretending to stop me from turning myself in,

307
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:07,658
but actually waiting for a similar incident to appear on the news to ruin me-

00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,435
<br>

312
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,651
Who are you?

313
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,047
I wanted to monitor (observe) your class.

314
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,219
All these people here have paid to hear this lecture, how can I let you just monitor (observe)?

315
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,217
Ah, I...

316
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:48,917
Because I'm your fan. The Burning Friday, The Family is Going, I've seen them all.

317
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:52,177
Can't I do it just this time?

318
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,357
Will you be okay with that?

319
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,083
Yes.

320
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,431
Thank you!

321
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:00,970
Thank you.

322
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:02,754
Then, again.

323
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:06,738
<br>

324
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,691
<br>

325
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:13,249
<br>

326
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:14,667
Hello?

327
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,975
Are you by chance, Na Mi Rae?

328
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:21,388
Yes, with a white foreign car with long hair, dressed like a broadcast writer.

329
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,150
You drive a truck?

330
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,152
I understand.

331
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,233
Hello? Are you Na Mi Rae?

332
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:37,505
I rewrote the closing that you spoke about. If you could look at it one time...

333
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:38,855
You're a man?

334
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,084
But your name is...

335
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:42,923
I understand.

336
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:49,261
Kim Announcer, I need to search for a preview intern, too... I'm really busy right now!

337
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,801
Hello? Are you Na Mi Rae?

338
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:53,746
Yes, that's right.

339
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:58,843
<i>Do you drive a white foreign car and have curly hair tied back and study broadcast writing?</i>

340
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,903
Who are you?

341
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey, 'Hit-and-run.'

342
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,206
Its 40,000,000 won.

343
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,368
I'm also busy so I'll just read it right now.

344
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,008
A bit later.

345
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:26,594
The best way to face an enemy is to place him/her next to you and observe that person.

346
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:28,506
Hey-!

347
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:29,980
Wha- What?

348
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,708
Observe. If that person becomes my side, everything will get better.

349
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,711
Good. Very good.

350
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:43,576
Okay? Cool.

351
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,419
This is too much.

352
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,158
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:51,910
I tried to study by myself,

354
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,092
Maybe it's because I'm stupid but it wouldn't register in my brain!

355
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:58,352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:02,463
Ah seriously, I have to change my number or something...

357
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,529
<i>This is my third time sending you a text,</i>

358
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,585
<i>you want to be a broadcasting writer right?</i>

359
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:11,042
<i>I'll let you do it, so come to the <br>YBS lobby right now and call me.</i>

360
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:27,049
Ahjussi do you go to YBS?

361
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,450
Yes I do. <br>He said yes... what do I do?

362
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:34,611
Are you getting on or not?

363
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,918
Should I go or not?

364
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:39,017
It seems like a trap right?

365
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,228
I really want to become a writer

366
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,824
<br>

367
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:47,311
Seriously...

368
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,897
Oh-

369
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:51,155
<br>

370
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:54,988
<br>

371
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:59,929
<br>

372
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,958
<br>

373
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:05,850
<br>

374
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,754
<br>

375
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,305
Wait a minute, Miss Bo Ra is coming through!

376
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,657
Bo Ra is coming through!

377
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,231
Move aside.

378
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,349
Don't stand in Bo Ra's way. Move!

379
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:23,519
Please move. Move!

380
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,011
Don't take photos, she has too much makeup on.

381
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:28,229
Hey!

382
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:37,395
Darlings, do I have to <i>really be irritated</i> for you to come to your senses?

383
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:38,754
<br>

384
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:41,061
Carefully, carefully. . .

385
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:44,337
<br>

386
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,357
Miss Mi Rae,

387
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,905
Hello.

388
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:53,076
Sorry, I can't really say that to you.

389
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:03,207
17,000 won, I'll definitely pay the rest.

390
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,268
Every month 30,000 won. . . <br> Never mind that.

391
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:06,973
Give me your resume.

392
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:07,523
Why?

393
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:09,167
You read the text and came here.

394
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,104
I told you I'll let you work here.

395
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:12,690
But why me?

396
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,608
Because you ran away.

397
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:17,989
How can somebody who wants to be in broadcasting have that kind of attitude?

398
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,238
So I told you to come so I can teach you myself.

399
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:23,826
Show you that this is real broadcasting.

400
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,252
Then am I the morning show team?

401
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:29,163
Of course. I'm the MC.

402
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,380
And if you

403
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,235
tell other people that you're a <br>part time worker at the broadcast station,

404
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,178
I'll go crazy.

405
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:40,067
Oh no but...

406
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,593
<i>Think about it quietly.</i>

407
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:47,047
<i>What you really want to be and what you're good at.</i>

408
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:51,773
I'll do it.

409
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,507
Please use me.

410
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:03,757
Your resume is so simple,

411
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:05,718
very chic.

412
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:06,838
Right?

413
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,701
Your major is... regional emotion? This kind of major exists?

414
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:13,490
It's like analyzing the emotions of different regions.

415
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,723
YBS is a nationwide broadcast right?

416
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,240
I know the different analysis for each region so I'm perfect for this job!

417
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,214
And on top of that -

418
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:20,693
Enough,

419
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,410
just promise me this.

420
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,560
In one year, you give me the opportunity to turn myself in for unlicensed driving.

421
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:33,457
Oh... so simply speaking, don't go report it you before then?

422
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,480
I'm not that interested in other people's lives.

423
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,817
I'm busy eating and living.

424
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:41,938
Okay then.

425
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,592
You know how to do the preview right?

426
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:48,268
Yes, I heard about it from my bro-

427
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,164
No I don't know.

428
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:51,719
What's that? Is it hard?

429
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:54,160
As hard as region emotions?

430
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,180
You basics...

431
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,486
I'll get them done!

432
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:03,549
If preview is the broadcasts basics I'll learn it.

433
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,712
I won't do just what you tell me to do.<br> I'll find things on my own.

434
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,391
If you tell me to do ten things, I'll do twenty.

435
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:13,174
If you tell me to dig 10m, I'll dig 100m, 1000m further and think about it.

436
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:17,303
Because the real basics is that.

437
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,086
Experience.

438
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:35,498
She's just your type and she knows the basics.

439
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:48,730
So, you don't know how to do the preview?

440
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,286
If you teach me I'll try my best.

441
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:54,744
Over here everyone tries their best, <br>the problem is doing well.

442
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,529
Do you go out with Kim Shin?

443
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,492
No.

444
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,900
That's not it. . .

445
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,256
This is the preview USB.

446
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:12,644
You can sit here and do it or put in in a laptop and

447
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:15,250
do it somewhere else.

448
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,991
But what is the preview?

449
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,416
The PD records on the tape.

450
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,164
Yeah,

451
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:26,275
then someone has to edit it.

452
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:26,763
Yeah,

453
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:30,212
But since they just do film anything<br> you don't know where is what.

454
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:32,342
Na Mi Rae, you're supposed to organize it.

455
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:34,533
To make it so we know what is where.

456
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,258
Yes.

457
00:27:35,258 --> 00:27:38,201
It's urgent, so please hurry.

458
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,552
Yes.

459
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:41,386
Ah wait!

460
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:44,287
Where is the bathroom for the Morning Team?

461
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,475
Over there.

462
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,161
There?

463
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,368
<br>

464
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:53,935
Na Mi Rae,

465
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:54,983
Yes?

466
00:27:54,983 --> 00:28:00,564
I'm not giving you work because I like you.

467
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,885
Your daughter's age is 32 and<br> her older brother is a broadcasting PD.

468
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,910
Your daughter's current job is... Unemployed.

469
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,480
But before that, she worked at Hong Electronics.

470
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,063
But if we sign the contract. . .

471
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,796
We'll see from Section D.

472
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:22,345
Start from A.

473
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,197
A is a special section,

474
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,541
Let's first see it.

475
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:38,274
Then, just check what level she is.

476
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:40,094
If she's professional enough,

477
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:44,867
Look, look.

478
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:50,233
She did drugs.

479
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,929
He gambled,

480
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,692
He was captured because of abusing his wife,

481
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,579
This is just a jail list.

482
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,732
Give me B.

483
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:05,281
B is doctors, lawyers and people like them.

484
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,378
Oh then I don't even need to see it.

485
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,355
Then, should I show you D?

486
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:14,845
Give me E.

487
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,872
Their levels are very low.

488
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:20,058
Their families aren't so well, or their jobs aren't good.

489
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:22,606
Give it to me.

490
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,638
You must not know well because you're from long ago,

491
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,167
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

492
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,248
All the people I'm looking for are in here.

493
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:35,576
Here, here, this person.

494
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:39,126
This person is a very famous photographer.

495
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:43,558
Oh my, and this guy is a movie director.

496
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:46,500
He went all the way to Hollywood.

497
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,561
Oh my.

498
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:51,654
He was in this generation.

499
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,958
Please give me a copy of this list,

500
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:01,304
and please let me meet them.

501
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:04,114
Also, within these people,

502
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:09,147
anyone who's involved in broadcasting, take them out.

503
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:11,655

505

<i>Announcer Kim Shin</i>

506
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:05,916
<i>Should I tell you honestly why you<br> can't be the main anchor, Mr. Kim Shin?</i>

507
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:08,885
<i>It's because you're old.</i>

508
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,768
<i>What people want nowadays is not news.</i>

509
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:15,606
The News, everywhere you look it's the news and what do they know.

510
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:20,378
<i>But still, the reason why people <br>still watch the news is the anchor.</i>

511
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,575
<i>Anchor's visual, voice, style!</i>

512
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:27,359
<i>Are my visuals, style, and voice, that bad?</i>

513
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,500
<i>Of course, you're great.</i>

514
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:35,070
<i>But a better guy came in so what can I do? <br>You should step down.</i>

515
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,795
<i>In what way is he better than me?</i>

516
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,236
His pronunciation is not good, he can't make the vital points, has repeated mistakes...

517
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,930
<i>He's young.</i>

518
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,914
How very youthful he is makes you want to watch.

519
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:46,969
<i>Even though he makes mistakes, since he's young, he's cute.</i>

520
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:50,303
Because of his pronunciation do you not know that more people are watching our news?

521
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:53,517
<i>This time, we ranked number 1.<br>-News is</i>

522
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:57,467
Journalism isn't something like that.

523
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:07,038
That is exactly the problem in our broadcasting systems these days! Enlightened sex!

524
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,839
<i>That's why abroad, older anchors are more...</i>

525
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:20,468
<i>Of course, there are older anchors<br> but there are also girls who do it wearing bikinis.</i>

526
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:24,541
<i>The President of YBS is me.</i>

527
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,636
So prove to me Kim Shin's ability.

528
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:31,853
<i>If you get at least a 15% rating on your morning show then</i>

529
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:37,308
<i>I will make you the main anchor<br> for the 5 o'clock, no, the 9 o'clock news.</i>

530
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:45,980
Oh, are you here to visit Miss Seo Yoo Kyeong?

531
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,649
Here everyday, you're so devoted.

532
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,446
While you're doing this, might there suddenly be a report about the two of you getting married?

533
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,473
Ah, no.

534
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,530
Since I hit her with my car, at least while she's in the hospital I have to take responsibility.

535
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,231
But what should I do? <br>Miss Seo Yoo Kyeong went for a check up.

536
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,111
Sunbae!

537
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:17,485
<i> YBS, Editing Desk.</i>

538
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,678
Others,

539
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:22,701
many are gathered.

540
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,885
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

541
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:32,635
7 people ran out,

542
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:40,756
Aigoo, why does this keep steaming up?

543
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:57,829
What should I call...

544
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,335
Ah, I really don't know.

545
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,742
What should I say?<br><i>YBS Editing Room</i>

546
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,926
Without one word...

547
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:33,411
If you're always going to do this, we can't have it.

548
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:49,714
WHAT?!

549
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,855
I'm sorry!

550
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:06,535
Just a minute, just a minute.

551
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,011
Ah! Oh! Sorry!

552
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:14,148
Where do I go? I'm not here. Make it so I'm not here.

553
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:16,536
Who are you?

554
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:17,894
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:31,991
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,605
Who are you?

557
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:36,903
I'm sorry. Just this one time.

558
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:48,830
<br>

559
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,503
Oh, that...

560
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:56,297
A girl came in here right?

561
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:58,047
Who?

562
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:02,220
An idiot with round eyes and scattered hair.

563
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,083
Is she pretty?

564
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,890
If that's the case then introduce me to her.

565
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,555
I'm sure it was Na Mi Rae.

566
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:12,401
This is the last one though.

567
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:16,993
Just watch if she really came here, I'm going to wrap her stuff and throw her out,

568
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,459
and take her off our family registry.

569
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,776
Excuse me...

570
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,966
She sees me as water, that's what it is. Does she <br>think I'm a fool?

571
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,912
I thought I was going to die.

572
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:44,797
If I'm caught it's my death. I'm sorry.

573
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:47,301
Your name is Na Mi Rae?

574
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:49,080
Yes.

575
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:55,358
Oh! You're that man!

576
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:57,020
Do you remember me?

577
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,009
Yes!

578
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,125
Why does this keep steaming up?

579
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,479
The video of the grandfather.

580
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:07,950
You kept cleaning the lens.

581
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,437
Oh.

582
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,726
You're previewing it? I shot it.

583
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:15,479
Really? That's amazing!

584
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,328
Earlier I saw that and came.

585
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:23,019
As I looked at it, the same thing came out. <br>It was really amazing.

586
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:26,782
I am amazed too. I thought I'm not going to see you again.

587
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:29,348
But now I'm looking at you like this.

588
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,403
But why is the Team Leader like that?

589
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,538
Ah, that...

590
00:37:38,762 --> 00:38:02,240
<i>Na Mi Rae fighting!</i>

591
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:05,855
Even if that wench weren't here, just...

592
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,607
Let's give up. Just give up.

593
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:11,296
Instead of the quail it's a chicken.

594
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:19,921
Yes?

595
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,762
Ahjumma, do you know where Mi Rae is?

596
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:24,715
I'm not sure.

597
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,422
Office...<br>-I already know that she's at the office.

598
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,529
Could it be that she went to the broadcasting station?

599
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:33,105
Why?<br>-Just now

600
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,358
I saw someone who looked exactly like Mi Rae.

601
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,276
Looked the same?

602
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:38,723
So much that you'd recognize her at once?

603
00:38:38,723 --> 00:38:40,783
What is this?

604
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:42,964
Is she really working at the broadcast station?

605
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:49,002
No, she should be studying for the civil <br>servant exam, level 7.

606
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,639
What?

607
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:56,019
This time she's really made up her mind strongly so try believing in her.

608
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:59,721
There's no way she went to the broadcasting center so don't worry.

609
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,041
Yes.

610
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,338
This girl, really...

611
00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:08,491
Ah, does Team Leader really look down on his own sister?

612
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:12,261
Aiyoo, I took out my brother's car and completely <br>destroyed it.

613
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:14,809
That's a bit...

614
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,625
Anyway, if you go there you should be able to preview<br> it quietly.

615
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:20,739
I'm not sure. I just need to check if she's here or not.

616
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:23,784
I would just look at the visitors log...

617
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,576
No, no...

618
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:29,138
Hey! You!

619
00:39:29,306 --> 00:39:30,769
Ahjumma!

620
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,817
Why did you lie? The broadcasting station...

621
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:36,236
I told you especially that YBS wasn't ok.

622
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:37,707
Wait, wait a moment.

623
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:38,607
Who are you?

624
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:41,622
Me? I'm her mother.

625
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,856
Ah...

626
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:48,512
Do you know me?

627
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,343
Park Se Ju!

628
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:07,566
Ah, I...

629
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:10,326
When your parents went abroad,

630
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:12,460
I lived next door.

631
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:15,486
I lived in the house next door.

632
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:17,151
Ah...

633
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:20,129
Your baby face is still there exactly.

634
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:21,652
Then Korea,

635
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,661
you've completely come back in? Then now...

636
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:27,655
I'm a VJ on Kim Shin's Morning Show Team 3.

637
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:31,020
<i>I was a VJ for a while.</i>

638
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,092
<i>Since I had to takeover the Broadcast Station later, from the standpoint of learning from the ground up.</i>

639
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:38,430
<i>I did mislead some people.</i>

640
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,822
<i>He fooled me too. Completely.</i>

641
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,912
That person then...

642
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:51,941
Do you have someone you're dating?

643
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,766
No.

644
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:55,991
What are you doing?

645
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:59,284
Then someone you fell for at first sight?

646
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:03,658
You have one.

647
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:05,634
Is she pretty?

648
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:06,867
No. I'm serious.

649
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:10,141
Are you for sure? You're definitely not a reporter?

650
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:12,175
Please!

651
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,900
I'm sorry, I asked you so much for the first time.

652
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,092
Then you're with this person Morning team?

653
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,791
Yes. Why?

654
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,275
That's good.

655
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,008
Good?

656
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,567
Can I talk to Mi Rae for a bit?

657
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:35,791
Yes.

658
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,175
Yes.

659
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:42,992
Ahjumma, what have you been eating to be this strong?

660
00:41:42,992 --> 00:41:44,766
You, what's your relationship with him?

661
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:47,675
Relationship? What? I just met him today.

662
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:49,900
Ahjumma, I'm really sorry for deceiving you.

663
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,792
It's fine, you did good.<br> I mean you didn't do good on deceiving me.

664
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:58,450
But why doesn't he know Seo Yoo Kyung?

665
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,008
Is he lying?

666
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,867
The person he fell for at first sight,

667
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:08,009
And in Solo he's in the same team as you.

668
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,291
But the problem is that guy is in here too.

669
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,425
What are you doing?

670
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:15,959
I'm building your life for you!

671
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:19,000
It's also my life, but.

672
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,042
Okay,

673
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,483
Yeah, VJ.

674
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:32,958
No. He's not a VJ.

675
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,134
He's a conglomerate.

676
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:39,591
Soon here, no,

677
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:45,383
Why would such a person work here?

678
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:48,217
Ahjumma is he that person?

679
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,009
The person who's going to kill the person I love?

680
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,992
Listen carefully. He is

681
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,491
a person you need to marry.

682
00:42:59,491 --> 00:43:02,816
And the person you almost had an accident with,<br> you need to avoid.

683
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:08,425
But the problem is that person<br> is also in the Morning Show team.

684
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:11,792
That guy is in our team? Who is he?

685
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,775
Did I say Morning Show?

686
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:19,292
Since I'm old, all my words are being twisted.

687
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,591
Not Morning Show, , , morning drama.

688
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:27,091
So its not the writer, then oppa, , ,

689
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:28,616
You!

690
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:31,067
Lied and the broadcast. .

691
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:35,433
I told you to avoid YBS but what is this?

692
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,825
You, if you're going to be like this

693
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:40,800
I'm going to just leave.

694
00:43:42,963 --> 00:43:44,817
I'm not going to tell you and just leave.

695
00:43:44,817 --> 00:43:45,725
Is something going to happen to me?

696
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:48,402
If you want to know then do whatever I say.

697
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:51,042
For now you, whatever it takes

698
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,608
seduce Park Sae Joo.

699
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:54,558
Seduce?

700
00:43:57,275 --> 00:43:57,775
Yes.

701
00:43:57,775 --> 00:44:01,841
Right now and in the future it only happens in dramas.

702
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:04,148
All except one.

703
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:15,766
He said he fell at first sight in Jeju island,

704
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:18,217
but he said he's single right now.

705
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:24,167
It means that our future days is starting to change.

706
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:29,500
A chance has come to you.

707
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,833
Trust me.

708
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:36,401
Park Sae Joo,

709
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:41,009
is the last best Cinderella ticket.

710
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:43,475
We need to get it.

711
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:50,483
You have to seduce Park Se Joo, no matter what.

712
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:53,550
Go and seduce him. Quickly.

713
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,266
Quickly, quickly quickly.

714
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,042
I'm sorry honey.

715
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,000
But,

716
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:15,583
I don't think I can

717
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,925
live like that again.

718
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:51,659
Did your Mother leave well?

719
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:55,359
She's not my mother,

720
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,667
she's just a far relative.

721
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:03,033
This must be a music storage room. It's nice.

722
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:06,709
What if my brother finds me?

723
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,800
Team leader won't come all the way here.

724
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,375
We made it so that they can just download it in the office.

725
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,567
Also I saw the preview that you've done,

726
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,784
It's not called big screen, but a full shot.

727
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:23,992
Full shot.

728
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,509
And this is called the title shot.

729
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,845
This is so interesting.

730
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:41,467
I didn't know what to call it so I just wrote whatever,

731
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:45,075
The English in the broadcasting system <br>is simpler than I thought.

732
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:47,500
Actually the English isn't very important.

733
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,833
But, what's full shot 130 screen?

734
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,117
Have you counted them all?

735
00:46:54,117 --> 00:46:55,258
Yes.

736
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:57,942
Wow, that's a lot.

737
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:00,550
Then what about the highlight marks?

738
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,625
They seemed important, and the numbers

739
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,875
Why?

740
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:17,984
It seemed very hard,

741
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:20,816
I thought it would be better if we did it like this. . .

742
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:24,383
I'm so sorry! You've worked so hard and I

743
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:28,625
No, I like it.

744
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:31,208
It's fun.

745
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:35,575
You're right, the most important thing in broadcast is that.

746
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:40,617
Really? Thank God.

747
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:46,775
It was so cool seeing the things that weren't edited. I would imagine 'what would it be like if it were like this'

748
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:48,717
Have you thought of what music to play?

749
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:50,041
Yes.

750
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,283
This one.

751
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:55,050
Daebak. Really this?

752
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,626
By any chance, is it track #3?

753
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:01,342
Want to listen together?

754
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:02,916
Yes.

755
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:28,833
<i>Does that make sense? Although he's good looking. . .</i>

756
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,042
<i>But still, he seems like a good person.</i>

757
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,150
It's so good.

758
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,460
Writer Bae.

759
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,559
Nam Mi Rae isn't answering her phone? Why?

760
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:04,691
I thought it was weird because <br>an announcer recommended her.

761
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:13,008
Why did you change the third line of the ment?

762
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:14,692
Where?

763
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,450
That, it seemed hard in reality.

764
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,159
Why?

765
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:35,867
Why are you talking about that now?

766
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:37,341
Bye.

767
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:43,833
No wonder, she came so quietly with one text,

768
00:49:44,717 --> 00:49:46,875
Excuse me driver, turn the car to the broadcasting station.

769
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,275
Yes.

770
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:58,008
Have you found her?

771
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,083
No. I called her about 3,852 times

772
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,083
but still.

773
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:10,484
I'm Nam Mi Rae's mother,

774
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:13,191
but her cell phone isn't working

775
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,317
If you're nearby,

776
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,675
Can you tell her to come to the lobby?

777
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:23,902
I'm not sure,

778
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:27,583
I also can't find Nam Mi Rae whom you're looking for.

779
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,925
Nam Mi Rae? Who is it? Who's looking for Nam Mi Rae?

780
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:32,883
She's making a mess here and there.

781
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:35,588
She says she's her mother, but her words are weird.

782
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:40,917
Are they planning something?

783
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:43,683
Yes Mother?

784
00:50:43,683 --> 00:50:46,758
Hello? You're Nam Mi Rae's mother?

785
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:49,950
Yes. Who are you?

786
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,791
Where are you?

787
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:53,541
In the lobby. . .

788
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,000
I'll go down.

789
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,221
This way, please.

790
00:51:08,257 --> 00:51:11,545
You're the mother of Ms. Nam-Mi-Rae, aren't you.

791
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:29,223
Excuse me to say this at start, but I had issue with your daughter.

792
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:31,976
She just took off even without telling me way to contact her.

793
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,040
Few days ago, problem happened with her.

794
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,953
I was bit suspicious on her, but since she's younger than me,

795
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:42,400
Trying to help her, I introduced her on broadcasting job.

796
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:47,375
For her 1st day on new job, she should be very responsive on my call.

797
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,656
But, I can't even contact her.

798
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:51,117
This is rather serious issue.

799
00:51:51,117 --> 00:51:52,740
What issue?

800
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,906
Real issue is yourself.

801
00:51:56,906 --> 00:52:00,514
People may be fooled by your deception, they'll know soon.

802
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,933
How ignorant you are!

803
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,698
How egotistical you are!

804
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,816
Thinking of becoming 9:00 news anchorman, you're full of motivation, aren't you?

805
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:12,674
Well, not so fast. This may be your peak.

806
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:14,796
Anchorman? Don't be ridiculous.

807
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:18,975
Only way for you is going down the hill.

808
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:25,739
Is that what you've heard from your daughter?

809
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,578
It's conspiracy, isn't it.

810
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:33,422
So, when are you going to expose this?

811
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:35,777
Why did you kill her?

812
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:39,597
You want to say it's accident. But, it's not.

813
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,929
You did it on purpose. You're getting paid.

814
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,857
Although you're being paid, you just let it happen...

815
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:47,465
How can you just leave her dying like that?

816
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,562
Miss NamIlHay

817
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:51,770
Is that what she said?

818
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,773
She almost got run over by car to death?

819
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:57,346
You killed her.

820
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:02,196
Do we need to go to editing room to see that?

821
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:03,656
What if I see him on the way?

822
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:05,895
He may be in writers' meeting.

823
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:10,104
So, as we watch the ones we saw earlier ..

824
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:15,551
Writer Bae want to see me.

825
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:17,874
How come I have these many calls!

826
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:20,213
Maybe, they're complaining at you.

827
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:21,827
What do I do?

828
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:24,497
Let's hurry.

829
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:29,752
Hey, Writer Bae, I'm Shin. Sound the emergency alarm; have everyone find Ms. lNam Mi Rae, make it quick!

830
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:32,447
How did you know her, and seduced her?

831
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:36,964
Seducing her? It's all your plan anyway, isn't it?

832
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,592
You laid out all the plan, didn't you.

833
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:41,893
My assistant manager

834
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,887
You figured out in secret. Waited until I drive to work to collide on my car.

835
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:49,514
Pretending to moderate the accident; she's fantasizing whether to sue or blackmail me

836
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:53,579
Did she really hit your car?

837
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,367
Why are you doing this?

838
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,622
Mother and daughter is very close relationship, ma'am.

839
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,882
It was another car accident?

840
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:04,706
She's enjoying it? She's real sickening.

841
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:05,965
I think same way you do.

842
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:10,894
I'll accuse her of threatening. Why don't you continue your dubious acting all the way to courtroom?

843
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:12,580
If you want to accuse of threatening, you accuse me for that.

844
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,582
Don't ever get near her, and don't mess her around!

845
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:19,275
Don't worry. She'll be kicked out instantly for you.

846
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,655
My preview was not the cause of problem, was it?

847
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:36,368
Maybe tape messed up, or machine broke down or something.

848
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:40,229
Perhaps. <br>What should I do.

849
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:50,136
Hey, What the hell you've been doing?

850
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:51,855
Oppa, I'm very sorry on that one.

851
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,855
And, I have small part-time job

852
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:56,630
Oppa?

853
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:59,717
Are you brother and sister? Didn't I tell you if you mess up, I'll kick you out.

854
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:00,897
You did, you did.

855
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,019
Sir, she's doing good job on preview.

856
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,068
You shut up, and go to editing room. <br>You come out.

857
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:07,210
Come out!

858
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,778
You got caught today.

859
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,374
Come over here!

860
00:55:12,374 --> 00:55:14,993
You're hurting me.

861
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:20,049
It hurts.

862
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,080
Aren't you going to confess?

863
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,539
How did you get into this company?

864
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:33,095
I got into here using front gate.

865
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,534
What happened?<br>Kim AnNa is showing up.

866
00:55:35,534 --> 00:55:37,681
Kim...?

867
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:39,684
How did you know that guy, Kim Shin?

868
00:55:39,729 --> 00:55:42,559
I just came to know him.

869
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,869
That's enough.

870
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,027
Are you dating him?

871
00:55:46,062 --> 00:55:49,499
Thou ought to stop saying that non-sense.

872
00:55:49,499 --> 00:55:52,399
You're the oldest daughter of your family, aren't you.

873
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,566
Pack your stuff in here. We'll talk in your home

874
00:55:54,566 --> 00:55:57,371
After she finishes her preview, sir.

875
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:01,035
Preview writing is good. She seems to have skill.

876
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:03,825
If you going to push her out, you need to bring someone for previewing.

877
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:05,924
Hey, writer Bae. She's my sister.

878
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:09,243
Because of work here, I couldn't even attend my son's anniversary party.

879
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:11,466
You may think same way I do.

880
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:15,672
For us, work comes 1st before family stuff, right?

881
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,330
You said preview didn't even have good terminology.

882
00:56:17,344 --> 00:56:20,334
Terms you can learn in 1 day isn't important.

883
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:24,293
Integrity is 1st for us, isn't it?

884
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:25,556
You showed hard work on preview, ma'am.

885
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:26,675
Thanks.

886
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,975
Team leader,

887
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:32,007
I'm in hurry, sir.

888
00:56:32,007 --> 00:56:34,501
Ok for now.

889
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:38,036
However, if your work is done here,

890
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:42,324
Why don't you leave home, please.

891
00:56:42,324 --> 00:56:44,313
Such a hard ass!

892
00:56:44,346 --> 00:56:49,044
You must be depending on him.

893
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,104
Hey, why you're not calling her instantly?

894
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:01,515
She'll be here soon.

895
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,596
She's with team leader.

896
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:05,256
That's why you need to call her now.

897
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:08,978
She's scammer.<br>That's your idea, sir.

898
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:12,406
For me, she's one of my team member.

899
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:16,007
It's correct that she need to see team leader 1st.

900
00:57:16,007 --> 00:57:18,258
What?

901
00:57:18,258 --> 00:57:22,418
Not even appears to be correct to see him 1st?

902
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:28,762
It appears to be correct as you said.

903
00:57:28,762 --> 00:57:31,239
What do you think you are?

904
00:57:31,274 --> 00:57:35,778
You're just 28 years old, and just new assistant manager.

905
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:39,652
You're lecturing what's correct to department manager?

906
00:57:39,652 --> 00:57:42,219
Now, you're even trying to take me over?

907
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:45,681
You think you're chairman here?

908
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:48,154
Are you a relative of Miranda?

909
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:51,174
Are you a spy?

910
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:57,225
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know.

911
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,286
You like vanilla drinks, don't you?

912
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:03,307
I'll buy it for you.

913
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:15,570
Thanks so much.

914
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:21,034
Only up to your preview, ma'am.

915
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:26,042
I know you work hard for this.

916
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:30,891
Hiding that team leader is your brother, and Kim AnNa issue. I don't like it.

917
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:34,794
That's not what I was trying to hide.<br>Most of all, you're...

918
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:36,885
You're 32 years old.

919
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:38,515
You're too old.

920
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,769
I'm main writer; I'm 30 years old.

921
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:44,530
Pushing new writer into hard working environment, I don't like to do.

922
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:46,321
You can push me hard, too.

923
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:49,354
I may be just old, but...<br>I feel uncomfortable.

924
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:53,506
Why don't you quit.

925
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:09,452
This time, you leave home, please.

926
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:13,345
Why don't you quit, now.

927
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:26,800
Still, I received some recognition on broadcasting.

928
00:59:26,822 --> 00:59:29,694
Is this the only broadcasting station?

929
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,573
Well, I tried to avoid YBS station anyway.

930
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:38,028
I can work some other stations. Let's go.

931
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:50,356
Sorry for being late.

932
00:59:52,894 --> 00:59:54,939
Are you awakened now?

933
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:59,031
Should I use ice cold water instead?

934
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:06,588
So, how far advanced in your plan?

935
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:09,937
You may have told this to team leader I dislike, already.

936
01:00:09,996 --> 01:00:12,580
What do you want, money?

937
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,802
Or official writer status?

938
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:20,070
I'm going to expose all your plan.

939
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,690
It includes your threatening accusation.

940
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,476
I like to know something.

941
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:33,569
Did you have traffic accident on night before Aug 15th?

942
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:35,702
How did you know this?

943
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:42,088
It happened on slow lane of on-ramp to bridge.

944
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:44,500
You're the one, jack ass.

945
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,263
You said that I'm going to kill the person I have loved.

946
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:50,977
You think it would be better for you to kill me?

947
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,978
What I love most in this world is myself.

948
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:55,793
Well... you see.

949
01:00:55,827 --> 01:01:00,386
I'll no longer pretend to be okay or happy.

950
01:01:00,398 --> 01:01:03,189
Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.

951
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:08,888
I'll get what I want, no matter what it takes to get it.

952
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:11,509
But, then you're killing me?

953
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:14,824
I barely manage to recover a little, then you're killing me again?

954
01:01:14,882 --> 01:01:15,936
Stop your bloody non-sense.

955
01:01:15,971 --> 01:01:18,447
I'll survive no matter what.

956
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:22,146
My own brother who's looking down on me, and my friends

957
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:27,568
I'll show to everyone I can be successful, you damn bastards.

958
01:01:54,026 --> 01:01:58,457
Miss, did you see Mr. Kim?

959
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,167
Are you okay?

960
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:07,355
