Blood pressure: 120 over 70.

3
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:01,661
Normal.

4
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,421
All right, open wide.

5
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:13,381
Looks fine. Healthy as a horse.

6
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,822
Just one more thing, Luther.

7
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:20,701
You got to whiz in the cup, Frank.

8
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,701
Then we're done.

9
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,216
Medical exam completed

10
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,301
Fuck them!

11
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,341
We going to argue
the merits of journalism?

12
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,581
You trying to tell me
that's journalism?

13
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,541
Look, Michelle...

14
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:51,861
...it's been a long weekend.

15
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,021
Everybody's shooting one another
and I've got to write about it.

16
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:58,300
I'm serious.
I'm tired of the crap, you know?

17
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:02,301
I should get my Ph. D. Then I could
write about stuff that matters.

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Michelle you're 23 years old.
You don't know anything that matters.

19
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,621
Well, fuck you too, Ev!

20
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:11,221
All right, here's a shoulder.

21
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:14,501
- What did they do to you?
- Not "they. " He.

22
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:15,781
- Alan.
- Alan?

23
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,380
Yeah. He killed my sidebar
on the Frank Beechum murder.

24
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,221
 If you asked me the whole case
stinks anyway, but that's not the point.

25
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,740
- I read that sidebar.
- It was good. Admit it.

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,581
It's the best thing
I've written in months.

27
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:29,861
That was the one where you say
that the media...

28
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:33,981
...glorified Beechum's victim in order
to mask our patriarchal culture...

29
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,540
...which created the violence
that destroyed her. Exactly!

30
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,461
Yeah. You're right.
He should have never killed that.

31
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,661
- You Fucking-Right!
- I would've tortured it.

32
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,020
Well, I might have enjoyed that.

33
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,060
I think you would've enjoyed
every second of that.

34
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,420
Another round?

35
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,581
Another margarita for the lady,
and I'll have my usual.

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,540
Not your "usual" usual?

37
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:05,140
No, my new usual.

38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,940
Virgin Mary.Yeah

39
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,500
And heavy on the...

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,900
...virgin?

41
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Alright. Tell me something.

42
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,860
If you're such hot shit, why are you
stuck here in Bumfuck, California?

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,580
Looking for love.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,780
Well you've come to
all the wrong places.

45
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,820
Not from where I sit.

46
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,380
It's not good. Not smart.

47
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,700
- What's smart got to do with anything?
- I can't do this.

48
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,180
I got to go.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,060
I got to go.
You're married and you're...

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,019
I can't do this.

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,060
I got to go.

52
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,700
Next time?

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,420
Yeah, next time.

54
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:50,898
Frank!

55
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,539
We're out!

56
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,458
Just hold on. I can't hear you.

57
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,259
Morning, Frank.

58
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,139
Can I get you anything?

59
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:21,816
<i> 6:21 prisoner awakes </i>
Some breakfast?

60
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,578
Well, if I can get, like...

61
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,378
...a roll and some coffee.

62
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:34,178
I'll get that right away.

63
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,738
You're not wearing
your protective glasses.

64
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,427
- You heard about it?
- Yeah

65
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:52,818
What a tragedy.

66
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,818
The fucking Raiders that's a tragedy.
Was she drunk?

67
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,236
I don't know.
It was at Dead Man's Curve.

68
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,347
They ought do something
about that place

69
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,945
Did we had to cover for her?
Did she have anything big on?

70
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,136
She had the interview
with Frank Beechum...

71
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,586
...at San Quentin, then she's going
to witness the execution tonight.

72
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,058
Christ!

73
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:04,618
It's a little worse then Michelle, Alan.

74
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,738
You think so, Bob?

75
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,898
If the warden will okay
a replacement for the interview...

76
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,898
but I thought I'll take Harvey out
of that meeting.

77
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:13,778
- Put Everett on it.
- Steve has the day off.

78
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,128
Not anymore he doesn’t.

79
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,658
He can do the interview and
witness the execution.

80
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,498
And what's-his-name, the warden
down there at San Quentin...

81
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:24,018
Plunkitt, Steve can dealt with
him before I can get him in.

82
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:28,788
You think Everett's
an asshole don't you?

83
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,138
I don't think he's an asshole

84
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,658
You're wrong. He is an asshole.
Trust me, I know him.

85
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:36,978
But a lot of people who are good
at their jobs are assholes Bob

86
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,178
Look, I know that, Alan, all right?
It's not about that.

87
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,034
Everything with Everett is a
big investigative witch-hunt,

88
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:44,737
you know like that
Mike Vargas piece.

89
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:45,898
He's not a drunk then. He isn't now

90
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:49,338
Two months ago he's a drunk,
now he's Mother Teresa.

91
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:52,458
The point is this is not a Steve
Everett slash-and-burn job. Okay?

92
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,258
This is a sidebar.
It's an issue piece.

93
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,857
"An issue piece. "
Well, dog my cats!

94
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:01,138
It's a capital punishment, Alan.

95
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:04,938
We are putting a man to death tonight.
We are killing a human being.

96
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,458
Stop the presses!

97
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,857
By the way,
that Amy what's-her-name...

98
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,978
you know...the pregnant broad
that Frankie shot in the throat...

99
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:15,057
...was she a human being?
Is that part of the issue?

100
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,458
Yeah, that is part of the issue.

101
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,017
Bob Let me tell you something...
Pumpkin?

102
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,506
- No
- Okay

103
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:24,872
Issues are shit we make up to give
yourself an excuse to run good stories.

104
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:25,866
Okay?

105
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:30,537
"Judge Grabs Female Attorney's Tits. "
Hey that The sex discrimination "issue. "

106
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,819
"Nine-year-old blows
his Brother With an Uzi. "

107
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,737
The child violence "issue. "

108
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:37,858
People want to read
about sex organs and blood.

109
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:39,218
You know what?

110
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:43,977
We make up issues so they don't have
to feel too nasty about it. Got it?

111
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,618
So I might as well call Steve Everett,
because that's his attitude exactly.

112
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:49,857
A little sarcasm?
How long you been here? Three months?

113
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,497
I've been worked with Steve Everett
for three and a half years.

114
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,897
And let me tell you something, Bob.

115
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:58,217
The guy is good, he's as good as anybody
I've ever worked with.

116
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,727
You know why he was
run out of New York?

117
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:00,337
You know the story?

118
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:01,617
I heard a couple of things.

119
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:05,137
He busted the mayor. Bob
The mayor of fucking New York City!

120
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,537
Everett found a secret memo
on a contract bribe...

121
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,296
...between His Honor and an ex-borough
president and he ran with it in his column.

122
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,337
- So?
- So..

123
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:15,737
The paper try to killed it because
the owner was in bed with the mayor.

124
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:17,239
What did Everett do, Bob? huh?

125
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,417
Well he didn't whine...

126
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:21,296
...and he didn't back down.

127
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,617
He just fucking walked.

128
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,977
- That's Steve Everett.
- Okay

129
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:27,697
- Okay? Alright? Good?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,183
How're you going with the
quitting smoking, good?

131
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:29,497
Going great.

132
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,417
Hey listen when you send the flowers
to the, you know...the dead girl

133
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,234
- Michelle?
- Michelle's family

134
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,401
...can you include my name?
Thanks, I appreciate it.

135
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:37,857
Yeah

136
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,285
- See you.
- Alright.

137
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:39,777
- Okay?
- Yeah

138
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:44,856
The mayor of New York City, Bob.

139
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,297
The mayor, you gullible asshole.

140
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,336
Yeah, I could have stayed
in New York forever.

141
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:53,617
They were about to put me
in charge of an investigative team.

142
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,136
That would have put me
on the Pulitzer track.

143
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,057
I really liked it there.
Broadway shows, downtown jazz clubs...

144
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:04,977
...dinners at Elaine's,
veal chops up the old wazoo.

145
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,537
Not veal chops like that, though.

146
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,136
Jaws!

147
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,696
Now you have to kiss it
and make it better.

148
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,657
So you were the king of New York.

149
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,056
Why are you hacking out metro stories
at the Oakland Tribune?

150
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,577
Well, that's a long story.

151
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:28,216
I got caught in the supply room
with a very young lady.

152
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:31,096
Turned out to be the owner's daughter.

153
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,376
How the hell was I supposed to know
she was underage?

154
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,617
She looked 18 to me.

155
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:39,416
Anyway, I got blackballed
all over town.

156
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,377
You bad man!
What did your wife say?

157
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,536
We'd just had the kid,
so she took it kind of hard.

158
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,176
But you know Alan offered us
this gig out here.

159
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:53,936
Another town, another change.

160
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,616
Bad man!

161
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,896
First the owner's daughter,
now the editor's wife.

162
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:03,816
Do I detect a little...

163
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,496
...hostility towards authority figures?

164
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,776
Only ones I work for.

165
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,215
Is that what you'll say
in the next town with someone else?

166
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:16,637
"I got caught with the editor's wife.
You know how that is?. "

167
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,616
I get caught
with the editor's wife...

168
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,416
...not too many more towns
that'll have me.

169
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,016
So playtime's over?

170
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:28,736
You've got to go to work.
I've got to get home...

171
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:31,536
...see if the wife and kid
still recognize me.

172
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,656
You won't tell me how awful
we're being, are you?

173
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,816
Bob, he's a decent sort.

174
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,775
Good newspaperman, solid editor.

175
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,336
So this all just stinks...

176
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,375
...right?

177
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,136
What we're doing?

178
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,655
Patricia...

179
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:54,016
...you and I are just two people
swimming through the passions of life.

180
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:55,845
You know what I mean?

181
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,935
Look, it's all right.

182
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:01,256
It's not like I love you or anything.

183
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,215
That's good.

184
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,976
Because I don't love you too.

185
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,468
Hello?

186
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,336
All right.

187
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,575
Yes, all right.

188
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,855
You are going to believe this.

189
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,135
What?

190
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,536
That was Bob.

191
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:38,375
What'd he want?

192
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,895
He was looking for you.

193
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:43,735
Who told him?

194
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,709
How in the hell should I know?

195
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:55,695
Morning, Frank.

196
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,254
Mr. Plunkitt.

197
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,495
Anything I can get for you?

198
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:08,255
Anything you need?

199
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:13,695
No, not anything I can think of.

200
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:20,535
There's some matters
I gotta discuss with you.

201
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,655
Figured we'd do it first,
get it out of the way.

202
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:29,134
Your dinner tonight,
for one thing...

203
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,895
...can be pretty much
anything you want.

204
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,495
You go ahead and tell Reedy here
when you decide.

205
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,574
Now, about your personal
effects and belonging...

206
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,295
My wife will take them.

207
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:42,974
And your remains?

208
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,215
That go for your remains too?

209
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,135
If she can't afford the funeral...

210
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,054
Our church raised some money.
It's all right.

211
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:56,374
So your wife will be claiming
your remains?

212
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,255
Yes, sir, that's right.

213
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:08,415
I want to give you some idea
of what's going to happen tonight.

214
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:11,734
We'll have to ask your visitors
to leave at 7 p. m.

215
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:15,655
You'll be given your dinner
and a fresh set of clothes.

216
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:19,894
We'll come for you about a half-hour
before the procedure.

217
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:22,454
You'll be taken
into the procedure room.

218
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,814
They'll hook an EKG up to you
and the intravenous lines.

219
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:29,654
But nothing's going to happen
early or anything.

220
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,414
Right up until 12:01,
we'll be monitoring the phones.

221
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,614
We got lines to the attorney
general and the governor.

222
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:41,494
And those we check to make sure
they're in working order.

223
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,014
You have any questions
about any of that, Frank?

224
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,174
No.

225
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:58,934
Just one more thing,
and then I'll leave you in peace.

226
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,974
- It's about the sedative.
- I don't want no sedative

227
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:06,694
Sedative's completely optional, Frank.

228
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,574
I just like to advice you again
it can make things a lot easier.

229
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:10,893
I don't want it.

230
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,174
I appreciate it, Mr. Plunkitt...

231
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:19,774
...but I want to be clear in my mind.

232
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,534
When I see my wife, I want to
be clear for that. Alright?

233
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,374
Fair enough.

234
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,133
You change your mind,
you let the duty officer know.

235
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,253
I just had to give you my
little sales talk that's all.

236
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:46,413
Badges will be at the gate.
Got the witness list.

237
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:47,694
What else?

238
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:51,534
Roadblocks are up.
Demonstrators are light so far.

239
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,813
- Visitors all squared away?
- Wife and kid.

240
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,413
Your girl from the Trib,
Michelle Ziegler, she'll be here at 4.

241
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,173
Mea culpa.

242
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:03,614
- She was pretty persuasive.
- Let her persuade me next time.

243
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,253
Arnie, what do you think of Beechum?

244
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:11,053
Well sometimes I think about the girl
he shot dead over $96.

245
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,653
Mostly I think about doing my job.

246
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,613
Warden! Sir!

247
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,133
I repent!

248
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,373
Jesus, Atkins!

249
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,413
Give me some of that pussy, baby.

250
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:53,373
Give me some pussy on toast!
I need some of that pussy on toast!

251
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,812
Go ahead, baby, shake that thing.

252
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,572
Excuse me.
Can I have some pussy on toast?

253
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,493
I just need some pussy on toast.
Give me some pussy on toast!

254
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,212
- Is that you, newspaperman?
- Back off.

255
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,293
You got money.
Give me some on toast.

256
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:11,612
Come on, I need it.

257
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,132
Promise me you will not
spend this on food.

258
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:16,493
Five dollars?

259
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,533
You can give me more than that.

260
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,612
Steve give me five, give me 10.
Come on, give me 20, Steve.

261
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,413
You can give me $100,
you got so much money!

262
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,532
You got money on toast, baby!
I know you do.

263
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,292
- Hey, sister!
- Get away from me.

264
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:32,732
- I know you got some sweet pussy!
- Get away from me.

265
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:37,453
You nasty motherfucker!
Shut your nasty ass up.

266
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:40,532
I want something on the toast.
Nothing wrong with that.

267
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,772
Put some on the toast for me.
I know she likes me.

268
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:47,092
I know I'm going to give her
my phone number.

269
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,493
Hello, everyone.

270
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,492
You got my message?

271
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,517
Yeah

272
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:07,292
Apparently, you and I
have a little problem.

273
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:08,932
Do we?

274
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:10,412
Yes, we do.

275
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,172
Look, Bob...

276
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,172
Michelle Ziegler was killed
in a car wreck last night.

277
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:18,212
What?

278
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:19,692
Michelle?

279
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,972
That couldn't be.
I was with her last night.

280
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,452
Oh, no!

281
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,852
She was only 23 or something.

282
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,131
Dead Man's Curve.

283
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:38,652
My God!

284
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,532
That poor kid!

285
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,491
Just out of school
and 23 or something.

286
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,452
I should have driven her home.

287
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,971
She had an interview set up
with Frank Beechum this afternoon.

288
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,012
The poor...

289
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,532
Beechum.

290
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,572
Yeah, I heard that they were going
to juice him today.

291
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,091
She said she had a seat
for the show.

292
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,887
Yeah. Four o'clock face to
face in the deathwatch cell.

293
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,252
Alan wants you to cover for her.

294
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,371
Beechum, Is he the one
who killed that pregnant girl?

295
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:14,692
College student, Amy Wilson.
Working the summer in Richmond.

296
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,731
Place called Pocum's Grocery.
Owed Beechum 96 bucks.

297
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:21,012
Repairs he did on her car
or something. Shot her dead.

298
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,706
Anything else I should know about him?

299
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:28,171
He's tough, black mechanic
at the Amoco station in Clayton.

300
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:31,132
But I'm warn you, do not pull
a Dick Tracy on this again.

301
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,207
I don't want a big
investigation piece.

302
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,132
You can depend on that.
Don't worry.

303
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:41,251
Says here, Beechum's
one of those born-agains.

304
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:44,572
Yeah, aren't they all on death row?

305
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,571
Biggest birthrate in the country.

306
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,252
Cynical.

307
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,692
He came from Michigan.
Broken home, alcoholic mother.

308
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:56,131
He's been in and out of jails,
violent assaults, drugs, more drugs.

309
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,052
He did two years for beating a cop
who tried to give him a ticket.

310
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,851
Sounds like a reasonable fella.

311
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:04,291
Then another three for breaking
into a store.

312
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,891
Then he got out of the slam,
met his wife. Nice girl, born-again.

313
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,701
Led him straight to Jesus.

314
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,931
They had a daughter,
bought a house in Richmond.

315
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,451
Yeah, now he's Mr. Nice Guy.

316
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,811
I guess not. Six years ago,
he walks into Pocum's...

317
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,651
...Amy Wilson's is working
on the register.

318
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,573
Yeah. Let me guess.

319
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,891
He asks Amy for his $96
and she says she doesn't have it.

320
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,651
And old Frankie, gets
his wicked temper up.

321
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,891
I don't suppose he's expressed
any heartfelt remorse?

322
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,531
Nope. Get this.

323
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:38,911
He still says that he just went
to the store for some A-1 Steak Sauce.

324
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,411
Steak sauce?

325
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:43,051
Wow, that's a nice touch.

326
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:45,931
Looks like Nussbaum had
two strong witnesses.

327
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:47,371
Black or white?

328
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,650
Let's see. Both white.

329
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,410
Looks like a woman in the
parking lot saw him running away...

330
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,251
...and this poor guy, an accountant...

331
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:56,802
...drive in the parking lot
because his car overheated

332
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:58,211
and he goes in the store
 to use the phone

333
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,403
and then there's Beechum standing
over the body with gun in hand,

334
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:01,068
blood all over him.

335
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,297
Okay. Okay. Don't over look it.

336
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,251
All I'm looking for here is the
human-interest angle. You know?

337
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,370
Final days, what it's like. Alright?

338
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,931
-Got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

339
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,885
Anything else you need from me, Bob?

340
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,210
Nope.

341
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,051
Good. Okey-dokey.

342
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,290
I'll get right on it.

343
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,970
Something else on your mind, Steve?

344
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,971
The witness...

345
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,971
...the one who found Beechum
with the body...

346
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,850
...he must have heard the shots.
Right?

347
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,879
- Shots.
- Yeah I mean

348
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,264
You know, he comes in...

349
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,050
...his car's overheated,
he's got the hood up.

350
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,051
Must be working on it.
While, there's a robbery going on.

351
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,300
He had to have heard shots.

352
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,770
So he heard the shots.

353
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,451
But this is a white
accountant in Richmond.

354
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,262
and you're telling me
he's going to walk

355
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,130
into a store when
he heard shots?

356
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,600
You know what Steve? I don't
know if he heard the shots or not

357
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,650
Maybe he did. I don't care.

358
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,172
What I'd like you to
do is please interview

359
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,210
Frank Beechum about
his feelings today.

360
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,185
and turn it into a
human-interest sidebar.

361
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,250
Think you can handle that?

362
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,850
Yeah, I'll get right on it.

363
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,370
No problem.

364
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,370
Bye-bye.

365
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,650
Fuck!

366
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:43,089
Close one!

367
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,021
I don't know what you did,
but he's on your case.

368
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,769
I'd we're about two seconds away
from a full Bob Findley explosion.

369
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:54,729
What are you, crazy?

370
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,130
You're lighting up after
Bob's "no smoking" speech?

371
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,249
I missed that.

372
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,449
Yeah. That was smart too.

373
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,450
Try to be a good boy, okay?

374
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:27,929
Beechum case.

375
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,689
Victim: Amy Wilson, married, 20
years old, shot in the chest...

376
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:36,677
...with a.38 as she stood behind
the counter at Pocum's Grocery in Richmond.

377
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:41,040
Six months pregnant at the time.
Both she and the baby died. Okay let see

378
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,089
Two witnesses.

379
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,729
If I'm right, First witness:
Nancy Larson, housewife...

380
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,649
...mother of three.
Drives car into the parking lot at Pocum's.

381
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,769
Larson couldn't see
whether he had a gun or not.

382
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:53,249
No weapon was found.

383
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,969
Later she picked Beechum out
of a police lineup...

384
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:58,649
...and it was the same lineup
where Beechum was picked out...

385
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,169
...by Dale Porterhouse, CPA.
He was in the neighbourhood

386
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,950
His car overheated, so he
drove into Pocum's to call AAA

387
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,489
Porterhouse call the cops  and picks
Beechum from the lineup that same day.

388
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,568
Records later show that Amy Wilson
owed Beechum $96...

389
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,208
...for working on her carburetor.

390
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:14,889
Note for future essay:

391
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,689
Why so few female car mechanics?

392
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,048
Want coffee, Ev?

393
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,129
It's back in fashion
as a late-morning pick-me-up.

394
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:36,127
I appreciate it. Thank you

395
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:37,169
Yeah. Make it a big one.

396
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,248
Women are allowed to
fetch coffee in the office now...

397
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:40,936
...because some improve
job opportunities

398
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,008
has given us a new confidence.

399
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:46,808
Brigett, don't you think being
the trends editor's getting to you?

400
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,648
I don't know. Was I an
insane person before?

401
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,449
You're a great person.

402
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,448
You take it black, right?

403
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,889
I do.

404
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:07,768
Oh Shit!

405
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:13,622
- Hello
- Hi

406
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,168
Steve, thank God. Where are you?

407
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:19,168
I'm at the paper. They roped me in.

408
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:20,616
Oh no did they call
you at the gym?

409
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,369
They tried here but I won't
tell them where you were.

410
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:25,448
I stopped by to pick something
up and they grabbed me.

411
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,449
Did you have a good workout?

412
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:29,489
Yeah, decent.

413
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,568
Good. Anyway, you really did promised
Kate you'd take her to the zoo.

414
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:35,968
The zoo!

415
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:39,768
God, I forgot!

416
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:42,488
Steve, she really is expecting you.

417
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:45,768
I'm sorry about that.
I really just forgot.

418
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:48,488
Look you worked all weekend.
She didn't see you at all.

419
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,128
You know how she loves her daddy.

420
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:53,328
Steve, I know it's work...

421
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:57,488
...but I feel it would be a bad idea
to let her down like this again.

422
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,968
Look Barbara, there's been an accident.

423
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,716
Remember Michelle Ziegler?
You met at the Christmas Party.

424
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:03,313
Yeah

425
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,768
She piled up her car
on Dead Man's Curve.

426
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:09,368
Oh my gosh that's terrible. There's
been so many accidents there.

427
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:11,716
They ought to do something about that place

428
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:12,761
What was that?

429
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:15,448
I said they ought do
something about that place.

430
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:18,288
- Is she hurt?
- "Not if I heard anything like that."

431
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:18,928
What?

432
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,047
Yeah, dead.

433
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:24,121
Oh that's awful.
Do they had you filling in for her?

434
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:28,847
They've got a ticket
for the execution tonight.

435
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:32,009
Steve don't tell me they couldn't
get someone else for this.

436
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,367
You were working all weekend.

437
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:34,487
Finally!

438
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,248
What? Where are you?

439
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:42,247
Barbara, look, I don't have
to be at San Quentin till 4.

440
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,280
Why don't I come by,
I pick up Katie,

441
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,571
I take her to the zoo and
bring her back at 3. How about that?

442
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:47,568
Coffee time!

443
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:50,437
What about her nap? She's suppose
to have her nap right after lunch.

444
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:51,688
- Her nap?
- Yes

445
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,288
Isn't today your day off?

446
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,727
You know how cranky she
get without her nap.

447
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,991
Well, I'll bring her
a double espresso.

448
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,487
Steven

449
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,047
- It's just a joke.
- and I'm busting a gut.

450
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:05,287
Alright, I'll be there in a
half-hour, 12:30 at the latest.

451
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,968
Why'd you go in there
on your day off?

452
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:11,447
Are you still trying to make up
for that Mike Vargas thing?

453
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:14,288
I'll be there at 12:30, all right?

454
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:21,847
More and more office workers insist on the
right not to breathe secondhand smoke.

455
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,807
And more and more scumbags don't care.

456
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,807
Well, Bridget,
you're an adorable person.

457
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,487
Sexual harassment.

458
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,848
What are the guidelines?

459
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,087
Who can say?

460
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,087
I hate my job, Ev.

461
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:41,567
But I love watching you do it.

462
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,847
Don't look now.

463
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:55,406
Gosh, Mr. Reporter, is that what
real newspapermen get to read?

464
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,647
Well, Dale Porterhouse:

465
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,007
"No, I couldn't have heard the shots.

466
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,598
Because all the windows
were rolled up and I had

467
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,767
the radio playing and
the air conditioner on.

468
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,367
That's probably why
the car overheated. "

469
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,367
Close quote.

470
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,647
That's another wild hunch
down the drain.

471
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:14,807
My condolences.

472
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:16,447
No great loss.

473
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:18,446
Look, anybody calls...

474
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:20,527
...I'm at the zoo.

475
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:22,006
Me too.

476
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:50,206
Good morning, Frank.

477
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,647
I thought maybe...

478
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,527
...if there's anything
I can do for you...

479
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:01,007
Is there anything you'd like
to talk to me about...

480
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:03,806
...I want you to know I'm here,
I'm available.

481
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,801
I understand you're
a Bible reading man

482
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:12,927
That's right, isn't it, Frank?

483
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,006
But, you know...

484
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,566
Frank,...just reading the Bible
isn't enough, isn't it?

485
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:22,927
No.

486
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,726
Man can't go to his Maker with
the sins of his soul unrepented of.

487
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:31,606
With the hurt he's caused
folks just, you know...

488
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,606
...unrepented of.

489
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,766
A lot of folks would feel
better to hear...

490
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,926
...you were remorseful
for the pain you caused them.

491
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:47,561
You could do a lot of good
with those words Frank.

492
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:55,685
I don't have anything to tell you.

493
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,710
Frank..

494
00:29:58,526 --> 00:29:59,566
Reverend Shillerman...

495
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,965
...I want you to leave.
I have my own pastor coming later.

496
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:10,383
Well son

497
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,525
Son, I don't need to tell you...

498
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,512
That there's will come a time,
and I'm afraid that time is not far off

499
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:19,805
Reedy!

500
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,446
...when you'll wish you'd made
a different decision.

501
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:23,886
But it will be too late.

502
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,081
Reedy!

503
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:29,231
What can I get you, Frank?

504
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,285
I want you to get this damn
fool out of my face!

505
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:32,845
He call himself a man of God.

506
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:34,246
Reverend Shillerman!

507
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,045
Reverend Shit-For-Brains.

508
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,246
Now, Frank...

509
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:45,332
...I myself wouldn't want to
be strapped to that table tonight...

510
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:47,765
...with the wrongs
I've committed unrepented of.

511
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,125
Because when they stick that
needle in your arm...

512
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,244
Jesus Reverend. Come on

513
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:52,646
...feel your blood run to ice!

514
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:54,242
Reverend, that's enough!
Reverend. Come on

515
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,365
Get him out of here!

516
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:58,365
I feel sorry for you, Frank.

517
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:00,565
I feel sorry too. Believe me.

518
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:02,805
I mean it.
We don't want no trouble.

519
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:05,405
All right.
I just felt it's my job.

520
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:07,245
It might be upsetting...

521
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:15,605
Everyone wants in on the
action, right, Frank?

522
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:22,626
Frank?

523
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:44,164
Well twelve hours from now,
convicted killer Frank Beechum...

524
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,924
...will be executed
by lethal injection.

525
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,925
Beechum was convicted six years ago...

526
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,405
...of the brutal
slaying of 20-year-old

527
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,605
coed Amy Wilson and
her unborn child...

528
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,245
...at Pocum's Grocery in the
Richmond section of the county.

529
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,565
Wilson, who was married
with six months pregnant...

530
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:02,205
...was working
when Beechum shot her...

531
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:06,045
...during an argument over $96
she owed him and was unable to pay.

532
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:09,765
Now the weather:

533
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,980
Morning low clouds with
some afternoon clearing.

534
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,357
Mostly cloudy tonight

535
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,845
Help you?

536
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,604
Yeah, I'm a reporter
from the Oakland Tribune.

537
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,124
Isn't this where
Amy Wilson was killed?

538
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,804
It sure is.

539
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:57,804
She was right behind
this same counter.

540
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,725
Almost six years ago exactly.

541
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,124
Mr. Pocum says...

542
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:04,004
...the needle's too good for him.

543
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,684
For Beechum.

544
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,524
They ought to bring back the chair.
That's what I say.

545
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:11,244
Really let him have
a jolt of something.

546
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:12,604
What's back there?

547
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:14,124
Bathroom.

548
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:15,684
Mr. Pocum was always nice...

549
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:18,964
...about letting folks come in
and do their business.

550
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:22,097
Well I'll come back
some other time maybe

551
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:24,404
and maybe do some really
serious shopping.

552
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:26,844
Am I going to be in the newspaper?

553
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,124
Was there something here before?

554
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:31,524
Yes sir, that's where
the potato chips used to be.

555
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:34,124
But Mr. Pocum moved
the rack over here...

556
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,164
...so it'd be what you call...

557
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:39,084
...an impulse kind of purchase.

558
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,443
This in that story you're writing?

559
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:44,524
That's a good point.

560
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:47,844
No. I'm writing a human-interest sidebar.
Do you know what that is?

561
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:49,604
No, I don't think I do.

562
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,764
I don't think I do either.

563
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:11,364
Sorry, I got hung up.

564
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:13,444
Daddy!

565
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:15,195
Aren't we going
to the zoo today?

566
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:15,563
Yeah

567
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:19,523
Well, what's holding us up?
Don't you want to get dressed?

568
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:23,203
- Come on. Let's change your clothes.
- What animal do you want to see?

569
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:25,764
Daddy, I want to go see
the hippopotamus.

570
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,803
Come on, let's change your pants.

571
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,443
I tell you,
looking into those eyes...

572
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,043
...I don't think...

573
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:42,483
It was like looking into the eyes
of a goat. Something like that.

574
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,003
They were that cold.

575
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,883
I can't honestly say that
I've ever wished anyone dead.

576
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:53,003
But I think I'll feel a lot safer
when Frank Beechum's gone.

577
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:57,643
That's Dale Porterhouse, an accountant
with the firm of Stokes and Whitney.

578
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,321
Mr. Porterhouse was the
state's key witness

579
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:02,283
in the Wilson case
six years ago...

580
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:06,083
...a case that will finally culminate
at one minute past midnight...

581
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:10,243
...with the execution by lethal
injection of Frank Beechum.

582
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,163
Information. What city, please?

583
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,112
For Oakland please, for
a Stokes and Whitney.

584
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,563
It's an accounting firm.

585
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,563
The number you requested is...

586
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,643
Come on, let's go. Daddy's here.

587
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:22,043
Steve, what is it?

588
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:24,243
Just a hunch I've got.
Bear with me.

589
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:26,883
Tonight, finally, is the execution.

590
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:30,882
It's been a long six years. Do you
feel justice is finally being done?

591
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,123
Hi. Is Dale Porterhouse there, please?

592
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:36,443
- Mr. Porterhouse is at lunch.
- Get off the phone, Daddy.

593
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,642
Right now!

594
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:45,122
This is Steve Everett. I'm a reporter
with the Oakland Tribune.

595
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:48,243
Could you have him call me?
It's about the Beechum case.

596
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:51,562
Nothing will end that rage
except the death of the monster...

597
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:54,563
...who killed my daughter
and my unborn grandchild.

598
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:56,402
I'll give you my beeper number.

599
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,722
You're not taking that beeper!

600
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:02,203
Just a second, it's just a hunch.
No big deal.

601
00:36:03,723 --> 00:36:05,402
Yeah, it's 5-5-5...

602
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:07,283
...1-4-3-9.

603
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:09,282
- I'll make sure he gets it.
- Thanks.

604
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:12,643
Okay, sweetheart, what do you think?

605
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,904
Are you ready for the big hippo?

606
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:16,731
Come on

607
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:18,882
You want to go in the den with Dad?

608
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,442
I'll show you something
Dad's got to take with him.

609
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:25,882
Not the beeper.
Right? Not the beeper.

610
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:29,602
Let's pick up my beeper.
This goes "beep, beep, beep. "

611
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,602
Yeah, it goes "beep, beep, beep. "

612
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:37,882
Come on, get your jacket on.

613
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:42,002
And now we're just hours away
from the actual time of execution.

614
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:44,682
Daddy, I want to go see
the hippopotamus.

615
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:47,443
After a break,
we'll be talking to someone...

616
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,442
...who thinks capital punishment
is never the solution.

617
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:52,402
I love you!

618
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:55,602
Bye, Katie!

619
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:58,682
Have a good time! I love you.

620
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,682
I love you too, Mama.

621
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,482
Wait!

622
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:05,562
You forgot the car seat!

623
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:08,242
Mother, I'm too big for a car seat.

624
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:10,201
We'll put her in back.
How about that?

625
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,722
Put her in the back seat.
Seat belt!

626
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,481
Daddy

627
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,882
Don't forget the seat belt!

628
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,561
The seat belt, Steven!

629
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:23,322
It's fine. It's fine.

630
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:25,401
I should've never stopped
by that grocery store.

631
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:27,721
Oh, God!

632
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,164
Beep, beep beep

633
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:37,402
Hi. Dale Porterhouse, please. This is
Steve Everett the Oakland Tribune.

634
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:41,441
Be with you
in just a second, darling.

635
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:44,441
This is Dale Porterhouse.
What can I do for you?

636
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:48,561
I'll be ready in a second, darling.
We'll go in a second.

637
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,642
Mr. Porterhouse, this is Steve Everett
of the Oakland Tribune.

638
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:55,082
I'm covering the Beechum
execution tonight.

639
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,921
I thought you were one of
the chief witnesses in that.

640
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:03,984
Just a second. Just a second,
sweetheart. Okay?

641
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:06,976
I was wondering if I could
have 10 minutes with you.

642
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,001
It'll be 10 minutes tops

643
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,761
I'd be glad to.
I can't talk right now.

644
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,401
I could meet you later though.

645
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,442
Yeah, where?

646
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,889
How about we meet down stairs at
a restaurant call Bread Company.

647
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,641
You know it?

648
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,681
Yeah, I know it exactly.

649
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,201
- On Ninth Street, isn't it?
- Yeah

650
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:24,866
How about I meet you
there in a half-hour?

651
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,041
Okay. Half-hour it'll be.

652
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,481
Thanks. Bye.

653
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:29,921
Okay, baby.

654
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,761
Come here. Come on.

655
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:35,081
But I'm too big to sit in a stroller!

656
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:38,921
That's nonsense. We're going
to play this game called Speed Zoo.

657
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:40,841
Speed Zoo?

658
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,121
Monkeys!

659
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,721
- Giraffes!
- We go fast.

660
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,841
Birdies!

661
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:00,281
Speed Zoo!

662
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:02,921
Camel lips!

663
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,121
We go fast.

664
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:10,961
We go fast!

665
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,201
Where's the hippopotamus?

666
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,601
Elephants! Look at the elephants.

667
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,881
Where's the hippopotamus?

668
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:20,521
Speed Zoo!

669
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:23,080
I want to see the hippopotamus!

670
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:24,761
We go fast.

671
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,681
I want a hippopotamus!

672
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,601
I'm sorry. I wouldn't have
this happen for the world.

673
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,601
I want my mommy!

674
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,600
I know, sweetie.

675
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,881
Daddy's sorry.

676
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,601
Oh, my God! What happened to you?

677
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:59,680
She's a real trooper,
I've got to tell you.

678
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,953
What the hell's the matter with you?

679
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,639
How you holding up?

680
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,440
Like I said, there's always a chance.

681
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
But with all the feeling
about the girl and all...

682
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,599
You know how the governor's
tough on crime.

683
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,599
So Mr. Berris says that maybe...

684
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:21,400
...if you just tell him
about how remorseful you feel...

685
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,160
You know what I'm saying?

686
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,119
- I didn't do it.
- I understand.

687
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:29,959
I'm just telling you that's what
we're facing here, all right?

688
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,680
I can't say I'm sorry
for what I never did.

689
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,857
I'll call you as soon as
the appeal comes down. Alright?

690
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,040
Hi, Daddy.

691
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,880
I brought you a picture,
but it's not finish...

692
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,119
...so I have to finish it, okay?

693
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,879
Hold on a second sweet heart.
They're going to let me in.

694
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,359
Don't be sad now.
We're not going to be afraid. Huh?

695
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:59,679
Give Daddy a big hug, please?

696
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:06,760
Come on, don't be sad. Don't be afraid.
We're not gonna be afraid.

697
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm gonna finish my picture now,
Daddy, okay?

698
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:14,719
You do Daddy a favor, okay?
Now, walk over here with me, okay?

699
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,599
I want you to sit right here while
I have a little talk with Mommy, okay?

700
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,159
Give me a kiss.

701
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,199
Come on.

702
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,479
Come on, now.

703
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,799
You know I'm just going home
to dreamland, that's all.

704
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:48,039
Look. It's green pastures, Daddy. See?

705
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,239
Here's the blue sky.
I made it at the motel.

706
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,261
Gonna be holding two places
at the table for us. Okay?

707
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,359
We're not gonna cry.

708
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:01,199
I'm sorry. Okay.

709
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,661
We know I'm going to a better
place beyond this place, right?

710
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:08,099
Okay

711
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,878
The thing I worry about most
in all this...

712
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:19,039
No, she loves you.

713
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:21,399
She loves you.

714
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,118
I don't want her
to ever think her daddy did...

715
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,038
She won't think that.

716
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,398
She knows you.

717
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:32,759
I can't find green, Mama.
Do you have it?

718
00:43:34,758 --> 00:43:37,878
All the crayons are
in the box, honey.

719
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:40,118
Well, I can't find it.

720
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:44,238
Don't you ever let her think it.

721
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,479
You do that for me, okay?

722
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,038
I swear.

723
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:49,838
It's lost.

724
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:51,878
I can't find it anywhere.

725
00:43:52,438 --> 00:43:54,798
Can you use another color, honey?

726
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:57,318
I have to have green.

727
00:43:57,598 --> 00:43:59,678
It's green pastures!

728
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,319
Just look for it baby.
It's got to be in here somewhere.

729
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,877
I'm sure daddy won't mind
if you use another color dear.

730
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,478
Okay, baby.

731
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:11,918
Calm down.

732
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:14,038
Calm down, honey.

733
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:17,158
Mrs. Beechum?

734
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:21,238
What parking area did you use?

735
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,078
Yeah, just a moment.

736
00:44:43,477 --> 00:44:45,078
It's your lawyer again.

737
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,917
- Frank?
- Yeah

738
00:44:58,157 --> 00:44:59,237
We lost it.

739
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:01,278
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:05,653
Mr. Berris will be at the governor's
desk this late afternoon.

741
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:06,237
Alright?

742
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:11,037
We got to be honest
about what's going on.

743
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:14,911
- You know what I'm saying?
- Okay

744
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:19,517
I'm really sorry, Frank.

745
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:23,460
We tried, but you know,
it just didn't work.

746
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:24,166
Okay

747
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:27,946
I don't know what else to say.
I'm so sorry.

748
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:28,753
Okay

749
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:30,357
God bless you, Frank.

750
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:40,158
- So is there anything?
- No, nothing yet.

751
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,517
You know how these legal things are.
They probably take forever.

752
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:50,677
Control, we've located the material.

753
00:45:54,997 --> 00:45:56,237
Copy that.

754
00:45:57,637 --> 00:45:58,398
Good news.

755
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:02,157
They found the crayon.
It'll be here momentarily.

756
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:06,477
You hear that, sweetie?

757
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:10,117
Now you can show Daddy
some real pastures.

758
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:15,037
- Green pastures.
- That's right. Baby's green pastures.

759
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:16,477
Come here.

760
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:22,637
Your green is coming.

761
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:24,717
Told you they would find it.

762
00:46:31,677 --> 00:46:34,917
I believe there's such a thing
in this world as good citizenship.

763
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:39,077
A man sees an injustice, let alone
a cold-blooded murder, I believe he has...

764
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:42,237
Let me get this straight.
You didn't really see the murder.

765
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:45,077
Of course not.
I never said I did.

766
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:46,557
Well, what did you see?

767
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,477
Mr. Everett, I've been
through this so many times.

768
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:51,331
I can't tell you how many...

769
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:53,636
I have trouble getting
it into my head.

770
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,116
It's simple.

771
00:46:55,517 --> 00:46:57,876
I went into Pocum's to use the phone.

772
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,037
My car had overheated.

773
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,181
As soon as the door
slammed behind me,

774
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:04,237
Beechum jumped up from
behind the counter.

775
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:06,727
They was covered with blood
and he had a gun in his hand.

776
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:09,396
I guess it was the point when
he was bending over Amy...

777
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:12,796
...I mean, Mrs. Wilson,
stealing her ring and her necklace.

778
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:16,516
He got one good look at me, and
then he ran out the service entrance.

779
00:47:16,796 --> 00:47:21,156
My concern is for the girl,
so I immediately dial 911.

780
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:24,117
I figured...

781
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:26,916
...why should I run after a killer
who's got a gun in his hand...

782
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:29,156
...when I can let
the police do their job?

783
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:30,732
And they sure did it, didn't they?

784
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:32,637
Yeah, they sure did.

785
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:35,517
Like I said, we live in a country
where there's a rule of law.

786
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:38,876
I mean, an ordinary citizen
who does...

787
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,996
Aren't you going to take notes
or something or use a tape recorder?

788
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,956
Usually when I'm talking
to a reporters...

789
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,036
...they want to keep a record
of what I've been saying.

790
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:49,624
I've got a photographic memory.

791
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,091
What?

792
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:51,636
Is that some kind of joke?

793
00:47:54,116 --> 00:47:56,036
No, I have a notebook right here.

794
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:59,196
Just having an off day.
You'll have to excuse me.

795
00:48:02,036 --> 00:48:02,836
Slow day.

796
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:04,676
Yeah, well...

797
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:09,756
- My point simply was this: A man...
- Mr. Porterhouse...

798
00:48:10,076 --> 00:48:11,876
...let me cut to the chase.

799
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:15,556
Are you absolutely sure
about your testimony?

800
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:18,396
Absolutely. Why wouldn't I be?

801
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:22,276
You saw Frank Beechum's face
and the gun?

802
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:27,595
If I had doubts about my testimony
Mr Everett, I would've told the police.

803
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:32,196
That must have been scary, having him
point that gun right at you.

804
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,036
No. Thank God, no.
It wasn't like that.

805
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:36,476
Was it above his head?

806
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:40,676
No, he had the gun down
by his side in a very normal way.

807
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:44,796
How could you have seen
over the potato chips?

808
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:46,276
What?

809
00:48:49,395 --> 00:48:50,956
What potato chips?

810
00:48:51,236 --> 00:48:53,075
I had a perfectly clear view.

811
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:57,195
Look, right here. Here's where
you come in the main entrance.

812
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:01,035
You look across and see Beechum
going out the service entrance.

813
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:05,356
Right here in the center
is a rack of potato chips.

814
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:08,636
I don't know how
you could have seen a gun there...

815
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:11,075
...unless he was waving it
over his head or something.

816
00:49:12,395 --> 00:49:14,549
Why would I say I saw a gun
if I didn't see a gun?

817
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:15,835
I don't know.

818
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:17,915
Maybe you like telling the story...

819
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:21,956
or...telling the police or reporters
something they didn't already have.

820
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:24,541
Maybe you like telling the
girls around the office

821
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,275
around the coffee
machine, stuff like that

822
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,875
This is absolutely absurd.

823
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:35,715
You actually think that
I would jeopardize a man's life...

824
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:38,755
...in order to impress the girls
around my office?

825
00:49:39,395 --> 00:49:42,035
I don't know, Mr. Porterhouse.
We only just met.

826
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:46,035
That's right, Mr. Everett.
We only just met.

827
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:50,035
But I did some checking on you
before I returned your call.

828
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:52,398
You're the guy who led
that crusade to get the

829
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:54,035
rapist released last
year, aren't you?

830
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:57,555
That lying what's-his-name?

831
00:49:58,515 --> 00:50:01,355
You wouldn't be referring
to the Mike Vargas case, would you?

832
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:05,075
Had all your facts straight
on that one too, didn't you?

833
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:09,555
Then they threatened him with
the DNA test. The guy confesses.

834
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:14,034
I'm surprised
they didn't fire you on the spot.

835
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,195
So am I.

836
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:21,515
Look, I'm sorry.

837
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:23,395
I just thought...

838
00:50:25,035 --> 00:50:26,715
I don't know what I thought.

839
00:50:29,187 --> 00:50:29,725
Hello...

840
00:50:30,555 --> 00:50:32,394
Can I tell you about our
specials today?

841
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:42,514
All right, lunch is here
and the drinks are cold.

842
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:43,955
Who gets the roast beef?

843
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:45,954
Over here, Zach.

844
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:47,074
Here you go.

845
00:50:47,835 --> 00:50:51,594
Seems like there's more fat
and less meat every time I get this here.

846
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:55,314
Ain't that the way you order it?
Hold the meat, leave the fat?

847
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,635
Hey Arnold's all right.
The more of him, the better.

848
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:04,914
Okay, what do you say we do some
work while we feed our faces?

849
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:07,354
You all know that at 1800 hours...

850
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:10,474
...the whole staff meets here
for a final briefing.

851
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,053
Excuse me, Warden.

852
00:51:13,054 --> 00:51:13,726
Right

853
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:18,940
Reverend Shillerman here will hold a
prayer meeting at the end of the briefing.

854
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:24,914
Which is optional for anyone
who wants to stay.

855
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:30,834
Also be advised...

856
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:34,234
...there's a change
in the 1600 interview thing.

857
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,154
The girl had some kind of accident.

858
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:41,914
They've replaced her with
a guy name Everett.

859
00:51:43,194 --> 00:51:44,194
Damn!

860
00:51:44,714 --> 00:51:48,114
Now I realize his butt ain't quite
up to the standard of Michelle's...

861
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,433
...but that's who's coming anyway.

862
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:57,634
Everyone clear on that?

863
00:52:29,874 --> 00:52:31,234
Well, speak of the devil!

864
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,353
Alan here tells me I'm
paying you too much.

865
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:37,274
You can rest assured I'm frittering
it away on women and booze.

866
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:41,493
You're a real dyed-in-the-wool
son of a bitch Everett.

867
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:43,154
Anybody ever tell you that?

868
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,153
Just close friends and family.

869
00:52:46,314 --> 00:52:49,393
- I'll come back later.
- No, I was just leaving.

870
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:52,793
Still sober as a judge, right?

871
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:56,673
Well I guess you haven't been partying with
the Alameda County judges lately.

872
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,073
Yeah, sober as an ex-drunk, sir.

873
00:53:01,153 --> 00:53:02,497
Good to see you, Steve.

874
00:53:03,576 --> 00:53:03,911
Alan

875
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,553
Stop fucking Bob's wife.
He doesn't like it.

876
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,593
What'd he do, put it in
the company newspaper?

877
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,866
Listen, if he comes to
me and wants your ass,

878
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:16,128
I going to have to give it to him.

879
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,433
and then you'll just be a hole
with no ass around it.

880
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:22,113
You know what, Ev? You're a fucking
womanizer, that's what.

881
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:24,233
You been fuck up your whole career,
you fucking up your marriage.

882
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:26,389
and If you can't keep your
prick in your pants,

883
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,913
then I can't god
damn protect you!

884
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,073
How was she?

885
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:32,753
None of your damn business.
Not bad.

886
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:35,793
Lucky bastard! I always liked her.
I respected her.

887
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:37,435
Hey did I ever tell you
about that assistant

888
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:38,433
D. A. I was banging in New York?

889
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:41,632
No, and if you start telling me now, I
gonna come across that desk and rip

890
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:43,033
your throat out
with my bare hands.

891
00:53:43,313 --> 00:53:45,553
I'll save it for another day.
Edifying story though.

892
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,313
- Look I've got this problem.
- The nickel finally drops!

893
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,592
You do have a problem.

894
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:52,610
Didn't I tell you that
Bob has been gunning

895
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:53,993
for you since the
day he got here.

896
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:56,713
In his quiet, earnest, reasonable way.

897
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:58,593
He's probably glad
you banging his wife.

898
00:53:58,594 --> 00:54:00,433
Now he has an ethical
mandate to annihilate you.

899
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:03,340
That's great, I live to make
him happy but that's not the problem.

900
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,573
You should've fuck my wife.
I'd just punch you out!

901
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:06,185
I did fuck your wife.

902
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:07,753
Lucky bastard. How was she, good?

903
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:09,993
A real wildcat but
that's not the problem.

904
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:11,593
What's your problem, huh? Tell Papa.

905
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,913
You can come to Papa, you soulless
sack of shit. Come on. What is it?

906
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:16,872
It's a..

907
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:17,713
Frank Beechum.

908
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:21,953
I think he may be innocent.

909
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:28,952
After the briefing, Arnold going
to be checking the phones in the chamber...

910
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,993
...make sure the whole
telephone lines are working.

911
00:54:31,273 --> 00:54:33,392
Don't want the governor
to get a busy signal.

912
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:36,875
Don't worry. I got call waiting
for him on that line.

913
00:54:37,113 --> 00:54:38,073
Christ, Atkins!

914
00:54:38,353 --> 00:54:40,953
Reuben, make sure the clocks
are synchronized.

915
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,433
And the one in the press room too.

916
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:45,353
You've got the strap-down team.

917
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:47,872
I myself had
a personal heart-to-heart...

918
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:50,792
...with the prisoner myself
this morning.

919
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:54,273
And going by my experience with the men,
he won't be any trouble.

920
00:54:54,553 --> 00:54:55,793
In my opinion.

921
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:09,152
All right.

922
00:55:10,512 --> 00:55:12,392
What have you got on Beechum?

923
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:18,114
Oh Ev

924
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:20,139
- Ev
- Alan. Yes

925
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:20,831
No

926
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:22,752
- Look, listen to me...
- I don't have to listen to you!

927
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:24,912
I'm looking at you. I'm looking and...

928
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:28,752
...I can see a reporter who's
about to tell me he has a hunch!

929
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:30,512
I've been checking some things.

930
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,872
You know my opinion
of reporters who have hunches?

931
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:36,478
I interviewed this witness who said
he saw a gun. I don't think he saw a gun

932
00:55:36,672 --> 00:55:39,112
I can't fart loud enough
to express my opinion!

933
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:41,257
Even Michelle thought
the whole thing stunk.

934
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:42,387
She thought there
were discrepancies.

935
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:42,832
Discrepancies?

936
00:55:43,152 --> 00:55:46,552
After a police investigation,
a trial, what? Six years of appeals?

937
00:55:46,832 --> 00:55:51,032
and you found discrepancies? How long
did it take you, what? Half an hour?

938
00:55:51,312 --> 00:55:52,505
You know the court system goes.

939
00:55:52,712 --> 00:55:55,992
His first attorney was probably
some 12-year-old legal-aid guy.

940
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:58,029
He couldn't object
enough for the appalet

941
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,911
court to even make an
intelligent decision.

942
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:01,991
- If they could make one.
- Ev, Come on.

943
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:03,392
I got your appeal.

944
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:05,671
Come on, they're going
to kill the guy tonight.

945
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:11,871
All right.
Man, I must be on acid!

946
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:16,312
So you're trying to tell me that you want
to turn a routine execution piece...

947
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:18,671
...into some fight-for-justice
story...and what?

948
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:21,272
...that would give me an excuse
to stand up for you...

949
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:24,832
...when Bob asks me to transfer
you to the toilet. Is that it, huh?

950
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,992
Alan, I need this.

951
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:31,021
You not going to get your 
wife and kid back. You know that

952
00:56:31,022 --> 00:56:32,192
No, she gonna find out.

953
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,152
I'll fix that.

954
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,047
I can't tell you
what will happen

955
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:37,231
if this turn into another
Mike Vargas piece. Okay?

956
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:40,202
So you come up with something, fine.
I'll run it.

957
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:41,871
But man it had better be good.

958
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:43,500
The Mike Vargas thing,
I was drinking.

959
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,127
You lose your nose
when you're drinking.

960
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:45,871
My nose is back.

961
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:48,792
Well, we'll both find out, won't we?

962
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:51,471
Just one thing.

963
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:53,377
If I do come up with something,

964
00:56:53,378 --> 00:56:55,671
we can't wait till
tomorrow to run the story

965
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:58,570
Oh my god! I know what
you're thinking. You know,

966
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:01,351
It's like dogs that hear a hyphen
sound that humans can't hear.

967
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:05,431
I can actually hear your little brain
ticking away. I really can.

968
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:07,932
and let me just remind you
if you go to Lowenstein

969
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:09,471
thinking he'll call
the governor...

970
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:10,538
The governor will listen to Lowerstein.

971
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:12,161
It better be awfully
fucking good.

972
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,154
Or he not only won't
call the governor...

973
00:57:14,671 --> 00:57:17,431
...he'll eat your heart and throw
carcass you to the dogs.

974
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:21,675
You won't have to bone his wife, pal.
He'll fire you for free. Okay?

975
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:23,511
Thanks Alan.

976
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:27,711
Ev, you don't have to thank me.

977
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,746
Because honestly god,
I don't know whose ass

978
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,631
you're trying to save,
Beechum's or your own.

979
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:35,911
But if your nose for a story is gone,
my friend, you are gone too.

980
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:37,990
Because I not going
to run this paper...

981
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,031
...to salvage what's left
of your smarmy existence.

982
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:44,162
So look you stand there
and you look me in

983
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:46,271
the eye and you tell
me, man-to-man:

984
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:49,230
Was she pretty good?

985
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,511
- Seriously.
- Fuck you.

986
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:53,470
Lucky bastard!

987
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:55,511
Go get them, tiger.

988
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,351
I don't know what to say to you.

989
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,430
Been trying to thinking all
morning figure out

990
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:43,350
...what it was I wanted to say
to you, and I don't...

991
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,590
I'm sorry, Bob.

992
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,910
I really am sorry.

993
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,950
I don't think you are.

994
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,630
I don't think you're
capable of feeling sorry.

995
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,150
You're not capable of feeling
anything for other people.

996
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,550
Maybe you're right.

997
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,510
Maybe you're right, Bob.

998
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,670
How'd you find out?

999
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,230
She told me.

1000
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,790
She told you?

1001
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,459
She saved your cigarette
butts and put

1002
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,749
them in an ashtray by
the side of the bed.

1003
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:26,830
It's her way of letting me know.

1004
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:37,989
Well I guess that's all I was, a
way of getting your attention.

1005
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,470
If it helps any, I feel awful.

1006
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,510
It doesn't help.

1007
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,909
That is so beautiful, sweetheart.

1008
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,190
I'll keep it with me always.
I promise you.

1009
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:17,189
Can we come back tomorrow?

1010
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,030
Can we stay at the motel again?

1011
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,109
Tomorrow.

1012
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:24,134
Well..

1013
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,069
Tomorrow you and Mama get to go home.

1014
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,949
I don't want to go home.
I want to stay with you.

1015
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,189
Come on, sweetie.

1016
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:44,429
You're a big girl now.

1017
01:00:45,029 --> 01:00:47,174
You know what's going
on here, don't you?

1018
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:48,884
Yes

1019
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:51,229
Now, you know, after today...

1020
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,469
...you won't see Daddy no more.

1021
01:00:58,109 --> 01:01:00,709
But I will be there in spirit.

1022
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,429
I promise.

1023
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:06,709
You can talk to me
whenever you want, all right?

1024
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:10,869
You remember when we talked
about little baby Jesus?

1025
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:12,949
Remember that?

1026
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:17,028
Well, I will be up there with Him.
And I will be watching you.

1027
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:21,949
And I'll wait for you.

1028
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:27,349
And if you want to talk to me anytime,
I will be there...

1029
01:01:27,588 --> 01:01:28,948
...listening.

1030
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:41,148
I'll miss you so bad, honey.

1031
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:45,789
I wrote you a letter.

1032
01:01:49,388 --> 01:01:51,069
And your mama will have it...

1033
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:54,229
...when you need it later on, okay?

1034
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:01,548
You go on now.

1035
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:04,669
Gail, you want to take these, honey?

1036
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,628
Take these, okay?

1037
01:02:07,028 --> 01:02:08,948
Come on. It's time.

1038
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:11,789
I love you.

1039
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:17,068
I'll always love you, Gail.
Okay?

1040
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,029
Why can't you just come home?

1041
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:25,188
Why can't you just kill
all these people and come home?

1042
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,908
Don't say that, Gail. Please!
Don't ever say that, okay?

1043
01:02:30,228 --> 01:02:31,468
Don't ever say that. Okay?

1044
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,828
I love you, baby!

1045
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:36,948
I'll always love you.

1046
01:02:37,548 --> 01:02:39,428
Goodbye, Daddy!

1047
01:02:42,668 --> 01:02:44,668
Goodbye!

1048
01:02:49,748 --> 01:02:51,268
Oh, God!

1049
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:53,908
It's too much.

1050
01:02:54,148 --> 01:02:56,388
She loves you. I know, honey.

1051
01:03:32,028 --> 01:03:34,587
Remind me not to start
a life of crime.

1052
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:36,308
They lie, you know?

1053
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:38,588
- Who's that?
- Prisoners.

1054
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,227
That's what they do.

1055
01:03:40,948 --> 01:03:43,428
Every word they say is a lie.

1056
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:45,788
Well, everyone lies, pal.

1057
01:03:46,148 --> 01:03:48,188
I'm just here to write it down.

1058
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:52,427
You've got 15 minutes, Mr. Everett...

1059
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:54,627
...by order of Warden Plunkitt.
<i> Reporter arrives for an interview </i>

1060
01:03:55,908 --> 01:03:56,947
Keep to 15 minutes.

1061
01:04:01,307 --> 01:04:02,868
Mr. Everett, Frank Beechum.

1062
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:07,627
All right, have a seat.

1063
01:04:15,908 --> 01:04:17,187
I got them.

1064
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:20,467
So how's that girl?

1065
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:22,827
The other, Michelle?

1066
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:25,587
I heard she was in
some kind of accident?

1067
01:04:28,587 --> 01:04:30,547
Yeah, she was.

1068
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,667
She was in a car wreck.

1069
01:04:33,947 --> 01:04:35,267
She didn't make it.

1070
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:37,907
Oh, man.

1071
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:40,907
I'm sorry to hear that.

1072
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:44,987
Thanks.

1073
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:51,587
I guess you want to hear...

1074
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:54,467
...about how it feels to be in here.

1075
01:04:57,907 --> 01:04:59,987
Yeah, it's a human-interest piece.

1076
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:04,986
I feel isolated.

1077
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:07,827
I feel fear.

1078
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:10,627
Fear of pain.

1079
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:14,306
Fear of prison.

1080
01:05:15,507 --> 01:05:17,947
Fear of being separated
from my loved ones.

1081
01:05:19,906 --> 01:05:22,386
All those fears rolled up into one.

1082
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:28,187
Never having a chance to see
my daughter draw pictures like this.

1083
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,547
She says it's Green Pastures.

1084
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:46,187
I want to tell everyone that...

1085
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:49,226
...I believe in Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

1086
01:05:55,306 --> 01:05:58,387
I believe I'm going to a better place.

1087
01:06:00,547 --> 01:06:04,146
And there's a better place,
better justice there.

1088
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:06,786
I came into my faith...

1089
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,426
...late in life.

1090
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:13,346
Did a lot of bad things
when I was younger. You know?

1091
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:16,026
Anyway...

1092
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:20,066
...I believe the crookeds will
be made straight.

1093
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:23,386
That's what the Bible says.
I believe that.

1094
01:06:29,106 --> 01:06:31,026
So that's how I feel about it.

1095
01:06:34,386 --> 01:06:36,226
Is that all right, Mr. Everett?

1096
01:06:36,546 --> 01:06:37,826
You got nine more minutes.

1097
01:06:42,946 --> 01:06:45,226
I mean, is there any more
that you want?

1098
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,786
Mr. Beechum, you don't know me.

1099
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:54,066
I'm just a guy out there
with a screw loose.

1100
01:06:56,706 --> 01:06:59,586
Frankly, I don't give a rat's ass
about Jesus Christ...

1101
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:02,826
...and I don't care about
justice in this world or the next.

1102
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:05,786
I don't even care what's
right or wrong. Never have.

1103
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:07,946
But you know what this is?

1104
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:11,825
What is this, some kind of joke?

1105
01:07:12,066 --> 01:07:14,746
No, it's no joke.
That's my nose.

1106
01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:18,506
To tell you the pitiful truth,
that's all I have in life.

1107
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:21,786
When it tells me something stinks...

1108
01:07:22,026 --> 01:07:24,906
...I have faith in it,
like you have faith in Jesus.

1109
01:07:25,985 --> 01:07:30,026
When my nose is working well,
I know there's truth there somewhere.

1110
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,586
But if it isn't working...

1111
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:36,105
...you may as well drive me off
a cliff because I'm nothing.

1112
01:07:38,465 --> 01:07:39,306
Lately...

1113
01:07:39,866 --> 01:07:41,185
...I'm not 100% sure...

1114
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:43,986
...my nose has been working that great.

1115
01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:46,265
So I've got to ask you...

1116
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:48,666
...did you kill that woman or not?

1117
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:50,625
What?

1118
01:07:53,745 --> 01:07:57,146
What happened at that store that day
Amy Wilson was shot?

1119
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:04,505
I went into the store to buy
a bottle of A-1 Sauce.

1120
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:06,305
and you paid for it at the counter...

1121
01:08:06,585 --> 01:08:08,065
No, I never got it.

1122
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:11,825
I told everybody this.
Why are you asking me this?

1123
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:15,425
Tell it again. To me.

1124
01:08:20,545 --> 01:08:22,265
I went into the store...

1125
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:25,105
...to buy a bottle of A-1 Sauce.

1126
01:08:25,825 --> 01:08:26,936
I didn't know where it was.

1127
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:28,705
So I saw Amy standing
behind the counter.

1128
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:29,852
- Hey, Amy.
- Hi Frank

1129
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:31,345
Where you keep the steak sauce?

1130
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,705
It's in the back. See where the
ketchup and relish is?

1131
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:37,385
You know Frank I've been
meaning to talk to you.

1132
01:08:38,265 --> 01:08:39,745
I don't have it.

1133
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:43,265
I mean I could give you 30 now,
but I don't have it all.

1134
01:08:44,065 --> 01:08:45,785
When can you give me the whole 96?

1135
01:08:47,265 --> 01:08:49,145
When I get paid, July 15th.

1136
01:08:49,465 --> 01:08:51,704
You're not gonna always
do me like this, are you?

1137
01:08:51,985 --> 01:08:56,545
No, I swear. It's just, the end of
school year. We have extra expenses.

1138
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:00,305
All right, then.

1139
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,145
July 15th?

1140
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:03,985
July 15th.

1141
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:07,265
Mind if I use the bathroom?

1142
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,664
You know where it is, right?

1143
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:15,185
So you weren't mad about the money?

1144
01:09:16,425 --> 01:09:19,065
I just wanted her to know I didn't
do business that way.

1145
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:21,105
She was cool. I liked her.

1146
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,025
- Were you carrying a gun?
- No

1147
01:09:25,984 --> 01:09:26,985
So then what?

1148
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:33,985
I asked her, could I use her restroom.

1149
01:09:34,224 --> 01:09:37,825
I went in to use the restroom,
and the next thing I know...

1150
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:39,824
...there was a gunshot.

1151
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:41,945
That's all you got?

1152
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:44,864
It's the Fourth of July
and we're not that busy.

1153
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:46,664
- Give me the fucking chain!
- Not that!

1154
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,544
Give me the fucking chain!

1155
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:04,064
Oh, God. Amy!

1156
01:10:08,624 --> 01:10:09,784
Oh, Jesus!

1157
01:10:13,424 --> 01:10:14,464
Oh, God!

1158
01:10:16,944 --> 01:10:18,024
Sweet Jesus!

1159
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:22,224
Can you breathe, Amy?

1160
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:31,904
Somebody help us!

1161
01:10:44,489 --> 01:10:45,097
Hello

1162
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:47,463
Anybody here?

1163
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:12,464
Help!

1164
01:11:13,063 --> 01:11:15,504
- "Please, not that. "
- That's what I heard.

1165
01:11:15,784 --> 01:11:17,104
Why'd you run?

1166
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:21,104
It was stupid. But I've been running
from something most of my life.

1167
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:24,384
There I was, covered in blood
next to a dead girl right next to me...

1168
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:27,824
...a white man staring at me
like I was... I just panicked.

1169
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:29,744
- Who shot her, Frank?
- I don't know.

1170
01:11:30,544 --> 01:11:32,184
Did Porterhouse..did he see a gun?

1171
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:34,343
- You got five minutes.
- I told you there wasn't no gun!

1172
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,743
Did Porterhouse see the shooter?

1173
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,023
I don't know. How would I know?

1174
01:11:37,303 --> 01:11:38,431
Of course he didn't see the shooter.

1175
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:40,421
because by the time he
pulled in the parking lot,

1176
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,486
the shooter had already left.

1177
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,112
That's why he didn't
hear the shots.

1178
01:11:43,113 --> 01:11:43,503
Mr Everett

1179
01:11:44,743 --> 01:11:46,383
I don't know. I don't know
anything that happened.

1180
01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:48,407
You don't know because
you don't know how long

1181
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:50,304
you were on the floor
trying to save poor Amy's life.

1182
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:53,783
What was this, a random shooting?
Or was there someone else there?

1183
01:11:54,063 --> 01:11:56,143
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

1184
01:11:56,423 --> 01:11:57,385
Give me something! God damn it!

1185
01:11:57,663 --> 01:12:00,383
What do you want?
What do you people want from me?

1186
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:01,680
Alright that's it.

1187
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:01,944
No

1188
01:12:02,863 --> 01:12:06,263
You believe us, don't you?
Do you believe us?

1189
01:12:06,983 --> 01:12:08,943
- Bonnie, don't.
- Do you believe us?

1190
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:11,743
Yes! I believe you.

1191
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:12,903
For Christsake!

1192
01:12:13,183 --> 01:12:14,958
Where's your god damn heart?
Don't these people have enough?

1193
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:15,743
What do you think this is?

1194
01:12:15,983 --> 01:12:17,463
Then where were you?

1195
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:22,423
Dear God! Where were you
all this time?

1196
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:25,703
It wasn't my story.
There was an accident...

1197
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:33,007
Where were you?

1198
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:38,623
Everett?

1199
01:12:40,343 --> 01:12:41,743
Warden.

1200
01:12:42,743 --> 01:12:45,382
You know, people come
in here, the press.

1201
01:12:45,623 --> 01:12:49,743
Prisoners tell them things.
All kind of heart-wrenching things.

1202
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:51,858
And the next day in the paper,

1203
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:54,462
we're the one come off
sounding like hard guys.

1204
01:12:55,063 --> 01:12:57,022
It can get pretty frustrating, is all.

1205
01:12:57,302 --> 01:12:58,863
Yeah, of course.

1206
01:12:59,143 --> 01:13:01,702
We have to do what
the state tells us to do.

1207
01:13:02,822 --> 01:13:04,022
Makes it a little tough on us...

1208
01:13:04,302 --> 01:13:07,742
...if we show up in the paper
as bloody murderers or anything like that.

1209
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,223
Yeah, I understand. Completely.

1210
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,022
Knew you would.

1211
01:13:16,222 --> 01:13:19,422
You know these things go through
all kind of trials and appeals...

1212
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:21,582
...before they get to us.

1213
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:25,462
There's no use trying to figure out
who's naughty or who's nice...

1214
01:13:25,702 --> 01:13:28,903
...and then come sliding down the
chimney like a hero.

1215
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:31,263
Not on execution day.

1216
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,902
You're not Santa Claus.

1217
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:39,743
No such thing as Santa Claus.

1218
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:49,222
Warden?

1219
01:13:51,982 --> 01:13:53,782
You're not really sure, are you?

1220
01:14:00,782 --> 01:14:02,622
You drive safe now.

1221
01:14:15,142 --> 01:14:17,182
- Cecilia, I want to talk.
- Not a good time.

1222
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:18,695
- No I got to talk to you
- Not now. Call my office.

1223
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:21,062
- This is important, really is
- Please, just back up.

1224
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:22,742
Back off, will you?

1225
01:14:23,022 --> 01:14:24,742
What are you, a court
attorney or something?

1226
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:25,941
Go ahead and hit a reporter.

1227
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:27,382
See how long you keep
your god damn job.

1228
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:30,142
- Why don't you get in the car?
- Yeah, why don't you get in the car?

1229
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,102
New York asshole!

1230
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:36,221
- What is it?
- Frank Beechum. Who else was there?

1231
01:14:36,462 --> 01:14:37,944
Are you back on the bottle again?

1232
01:14:38,102 --> 01:14:41,662
There was Frank Beechum, there was
Nancy Larson, there was Porterhouse...

1233
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:43,825
- Who else was there?
- What's the difference does it makes?

1234
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:45,661
Come on. The one that shot Amy.

1235
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:48,370
I don't know what kind of
cock-a-many-conspiracy

1236
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:49,621
theory you're working on this time...

1237
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:53,705
...but we've got a solid case here.
I don't send innocent men to death house.

1238
01:14:53,901 --> 01:14:55,141
I know that. I do.

1239
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:56,697
But you made a
mistake this time.

1240
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:58,462
Look, he was just in there
using the bathroom.

1241
01:14:58,742 --> 01:15:00,382
He went in there for some steak sauce.

1242
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,901
You've always been
a gullible son of a bitch.

1243
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:07,501
Read the transcripts.
A witness saw Beechum with a gun.

1244
01:15:07,741 --> 01:15:10,142
He couldn't have.
Not through the potato chips.

1245
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,741
Are telling me he said that?

1246
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:13,702
I saw it in his eyes.
I could tell.

1247
01:15:14,021 --> 01:15:17,061
- You haven't got jack shit.
- How much jack shit do I need?

1248
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:19,421
Now come on. There was somebody,
wasn't there?

1249
01:15:20,702 --> 01:15:22,621
A kid. He bought a
Coke from the machine.

1250
01:15:22,622 --> 01:15:23,901
He didn't even look inside.

1251
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:25,502
He's the one who killed Amy.

1252
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:28,272
We interviewed him.
We issued a description of his car.

1253
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:28,895
It came in

1254
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,945
His story checked out...He wasn't even

1255
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:32,701
The plain fact is you had
Frank Beechum in custody.

1256
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:34,931
So you thought you had the
right person but you didn't

1257
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:36,824
- This was the right guy.
- He was nothing to the case!

1258
01:15:37,101 --> 01:15:38,879
He even put him in a
lineup with Beechum.

1259
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,659
Both witnesses look right at him
and still fingered Beechum as the killer

1260
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:44,689
The fact is, he was long gone before
the witnesses even got there.

1261
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:45,701
Just give me his name.

1262
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,821
How can I suppose remember
after six years?

1263
01:15:48,101 --> 01:15:50,661
- He was nothing to the case!
- You've got files! God damn it!

1264
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:54,128
Call my office in the morning.
I'll try to help you out if I can.

1265
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:57,141
You wait till morning,
you better sleep god damn well tonight.

1266
01:15:57,421 --> 01:16:00,381
Because after today, I'm gonna haunt
the shit out of you Cecilia

1267
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:03,381
I'm gonna haunt your ass all over
this goddamn town.

1268
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,821
I am not Wally.
I'm a lot bigger than Wally.

1269
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:07,978
You threaten me again,

1270
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:10,169
I'll have pieces of your
life thrown in the gutter...

1271
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:11,781
...and I'll blow the rest away.

1272
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,741
One more thing, barfly.

1273
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:22,261
I think you ought to know this before
your latest lost cause confesses.

1274
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:25,701
Did anybody ever tell you that Beechum
volunteered for a lie detector test?

1275
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,181
And he flunked it big time.
Sure, it's inadmissible.

1276
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,501
It you didn’t read it
in the transcripts...

1277
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:37,101
...but it certainly captured
our attention.

1278
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:41,180
So why don't you just go pour yourself
a tall one and think about that?

1279
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:06,569
- Hey Ev
- Tom

1280
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,180
You want a nip?

1281
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,701
No, thanks. I'd better not.

1282
01:17:10,981 --> 01:17:12,380
Sorry, I forgot.

1283
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:18,020
What's with you and Bob? He's been
giving you the evil eye all day.

1284
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,924
You know something,
it's starting to work.

1285
01:17:19,925 --> 01:17:20,340
Oh really?

1286
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,900
Did something happen up at the
prison? Some big uproar?

1287
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,701
Tom why would a guilty man volunteer
for a lie detector test?

1288
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:31,060
Happens all the time. Perp gets
cocky, thinks he can slide one by.

1289
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,740
Of course, innocent men
flunk them sometimes too.

1290
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,180
Why, does Bob want you to take one?

1291
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,020
That's a cute idea.

1292
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,580
No. I don't think
my guilt's in any doubt.

1293
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,500
Where's Bridget? I want her
to do some scutwork for me.

1294
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,340
Women feel much more secure
in the workplace now these days.

1295
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:50,180
She we home. But I'll get
your coffee if you give me head.

1296
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,028
Better yet, why don't
you track down an

1297
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:57,700
investigator in
the Beechum case.

1298
01:17:57,979 --> 01:17:59,650
See if they can find out
there was another...

1299
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:00,980
...witness on the murder scene.

1300
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,540
A kid. Just an address
and a name will do.

1301
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,860
You got it.

1302
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,350
After that, get me some
coffee will you tom?

1303
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,499
Oakland Police.
Sgt. Bartlett speaking.

1304
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:19,940
Yeah. This is Donaldson at the Tribune.
Who headed the Beechum case?

1305
01:18:20,179 --> 01:18:22,259
Anyone there know the Beechum case?

1306
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,140
All of us. Anyone here.

1307
01:18:24,419 --> 01:18:26,140
Before Beechum comes to the store...

1308
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,420
...there's another witness
come into the parking lot, right?

1309
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,499
Wrong. There's nothing
like that in the files.

1310
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:35,900
- How do you know? Have you looked?
- Believe me, we know.

1311
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,299
Everybody here has
memorized these files.

1312
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:41,620
There are no other witnesses.
Porterhouse and Larson, that's it.

1313
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,659
But a lot of circumstantial.

1314
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,819
This is Donaldson over at the Tribune.

1315
01:18:46,099 --> 01:18:49,340
On the Beechum case, was there
a record of a kid who was a witness?

1316
01:18:49,619 --> 01:18:51,329
- A kid?
- Yeah

1317
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:52,860
I don't think so.

1318
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,780
- You're sure?
- Thanks anyway.

1319
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,179
All right, thanks.

1320
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,260
That was the whip in the investigation.

1321
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:07,739
He says it rings a bell. But turn up to be
nothing he doesn't remember any names.

1322
01:19:08,059 --> 01:19:12,099
Ardsley, who headed the investigation,
retired. Florida somewhere.

1323
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:13,699
Shit!

1324
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,219
Everett! Come here.

1325
01:19:18,139 --> 01:19:19,539
Shit!

1326
01:19:21,913 --> 01:19:23,779
Everett

1327
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:28,059
- Don't look so happy about it.
- Who said anything about being happy?

1328
01:19:28,299 --> 01:19:30,125
I understand your
prison interview went

1329
01:19:30,126 --> 01:19:32,499
beyond the requirement of
a human-interest sidebar.

1330
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:34,155
I colored outside
the lines a bit,

1331
01:19:34,156 --> 01:19:36,219
but I don't think the warden
wasn't sore about it.

1332
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:39,370
Now he just probably thought
you were back on the booze, Steve

1333
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:41,293
By the way, there's no
smoking in the building.

1334
01:19:41,294 --> 01:19:42,019
You got a minute?!

1335
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:43,379
I can't put up with this. Okay?

1336
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,219
Steve, say you're sorry.
Bob, punch his lights out.

1337
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:47,659
This is not a personal matter.

1338
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:50,659
I gave him an important story
with very specific instructions.

1339
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:52,059
The newspaper made a promised...

1340
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:54,339
- The guy is not guilty.
- Oh Come on!

1341
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:57,819
This isn't a human-interest sidebar.
It's a cruci-fucking-fixion.

1342
01:19:58,099 --> 01:20:01,459
Want me to look at the cross and say
"How's the weather up there?"

1343
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,698
I've got all the personal crap
right here in this book.

1344
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,939
He believes in God.
He thinks he's going to heaven.

1345
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,858
He's happy as shit.
He's glad they're juicing him.

1346
01:20:11,138 --> 01:20:13,179
- Go ahead write up your sidebar!
- That's not the point. Okay?

1347
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:14,858
Of course it's not the point.

1348
01:20:15,098 --> 01:20:18,379
Fine.we take Steve off the
execution and put Harvey on it.

1349
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:21,659
- That's still not the point.
- Well Bob we know what the point is.

1350
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,498
You know what the point is?
I can't work with you anymore, Steve.

1351
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,153
Maybe you're a good reporter...
everybody seem to think so

1352
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,900
...but there's a room out there full of
good reporters who don't have your attitude

1353
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:28,858
and they follow instructions.
I'm done with him.

1354
01:20:29,139 --> 01:20:30,252
I can't work with him.

1355
01:20:30,379 --> 01:20:32,098
Bob, why don't you hit me in
the fucking face will ya?

1356
01:20:32,339 --> 01:20:33,738
I'll fall down. I'll bleed.

1357
01:20:34,018 --> 01:20:35,899
I'll do all that. I deserve it.

1358
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:38,779
Then go home and hit your
wife because she likes it.

1359
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,779
Nice one, babe.

1360
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:49,698
We can't all live in the world
of your fucking imagination here. Alright?

1361
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,984
I not going to hit anybody
no matter what they want,

1362
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:53,498
because that's exactly
what you'd want.

1363
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:55,722
as far as Patricia goes, she
need to find something

1364
01:20:55,723 --> 01:20:57,819
outside of our relationship,
she can go ahead find it.

1365
01:20:58,058 --> 01:21:00,178
My marriage is none of your
fucking business, number one.

1366
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:02,738
Number two, you're a thoughtless...

1367
01:21:03,019 --> 01:21:05,661
...mentally unbalanced man and
I can't work with him anymore, Okay?

1368
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:07,738
I've enjoyed this episode of Oprah here...

1369
01:21:08,018 --> 01:21:09,010
Allan I got the shooter.

1370
01:21:10,643 --> 01:21:11,350
What?

1371
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:13,040
I don't think we shouldn't
confuse the issues.

1372
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:14,550
The guy who killed Amy
Wilson, I got him.

1373
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:18,738
- Even if it's the guy who shot JFK...
- Bob, shut up!

1374
01:21:19,018 --> 01:21:20,178
How do you got him?

1375
01:21:20,538 --> 01:21:22,298
I've got him. I know who he is.

1376
01:21:23,218 --> 01:21:24,378
All right, who is he?

1377
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:27,458
He's a guy.
He's a guy who was there.

1378
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:34,018
You're telling me that the shooter
is a guy who was there?

1379
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:36,018
Great Steve!
Should I hold the front

1380
01:21:36,019 --> 01:21:37,726
page or you want to wait for
two unnamed sources, or what?

1381
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:39,978
The D.A. knows Bob. She knows
about it, she just won't give me the name.

1382
01:21:40,218 --> 01:21:43,406
- What about the defense?
- The defense doesn't have it on file.

1383
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:44,618
This is ridiculous.

1384
01:21:44,643 --> 01:21:46,457
Bob..

1385
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,618
Shut...

1386
01:21:47,857 --> 01:21:48,618
...up.

1387
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:52,018
What about the cops?

1388
01:21:52,978 --> 01:21:54,458
Well they're sitting on it
if they know about it.

1389
01:21:54,738 --> 01:21:55,618
Jesus!

1390
01:21:55,898 --> 01:21:58,018
Sorry, Alan. This is just too much.

1391
01:21:58,658 --> 01:22:01,058
Alan, I gotta be clear
on this, okay?

1392
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:03,418
This is causing problems for everybody.

1393
01:22:03,698 --> 01:22:05,578
I love the paper
but I'm ready to leave.

1394
01:22:05,858 --> 01:22:09,578
I can't work like this. This environment's
become intolerable for me.

1395
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,178
"Intolerable environment"?
What are you? Some fucking feminist?

1396
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:14,538
Are you a cooze?
What's wrong with you?

1397
01:22:14,818 --> 01:22:16,458
Alright, you gotta give me notice.

1398
01:22:19,618 --> 01:22:22,657
My contract, if you dump me,
you gotta give me notice.

1399
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:25,058
How much notice do you want Steve?

1400
01:22:27,938 --> 01:22:30,177
Six hours and seven minutes.

1401
01:22:39,618 --> 01:22:41,658
Testing red. Testing red.

1402
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:46,738
<i> Correction Department </i>
Testing tan. Testing tan.

1403
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,337
Testing white. Testing white.

1404
01:22:52,977 --> 01:22:55,297
<i> Governor's Office </i>
Testing black.

1405
01:22:59,657 --> 01:23:01,737
We're standing in San Quentin's
former gas chamber...

1406
01:23:02,017 --> 01:23:04,057
...which is then converted
for lethal injection.

1407
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:07,497
The first syringe delivers five grams
of sodium Pentothal...

1408
01:23:07,777 --> 01:23:09,498
...and that will basically
put him to sleep

1409
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,258
within a matter of a few
seconds, we're told

1410
01:23:11,537 --> 01:23:15,577
Then the injection line will be flushed
with 20 cc's of saline solution...

1411
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:19,297
...and then he'll be given 50 cc's
of pancuronium bromide.

1412
01:23:19,617 --> 01:23:22,777
Now that is a muscle paralyzer,
and his muscle will be paralizied at that point...

1413
01:23:23,057 --> 01:23:24,697
...he won't be able to breathe.

1414
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:28,057
And finally, 50 cc's
of potassium chloride.

1415
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,257
And that'll stop his heart.

1416
01:23:59,019 --> 01:23:59,757
Hello..

1417
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,977
Yes, this is...

1418
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,296
Yeah. This is Steve's wife. Why?

1419
01:24:09,017 --> 01:24:11,416
What's the matter?
Something happen to him?

1420
01:24:36,297 --> 01:24:37,776
Already, the vultures come...

1421
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:41,056
So steal. Go ahead.

1422
01:24:41,296 --> 01:24:42,696
Mr. Ziegler?

1423
01:24:45,217 --> 01:24:46,536
Mr Ziegler I'm not a thief.

1424
01:24:46,776 --> 01:24:49,656
I'm a friend of Michelle's,
a colleague of hers at the paper.

1425
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,376
My friends, most of them knock.

1426
01:24:53,816 --> 01:24:55,136
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1427
01:24:56,136 --> 01:24:59,176
I'm sorry about Michelle too.
She was really topnotch.

1428
01:24:59,456 --> 01:25:01,496
A really fine reporter.

1429
01:25:02,696 --> 01:25:04,576
So you came to give the eulogy?

1430
01:25:04,856 --> 01:25:06,256
Michelle was working on a story.

1431
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:09,336
There's a man at San Quentin who's
going to be executed tonight.

1432
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:10,296
I think he's innocent.

1433
01:25:10,576 --> 01:25:13,376
I think the answer may be in
Michelle's papers.

1434
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:15,936
Something Michelle did?

1435
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:17,776
Something she was onto, yeah.

1436
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:19,856
So look!

1437
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:21,216
Great.

1438
01:25:23,056 --> 01:25:25,216
I've been going through her things too.

1439
01:25:26,096 --> 01:25:27,575
See this?

1440
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:30,816
Gave her this when she was 9.
She loved it.

1441
01:25:33,856 --> 01:25:35,016
She saved everything.

1442
01:25:36,816 --> 01:25:38,016
Look at this.

1443
01:25:38,296 --> 01:25:41,695
I don't know when she did it.
Must have been 4 or 5.

1444
01:25:45,496 --> 01:25:47,416
Where'd this come from? Over here?

1445
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:56,976
This anything?

1446
01:25:57,256 --> 01:25:59,895
"Warren Russel, 17 years old.

1447
01:26:00,136 --> 01:26:03,895
4331 Knight Street. Interviewed
July 7th at own request. "

1448
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:08,415
"Says he bought a soda and left.
Saw nothing.

1449
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,895
Something fishy here. "

1450
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:16,615
Mr. Ziegler, that Michelle, she was
really on top of things.

1451
01:26:16,856 --> 01:26:18,096
Great!

1452
01:26:31,575 --> 01:26:32,896
Sorry, Frank.

1453
01:26:33,296 --> 01:26:35,735
We're going ti have to ask
Mrs. Beechum to leave now.

1454
01:26:36,615 --> 01:26:38,015
Give us a minute, okay?

1455
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:40,935
Sure.

1456
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,108
- Oh God
- No

1457
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:46,375
I don't think I can do this.

1458
01:26:50,975 --> 01:26:53,695
I won't get a chance
to say goodbye later on.

1459
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:01,975
So I need you to take care of
yourself and our little girl, Bonnie

1460
01:27:02,975 --> 01:27:04,735
You know I will, baby.

1461
01:27:05,335 --> 01:27:06,895
- I will.
- And give her this.

1462
01:27:07,535 --> 01:27:09,015
And don't forget.

1463
01:27:10,895 --> 01:27:12,375
It ain't much, but it's...

1464
01:27:12,655 --> 01:27:14,735
It'll be precious to her.

1465
01:27:15,654 --> 01:27:17,775
It will be her most precious thing.

1466
01:27:19,894 --> 01:27:22,615
I really hate that you have
to go through this Bonnie

1467
01:27:23,495 --> 01:27:24,815
I know.

1468
01:27:25,895 --> 01:27:26,775
Okay, I love you.

1469
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:28,775
I love you.

1470
01:27:30,295 --> 01:27:32,254
I wanted to be there for you.

1471
01:27:32,535 --> 01:27:35,175
God knows I wanted to see
my little girl grow up.

1472
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,015
If we had just a little bit more time...

1473
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:42,335
We have to be thankful
for the time we had.

1474
01:27:42,615 --> 01:27:43,935
It's that it was short.

1475
01:27:44,454 --> 01:27:45,615
At least we made Gail.

1476
01:27:45,895 --> 01:27:47,535
We made Gail together.

1477
01:27:47,775 --> 01:27:50,095
We made something beautiful
in this world.

1478
01:27:50,935 --> 01:27:53,975
You look at her and you remember
how much I love you. Okay?

1479
01:27:54,694 --> 01:27:55,775
Can you do that?

1480
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:58,174
God, Frank, I'm so scared.

1481
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:00,734
If I can see your face...

1482
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:02,654
I'll talk to you every day.

1483
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,854
- If I can see you at the end.
- Come with me!

1484
01:28:06,135 --> 01:28:08,095
You going to be talking to me?

1485
01:28:08,974 --> 01:28:10,174
If I could see your face!

1486
01:28:10,454 --> 01:28:12,814
How did this ever happen to us?

1487
01:28:18,934 --> 01:28:21,494
The only thing in my life...

1488
01:28:21,775 --> 01:28:23,774
...that made it worth anything.

1489
01:28:24,894 --> 01:28:27,135
God bless you for that.

1490
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:32,694
God bless you for that.

1491
01:28:37,574 --> 01:28:38,694
Who's there?

1492
01:28:40,494 --> 01:28:43,574
I'm Steve Everett. I'm a reporter
for the Tribune.

1493
01:28:55,134 --> 01:28:56,454
Go home!

1494
01:28:58,054 --> 01:29:00,254
And quit casing that man's car.

1495
01:29:01,214 --> 01:29:02,854
It's almost your dinnertime.

1496
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:04,294
Go home!

1497
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:11,254
- Sorry about them kids.
- That's all right.

1498
01:29:11,533 --> 01:29:13,333
I'm just glad to find
you here after 6 years

1499
01:29:14,254 --> 01:29:16,613
What, you thought I might've
moved to the suburbs?

1500
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:20,534
Come on in.

1501
01:29:26,613 --> 01:29:27,814
And you are...?

1502
01:29:28,094 --> 01:29:29,014
Angela Russel.

1503
01:29:29,294 --> 01:29:30,294
And Warren?

1504
01:29:31,013 --> 01:29:32,134
My grandson.

1505
01:29:35,174 --> 01:29:36,333
Is this Warren right here?

1506
01:29:36,814 --> 01:29:38,013
It is.

1507
01:29:38,293 --> 01:29:40,014
You want to tell me why you're here?

1508
01:29:41,573 --> 01:29:44,534
Mrs. Russel, it's very important
that I talk to Warren.

1509
01:29:44,814 --> 01:29:46,974
It's important I talk to him tonight.

1510
01:29:47,254 --> 01:29:51,293
Oh It is? And what could be so important,
if you don't mind my asking?

1511
01:29:51,813 --> 01:29:55,693
There's a man on death row, and
they're gonna execute him tonight.

1512
01:29:56,294 --> 01:29:58,413
They say he killed
a grocery store clerk...

1513
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,573
...six years ago. An Amy Wilson.

1514
01:30:00,893 --> 01:30:02,133
I think he's innocent.

1515
01:30:02,413 --> 01:30:04,693
I think Warren knows
something about it.

1516
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:06,974
Why would you
think a thing like that?

1517
01:30:07,733 --> 01:30:09,973
Because he's the only other
person that was there.

1518
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:12,773
And how do we know that?

1519
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,774
The witnesses didn't see anyone else.

1520
01:30:16,773 --> 01:30:21,053
Wait a minute. So, there were witnesses,
even though nobody else was there?

1521
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,134
- Yes, that's right...
- No, wait. Help me out here.

1522
01:30:24,493 --> 01:30:26,213
I am getting confused.

1523
01:30:26,533 --> 01:30:28,933
There was an accountant
and a housewife.

1524
01:30:30,693 --> 01:30:31,853
- White people?
- Yeah

1525
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:37,533
And I bet...

1526
01:30:37,813 --> 01:30:40,533
...that girl that got killed,
that Amy Wilson...

1527
01:30:40,813 --> 01:30:42,613
...I bet she was white too, wasn't she?

1528
01:30:43,253 --> 01:30:45,293
Yeah that's right. But I don't think...

1529
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:48,013
You don't think those nice
white people...

1530
01:30:48,293 --> 01:30:50,213
...would ever kill that nice white girl.

1531
01:30:50,613 --> 01:30:52,333
But they all looked around...

1532
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:55,533
...and what do you know?
There was a black boy.

1533
01:30:56,813 --> 01:30:57,972
Look, it isn't like that.

1534
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:00,317
Will you just think
back in your mind?

1535
01:31:00,318 --> 01:31:01,693
Think back Six years ago.

1536
01:31:01,973 --> 01:31:04,692
Was Warren using drugs
or anything like that?

1537
01:31:04,933 --> 01:31:06,052
Yes. He was into drugs.

1538
01:31:06,332 --> 01:31:07,413
Did he own a gun?

1539
01:31:07,693 --> 01:31:10,973
They all own guns, Mr. Everett.
Don't you know that?

1540
01:31:11,253 --> 01:31:15,133
All those black dope-fiend boys,
they all own guns.

1541
01:31:16,413 --> 01:31:17,572
Can I just talk to him?

1542
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:19,492
Do you know where he is?

1543
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:23,013
Yes, I do.

1544
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:25,573
And no, you can't.

1545
01:31:25,932 --> 01:31:29,533
Look, an innocent man
is gonna die tonight.

1546
01:31:30,533 --> 01:31:32,693
Well I have seen a lot of innocent folk...

1547
01:31:32,973 --> 01:31:36,013
...die in this part of town,
Mr. Everett.

1548
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:37,732
But it's funny.

1549
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:41,253
I ain't never seen you
around here before.

1550
01:31:41,613 --> 01:31:45,652
Mrs. Russel, you're making this into
a racial thing, and it's not like that.

1551
01:31:45,893 --> 01:31:48,252
The man on death row,
he's a black man too.

1552
01:31:48,532 --> 01:31:49,932
Did you know that?

1553
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:51,594
They'll kill him at midnight.

1554
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:54,292
Now, I can't help unless I
have the facts in this case

1555
01:31:54,852 --> 01:31:57,892
The only fact I know, Mr. Everett...

1556
01:31:58,692 --> 01:32:00,572
...is that my grandson, Warren...

1557
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:04,533
...he's been in his grave now
going on three years.

1558
01:32:04,933 --> 01:32:08,213
Stabbed out there in the park.

1559
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,252
My Warren...

1560
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:18,532
...was a loving child.

1561
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:21,652
But I don't remember you
coming around here...

1562
01:32:21,933 --> 01:32:25,132
...looking for the facts
when he was killed.

1563
01:32:25,932 --> 01:32:29,732
Nobody came around here
looking for the facts then.

1564
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,332
Fucking loser!

1565
01:32:37,612 --> 01:32:39,412
Goddamn it!

1566
01:32:45,012 --> 01:32:47,805
and We're told he's now having
that last meal he requested earlier...

1567
01:32:48,092 --> 01:32:50,012
...steak and french fries.
and oddly enough...

1568
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:52,852
...he also requested two
six-packs of Coke.

1569
01:32:53,092 --> 01:32:56,331
and in you're just tuning in,
we'll repeat our top story.

1570
01:32:56,611 --> 01:33:01,292
Convicted killer Frank Beechum has,
for the first time, confessed his crime.

1571
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:03,772
The confession was made
to the chaplain...

1572
01:33:04,052 --> 01:33:05,452
...as an expression of remorse...

1573
01:33:05,692 --> 01:33:09,651
...for the murder of Amy Wilson
and her unborn child six years ago.

1574
01:33:09,932 --> 01:33:13,252
A source posted to the governor's
office says however that despite this...

1575
01:33:13,532 --> 01:33:17,892
...the execution will proceed as schedule
at one minute after midnight tonight.

1576
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:20,932
And in other news, the market
slumped badly...

1577
01:33:59,052 --> 01:34:00,972
I am tired.

1578
01:34:01,252 --> 01:34:03,051
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1579
01:34:03,331 --> 01:34:05,611
Why are you here, Daddy?

1580
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:11,091
I'm here to see you, you little goon.

1581
01:34:12,691 --> 01:34:14,251
Where did you go?

1582
01:34:16,051 --> 01:34:17,692
A wild-goose chase.

1583
01:34:17,971 --> 01:34:19,691
You went chasing?

1584
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:22,320
Yeah

1585
01:34:22,571 --> 01:34:25,451
Chasing salvation and
never did find it.

1586
01:34:25,971 --> 01:34:27,831
Just disappeared. Poof

1587
01:34:29,052 --> 01:34:30,117
- Poof
- Poof

1588
01:34:30,142 --> 01:34:31,737
Poof. Yeah

1589
01:34:32,317 --> 01:34:34,024
- Poof
- Hey

1590
01:34:34,971 --> 01:34:35,811
Let me tell you...

1591
01:34:36,091 --> 01:34:37,970
About today, I'm sorry.

1592
01:34:39,331 --> 01:34:40,651
How about this weekend we'll...

1593
01:34:40,891 --> 01:34:43,259
...go and spend the whole
day play Slow Zoo.

1594
01:34:44,878 --> 01:34:45,469
Yeah

1595
01:34:46,571 --> 01:34:48,211
And this time, could we see...

1596
01:34:48,491 --> 01:34:50,291
...the hippopotamus?

1597
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:53,330
Yeah. I've already talked to him.
We have an appointment.

1598
01:34:55,971 --> 01:34:57,531
My little Daddy.

1599
01:34:57,811 --> 01:35:00,011
I'll go to sleep now.

1600
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:03,411
Okay, I think that's a good idea.

1601
01:35:08,891 --> 01:35:10,291
Close them, now.

1602
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,171
If this were a bullet...

1603
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,610
...you'd be dead.

1604
01:35:59,731 --> 01:36:01,210
Bob call you?

1605
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:05,530
What difference does
it make who called me?

1606
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:11,010
I know you're going to apologize.

1607
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:14,090
I know you will try to do better.

1608
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:17,410
But I don't want this anymore.

1609
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,530
Because I'm tired.

1610
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,850
I just think this'll be hard on her.

1611
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:31,020
It is

1612
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,649
Barbara, I can change.

1613
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:46,650
Can't we just erase all this?

1614
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:49,650
I just had a terribly
ridiculous day.

1615
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:52,970
It isn't just today.

1616
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,690
But today is the end of it.

1617
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,770
Today I understand.

1618
01:36:59,889 --> 01:37:02,010
Hell, I know I've been...

1619
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,250
...tempted a lot, but...

1620
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:06,730
But I love you, baby.

1621
01:37:13,729 --> 01:37:15,369
It's just that I...

1622
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,969
I'm just kind of coming apart here,
and I didn't...

1623
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:26,129
I know it's nobody's fault
but my own.

1624
01:37:26,769 --> 01:37:29,809
I need you. I got to put
these pieces back together.

1625
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,569
I feel sorry for you.

1626
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:44,609
You and your famous nose for a story.

1627
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:47,649
You think you can just...

1628
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,570
...sniff your way along, you know?

1629
01:37:50,889 --> 01:37:53,170
From one hunch to another...

1630
01:37:53,889 --> 01:37:57,929
...one girl to another, one drink to
another when you're drinking.

1631
01:37:58,209 --> 01:38:00,849
But I'm not one of your stories, Ev.

1632
01:38:02,649 --> 01:38:04,289
I'm your wife.

1633
01:38:08,969 --> 01:38:10,929
You can't line up all the facts...

1634
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:13,489
...and think you know something
about me.

1635
01:38:15,969 --> 01:38:17,369
Your hunches...

1636
01:38:17,929 --> 01:38:19,489
...are shit.

1637
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:24,889
Even when they're right, they're shit.

1638
01:38:26,849 --> 01:38:28,609
They're all I've got.

1639
01:38:32,729 --> 01:38:35,169
I hope they do somebody
some good someday...

1640
01:38:35,449 --> 01:38:39,409
...because they sure as hell didn't
do us any good, did they?

1641
01:38:41,769 --> 01:38:43,409
I packed all your stuff.

1642
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:46,768
You can take it now,
or you can come back later.

1643
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:49,129
Please, just get out.

1644
01:38:49,409 --> 01:38:51,769
Get out of here, Ev, please.

1645
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:55,528
Just get out.

1646
01:39:28,568 --> 01:39:33,009
Sometimes, the governor's aides call me
on matters that concern the governor.

1647
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:36,049
In the course of spiritual
guidance and ministrations...

1648
01:39:36,328 --> 01:39:40,128
...I might have misunderstood what
the prisoner said to me.

1649
01:39:40,408 --> 01:39:42,968
But these things happen
from time to time.

1650
01:39:45,288 --> 01:39:47,488
If he says, meaning the prisoner...

1651
01:39:47,768 --> 01:39:50,128
...says, "I'm sorry,"
under these extreme...

1652
01:39:50,408 --> 01:39:53,768
You know what you've done, don't you?
Now I have to call the governor.

1653
01:39:54,048 --> 01:39:55,524
I have to issue a
retraction to the

1654
01:39:55,525 --> 01:39:57,368
press and tell them there
was no confession.

1655
01:39:59,008 --> 01:40:00,480
Beechum has his own
pastor anyway.

1656
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:02,288
What the hell do you
think you were doing?

1657
01:40:02,313 --> 01:40:03,839
Well sir I..

1658
01:40:03,888 --> 01:40:05,768
You made me look
unprofessional Shillerman

1659
01:40:07,848 --> 01:40:09,728
Not a good thing to do.

1660
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,528
Spiritually speaking.

1661
01:40:20,408 --> 01:40:22,888
If any of the men
feel they need counseling...

1662
01:40:23,327 --> 01:40:24,728
...I'll be here.

1663
01:40:25,768 --> 01:40:27,488
Long as they need me...

1664
01:40:27,967 --> 01:40:29,168
...I'll be here.

1665
01:40:36,008 --> 01:40:38,168
You sure you want to do this, Ev?

1666
01:40:38,488 --> 01:40:40,648
Does a bear shit on Goldilocks?

1667
01:40:40,928 --> 01:40:43,887
I don't know.
I've never been asked that before.

1668
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:46,128
That's the trouble with having kids.

1669
01:40:46,487 --> 01:40:48,287
It screws up your quips.

1670
01:40:48,888 --> 01:40:53,447
So you're seriously rolling off
the wagon. Must have been a rough day.

1671
01:40:53,767 --> 01:40:56,408
Yeah, lost my wife, lost my kid...

1672
01:40:56,688 --> 01:40:59,328
...lost my goddamn job.
Is that rough enough?

1673
01:40:59,568 --> 01:41:01,127
Did you lose your automobile too?

1674
01:41:01,407 --> 01:41:03,487
Because if you start
driving in this...

1675
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:06,207
I'm the best fucking driver
on the planet.

1676
01:41:06,487 --> 01:41:08,287
I'm talking to a dead man.

1677
01:41:08,608 --> 01:41:10,688
Will you leave me
your stamp collection?

1678
01:41:10,968 --> 01:41:15,167
How about filling this up?
I ain't eaten anything all day, either.

1679
01:41:22,767 --> 01:41:23,647
Jesus Christ!

1680
01:41:27,808 --> 01:41:29,927
Go the fuck home, will you?

1681
01:41:31,447 --> 01:41:33,087
Ain't got no home.

1682
01:41:36,327 --> 01:41:38,487
I ain't got no fucking home.

1683
01:41:44,647 --> 01:41:45,767
You have full confidence...

1684
01:41:46,048 --> 01:41:49,647
...the state should sanction an execution
to go ahead satisfy your rage.

1685
01:41:50,047 --> 01:41:53,007
Wait. This is got nothing to do about
my rage. Let's be honest.

1686
01:41:53,247 --> 01:41:56,047
My daughter was shot and killed
in cold blood for no reason.

1687
01:41:57,127 --> 01:41:58,247
He took $96...

1688
01:41:58,527 --> 01:42:00,887
...and he  took a ring
and a locket I'd given her...

1689
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:02,887
...for her 16th birthday.

1690
01:42:03,767 --> 01:42:05,087
My Warren...

1691
01:42:05,687 --> 01:42:07,767
...was a loving child.

1692
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:12,447
That's someone who doesn't deserve
the same rights as a human being.

1693
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,887
- Will you be there tonight sir?
- You bet.

1694
01:42:15,847 --> 01:42:16,807
July 15?

1695
01:42:17,247 --> 01:42:18,647
July 15.

1696
01:42:19,086 --> 01:42:20,407
Mind if I use your bathroom?

1697
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,687
You know where it is, right?

1698
01:42:29,447 --> 01:42:30,567
The fucking money!

1699
01:42:31,487 --> 01:42:33,046
Don't hurt me, please.

1700
01:42:36,886 --> 01:42:39,526
What the fuck?
This is all you fucking got?

1701
01:42:39,766 --> 01:42:41,767
The 4th of July.
We're not that busy.

1702
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:44,326
Give me the chain!

1703
01:42:44,647 --> 01:42:47,367
- Fucking chain!
- No, please, not that!

1704
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:04,886
Amy?

1705
01:43:08,006 --> 01:43:09,421
Jesus! Amy?

1706
01:43:29,486 --> 01:43:31,046
Still on the Beechum's execution story...

1707
01:43:31,286 --> 01:43:33,246
...the report we got
just about an hour ago...

1708
01:43:33,526 --> 01:43:36,486
...in which Frank Beechum
confessed to his crime...

1709
01:43:38,326 --> 01:43:39,790
Are you driving? Hey Ev

1710
01:43:39,815 --> 01:43:41,884
Hey Ev

1711
01:43:56,206 --> 01:43:58,486
You sack of shit! Let's get going!

1712
01:44:06,325 --> 01:44:09,286
There are two executioners.
Each one of them has a button.

1713
01:44:09,526 --> 01:44:11,926
and that button is connected
for each of them to a computer...

1714
01:44:12,206 --> 01:44:15,326
...that scrambles the circuits
so no one knows who does it the deed.

1715
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:47,765
Brother Beechum, let me
tell you of the Lord.

1716
01:44:51,805 --> 01:44:54,366
He is my refuge
and He is my fortress.

1717
01:44:54,885 --> 01:44:56,686
He is my God.

1718
01:44:57,485 --> 01:45:01,805
And therefore, even in the darkest
moments, even when there is no hope...

1719
01:45:02,606 --> 01:45:05,005
...He will deliver you from the snare...

1720
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:08,045
...of the fowler.

1721
01:45:16,845 --> 01:45:17,965
Step in there.

1722
01:45:21,085 --> 01:45:23,125
That Robinson man on TV, I saw him.

1723
01:45:23,405 --> 01:45:27,085
And I started remembering that night
Warren gave me that locket.

1724
01:45:27,525 --> 01:45:30,925
Her maiden name! And I started
remembering Warren's face.

1725
01:45:31,205 --> 01:45:33,245
I can always read that boy's face.

1726
01:45:33,525 --> 01:45:36,245
He did a terrible thing, Mr. Everett.

1727
01:45:36,525 --> 01:45:40,485
He wasn't a bad boy, but I know
he did a terrible thing!

1728
01:45:40,885 --> 01:45:43,605
They're gonna kill that man
in less than a half-hour.

1729
01:45:43,885 --> 01:45:45,965
We can't get to the prison
in that time.

1730
01:45:46,245 --> 01:45:49,045
You're right, lady.
Fasten your seat belt.

1731
01:45:50,725 --> 01:45:52,205
Reverend, it's time.

1732
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:18,445
Set him up.

1733
01:46:21,684 --> 01:46:24,765
There's this boy sold
Warren a gun around that time.

1734
01:46:26,045 --> 01:46:27,444
This boy, he's in jail.

1735
01:46:27,724 --> 01:46:30,285
He might talk to them
if they give him time off.

1736
01:46:31,205 --> 01:46:34,085
Mrs. Russel, I could kiss you.

1737
01:46:34,844 --> 01:46:36,484
Release your hands.

1738
01:47:40,404 --> 01:47:42,044
Gun it, mister!

1739
01:47:42,324 --> 01:47:43,804
We go fast.

1740
01:48:11,044 --> 01:48:13,443
Pull over! Pull over
and stop the car!

1741
01:48:14,204 --> 01:48:15,844
Don't stop now!

1742
01:48:56,123 --> 01:48:58,003
Prepare yourself, all right?

1743
01:49:01,203 --> 01:49:03,243
I'm going to attempt this maneuver.

1744
01:49:19,923 --> 01:49:22,803
They really ought to do
something about that place.

1745
01:50:20,602 --> 01:50:22,762
Boy, something must be going on.

1746
01:50:23,123 --> 01:50:25,763
Maybe a fire, another accident
on the curve.

1747
01:50:49,882 --> 01:50:52,203
"To all whom it may concern,
be it known...

1748
01:50:52,482 --> 01:50:55,202
...whereas the Superior Court and
county of Alameda...

1749
01:50:55,442 --> 01:50:58,802
...ordered that Frank Louis Beechum
suffer the death penalty...

1750
01:50:59,082 --> 01:51:00,842
...within the walls of
San Quentin prison...

1751
01:51:01,122 --> 01:51:05,242
...for the crime of murder in the first
degree with special circumstances. "

1752
01:51:10,762 --> 01:51:12,082
I love you.

1753
01:51:13,882 --> 01:51:15,802
I love you.

1754
01:51:19,562 --> 01:51:22,002
McCardle. Yes, sir.

1755
01:51:24,642 --> 01:51:25,722
We have a go.

1756
01:52:44,896 --> 01:52:45,521
Yes sir

1757
01:52:48,401 --> 01:52:49,801
But it's too late.

1758
01:53:03,001 --> 01:53:03,881
Go! Go!

1759
01:53:12,781 --> 01:53:16,891
Frank!

1760
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:25,920
Frank!

1761
01:53:29,314 --> 01:53:31,314
Frank!

1762
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,521
What's up? It's official,
it's for the kids.

1763
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,161
I need some charity.

1764
01:54:07,681 --> 01:54:09,760
It's charity on toast, baby. Come on.

1765
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,440
How you doing?

1766
01:54:13,841 --> 01:54:15,240
Thank you very much.

1767
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,560
How you doing, sir?

1768
01:54:20,138 --> 01:54:21,990
Hey Ev! Kate like that dalmatian?

1769
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,281
She loved it.

1770
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:26,600
Even my ex managed to muster up
a little enthusiasm.

1771
01:54:27,121 --> 01:54:29,840
In fact I've got to get something
better for Christmas.

1772
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,120
Sheepdog, collie,
we got Saint Bernards...

1773
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,801
How about a hippopotamus?

1774
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:40,200
Check it out! Local designer,
based on the one at the zoo.

1775
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,960
Yeah, this is a beauty.

1776
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,760
Think a homeless man can afford this?

1777
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,760
You're not homeless.

1778
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,600
Well, I'm wifeless and jobless...

1779
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,440
...and I live in a hotel.

1780
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,080
That's unless...

1781
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:00,040
...you'd be interested
in putting me up.

1782
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,248
First of all, everybody said
you have a big fat book contract.

1783
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,720
Money's already spent.

1784
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,429
Second of all,
everybody says you're

1785
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:10,600
about to win the Pulitzer
Prize or something.

1786
01:55:10,839 --> 01:55:13,240
I think everyone's being
a little bit optimistic.

1787
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:16,599
And third of all, I have a boyfriend.

1788
01:55:19,759 --> 01:55:21,640
Well, that's good!

1789
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:25,200
Maybe he's out of town
for the holidays.

1790
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,160
Cash or charge, Ev?

1791
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:31,959
I better charge it.

1792
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,240
I'm charging everything else
these days.

1793
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,400
Give me some charity, baby.
It's for the kids.

1794
01:55:38,799 --> 01:55:40,039
It's official!

1795
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:43,680
I need some charity on toast!
Come over here, help me out.

1796
01:55:45,793 --> 01:55:46,760
Steve!

1797
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:50,479
I know you got some charity.

1798
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,440
You famous baby! Rich and famous.

1799
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:56,280
I know you got charity on toast.
Give me some charity. Come on.

1800
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:57,879
It's for the kids.

1801
01:55:58,119 --> 01:55:59,239
That's right, come on.

1802
01:55:59,519 --> 01:56:01,640
Give me 20, give me 100.
Come on, Steve.

1803
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,479
Take it before my wife does,
and get out of here.

1804
01:56:04,759 --> 01:56:05,519
A 10?

1805
01:56:05,799 --> 01:56:08,158
Steve, you got more than that.
Come on, now. It's for the kids.

1806
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,559
It's official.
Come on give some more

1807
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:13,919
All right. All right, newspaperman.

1808
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:16,359
I been here two hours
freezing my ass off.

1809
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:17,559
I'm going home.

1810
01:56:17,839 --> 01:56:19,639
You haven't got a home.

1811
01:56:20,119 --> 01:56:22,159
I got no wife
and no elves, either.

1812
01:56:22,439 --> 01:56:25,239
You want to be Santa Claus these
days, you on your own.

1813
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:30,519
You're right there, pal.

1814
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:33,199
Santa Claus rides alone.

1815
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:43,359
It's for the kids!

1816
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:50,119
Daddy!

1817
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:51,439
Come on!

1818
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:53,639
Come on, Daddy.

1819
01:56:57,919 --> 01:56:59,639
Come on, now, Daddy.

1820
01:57:28,594 --> 01:57:29,554
