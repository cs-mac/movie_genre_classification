1
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,346
We choose to go to the moon.

2
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,355
We choose to go to the moon...

3
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:33,796
We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,200
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

5
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,034
We set sail
on this new sea...

6
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,304
because there is new
knowledge to be gained...

7
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,538
and new rights to be won,

8
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,444
and they must be won
and used...

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,881
for the progress
of all mankind.

10
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,886
We shall send to the moon,

11
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,116
240,000 miles away...

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,715
from the control station
in Houston,

13
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,727
a giant rocket...

14
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,729
more than 300 feet tall,

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,197
made of new metal alloys,

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,633
some of which have not yet
been invented,

17
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,501
capable of standing heat
and stresses...

18
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,064
several times more
than have ever been experienced,

19
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,546
fitted together with a precision
better than the finest watch,

20
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,617
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion,

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,983
guidance, control,
communications, food and survival,

22
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,717
on an untried mission...

23
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,385
to an unknown celestial body.

24
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,395
And, therefore,
as we set sail,

25
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,694
we ask God's blessing
on the most hazardous...

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,861
and dangerous and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked.

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,370
Thank you.

28
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,553
Just like a person
waiting in the wings to go on stage,

29
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,148
they probably have less time
to daydream...

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,923
because they're trying to
remember what they've gotta do.

31
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,794
You know, I had the feeling I really
ought to concentrate on remembering...

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,200
the things that I had to do
at the moon and all that.

33
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,503
Gosh, here
we are, and we're gettin' down close.

34
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,174
I hope the suit
checks out okay.

35
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,317
You get sweaty palms...

36
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,354
and heart starts pounding.

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,288
It's like the big game
about to start.

38
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,932
You're in
your work clothes, ready to go to work.

39
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,941
But you still
have to stay there.

40
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,705
You have to schedule it in conjunction
with the booster schedule itself.

41
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:37,442
You're plugged into a console
that's supplying 100% oxygen.

42
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,450
There's kind
of a catch-up time...

43
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,452
if there's a problem
with the booster or something,

44
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,682
we're there at the pad until the count
gets to a certain point,

45
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,954
and then we're called
to proceed to the spacecraft.

46
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,512
Y'all take care, now.

47
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,001
Godspeed, men.

48
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,515
At the last minute, there was
a psychological block there...

49
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,819
that said,
"Don't count on this so heavily.

50
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,519
It might not happen. "

51
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,860
This is such a big thing. I frankly
don't see how you can do it.

52
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,868
Even when participating in it, I think
it's audacious that you would try.

53
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,564
I clearly could never
understand, as a crewman,

54
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,233
how to make it work.

55
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,607
I could only learn
how to operate my share of it.

56
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,729
Bein' command pilot, I was
sittin' in the center seat,

57
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,771
so that meant
I climbed in last.

58
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,102
I just stood around and waited
till they strapped in.

59
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,767
And here was kind
of a strange quiet.

60
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,849
You can look out and you can see
a large part of the state...

61
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,785
and the ocean
and this thing out here.

62
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,618
You have the feeling
that it's alive.

63
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,126
That's the kind of thing that
sort of, for the first time,

64
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,128
begins to bring home the fact...

65
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,360
that today is not the game we've been
playing in training for years.

66
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,196
This is reality.

67
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,559
I had the only window
at this point,

68
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:46,104
and I looked out, and doggone if the
moon wasn't visible in the daylight...

69
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,436
right straight out
the top of the window.

70
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,442
I know they're doin' their job,
because the moon's right ahead...

71
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,068
and that's where we're pointed.

72
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,342
They're just gonna launch us
right straight to this thing.

73
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,145
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.

74
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,156
All still go
on the Apollo mission...

75
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,921
the flight to land
the first men on the moon.

76
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,395
The spacecraft also now
is on full internal power.

77
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:17,128
Up to this time, it had been sharing
the load with an external power source.

78
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,696
Once we get down to the three minute
and ten second mark in the countdown,

79
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,708
we'll go on
an automatic sequence.

80
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,109
All aspects from there on down
will be automatic,

81
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,273
run by the ground master computer
here in the firing room.

82
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,681
We have some 7.6 million pounds
of thrust pushing the vehicle upward,

83
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:45,389
a vehicle that weighs close to
six and a half million pounds.

84
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,459
We all are in this
together as a team effort.

85
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,469
We're gonna make it work.

86
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,471
And I don't know
how to make it work.

87
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,701
I don't know how to do
most of this mission.

88
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,575
But I do know that I can assure you
that my piece of it is gonna work,

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,739
and it won't fail
because of me.

90
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,579
The members of the launch team
here in the control center...

91
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,145
are monitoring a number
of what we call red line values.

92
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,385
These are tolerances we don't
want to go above or below...

93
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,394
in temperatures and pressures.

94
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:24,835
They are standing by to call out
any deviations from our plans.

95
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:30,432
The supervisor has informed launch
vehicle testing you are go for launch.

96
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,274
Three minutes, 25 seconds and counting.
We are still go at this time.

97
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,982
There's a long period of time...

98
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,178
when you've done all the things you can,
and there are few things left to say.

99
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,619
You don't know any new jokes
to tell.

100
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,351
There's just not much left
to say except just sit there and wait.

101
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,859
And it feels good.

102
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,453
Astronauts report it feels good.
One minute, 25 seconds and counting.

103
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,090
Our status board indicates
the third stage completely pressurized.

104
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,864
Guidance system goes on internal
at 17 seconds,

105
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,963
leading up to the ignition
sequence at 8.9 seconds.

106
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,042
Power transfer is complete.

107
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,979
Firing command coming in now.

108
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:14,610
We are on the automatic sequence.
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,383
We're on internal power with
the launch vehicle at this time.

110
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,324
All the second stage tanks
now pressurizing.

111
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,327
Thirty-five seconds
and counting.

112
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,193
It won't fail because of me.

113
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,961
T minus 20 seconds and counting.

114
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,626
Guidance internal.
15, 14,

115
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,204
13, 12, 11,

116
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,968
10, 9, engines on,

117
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,067
five, four, three, in two,

118
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,339
launch commit.

119
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,219
Yahoo!

120
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,988
It feels just like it sounds.

121
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,564
I got a pitch and a roll
program and this baby is really goin'.

122
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,194
Roger that.
Stand by for mode one bravo.

123
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,204
Mark one bravo.

124
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,167
That's a lovely liftoff.
That's not bad at all.

125
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,769
There's a moment
there just of supreme elation,

126
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,076
a complete release
of tensions.

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,845
To feel all that power
precisely directed,

128
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,080
to know that we're on course,
first of all for Earth orbit,

129
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,886
and then precisely inserted
onto the right orbit,

130
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,427
the right trajectory,
for rendezvous with the moon.

131
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,327
Apollo, Houston. You're
right smack dab on the trajectory.

132
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,992
Your I.U.'s doin'
a beautiful job.

133
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,001
I got a yaw program.

134
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,162
Trajectory's good. Thrust is good.

135
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,172
We're on our way, Houston.

136
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,675
At last, I'm leaving the
earth, and I'm destined for the moon.

137
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,337
What a ride. What a ride.

138
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,711
Roger. We copy, Pete.

139
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,374
Roger. Looks good up here too.

140
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,250
Roll's complete.

141
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,324
This is really
a rockin' rollin' ride.

142
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,655
You can feel it shake.

143
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,753
There's a real strong vibration.

144
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,264
Of course, you're up
at the end of this beauty.

145
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,131
Here you are,
going along with the G on ya.

146
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,765
It's up to about four Gs, but you're
psyched up, good shape and all that.

147
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,367
Even liftin' your arm
to move switches... no problem.

148
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,379
Apollo, you are go for staging.

149
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,141
Here you are comin' up on staging,

150
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,982
and when staging happens,
it's, like, man!

151
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,695
We got skirt step.

152
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,495
And that's for ignition,
Houston.

153
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,633
- Thrust is go.
- Roger.

154
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,769
Trajectory, guidance,
C.M.C. are all go.

155
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
Thank you, Joe.

156
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,746
Houston, you're lookin'
good here, right down the center line.

157
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,997
That was shutdown
right on the money.

158
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,869
17 Houston,
you are go for orbit.

159
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,669
And we're out over the Canaries.

160
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,052
Apollo, Houston through
the Canaries. How do you read?

161
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,351
Loud and clear, Houston.
Over the Canaries.

162
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,461
Boy, it's just beautiful
up here lookin' out the window.

163
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,463
It's just really fantastic.

164
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,700
Roger.

165
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,329
Let me tell ya
a little bit about the ride.

166
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,339
Uh, John, this is Houston.

167
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,070
If there's nothin' startling to report
about the ride, we'd rather hold off.

168
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:14,185
No, there's nothing really
different to report on the ride.

169
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,186
We'll hold off on that.

170
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,959
The sunset is just as
beautiful as always in this business.

171
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,624
In Africa, there are
a lot of nomads out in the desert.

172
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,829
Clear desert nights, you see
the fires from all of these...

173
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,532
these little yellow dots
that represent the fires...

174
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,508
from all these nomads
camping out.

175
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,774
And you realize the broad area
you're looking at.

176
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,372
And each of those little dots
represented people...

177
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,542
other humans that are out there
in an environment...

178
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:51,612
I would consider more strange than
they might think about... me.

179
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,599
When you get there into orbit,

180
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,966
the engines shut down and things
sorta feel sorta funny.

181
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,539
And you sorta unbuckle
your seat belt...

182
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,371
and wiggle around in your seat
or tap your toes...

183
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,105
and all of a sudden you're just bodies
everywhere in the room...

184
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,114
and you're just doin' flips
and cartwheels and spins.

185
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,884
Your first feelings of
weightlessness as it hits you...

186
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:29,791
is like going down a country
road about 60 miles an hour,

187
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,524
And then you get over the bump, and
you get that good sensation feeling...

188
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,600
and then, boom,
you're back down again.

189
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,101
Only when you're in space
and you go into weightlessness,

190
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,603
you go over that bump
and you never come down.

191
00:15:55,654 --> 00:16:00,182
Uh, 12 Houston, your program
alarm was an integration problem.

192
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,591
Can you give us a verb 96
to stop your integration...

193
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,392
and we'd like you to do
an E mod dump.

194
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,457
Give us a 3-2-1 mark
when you do your verb 74,

195
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,469
and if we get it done now,

196
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,971
we should have an answer for ya
on your erasable memory...

197
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,201
by the time you get to Guaymas.

198
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,209
Do a verb 96 first.

199
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,915
We had a great deal of difficulty...

200
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,917
paying attention
to what our job was.

201
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,215
Already I was getting
the impression...

202
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,385
that this is such an amazing thing
that I'm gonna forget these things.

203
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,227
I know I'm going to lose this image.
It's going to be replaced with another.

204
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,440
Each image came up, was there for
a flash to be appreciated and savored...

205
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,375
and then let go because you know
it's gonna be superposed with others.

206
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,606
And, Houston, we're beginning
to see a beautiful sunrise here.

207
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,750
Okay. We're giving you a go
for your E.V.A. at this time.

208
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,159
Okay.
The hatch is open. No sweat.

209
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,696
Ah, it stayed
just where I wanted it.

210
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,752
Dave, come on out
wherever you are.

211
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,529
When you're
outside in one of those spacesuits,

212
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,297
you're really in space.

213
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,237
There are no boundaries
to what you're seeing.

214
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,740
It's like having a goldfish bowl
over your head...

215
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,812
which gives you
unlimited visibility.

216
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,849
And then the portable life support
system is just very, very quiet.

217
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,350
You know, there's a water pump in it
that's circulating water...

218
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,388
through your underwear...
you know, cooling water.

219
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:15,051
And there's a fan that's pumping the
oxygen through, but they're very quiet.

220
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,060
You can't hear them at all.

221
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,597
It's as if you're out there
without anything on.

222
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,467
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Houston.

223
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,412
There's a total complete
silence and that beautiful view...

224
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,315
and the realization, of course,
that you're going 25,000 miles an hour.

225
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,175
You recognize that you're not
there because you deserve to be there.

226
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,176
You were just lucky.

227
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:11,545
You're the representative
of humanity at that point in history...

228
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,747
having that experience,
in a sense, for the rest of mankind.

229
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,488
The flight director says get back in.

230
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,666
Apollo Control Houston. Two
hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time.

231
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:40,907
It will be during this pass that we will
have the translunar injection burn.

232
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,038
Capcom, we're go for T.L.I.

233
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,912
Roger. Guys, I've got the word
you wanted to hear.

234
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,953
You are go for T.L.I.
You're go for the moon.

235
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,849
If there's anything to be
remorseful about on going to the moon,

236
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,396
it was you didn't get to spend as much
time around the earth as you'd like...

237
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,160
because there's an awful lot of
very interesting things to see.

238
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,101
Three, two, one, ignition.

239
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,969
We confirm ignition,
and the thrust is go.

240
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,670
You guys are really haulin'
the mail out of there.

241
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,714
Boy, you'd better believe it.
It's like we're climbing straight up.

242
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,307
It's a fantastic sight.
Just like we were shot straight up.

243
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,388
Uh, you're goin'
about 6,000 feet a second.

244
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:39,661
Their present altitude
is now about 3,000 miles,

245
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,867
and the spacecraft moving at
nearly 35,000 feet per second.

246
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,876
These three crew members...

247
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,845
are traveling faster than
any man has ever flown before.

248
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,310
There's not much
sensation of what's really happening...

249
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,615
except we're looking at the computer and
the computer is adding up the velocity,

250
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:01,125
and suddenly we really knew
that we were really traveling.

251
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,128
And shoot, when that engine lit off,
it was on for a long time.

252
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,130
Shutdown.

253
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,723
But it really hit us when it stopped,

254
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,860
and we turned around
and looked at the earth.

255
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,530
Suddenly,
the earth had started to shrink.

256
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,418
Hello, Houston. You'd have
to see this planet to believe it.

257
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,530
This is just so you guys
don't get too excited...

258
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,066
and forget what your job is
down there.

259
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,363
We're ready for what
we're about to receive.

260
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,268
" Fly me to the moon "

261
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,171
" Let me play among the stars "

262
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:55,645
" Let me see what spring is like "

263
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,715
" On Jupiter and Mars "

264
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,444
" In other words "

265
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,044
" Please be true "

266
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,254
" In other words "

267
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,729
" I love you "

268
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,732
which you could listen to music.

269
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,895
We were allowed to carry a personal
cassette so you could play the music.

270
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,565
Mine was country music.

271
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,403
Hi, this is Buck Owens
from the Buckaroos.

272
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,414
We came down to the studio and thought
we'd put together a little thing...

273
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,212
that you could take along
with you on your trip.

274
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,755
Now when you get back, they're probably
gonna put you in the movies,

275
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,824
so the first thing
we're gonna do for ya...

276
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,190
is to play a little song
called "Act Naturally. "

277
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,820
It goes like this:

278
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,423
" They're gonna put me
in the movies "

279
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,264
" They're gonna make
a big star out of me "

280
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,432
" Well, we'll make a scene about
a man that's sad and lonely "

281
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,638
" And all I gotta do
is act naturally "

282
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,683
" Well, I'll bet you
I'm a-gonna be a big star "

283
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,845
" You might win an Oscar
You can never tell "

284
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,755
" The movies are gonna
make me a big star "

285
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,819
" 'Cause I can play
the part so well "

286
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,424
" Well, I hope you'll come
to see me in the movie "

287
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,026
" And I know that
you're gonna plainly see "

288
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,768
" Mmm, the biggest fool
that's ever hit the big time "

289
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,778
" And all I gotta do
is act naturally "

290
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,815
By the way, you know we're makin' this
tape, and they're goin' to the moon.

291
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,612
They're on their way
to the moon right now. Oh.

292
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:45,418
Hey, anybody up there
read me? This is Houston.

293
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,857
You don't think of it
as Texas or the United States.

294
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,690
You really think of it as Earth.

295
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,857
The three things that
I associated with Earth...

296
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,369
were people and green trees
and fresh water.

297
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,940
This is different
for me. My name is Merle Haggard,

298
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,978
and this is my band,
the Strangers.

299
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,482
I hope we will be able to do somethin'
you'll enjoy on your way to the moon.

300
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,609
And of course,
we hope that you come back,

301
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,517
but we want you to leave
this tape there, okay?

302
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,886
We want this tape
to be out of sight.

303
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:36,399
" Someday when our dream world
finds us "

304
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,375
" And these hard times are gone "

305
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:44,245
" We'll laugh
and count our blessings "

306
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,843
" In a mansion all our own "

307
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:53,015
" If we both pull together "

308
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:57,356
" Tomorrow's sure to come "

309
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,130
" Someday we'll look back "

310
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,293
" And say "

311
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,768
" It was fun "

312
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,772
When you get ready to eat,

313
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:13,072
they'll say right on there, "Command
Module Pilot, day three, meal two. "

314
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,841
So you take that packet out,

315
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,212
and you may have two drinks...

316
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,548
and three or four different
types of food in there.

317
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,385
So you've gotta find a spot to stick
these, or they're gonna float off.

318
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,221
And then you've gotta get
the water gun.

319
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,386
You gotta mix up the drinks
and mix up the food...

320
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,487
and knead 'em around...

321
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,499
and not let everything
float off in the interim.

322
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,501
" And someday "

323
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,629
" We'll look back and say "

324
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,640
" It was fun "

325
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,311
" Someday "

326
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:52,941
" When our dream world finds us "

327
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,576
The only bad part
about zero gravity in Apollo...

328
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,587
was goin' to the bathroom.

329
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,283
We had a very crude system.

330
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,690
For your feces,
it was a bag,

331
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,126
and you'd put this bag
in the right position.

332
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,600
So you go, but nothin' goes to
the bottom of the bag in zero gravity.

333
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:14,729
Everything floats. So you've
got this bag and then the problem...

334
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,104
is gettin' it off
and closin' up the bag,

335
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,541
makin' sure everything's
still in the bag.

336
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,248
" Someday "

337
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,341
" We'll look back and say "

338
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,013
" We had a good time on the way
to the moon, didn't we "

339
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,326
Are you still planning to have
TV at the scheduled time?

340
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,231
Right. You can go ahead
with the TV now. We're standing by.

341
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,032
Hello, Houston. We've got
a beautiful view of the earth here...

342
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,572
that is absolutely fantastic.

343
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,633
We're standing by
at this time to receive...

344
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,009
the first TV transmission
from the spacecraft.

345
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,218
Houston, we're now
showing you a view of the earth...

346
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,550
through the telephoto lens.

347
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,556
This transmission
is coming to you...

348
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,889
approximately halfway
between the moon and the earth.

349
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:14,227
It makes you realize
just what you have back there on Earth.

350
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,496
The earth from here is a grand oasis
in the big vastness of space.

351
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,740
I keep imagining, if I'm some
lonely traveler from another planet,

352
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,749
would I land on the blue
or the brown part of the earth?

353
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,985
Okay, world.
Hold on to your hat.

354
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,990
I'm gonna turn ya upside down.

355
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,522
The spacecraft
at the present time...

356
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:50,465
is in a slow roll as part of the passive
thermal control program...

357
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,468
to maintain temperatures.

358
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,139
You have to,
literally, just pinch yourself...

359
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,405
and ask yourself
the question, silently,

360
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,176
"Do you really know where you are
at this point in time and space...

361
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,581
and in reality
and in existence?"

362
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,177
When you look out the window
and you're lookin' back...

363
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,688
at the most beautiful star
in the heavens...

364
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,691
the most beautiful because
it's the one we understand,

365
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,024
and we know it... it's home, humanity,
people, family, love, life.

366
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,029
And besides that,
it is beautiful.

367
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,691
We can see from pole to pole and
across oceans and continents,

368
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,702
and you can watch it turn
and there's not strings holding it up.

369
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:30,366
And it's movin' in a blackness
that is almost beyond conception.

370
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,645
Rog, how's that tape recorder?

371
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,147
Is the R.P.M. up to nominal?

372
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,879
Yeah. It works
pretty good here in zero G.

373
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,454
It works better than it does
down there on the ground.

374
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,653
We're ready for the news now.

375
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,665
Okay. Let's see.

376
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,964
The Beatles have announced
they will no longer perform as a group.

377
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,301
The quartet is reported to have made
in excess of a half billion dollars...

378
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,001
during their short
musical career.

379
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,945
Rumors they will use this money to start
their own space program are false.

380
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:17,217
That's about it for news. A recap
of how the top ten teams did yesterday:

381
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,985
Ohio State beat Purdue,
42 to 14,

382
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,687
Texas beat T.C.U.,
69 to 7.

383
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,764
Tennessee lost to Mississippi.

384
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,028
Final score on that one
was 38 to nothing.

385
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,037
Notre Dame won over Georgia Tech
last night, 38 to 20.

386
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,235
And, of course, Purdue lost
to Ohio State.

387
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,482
When the sunlight shines
through the blackness of space,

388
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,487
it's black,

389
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,854
but I was in sunlight, and I was
able to look at this blackness.

390
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,086
I mean, what are you looking at?

391
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,426
Call it the universe, but it's the
infinity of space and time.

392
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,366
I'm looking at something
called space, that had no end,

393
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,235
and at time,
that has no meaning.

394
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,364
You can really focus on it...

395
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,535
because you got this planet out there...
this star called Earth...

396
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,341
which itself is in this
blackness, but it is lit up...

397
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,677
because the sunlight strikes
on an object...

398
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,717
strikes on something
called Earth.

399
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,344
And it's not a hostile blackness.

400
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,786
Maybe it's not hostile because
the beauty of the earth...

401
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,790
that sort of gives it life.

402
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,968
Throughout the flight,

403
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,970
the times when one could sit back...

404
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,666
and really appreciate what
an amazing adventure this was...

405
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,767
was only during those little
periods of time...

406
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,609
when you had a chance to stop and do
the things you weren't programmed to do.

407
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,707
A lot of times, when there was
nothing else to do...

408
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,787
or after everybody'd gone
to sleep and I couldn't,

409
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,255
I'd open up the window
and look around.

410
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,317
One thing every spacecraft
ought to have is a huge window.

411
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,991
Looking back at the earth was a pastime
that I never really got tired of.

412
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,227
Uh, who've we got up now?

413
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,328
The other two guys are pretty sleepy.

414
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,306
They sacked out again, so
I'm holdin' the fort down for a while.

415
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:21,640
Biomedical data recently was monitored,

416
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,045
and the C.M.P. was soundly asleep...

417
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,913
while the commander was resting...

418
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,044
but perhaps not soundly asleep.

419
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,123
We got the black watch
watchin' you tonight.

420
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,488
You picked the midnight shift, I see.

421
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,289
Yeah, it's turnin' out
to be kind of quiet too.

422
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,296
We like it that way.

423
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,768
When you're out there
in this little command module,

424
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,896
you see the risk you're taking
because you realize...

425
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,033
that, if the glass breaks
or the computers quit workin'...

426
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,577
or the electrical system
quits workin',

427
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,011
you're not gonna get back.

428
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,243
And you have time to contemplate this.
You have time to think about it.

429
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:05,084
And you have time to run it through
your mind a lot of different times.

430
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,784
How far away from Earth now,
Jim... about?

431
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:12,522
It looks like you're
approaching 150,000 miles.

432
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,632
Frank, we had a little
egg nog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.

433
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,364
Val Anders dropped by. She's lookin'
fine. Tell Bill she's doin' real well.

434
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,372
Rog, thank you.

435
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,745
Everything that I know...

436
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,906
my family and my possessions,

437
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,348
my friends, my country.

438
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,478
It's all down there
on that little thing,

439
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:42,491
and it's so insignificant
in this great big vastness of space.

440
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,716
Here in Mission Control,
the coffee cup...

441
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,687
has become an appliance...

442
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,816
second only to the headset...

443
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,487
in usefulness here.

444
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:07,966
Let's, uh, cycle through
some of our consumables...

445
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:10,901
and other items this morning,

446
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,972
and I'll tell you what we see.

447
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,166
And all this looks quite nominal.

448
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,766
Lights, camera, action.

449
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:22,110
We'll show you some of the type
meals that we have on Earth.

450
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:26,949
Matter of fact, on this flight,
we've carried along pieces of bread.

451
00:33:27,054 --> 00:33:30,182
And along with the bread...

452
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,054
we have a ham spread.

453
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,926
And I'll show you, I hope,
how easy it is...

454
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,931
to spread some ham...

455
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,437
in the environment of zero G.

456
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:18,994
I think we've discovered
that it is quite easy to...

457
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,506
That's great.
You all ought to set this to music.

458
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:23,508
Oh, you want music?

459
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,139
This little tape recorder
has been a big benefit to us...

460
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,152
in passing for the time away
in our transit onto the moon.

461
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:38,748
And it's rather odd to see it
floating like this, in odyssey,

462
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:41,419
while it's playing...

463
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:44,122
the theme from 2001.

464
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:14,155
- We've lost our picture.
- What the...

465
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:16,286
Okay, Houston.
We've had a problem here.

466
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,557
I got three fuel cell lights,
an A.C. buss light,

467
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:23,295
fuel cell disconnect, A.C. buss overload
one and two, main buss A and B, out.

468
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,633
This is Houston. Say again, please.

469
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,639
Gang, I don't know what happened here.

470
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,073
We had everything in the world
drop out.

471
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:37,644
We are venting something.

472
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:41,084
I don't think
this is gonna be a simple problem.

473
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:43,213
We have an apparent serious problem...

474
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:47,191
with a leak in the cryogenic
oxygen in the service module...

475
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:50,422
which provides breathing oxygen
for the crew.

476
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,762
Apollo, Houston.
Try S.C.E. to auxiliary, over.

477
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,995
N.C.E. to auxiliary.

478
00:35:57,104 --> 00:36:00,335
S.C.E. S.C.E to auxiliary.

479
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:06,546
Okay. Let's make sure
we don't do anything...

480
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:09,548
that's going to blow our C.S.M.
electrical power with the batteries...

481
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,017
or that will cause us to lose
fuel cell number two.

482
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:18,120
On panel 276
under instrumentation and power control,

483
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:20,853
open C.B. number three
and number four.

484
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:24,294
Close ascent feed one and two
circuit breakers.

485
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:28,425
Cycle the Parker valves, and then open
the S.M.C. circuit breakers on panel 11.

486
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,802
Hey, it's off. It's off.

487
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:42,313
That sounds beautiful, troops.

488
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:45,442
That's exactly
what we wanted to see.

489
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:48,077
Charlie, my hats off
to the guys in the trench.

490
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:50,656
I love 'em.

491
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:53,021
And, by the way,
welcome to the moon's sphere.

492
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,026
You're in the influx.

493
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,564
One of the things different
about a lunar trip...

494
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,333
is you don't pass anyplace
on the way.

495
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:11,935
Going to the moon, you leave the
launchpad, then you leave Earth orbit.

496
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:15,537
And then a couple of days
later, after passing nothing,

497
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,447
all of a sudden,
you're at the moon.

498
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,282
And that lack of way points, to me,

499
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:24,915
had an effect of making it seem a little
magical and mystical getting there.

500
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:30,361
This is really a rugged planet.

501
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:33,900
We're drawing close to the moon
with the Apollo spacecraft.

502
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,562
Our L.O.S. clock,
our loss of signal clock,

503
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,231
continues to count down
until that time...

504
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,173
that the spacecraft will pass
out of communications range...

505
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:45,176
over the backside
of the moon.

506
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:49,044
On approach, the spacecraft
just sort of dives towards...

507
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:51,413
and behind the moon.

508
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:58,821
It was a totally different moon than
any moon I had ever seen before.

509
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:02,088
It was in this eery shadow.

510
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:04,857
No motion. Utterly silent.

511
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:07,627
It sort of gave one
a feeling of foreboding.

512
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:11,329
It didn't seem like a very
friendly or welcoming place.

513
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:19,976
Apollo, this is Houston.
You are go for L.O.I.

514
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,412
Go ahead, Houston.

515
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:25,076
Jim, you are go for the burn.
Go for the burn.

516
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:29,679
Okay. Apollo is go.

517
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:33,886
You're going too fast to orbit
the moon. You're rockin' on ready.

518
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:36,394
Okay. Two minutes, babe.
Give it a final trim.

519
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,932
Burn time is 15 seconds,
so it's gonna go in a hurry.

520
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:43,434
You're in the burn position.
You're ready to go.

521
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:45,562
Baby, let's make this one.

522
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:49,164
- Then there it is.
- Thirty-five seconds.

523
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:52,143
It's 2001 type stuff.

524
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:56,238
That old moon's just growin'
magnificently fast,

525
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:59,546
and it's just fillin' up
that hatch window...

526
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:02,349
and you're driftin'
into the shadow.

527
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:05,914
Okay, baby. Eight, seven, six,

528
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:09,018
five, three, two, one.

529
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,324
Burn. Burn.

530
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:17,097
You're burnin'.
Okay. Seventy-eight to go,

531
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,798
50 to go, 20 to go.

532
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:22,374
- Standby, Tom.
- Shut down.

533
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:24,376
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

534
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:27,379
Apollo, Houston. You got
the burn off. We're in good shape.

535
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,608
Boy, I tell you.
We is down among them.

536
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:31,843
We is going backwards.
You know that?

537
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:36,651
You've worked so long
and so hard, and finally you're here.

538
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:39,725
The burn has gone well.
You know you're in lunar orbit.

539
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:43,227
You know the orbit is good.
You're right where you wanted to be.

540
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,061
And it just looked like you
could reach out and touch it.

541
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:50,603
Apollo now traveling
over the backside of the moon.

542
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:54,640
The crew should be seeing the features,
the rugged features,

543
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:58,199
moving below them
at a high rate of speed.

544
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:04,346
Charlie, we just saw Earth
rise and it's gotta be magnificent.

545
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:08,683
Charlie, it might sound corny, but
the view is really out-of-this-world.

546
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:18,589
Dave, you ought to
start gettin' your hatch closed.

547
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:19,596
Say again.

548
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:22,998
Start gettin' your hatch
closed if you're not already doin' it.

549
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:25,003
I was disappointed.

550
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:27,767
I wanted to go with them so bad
I could taste it.

551
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:31,002
As far as I was concerned,
that's what it was all about...

552
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:34,638
not only goin' to the moon, but
goin' down to the surface and walking.

553
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:38,741
We're now less than two minutes
away from the separation burn,

554
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:41,787
which will be performed
by the command module.

555
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,288
When we next hear from them,
the lunar module...

556
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:46,757
should be undocked from
the command and service module.

557
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:57,194
You'll never know
how big this thing gets...

558
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,033
when there ain't nobody but one guy.

559
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:06,139
Yeah. Don't get lonesome
out there, John.

560
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:09,113
I wish I could go down there with 'em.

561
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,582
You may not talk about it much,

562
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,153
but part of your training
is comin' back by yourself.

563
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:22,627
See you later.

564
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:27,592
I wish the damn thing
would hold three people.

565
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:31,255
It's grown quiet here
in Mission Control.

566
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,292
A few moments ago,
Flight Director Gene Krantz...

567
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:38,558
requested that everyone sit down,
get prepared for events that are coming,

568
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:41,566
and he closed with,
"Good luck to all of you. "

569
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:44,000
We's go and we's down
among 'em, Charlie!

570
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:48,669
Rog, I hear ya weavin'
your way up the freeway.

571
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:51,744
You're goin'
right down U.S. 1, Mike.

572
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:56,140
Rog, copy. Looks great.

573
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:58,877
Okay, all flight controllers,
go, no go for landing. Retro.

574
00:43:58,985 --> 00:43:59,883
- Go.
- Econ.

575
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:00,884
- Go.
- Surgeon.

576
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:01,885
- Go.
- Fido.

577
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:02,886
- Go.
- Guidance.

578
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:04,286
- Go.
- Telcom.

579
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,289
- Go.
- G.N.C.

580
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,290
- Go.
- We're go for landing.

581
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,691
Eagle, Houston.
You are go for landing, over.

582
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,626
Okay, Houston.
We'll give you a countdown.

583
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,860
Four, three, two, one. Fire.

584
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:18,961
Pitch over. There it is. Oh, baby.

585
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:21,870
We are sure comin' down
to that drop. Look at that rille.

586
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:25,638
That's gotta be, gotta be
probably Diamondback right there.

587
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:28,646
When the pitch is over
and you get your first look, you know...

588
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:31,012
there's nothin' but nine million
craters out there.

589
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,017
a terrible sinking feeling.

590
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,952
I obviously didn't recognize a thing
after studying all these photographs.

591
00:44:36,055 --> 00:44:37,955
Nothin' looked right.

592
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,024
- How you doin', control?
- We look good here. Fine.

593
00:44:43,129 --> 00:44:45,029
- How about you, Telcom?
- Go.

594
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,723
- Guidance, you happy? Fido?
- Go. Go.

595
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:49,859
You are go.
You're go to continue power descent.

596
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:52,369
You are go to continue
power descent. Over.

597
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:56,502
All during this power descent
I kept telling myself,

598
00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:00,943
"This is not for real. You're back in
the simulator. Just remember that. "

599
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:04,608
Eagle, Houston.
It's descent two fuel to monitor, over.

600
00:45:08,855 --> 00:45:11,722
Eagle, Houston.
Everything's lookin' good here, over.

601
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:25,329
Houston, I'm getting a little
fluctuation in the A.C. voltage now.

602
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:28,407
Roger. Stand by.

603
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:36,143
Lookin' good to us.
You're still lookin' good.

604
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:38,513
Houston,
you're lookin' at our delta eight.

605
00:45:38,618 --> 00:45:40,643
That's affirmative.

606
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:42,653
Lookin' good to us, over.

607
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:51,127
Eagle, Houston.
We'll monitor your delta eight.

608
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,737
Six plus two-five throttle
down. Six plus two-five throttle down.

609
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,206
Roger. Copy. Six plus two-five.

610
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:06,107
Let me try auto again now...
see what happens.

611
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,146
We got data dropout. Roger. Stand by.

612
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,310
We're go on that alarm?
If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.

613
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:15,353
We are go on that alarm.

614
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:17,355
Roger. I understand. Go for landing.

615
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:19,357
Roger. We got good data.

616
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,359
Altitude velocity lights.

617
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,988
Eagle, we got you now.
It's lookin' good, over.

618
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:27,658
Four forward,
driftin' to the right a little.

619
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,827
Comin' at us 23, 21 down, 33 degrees.

620
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:33,428
We're go. Same type. We're go.

621
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,805
- Kickin' up dust.
- A couple of big boulders.

622
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,810
Comin' right. Got a good spot.

623
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:42,643
Not too bad. Here comes the shadow.

624
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:44,649
Oh, are we comin' in.

625
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:50,922
- Stand by for touchdown.
- Stand by.

626
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:57,228
Bam!

627
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,532
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.

628
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:06,605
The eagle has landed.

629
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,044
There's a cheer in this room.

630
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:22,910
What we're witnessing now
is man's very first trip into space...

631
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:25,081
with a station stop
along the route.

632
00:47:28,227 --> 00:47:30,593
We gonna stay, Houston?

633
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:34,631
Eagle, you are stay for T-1.

634
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:42,136
This thing came to a stop on the moon.

635
00:47:42,241 --> 00:47:44,641
It was kind of a letdown saying,

636
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:49,113
"You know, we're gonna have to get it
going fast again to get back home. "

637
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,824
Neil, this is Houston.
What's your status on hatch opening?

638
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:02,952
Okay, Houston. I'm on the porch.

639
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:05,929
Neil, this is Houston.
Loud and clear by radio.

640
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:09,160
Check and verify
TV circuit breaker in.

641
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:12,237
Roger. TV circuit breakers in.

642
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:16,798
Houston, roger. We copy,
and we're standing by for your T.E.D.

643
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,377
I'm gonna pull it now.

644
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:23,445
Houston,
the mesa came down all right.

645
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:25,449
And we're gettin' a picture on the TV.

646
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:27,451
Got a good picture, huh?

647
00:48:27,553 --> 00:48:29,748
Okay, Neil. We can see you
coming down the ladder now.

648
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:37,963
The surface seems to be
very, very fine-grained...

649
00:48:38,064 --> 00:48:40,294
as you get close to it.

650
00:48:42,301 --> 00:48:44,997
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

651
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:50,774
Okay. I'm gonna step off
the LM now.

652
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,480
That's one small step for man,

653
00:48:56,582 --> 00:49:00,313
one giant leap for mankind.

654
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:07,520
I had a bet
with somebody who didn't...

655
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:10,721
Really felt that Neil
spent a great deal of time...

656
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,355
before he went figuring out
his famous words,

657
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:17,493
and they were not extemporaneous
on the spot historical words.

658
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:19,901
He actually felt
that these words...

659
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:22,804
might have even been written
for Neil by somebody else.

660
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:26,345
And I said,
"Well, I'll bet you 500 bucks...

661
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:28,607
"that when I get to the bottom
of the ladder...

662
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,843
"nobody ever remembers what the second
person to do something does anyhow...

663
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:34,852
I'm gonna say,
"It may have been a small step for Neil,

664
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:37,388
but it's a big step
for a little fella like me. "

665
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,390
Are you ready for me to come out?

666
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:40,891
Okay.

667
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:45,453
I want to back up
and partially close the hatch,

668
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,898
making sure not to lock it
on my way out.

669
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:53,797
So this person says,
"Ah, no way you're gonna do that.

670
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:55,806
They're gonna tell you
what to say. "

671
00:49:55,908 --> 00:49:59,207
I said, "Okay, a bet's a bet. "
So I bet this person $500,

672
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:02,577
and when I got to the bottom
of the ladder, I said it.

673
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:06,516
And that may have been a small one
for Neil, but that's a long one for me.

674
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:13,989
12 Houston, we have you
in blushing black and white.

675
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:16,789
What happened to the color?

676
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,023
Maybe the color wheel will come up.

677
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:21,430
I can feel the wheels running...

678
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:23,434
because I can feel something
in motion inside.

679
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:26,630
Why don't you put your glove
in front of the lens?

680
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:28,639
All right. Will do.

681
00:50:28,741 --> 00:50:32,575
- That's comin' in there now.
- Got the ol' camera running.

682
00:50:32,678 --> 00:50:34,578
Okay.
What change did you make?

683
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,911
I hit it on the top with my hammer.

684
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:40,144
I figured we didn't have
a thing to lose.

685
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:42,244
I can't believe it.

686
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:44,255
I want you to watch this.

687
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,024
I don't know
if this'll work or not, Charlie.

688
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:53,223
Well, in my left hand
I have a feather,

689
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:55,527
in my right hand, a hammer.

690
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,263
And I guess one of the reasons
we got here today...

691
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,397
was because of a gentleman
named Galileo a long time ago...

692
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:03,805
who made a rather
significant discovery...

693
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,378
about falling objects
in gravity fields.

694
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,607
And we thought that where
would be a better place...

695
00:51:09,715 --> 00:51:13,378
to confirm his findings
than on the moon?

696
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:16,944
And so we thought
we'd try it here for ya.

697
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:19,616
The feather happens to be,
appropriately, a falcon feather,

698
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:22,592
for our falcon.

699
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:25,425
And I'll drop
the two of them here,

700
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:28,022
and, hopefully, they'll hit
the ground at the same time.

701
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,034
How about that?

702
00:51:30,136 --> 00:51:34,334
That proves that Mr. Galileo
was correct in his findings.

703
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,637
We've got a beautiful picture
of you guys up down here.

704
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:40,644
Let me tell you, Bob. This flag
is a beautiful picture.

705
00:51:42,248 --> 00:51:46,548
Hey, John, this is perfect,
with the LM, you and the ol' flag.

706
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:48,950
We really should set the flag up
on a hill, Charlie,

707
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,955
but there just ain't one.

708
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,116
I know, John.

709
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:56,320
I'll put it right here. Big rock.

710
00:51:56,429 --> 00:52:00,422
I was proud for our country
more than I was proud for me.

711
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,626
And it was nothin' that I did.

712
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:05,533
I just happened to have gotten
there at the right time.

713
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:08,368
My background
carried me through.

714
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:11,409
But there were a lot of other
qualified people that didn't go.

715
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,070
Why my name came out,
I don't know.

716
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:23,952
And we very proudly
deploy it on the moon...

717
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:26,684
to stay for as long
as it can,

718
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:29,659
in honor of all those people who have
worked so hard to put us here...

719
00:52:29,762 --> 00:52:33,596
and to make the country and mankind
something different than it was.

720
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:37,694
It was like sittin'
in the last row of the balcony,

721
00:52:37,803 --> 00:52:40,567
lookin' down
at that play goin' on.

722
00:52:40,673 --> 00:52:45,474
While I was in the play, it was
more like I was a spectator.

723
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,480
Tranquility, this is Houston.

724
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:53,609
We'd like to say, from all of us
down here in Houston,

725
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:56,017
and, really, from all of us...

726
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:58,352
in all the countries
in the entire world,

727
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:02,325
we think that you've done
a magnificent job up there today, over.

728
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:05,989
Thank you very much.
Have you had enough TV for today?

729
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:09,795
Yes, indeed. It's been
a mighty fine presentation there.

730
00:53:09,902 --> 00:53:12,496
Thank you. Couldn't have enjoyed it
as much as we did.

731
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:15,870
Get some rest there
and have at it tomorrow.

732
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:18,600
Okay. Signing off.
See you again tomorrow.

733
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:21,612
All systems on the lunar module
are in good order.

734
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:25,582
We have not heard from Tranquility base
since saying good night.

735
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:31,815
My mind's one that
just goes constantly,

736
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:34,552
so I took a sleepin' pill.

737
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,560
Slept like a baby.

738
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:42,124
I had one dream
that was very vivid.

739
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:47,766
In my dream, we were drivin'
the Rover up to the north.

740
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:53,504
And you didn't really feel
like you were out there.

741
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:56,672
It was untouched.

742
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:59,114
The serenity of it...

743
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:02,779
had a pristine purity about it.

744
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:07,649
We crossed a hill.

745
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,490
I felt, "Gosh, I've been here before. "

746
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:14,589
And there was a set of tracks
out in front of us.

747
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,397
So we asked Houston if we could follow
the tracks, and they said yes.

748
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:20,904
And we turned and followed the tracks.

749
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:26,903
Within an hour or so
we found this vehicle.

750
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,140
It looked just like the Rover.

751
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:32,945
The two people in it...
they looked like me and John...

752
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:37,148
had been there
for thousands of years.

753
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,644
It was not a nightmare-type
situation... nothin' like that.

754
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:05,183
Probably one of the most real
experiences in my life.

755
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:24,768
I'd have traded
on the drop of a hat...

756
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,770
to go and land on the moon.

757
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:38,575
I'm one of these nuts.
I like classical music,

758
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:41,710
and I almost learned
to like country and western.

759
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:55,360
One of the things I took was Berlioz'
"Symphonie Fantastique,"

760
00:55:55,468 --> 00:56:00,371
which seemed like that was appropriate
to be taking to the moon.

761
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:47,583
And I was floatin' along,

762
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:50,621
just layin' back
and enjoyin' life.

763
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:52,816
I had just crossed
the face of the moon,

764
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:54,825
goin' towards the darkness.

765
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:14,912
And here's this strange scene,
this music.

766
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,539
And it just seemed to put it
all together in one moment...

767
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,848
that you could completely forget
that this is a real situation.

768
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,591
This is Apollo control Houston...

769
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:32,995
at 104 hours, 31 minutes
now into this historic mission.

770
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:37,626
The lunar surface temperature in the sun
should be around 135 degrees today.

771
00:57:37,736 --> 00:57:40,136
In the shade, the temperature
would again be around minus 100...

772
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,969
to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

773
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:45,509
That would be in the shadow
of the lunar module.

774
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:47,511
Ah, look at that!

775
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:50,605
Ah, it's a panoramic scene
of beauty!

776
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:56,716
Al, can you find the earth?

777
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,322
Oh, there it is. I see it.

778
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,759
Lookin' at the earth
down there, Houston.

779
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,956
It looks like you're littler
than a golf ball at arm's length now.

780
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,966
Sure looks pretty, though.

781
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,400
Really looks spectacular.

782
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:15,332
It seemed very unreal to me...

783
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:18,410
to be there,
looking back at the earth,

784
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,843
thinking how far,
far away it was.

785
00:58:21,947 --> 00:58:24,848
This is the moon.
That is the earth.

786
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:28,318
I'm really here.

787
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,981
We're allowing about five
minutes for the drive to station three.

788
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,082
Okay. Safety belts on.

789
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:36,957
And here we go.

790
00:58:37,062 --> 00:58:38,962
How's the drivin', John? Pretty easy?

791
00:58:39,064 --> 00:58:40,326
Drivin' good.

792
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:42,332
Man, Indie's never seen
a driver like this. Barney Oldfield.

793
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:46,495
Charlie,
what should we be headin' for?

794
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:49,335
- Those craters up there.
- Don't tell me that.

795
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:51,136
Boy, this is so neat.

796
00:58:51,243 --> 00:58:53,143
You look like you're headed
just about for our spot.

797
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:55,179
- See Survey Ridge down there?
- Yep.

798
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,012
This is gonna be spectacular!

799
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,018
No, not through this crater.

800
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,749
- Yeow! Whoa!
- Tryin' to see if you're nervous.

801
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:06,882
Ol' Barney's really drivin' this beauty.

802
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:08,892
Only way to fly, Tony.

803
00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:13,055
This is gonna be such a
spectacular view, you can't believe it.

804
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,895
Well, that's good news.

805
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:19,363
We're here! You did it!

806
00:59:19,471 --> 00:59:22,531
Hey, that was a good stop.
Those wheels just locked.

807
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:25,371
Marked off! Super.

808
00:59:25,477 --> 00:59:28,640
John, did you dust that TV lens?

809
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:31,341
Get some dirt in your eye, Houston?

810
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:35,284
That does a good job on the lens there.

811
00:59:35,387 --> 00:59:38,982
You want us to go up
and travel along that ridge?

812
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:41,491
Yeah, why don't you press on up there?

813
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:50,593
I think
the best place here for the ALSEP...

814
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:53,536
is to the LM's
11:00 position.

815
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:56,904
That sounds good, Charlie.
And, John, it's 2-6-6.

816
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:04,311
I felt very welcome there.

817
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:07,283
You know, the moon's been waitin' for us
for thousands of years...

818
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:09,786
millions of years, maybe,

819
01:00:09,888 --> 01:00:12,516
unless someone else has already been
there before us at some time.

820
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:14,524
That's possible,

821
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:18,118
although we didn't see
any evidence of that.

822
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,131
I felt like I was the only one
there, but not an alien...

823
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:25,932
not an alien in terms of
invading someone else's domain.

824
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:28,836
I didn't find the moon hostile.

825
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:31,171
I found it
very majestically beautiful.

826
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:33,836
Bland in color,
but majestically beautiful.

827
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:38,775
There's a look at that
glass-covered one right there.

828
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:41,011
Pretty good size, isn't it?

829
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,714
It looks like
it's about three days old.

830
01:00:43,822 --> 01:00:46,882
So it must be on the order
of four billion.

831
01:00:46,992 --> 01:00:49,790
So let's fill this one up,
and then...

832
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:52,659
Ah, rats!

833
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:55,962
Betcha that looked like
a comedy of errors on the tube.

834
01:00:56,068 --> 01:00:59,094
Yeah.

835
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:01,900
Hold still.

836
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:05,807
That is a crystalline rock
if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.

837
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:08,641
- First one today.
- Yeah.

838
01:01:08,747 --> 01:01:10,874
We gotta get over
this ridge, John.

839
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:13,474
Do you want to take off
and go that way now?

840
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:15,485
Yeah.

841
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:18,647
John, did you make those
little footprints here?

842
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:20,987
Yeah, I guess I did.

843
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:24,324
Aah, the old footprints
on the crater rim.

844
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,166
There's a good rock
right there.

845
01:01:31,336 --> 01:01:34,066
Look at the size of that rock!

846
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:39,842
I thought this thing
was just right next door to us.

847
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,179
Well, Tony, that's
your house rock right there.

848
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:53,255
It's got black streaks
coming out of it.

849
01:02:03,368 --> 01:02:06,303
This is tough going here.

850
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:08,305
Let me have the shovel.

851
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:12,002
I'll get it. Just a minute.

852
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,442
Good deal, boy.

853
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:18,039
There you go.

854
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,243
I can't get going here.

855
01:02:24,256 --> 01:02:28,124
You've got about ten minutes
left before we have to leave.

856
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:30,923
- Is that okay for you?
- Yep, sure is.

857
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:34,630
338 is the soil sample.

858
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,527
That is the best sample we got.

859
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:40,867
- I know it.
- I'll tell ya.

860
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:47,171
You just had to steal time now and then.

861
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:49,770
You just had to stop
chipping at a rock...

862
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:54,649
and figure out that bringing back
some kind of thought and feeling...

863
01:02:54,753 --> 01:02:58,314
was as important as bringing
another chunk of rock back.

864
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:02,257
And not being a machine but being
a human being, you have to stop and say,

865
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,955
"Do you know where you are
and what you're looking at?"

866
01:03:05,063 --> 01:03:09,591
and try and take in, in those
few moments of privacy you have,

867
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:12,602
everything there is to take in
in that moment.

868
01:03:12,704 --> 01:03:15,195
You've got five minutes here.

869
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:19,643
And all of a sudden,
you've got to get to work.

870
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:25,747
Okay, Houston,
as I stand out here...

871
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:28,479
in the wonders
of the unknown at Hadley,

872
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:32,250
I realize there's a fundamental
truth to our nature:

873
01:03:32,357 --> 01:03:34,325
Man must explore.

874
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:42,958
One of the things
you gotta stop and do...

875
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:45,798
is make sure to have fun too.

876
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:48,702
Because you're only probably
gonna come this way once.

877
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:52,709
" I was strolling
on the moon one day "

878
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:56,212
" In the merry, merry
month of December "

879
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:58,442
- No, May.
- May.

880
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:01,018
" When much to my surprise "

881
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,610
" A pair of funny eyes "

882
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:07,658
Boy, is this
a neat way to travel.

883
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:10,626
Isn't it great?

884
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:17,629
- I like to skip along.
- Not me, boy. Skip.

885
01:04:17,736 --> 01:04:22,139
Well, whatever you call it.
I can't get my left leg in front of me.

886
01:04:34,252 --> 01:04:36,482
It was almost dangerous.

887
01:04:36,588 --> 01:04:39,523
You lose sight of the fact
that it's a vacuum out there,

888
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:43,117
and if you spring a leak in that
suit, you're gonna be dead.

889
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:45,753
Uh-oh.

890
01:04:54,606 --> 01:04:56,631
Nice soft Navy landing.

891
01:04:56,742 --> 01:05:01,179
Yahoo!

892
01:05:03,515 --> 01:05:05,847
Boy, do I like to run up here.

893
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:12,955
I feel like Bugs Bunny.
This is neat.

894
01:05:13,058 --> 01:05:15,754
Here come the Bobbsey twins.

895
01:05:17,195 --> 01:05:19,288
You're pretty agile there,
twinkle toes.

896
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:22,196
I'm goin' out for the ballet
when I get back.

897
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,564
You learn another
line of work up here.

898
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,968
And while you're
bouncing around there,

899
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:30,337
you might keep your eye out
for a nearby crater.

900
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:37,514
Ah, rats. I been on my knees
twice to get that.

901
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,019
- John.
- Yes, sir?

902
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:46,579
You are black
from the knees down.

903
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:50,822
No way to avoid it. That's why I'm glad
the pressure suit bends.

904
01:05:50,929 --> 01:05:53,762
John, you are filthy.

905
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:57,858
I'll tell you, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

906
01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:01,029
Hey, here's a rock they'll
be glad to see in Houston.

907
01:06:02,841 --> 01:06:06,174
Man, Tony, you don't know
how much fun this has been.

908
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:09,213
We concur, John.

909
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,082
Having gotten away from the spacecraft,

910
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:17,655
I was able to really realize...

911
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:21,317
what this place was like
that we had landed in.

912
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:27,661
I had tried to anticipate
what it would be like for many years,

913
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:31,759
but it was obvious that there was no way
one could have anticipated...

914
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,567
what it would be like to stand
in the valley of Taurus Litterol,

915
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:39,508
a place deeper than the Grand Canyon
and equally as spectacular,

916
01:06:39,611 --> 01:06:42,307
and see this brilliantly
illuminated landscape...

917
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:46,714
with a brighter sun than anyone
had ever stood in before,

918
01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:49,286
with a blacker-than-black sky,

919
01:06:49,387 --> 01:06:53,050
and then to top the whole scene off,
in this blacker-than-black sky...

920
01:06:53,158 --> 01:06:55,888
was a beautiful,
brilliantly illuminated...

921
01:06:55,994 --> 01:06:59,020
blue marble
that we call the earth.

922
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:02,999
The path of evolution is now
in space as much as on Earth.

923
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:08,035
Man has shown
that as a species...

924
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,007
mankind was willing
to commit itself...

925
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:14,738
to living in environments that
were completely different...

926
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:18,009
than those in which
the species evolved.

927
01:07:18,116 --> 01:07:20,778
We put a shield of life
around ourselves...

928
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:23,855
in order to protect
the life within,

929
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:26,549
but the willingness
to go out there is there.

930
01:07:26,658 --> 01:07:28,558
We've shown that.

931
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,652
The curve of human evolution
has been bent.

932
01:07:31,763 --> 01:07:34,197
Okay, it's time to load up right now.

933
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:36,961
We're on our way again, Tony.

934
01:07:37,068 --> 01:07:41,232
We'd like you to drive
gingerly up to the ALSEP area there.

935
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,239
Okay, we'll go on up.

936
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:45,332
You want to go right or left?

937
01:07:45,443 --> 01:07:47,741
We want to head...
Just keep going west.

938
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:49,814
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hook a left.

939
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:52,577
You gotta expect trouble
from backseat drivers.

940
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,675
Okay, we copy that, John.

941
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:57,516
Look at this baby. I'm really
getting confidence in it now.

942
01:07:57,622 --> 01:07:59,647
This back wheel's off the ground.

943
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:02,318
Charlie, whatever you do,
don't hit that brake.

944
01:08:02,427 --> 01:08:04,691
The Grand Prix drivers are at it again.

945
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:06,821
This is about the neatest
thing I ever saw.

946
01:08:06,932 --> 01:08:08,661
It's back to the LM,
right, Tony?

947
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:10,257
You bet your life.

948
01:08:10,368 --> 01:08:13,269
And you're well ahead
on the time line.

949
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:16,272
We must've forgotten
something. That's all I can say.

950
01:08:16,374 --> 01:08:18,274
Well, everything's running.

951
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:20,844
We're just about to start
upslope here.

952
01:08:20,946 --> 01:08:22,846
Have we been climbing, John?

953
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:26,076
Look at that pitch meter.
It's pegged out high.

954
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:28,209
Yeah, we have been climbing.

955
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,447
Tony, we've really...

956
01:08:30,555 --> 01:08:34,355
It doesn't feel like we're climbing, but
we've been climbing for a while here.

957
01:08:34,459 --> 01:08:39,021
We're going up a steep, steep
slope, John. I'll tell you.

958
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:41,291
Look at that, Charlie.

959
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,299
I don't see. What? What?

960
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:44,959
Well, I'll be doggoned.

961
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,628
Look at that!

962
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,639
You said you were gonna see
some other tracks on the moon.

963
01:08:49,741 --> 01:08:51,641
I knew it.

964
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:55,775
We're going back down
our tracks, Tony.

965
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,712
Okay, good show.

966
01:08:57,816 --> 01:09:00,284
There she is, John.

967
01:09:00,385 --> 01:09:02,979
Somebody up there likes us.

968
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:05,488
Don't run into our home.

969
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:14,127
I felt like I was an alien
as I travelled through space.

970
01:09:14,232 --> 01:09:18,100
But when I got on the moon,
I didn't feel that at all.

971
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:23,106
I felt at home there, even though
the earth was a long ways away.

972
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:27,304
We could see it directly above,
about the size of a marble...

973
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:31,974
and realize that we were there
but by the grace of God.

974
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:36,078
I felt like I was at the end
of a thin cord...

975
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:38,553
that could be cut
at any time.

976
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:42,218
It was precarious,
but yet I felt comfortable.

977
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,599
I felt something other than
what we can visually sense.

978
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:56,202
A spiritual presence was there.

979
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:03,979
Perhaps it was because so many people on
the earth were focusing their attention.

980
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:07,415
They were maybe sending signals
to us somehow.

981
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:12,322
I sensed,
I guess in a way,

982
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:17,521
much like maybe the first man
on the earth would have sensed...

983
01:10:17,629 --> 01:10:20,792
like Adam or perhaps Eve...

984
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:24,198
as they were standing on the earth
and they realized they were all alone.

985
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:26,361
There was no one else
on the earth,

986
01:10:26,471 --> 01:10:29,463
but yet they had
that special communication.

987
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:32,668
And I guess it was similar
to the feeling I had...

988
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:35,041
when I realized
that Dave Scott and I...

989
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:38,479
were the only two
on this vast planet.

990
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:42,075
Another world.
We were the only two there.

991
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:45,384
We felt an unseen love.

992
01:10:47,325 --> 01:10:49,225
We were not alone.

993
01:10:58,069 --> 01:10:59,468
Hi, big guy.

994
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:02,369
Hi there, Charlie.

995
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:23,052
Bob, this is Gene,
and I'm on the surface.

996
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:26,392
And as I take man's
last step from the surface,

997
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:28,898
in everlasting commemoration...

998
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,969
of what the real meaning
of Apollo is to the world,

999
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,436
we'd like to uncover a plaque...

1000
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:37,167
that has been on the leg
of our spacecraft...

1001
01:11:37,275 --> 01:11:42,042
that we have climbed down
many times over the last three days.

1002
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:53,156
The words are...

1003
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:57,820
"Here man completed his first
exploration of the moon.

1004
01:11:57,929 --> 01:12:01,262
"May the spirit of peace
in which we came...

1005
01:12:01,366 --> 01:12:05,132
"be reflected in the lives...

1006
01:12:05,236 --> 01:12:07,864
of all mankind. "

1007
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:20,882
Some 7 minutes,
22 seconds away from ignition...

1008
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:24,386
on the LM ascent
back into lunar orbit.

1009
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:27,083
- Capcom.
- Go.

1010
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:28,784
- Surgeon.
- Go.

1011
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:30,224
- G and C.
- Go.

1012
01:12:30,328 --> 01:12:31,727
- Fido.
- Go.

1013
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:35,231
AFD. Oh, we don't have
an AFD. FAO?

1014
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,324
Network. Recovery.

1015
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:40,632
Capcom, we're go for liftoff.

1016
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:44,767
Tranquility Base, Houston.
You're cleared for takeoff.

1017
01:12:44,876 --> 01:12:48,039
Roger. Understand.
We're number one on the runway.

1018
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:51,949
The moon is different.

1019
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:57,920
It's become man's first outpost,
our first footstep in space.

1020
01:12:58,022 --> 01:13:01,219
Where man was able to look back
at the earth and see the earth,

1021
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:04,921
and see himself
in a different perspective.

1022
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:09,365
Six, five, four,

1023
01:13:09,467 --> 01:13:13,665
three, two, one, ignition.

1024
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:26,807
As you leave, you're leaving
this unbelievably beautiful...

1025
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:31,446
naked charcoal ball
out there in space.

1026
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:34,491
And you've been around the moon.
You've been on it.

1027
01:13:34,592 --> 01:13:36,651
You're seeing something
that's familiar to you.

1028
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:38,820
That's home.
That's where we lived.

1029
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,091
There's where we left
the lunar rover.

1030
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,167
There's the mountains
and the valleys.

1031
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:46,795
It has, in a sense, been a home,
a life-sustaining home for you.

1032
01:13:46,905 --> 01:13:49,806
And when you leave it
and you see those things,

1033
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:52,672
you leave it with the same kind
of feeling and awe...

1034
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:56,338
that you left the earth with
several days earlier.

1035
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:42,719
When we were about 30 minutes
from rendezvous with the module,

1036
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:46,228
Pete said to me,
"You want to fly this thing?"

1037
01:14:46,331 --> 01:14:48,993
And I said,
"Well, yeah, I'd like to fly. "

1038
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,500
As I took the controls,
I said, "Wait a minute.

1039
01:14:51,603 --> 01:14:54,902
The people on Earth in Mission
Control aren't gonna like this. "

1040
01:14:55,006 --> 01:14:58,100
And to show how he thinks
about things, he said,

1041
01:14:58,209 --> 01:15:02,373
"Don't worry. We're on the back side
of the moon. They'll never know. "

1042
01:15:50,995 --> 01:15:53,486
Houston. You're looking good.

1043
01:15:53,598 --> 01:15:57,227
Roger, Houston.
We are returning to the earth. Over.

1044
01:15:57,335 --> 01:16:00,099
Glad to have you
on the way back home.

1045
01:16:01,973 --> 01:16:04,305
I think I must have the feeling...

1046
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:07,537
that the travellers on the old
sailing ships used to have.

1047
01:16:07,645 --> 01:16:10,239
You've gone on a very long
voyage away from home,

1048
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:12,612
and now we're headed back.

1049
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:22,787
I have that feeling of being
proud of the trip...

1050
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:26,796
but still happy to be going back
home and back to our home port.

1051
01:16:51,222 --> 01:16:54,020
We set sail on this new sea...

1052
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:57,322
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...

1053
01:16:57,428 --> 01:16:59,658
and new rights to be won,

1054
01:16:59,764 --> 01:17:04,565
and they must be won and used
for the progress of all mankind.

1055
01:17:31,562 --> 01:17:33,689
As time goes on, I truly believe

1056
01:17:33,798 --> 01:17:36,596
that you are able to pull out
of the subconscious...

1057
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:39,636
a great many things
that you absorbed...

1058
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:43,400
in those moments while you were
there looking back at the earth.

1059
01:17:43,508 --> 01:17:46,534
And I can almost transform
my body, certainly my mind,

1060
01:17:46,644 --> 01:17:50,580
through time and space instantaneously
to that spot on the moon.

1061
01:17:50,681 --> 01:17:53,514
I know where I am
when I look at the moon.

1062
01:17:53,618 --> 01:17:56,849
It's not just some abstract,
romantic idea.

1063
01:17:56,954 --> 01:17:59,787
