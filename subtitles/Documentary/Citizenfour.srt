1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:24,640


2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,770

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,170

4
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,970
"Laura,

5
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,180
at this stage, I can offer nothing more than my word.

6
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm a senior government employee in the intelligence community

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,710
I hope you understand that contacting you is extremely high risk

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,130
and you are willing to agree to the following precautions

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,780
before I share more.

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,760
This will not be a waste of your time.

11
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,060
The following sounds complex,

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,510
but should only take minutes to complete for someone technical.

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,700
I would like to confirm out of email
that the keys we exchanged were not intercepted

14
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,150
and replaced by your surveillants.

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,530
Please confirm that no one
has ever had a copy of your private key

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,680
and that it uses a strong passphrase.

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,350
Assume your adversary is capable
of one trillion guesses per second.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 01:31:47,060


19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,110
If the device you store the private key
and enter your passphrase on

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,450
has been hacked,

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,810
it is trivial to decrypt our communications.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 01:28:51,870


23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,370
Understand that the above steps
are not bullet proof,

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,700
and are intended only to give us breathing room.

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,130
In the end if you publish the source material,

26
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,130
I will likely be immediately implicated.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,860
This must not deter you from releasing
the information I will provide.

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,850
Thank you, and be careful.

29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,800
Citizen Four"

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,210
Radio: ... surveillance means that there are facts

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,960
under the law to apply to

32
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,500
if we should take away the surveillance

33
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,910
there are no facts the government could manufacture

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,580
- Oh, that's right
and it's all about creating an independent record

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,300
- To me this goes to the question

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
of independently verifying

37
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:41,700


38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,330
what the government is doing.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,500


40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,600


41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,040
That's why I keep going
back to that question.

42
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,150
- So, that was David Suruda. 
After CBS News traffic and weather...

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,180
Hey, can you hear me?

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,980
I am here David, how are you?

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,150


46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,560
Well, I would just point...

47
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,720
start by pointing to (what) Barack Obama 
himself said about those questions

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,630
when he was running for
the office that he now occupies.

49
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,190
On December 2007 he said 
"The president does not have

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,410
the power under the Constitution to
unilaterally authorize a military attack

51
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,830
in a situation that does not involve stopping
an actual or imminent threat to the nation".

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,430
So by Obama's own words, the president doesn't
have the power that he is now exercising

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,130
under the Constitution.

54
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,570
And as far of why it matters,
in... on August 1st 2007

55
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,130
when he laid out his reasons
why he was running for office

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,970
and why he thought it was so important
to change the way we were doing things

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,020
he said

58
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,480
"No more ignoring the law
when it's inconvenient,

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,100
that is not who we are.

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,070
We will again set an example for the world
that the law is not subject 

61
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,560
to the whims of stubborn rulers."

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,410
- So to allow presidents to simply
start wars on their own without any...

63
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:07,140


64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,900


65
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,090


66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,860


67
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,490


68
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,060


69
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,910


70
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,880


71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,240
For now, know that every border you cross, every purchase you make,

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,460
every call you dial, every cell phone tower you pass,

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,870
friend you keep, article you write,

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,530
site you visit, subject line you type,

75
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,400
and packet you route,

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,030
is in the hands of a system 
whose reach is unlimited

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,260
but whose safeguards are not.

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,450
Your victimisation by the NSA system means 
that you are well aware

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,570
of the threat 
that unrestricted secret police pose

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,600
for democracies.

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,080
This is a story few, but you, can tell.

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:19,050


83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:52,730


84
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,900
Thank you for inviting me here,

85
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,390
to give me the opportunity to express my story.

86
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,160
But let me give you some of my background.

87
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,740
I spent about 4 years in the military and then I went to NSA directly, so...

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,860
so I ended up with about 37 years of service combined.

89
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,610
Most of it was a lot of fun!
I tell you, it was really a lot of fun,

90
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,910
breaking these puzzles.

91
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,750
You know, solving problems
and things like that.

92
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,820
So, and that's really what I did.

93
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,240
Fundamentally started working with data,
looking at data and datasystems

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,490
and how you do that.

95
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,600
I was developing this concept of analysis
where you could lay it out in such a way

96
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,850
that it could be coded and executed electronically.
Meaning you could automate analysis.

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,700
And it has to do with metadata
and using metadata relationships.

98
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,540
So that was the whole,
that was my whole theme there at NSA

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,950
that was eventually what I ended up to,
I was the only one there doing that, by the way.

100
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,190


101
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,470
So any rate, you know, 9/11 happened.

102
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,630
And it must have been right after.

103
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,180
A few days, no more than a week after 9/11

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,110
that they decided to begin actively spying on everyone in this country.

105
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,730
And they wanted that back part of our program to run all the spying.

106
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,420
So that's that's exactly what they did.

107
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,930
And then they started taking the telecom data,

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,730
and expanded after that.

109
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,100
So, I mean, the one I knew was AT&T,

110
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,380
and that one provided
320 million records every day.

111
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,320
That program was reauthorized every 45 days by the,

112
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,430
what I call the "Yes Committee"

113
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,330
which way Hayden, and Tenet, and the DOJ,

114
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,490
that program was called STELLARWIND.

115
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,490
So first I went to the
House Intelligence Committee,

116
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,560
and the staff member I personally knew there

117
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,630
and she then went to the Chairman
of that Committee, Nancy Pelosi,

118
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,960
who was the Minority Rep.

119
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,720
They were all briefed in to
the program at the time, by the way,

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,660
and all the other programs that were going on,

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,500
including all those CIA programs.

122
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,270
I wasn't alone in this,
there were four others out of NSA,

123
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,720
we were all trying to work interally
in the government over these years

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,650
trying to get them to come around,
to being constitutionally acceptable,

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,210
and take it in to the courts
and have the courts' oversight of it too.

126
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,060
So we naïvely kept thinking
that that could, that could happen,

127
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,640
and it never did.

128
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,410
But any rate after that
and all the stuff we were doing

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,490
they decided to raid us
to keep us quiet,

130
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,990
threaten us, you know.

131
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,990
So we were raided simultaneously,
four of us.

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,100
In my case they came in
with guns drawn,

133
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,220
I don't know why they did that,
but they did. So....

134
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:59,380


135
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
"Laura,

136
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,420
I will answer what I remember

137
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,480
of your questions as best I can.

138
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,070
Forgive the lack of structure, I am not a writer,

139
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,320
and I have to draft this in a great hurry.

140
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,280
What you know as STELLARWIND has grown,

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,580
SSO,

142
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,590
the expanded Special Source Operations that took over STELLARWIND's share

143
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,830
of the pie

144
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,560
has spread all over the world

145
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,640
to practically include

146
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,660
comprehensive coverage of the United States.

147
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,600
Disturbingly, the amount of US communication

148
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,800
ingested by NSA is still increasing.

149
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,240
Publicly,

150
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,000
we complain that things are going dark,

151
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,260
but in fact our accesses are improving.

152
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,370
The truth is that the NSA has never

153
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,180
in its history

154
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,560
collected more than it does now.

155
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,730
I know the location of most 
domestic interception points,

156
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,230
and that the largest 
telecommunication companies in the US

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,380
are betraying the trust of their customers,

158
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,980
which I can prove.

159
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,530
We are building the greatest weapon 
for oppression in the history of Man.

160
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,700
Yet its directors 
exempt themselves from accountability.

161
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,540
NSA director Keith Alexander 
lied to Congress,

162
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,230
which I can prove.

163
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,860
Billions of US communications 
are being intercepted.

164
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
In gathering evidence of wrongdoing

165
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,510
I focused on the wronging 
of the American people,

166
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,090
but believe me when I say that 
the surveillance we live under

167
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,310
is the highest privilege 
compared to how we treat

168
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,960
the rest of the world,

169
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,410
this I can also prove.

170
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,100
On cyberoperations 
the government's public position

171
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,050
is that we still lack a policy framework.

172
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,360
This too is a lie.

173
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,180
There is a detailed policy framework,

174
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,870
a kind of martial law for Cyber Operations

175
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,740
created by the White House.

176
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,100
It's called "Presidential Policy Directive 20"

177
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,970
and was finalized at the end of last year.

178
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,370
This I can also prove.

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,250
I appreciate your concern for my safety,

180
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,620
but I already know how this will end for me,

181
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,280
and I accept the risk.

182
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,550
If I have luck, and you are careful,

183
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,270
you will have everything you need.

184
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,660
I ask only that you ensure

185
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,730
this information makes it home 
to the American public.

186
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Does the NSA routinely intercept 
American citizen's emails?

187
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,220
No.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,310


189
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,830
Does the NSA intercept Americans' 
cell phone conversations.

190
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,990
No.

191
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Google searches?

192
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,440
No.

193
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,850
Text messages?

194
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,700
No.

195
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,790
Amazon.com orders?

196
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,030
Nope

197
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,080
Bank records?

198
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,880
No.

199
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,250
What judicial consent is required for NSA

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,130
to intercept communications

201
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,580
and information 
involving American citizens?

202
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,920
Within the United States 
that would be the FBI lead.

203
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,050
If it was a foreign actor in the United states

204
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,570
the FBI would still have the lead 
and could work that with NSA

205
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,360
or other intelligence 
agencies as authorized.

206
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,890
But to conduct that kind

207
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,770
of collection within the United states

208
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,950
it would have to go through a court order.

209
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,520
And the court would have to authorize it.

210
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,750
We are not authorized to do it,

211
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,540
nor do we do it.

212
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,480
All rise.

213
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,030
The United States Court of Appeals

214
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,200
for the Ninth Circuit is now in session.

215
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,940


216
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,600
Please be seated.

217
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,660


218
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,500
Good morning and welcome 
to the Ninth Circuit.

219
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,310
The first case for argument is 
Jewell vs. National Security Agency.

220
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,030
You may proceed.

221
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,360
May it please the Court, 
Kevin Bankston for Carolyn Jewell

222
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,450
and her fellow plaintiff appellants 
in Jewell vs. NSA.

223
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,040
- Your Honors,

224
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,930
plaintiffs have specifically 
alleged that their own communications

225
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,170
and communications records have been 
acquired by the government.

226
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,170
But the District Court found that 
we failed to allege facts

227
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,510
that differentiated the injury 
of our plaintiffs sufferred

228
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,090
from the injury suffered 
by every other AT&T user

229
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,050
whose communications and records 
have been acquired by the government.

230
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,580
Basically concluding that so long as 
every one is being surveilled,

231
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,850
no one has standing to sue.

232
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,000
However to deny standing to persons 
who are injured simply because

233
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,870
many others are also injured 
would mean that the most injurious

234
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,810
and widespread government actions 
could be questioned by nobody.

235
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,640
- Do they have anything concrete 
that in fact a specific communication

236
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,930
of your client was intercepted?

237
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,260
- We have evidence that all 
the communications passing

238
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,920
between AT&T's network and other networks 
in their Northern California facility

239
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,380
have been intercepted, 
so that would necessarily include

240
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,200
the Internet communications of 
our Northern California plaintiffs.

241
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,870
- Okay, thank you.

242
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,030
- Thank you, your honor

243
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,460
- May it please the Court,

244
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm Thomas Byron from 
the Department of Justice

245
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,470
here on behalf of 
the Government defendants.

246
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,310
We think this litigation 
need not be resolved in Federal Court.

247
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,590
In light of the oversight 
of the political branches

248
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,650
both Legislative and Executive,

249
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,980
which provides a better opportunity 
for oversight and resolution

250
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,570
of the concerns raised 
concerning nationwide policies

251
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,540
of alleged surveillance 
in these complaints.

252
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,120
- Even if it's revealed 
that one or more of the plaintiffs

253
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,780
had email or telephone conversations 
intercepted that had nothing to do

254
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,480
with the national security?

255
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
- Your honor, I don't know 
that anyone necessarily

256
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,030
would have standing to raise
the particular claims that issue

257
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,830
in these 2 cases.

258
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,760
We think instead that the kinds of claims
that issue here against these defendants

259
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,550
are those that are 
better suited to resolution

260
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,440
before the representative branches 
of our government...

261
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,840
- What role... would the Judiciary have 
if your.. approach is adopted...

262
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,290
- Judge Peterson, I think the...

263
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,760
- I mean, we just get out of the way, is that it?

264
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,190
- Well, Judge Peterson, what I think 
is that there is a narrow category,

265
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
subset of cases in which 
it may be appropriate

266
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,440
to step aside
for that narrow category of cases.

267
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,070
- But mmm... the Judiciary plays a role...

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,340
- To be sure, Judge Peterson....

269
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
- ...in our system.

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,820
- Yes Your Honor and we don't mean to diminish that.

271
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,510
-  You're asking us to abdicate that role

272
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,230
- No, Your Honor,

273
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,110
but it is a question of this court's discretion
whether to reach that issue.

274
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,230
We do think that there is simply
no way for the litigation to proceed

275
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,750
without risk of divulging 
those very questions of privileged information

276
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,410
that would cause, 
as Director of National Intelligence

277
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,820
has explained,

278
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,950
exceptionally great damage to 
National Security's disclose.

279
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,770
Thanks for having me.

280
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,870
Hum, if anybody has any questions,
like I said just..

281
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,690
Basically just raise your hand 
and I'll try to call on you

282
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,200
as soon as I possibly can.

283
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,790
So, who here actually feels like 
they are under surveillance,

284
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,720
pretty regularly?

285
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,310
Everyone inside of Occupy.

286
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,120
How many people here have been arrested

287
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,210
and at their Court date had
their phone taken into the back room?

288
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,790
How many people here
had their retina scanned?

289
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,090
Wow.

290
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,540
So you guys are actually, in a sense, 
the canaries in the coal mine,

291
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,490
right,

292
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,460
because the incentives 
are all lined up against you.

293
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,520
Anybody see how the subway link 
your metro card to your debit card,

294
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,360
right? And, like, auto refill.

295
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,970
This is a concept which is key 
to everything we'll talk about today.

296
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,460
And it's called linkability.

297
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,500
Take one piece of data 
and link it to another piece of data.

298
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,920
So for example,

299
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,290
if you have your metro card 
and you have your debit card,

300
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,390
you have those things 
and you can draw a line between them right?

301
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,360
So that's, like, not a scary thing.

302
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,880
Except your bank card is tied 
to everything else that you do during the day.

303
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,060
So now they know where you're going, 
when you make purchases.

304
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,060
So when they decide to target you, 
they can actually recreate your exact steps.

305
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,410
With a metro card and with a credit card alone.

306
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,450
Like literally where you go and what you buy

307
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,440
and potentially by linking that data with other people

308
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,650
on similar travel plans,

309
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,960
they can figure out who you 
talk to and who you met with.

310
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,240
When you then take cellphone data, 
which logs your location

311
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:32,660
and you link up purchasing data, 
metro card data and your debit card.

312
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,160
You start to get what you could call metadata,

313
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,190
an aggregate over a person's life.

314
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,200
And metadata, an aggregate, is content.

315
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,100
It tells a story about you,

316
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,270
which is made up of facts, 
but is not necessarily true.

317
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,290
So for example, just because 
you were on the corner,

318
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,000
and all these data points point to it, 
it doesn't mean you committed the crime.

319
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,910
So it's important to note

320
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,150
that if someone has a perception 
of you having done a thing,

321
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,730
it will  now follow you 
for the rest of your life.

322
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,640
So just keep in mind that 
what happens to you guys for example

323
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,620
with fingerprints, and retinal scans, and photographs.

324
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,910
That is what is going to happen 
to people in the future

325
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,050
when they resist policy changes 
and when they try to protest

326
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,720
in a totally constitutionally protected way.

327
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,710
This is for you, Director Clapper, again on the surveillance front.

328
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:22,800


329
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,520
And I hope we can do this in just a yes or no answer,

330
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,820
because I know Senator Feinstein wants to move on.

331
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,290
- So, does the NSA collect any type of data at all,

332
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,500
on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans ?

333
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,810
- No sir.

334
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,510
- It does not?

335
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,990
- Not wittingly.

336
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,320
There are cases where they could inadvertently,

337
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,400
perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.

338
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:57,500


339
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,330
Email from April 2013

340
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,110
The encrypted archive

341
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,880
should be available to you within seven days.

342
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,900
The key will follow when everything else is done.

343
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,990
The material provided,

344
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,090
and investigative effort required 
will be too much for any one person.

345
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,640
I recommend at a very minimum 
you involve Glen Greenwald.

346
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,790
I believe you know him.

347
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,020
The plaintext of the payload

348
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,050
will include my true name details 
for the record.

349
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,100
Though it will be your decision

350
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,330
as to whether or how 
to declare my involvement.

351
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,780
My personal desire is that you 
paint the target directly on my back.

352
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,320
No one, not even my most trusted confidant, 
is aware of my intentions

353
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,250
and it would not be fair for them 
to fall under suspicion for my actions.

354
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,420
You may be the only one 
who can prevent that,

355
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,230
and that is by immediately 
nailing me to the cross

356
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,450
rather than trying 
to protect me as a source.

357
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,470
On timing, regarding 
meeting up in Hong Kong,

358
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,650
the first rendezvous attempt 
will be at 10 A.M. local time

359
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,780
on Monday.

360
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,340
We will meet in the hallway outside of the restaurant

361
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,090
in the Mira Hotel.

362
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,270
I will be working on a Rubik's cube

363
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,750
so that you can identify me.

364
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,910
Approach me and ask if I know the hours of the restaurant.

365
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,490
I'll respond by stating that I'm not sure

366
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,310
and suggest you try the lounge instead.

367
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,500
I'll offer to show you where it is, and at that point we're good.

368
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,510
You simply need to follow naturally.

369
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,210


370
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,840


371
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,750
As far as positioning I mean

372
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,060
if you want us to sit in any particular way or whatever.

373
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,090
You know, I'm gonna go there just like we get better light.

374
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:32,630


375
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,040
There is, you know, so many different

376
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,430
enormous stories

377
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,870
just that are kind of standalone stories

378
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,920
that, even like you know certain things on my individual document

379
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,120
that can just be their own story

380
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,430
and I just want to start turning those stories out.

381
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,510
I basically woke up this morning and I already started writing stories

382
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,030
hum so I'm hoping to, you know,

383
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,580
start publishing within like a day or two days.

384
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,640
- OK

385
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,180
it's as long as you're good with that

386
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,940
- Yeah

387
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,820
and so as far as I...

388
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,200
the stuff we have to talk about,

389
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,510
I mean I'm kind of like

390
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,080
dichotomizing it between,

391
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,400
you know, stuff that I'd like 
to talk you about,

392
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,260
in terms of like the documents 
and the content.

393
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,000
Laura has a bunch of questions 
about that as well.

394
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,780
So while we're working through 
the documents getting your take-on,

395
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,610
a lot of the stuff that, you know,

396
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,260
help me understand it better, 
but then also the sort of You story, right...

397
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,150
like the <i>who you are</>?

398
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,820
- Yeah

399
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,960
what you've done, why you've 
done what you've done

400
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,310
- Yeah

401
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,020
and I'd love to do that first

402
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,420
- OK

403
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,520
in part because, you are 
the only one who can do that

404
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,200
- Yeah

405
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,740
so I'd like to just get it done 
so let it's done,

406
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,650
and also because, you know, 
it might be that you wanna do that early

407
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,480
- Yeah

408
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,490
because, it might be necessary, 
we might choose to have that done early.

409
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,570
What are you... tell me your thoughts, 
just where you are with that?

410
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,930
- So primary one on that, 
I think I've expressed it

411
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
a couple times online,

412
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,230
is I feel the modern media 
has a big focus on personalities.

413
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,260
- Totally

414
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,970
- And I'm a little concerned (that)
the more we focus on that

415
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,060
the more they're going 
to use that as a distraction.

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,360
I don't necessarily want that to happen, 
which is why I've consistently said, you know,

417
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm not the story here, 
hum haha, nervous uh?

418
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,470
- No it's a very very cheap pen, I just, the slider is broke, 
go ahead.

419
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,270
- Hum, but hum, yeah, anything I can do 
to help you guys get this out,

420
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,610
I will do,

421
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,440
I don't have any experience 
with media, with how this works

422
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,610
so I'm kind of learning as I go.

423
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,590
Right, so, I just want to get a sense of 
why did you decide to do what you've done.

424
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,160
So for me it all comes down to 
State Power against the people's ability

425
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,980
to meaningfully oppose that power.

426
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,790
And I'm sitting there everyday,

427
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,690
getting payed to design methods 
to amplify that State Power.

428
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,010
And I'm realizing that if, you know, 
the policy switches,

429
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,000
that there are the only things that restrains 
these states, were changed,

430
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,880
there, you couldn't meaningfully 
oppose these.

431
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,220
I mean, you have to be the most 
incredibly sophisticated ta* col* actor in existence.

432
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,150
I'm not sure there's anybody, 
no matter how gifted you are,

433
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,700
who could oppose all of the 
offices and all the bright people

434
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,500
even all the mediocre people out there 
with all of their tools and all of their capabilities.

435
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,860
And as I saw the promise 
of the Obama administration

436
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,270
be betrayed and walk away from it. 
In fact, actually advance

437
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,240
the things that had been promised 
to be sort of curtailed and rained in

438
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,080
and dialed back.

439
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,620
It actually gets worse,
particularly drone strikes.

440
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,100
Which I also learned in NSA,

441
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,310
we could watch drone videos 
from our desktops,

442
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,120
as I saw that, that really hardened me to action.

443
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,350
- In real time?

444
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,730
- In real time, yeah,

445
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,560
it'll stream a lower quality 
of the video to your desktop,

446
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
typically you'd be watching surveillance drones
as opposed to actually letting you know,

447
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,070
murder drones really going out there 
and bomb somebody.

448
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,530
But you'll have a drone 
that's just following somebody's house

449
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,080
for hours and hours.

450
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,090
And you won't know who it is because, you know,

451
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,570
you don't have the context for that 
but it's just a page

452
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,820
where it's lists 
and lists of drone feeds

453
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,770
and all these different countries 
with all these different code names

454
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,180
and you can just click 
on which one you want to see.

455
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,870
- Right, so if your self interest 
is to live in a world in which

456
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,140
there's maximum privacy,

457
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,870
doing something that could 
put you into prison,

458
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,970
in which your privacy is completely destroyed 
is sort of the antithesis of that,

459
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,220
how did you reach the point where 
that was a worthwhile calculation for you?

460
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,170
- I remember what the Internet was like 
before it was being watched.

461
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,210
And there has never been anything 
in the history of man like it.

462
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,920
I mean you could have children 
from one part of the world

463
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,290
having an equal discussion,

464
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,870
where you know they were sort of granted

465
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,870
the same respect 
for their ideas and conversation,

466
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,250
with experts in the field 
from another part of the world

467
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,820
on any topic, anywhere, 
anytime, all the time.

468
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,640
And it was free and unrestrained.

469
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,910
And we've seen the chilling of that, 
the cooling of that and the changing

470
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,350
of that model towards something 
which people self police their own views.

471
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,420
And they literally make 
their own jokes on ending up on the list

472
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,890
if they donate to a political cause 
or if they say something in a discussion.

473
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,080
And it has become an expectation that we're being watched.

474
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,620
Many people I've talked to have mentioned 
that they're careful about what they type

475
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,340
into search engines.

476
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
Because they know that it's being recorded.

477
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,410
And that limits the boundaries 
of their intellectual exploration.

478
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,020
And I'm more willing to risk

479
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,660
imprisonment

480
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,890
or any other negative outcome personally

481
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,620
than I am willing to risk

482
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,480
the curtailment of my intellectual freedom

483
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,800
and that of those around me,

484
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,770
whom I care for equally as I do for myself.

485
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,970
And again that's not to say that I'm self sacrificing

486
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,210
because it gives me, I feel good,

487
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,160
in my human experience

488
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,400
to know that I can contribute to the good of others.

489
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,080


490
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,060


491
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,030
- Could you elaborate on that?

492
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,240
- So, I don't know how much the programs 
and the actual technical capacities

493
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,850
everybody's talked to you about 
but there is an infrastructure in place

494
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,940
in the United States 
and world wide that NSA has built

495
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,620
in cooperation with 
other governments as well,

496
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,360
that intercepts

497
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,720
basically every

498
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,730
digital communication,

499
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,050
every radio communication,

500
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,300
every analog communication

501
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,920
that it has sensors in place to detect.

502
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,670
And with these capabilities,

503
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,670
basically the vast majority

504
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,430
of human

505
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,360
and computer to computer communications,

506
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,840
device-based communication,

507
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,420
which that sort of then forms 
the relationships between humans,

508
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,650
are automatically ingested 
without targeting.

509
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,520
And that allows individuals 
to retroactively

510
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,900
search your communications 
based on self certifications.

511
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,830
So for example, if I wanted 
to see the content

512
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,080
of your email or,

513
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,130
you know, your wife's phone calls

514
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,010
or anything like that.

515
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,310
All I have to do is use 
what's called a selector.

516
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,730
Any kind of thing

517
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,020
in the communication's chain

518
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,510
that might uniquely or almost uniquely

519
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,480
identify you as an individual.

520
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,580
And I'm talking about 
things like email addresses,

521
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,340
IP addresses, phone numbers,

522
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,590
credit cards,

523
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,420
even passwords

524
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,210
that are unique to you, 
that aren't used by anyone else.

525
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,540
I can input those into the system

526
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,030
and it will not only go 
back through the database

527
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,050
and go 
"have I seen this anywhere in the past?",

528
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,770
it will basically put an 
additional level of scrutiny on it

529
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,080
moving into the future that says

530
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,030
"if this is detected now 
or at anytime in the future,

531
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,800
I want this to go to me immediately" 
and alert me in real time

532
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,580
that you're communicating 
with someone,

533
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,500
things like that.

534
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,190
- So I don't know who you are 
or anything about you.

535
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:18,260
- Ok. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton, 
defense contractor.

536
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,860
I am sort of on loan to NSA, 
I don't talk to Booz Allen boss,

537
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,340
I don't get tasking from Booz Allen, 
it's all from NSA.

538
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,270
- So, I don't know your name.

539
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,000
- Oh, sorry, my name is Edward Snowden,

540
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,730
I go by Ed.

541
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,220
Edward Joseph Snowden is the full name.

542
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,580
(spelling) S. N. O. W. D. E. N..

543
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,070
- And where are you from ?

544
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,810
- I'm originally...
I was born in North Carolina,

545
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,000
small town, Elizabeth City.

546
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,160
There is a Coast Guard station there,

547
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,700
I'm from a military family.

548
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,630
But I spent most of my time 
growing up around Fort Meade in Maryland.

549
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,490
- And your family, 
what's the consequences for them?

550
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,080
- This is actually 
what has made this hardest.

551
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,960
My family doesn't know 
what's happening, they're unaware.

552
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,230
I don't think I'll be able 
to keep the family ties

553
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,420
that I've had for all my life

554
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,080
because of the risk of 
associating them with this.

555
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,280
And I'll leave what to publish 
and what not to publish to you guys,

556
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:38,680
I trust you'll be responsible on this. 
But basically, the closer I stay to my family,

557
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,030
the more likely they are 
to be leaned on.

558
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,450
- So you don't want me to report this?

559
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,540
- We dont have ... I mean, 
we definitely want to do

560
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,330
whatever we can not to 
include them or bring them into the mix

561
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,870
- Oh I'm sorry that's fine, I won't...

562
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,570
- I'm sorry I'm going to interrupt you.

563
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,430
Can we just stop for a second, 
do the document and then go back to that?

564
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,130
- What do I need? Do I need 
an email address that we're using or...

565
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,670
- Well you can send... Once you've encrypted it, 
you can send it from whatever you think is appropriate.

566
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,370
The main thing is 
you've got to encapsulate all of this

567
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,800
in a way that it can't be 
decrypted and read

568
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,760
once it's in transit across the 
network or on either of the end points.

569
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,500
- Ok I mean just  so you know 
these documents are basically all going

570
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,990
to be uploaded within like 48 hours.

571
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,670
- This is simply..

572
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,100
You want to get in the process 
of doing this for everything because

573
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,370
it seems hard but it's not hard, 
this is super easy.

574
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,030
- Ok so just walk me through it.

575
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,550
- Ok. Show me the actual folder structure 
where these files are first.

576
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,120
- How many documents 
did you say there were?

577
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,750
- Seven

578
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,630
- Ok well, while you're working...

579
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,560
- Ok go ahead

580
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,020
- How many documents are we talking about?

581
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,160
Because in The Guardian,

582
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,170
that Wikileaks, technical people

583
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,940
set up a system

584
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,530
so that they were available 
for anybody to see

585
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,490
and I just wonder if it's 
possible to do the same thing.

586
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,410
- That would be the ideal end game.

587
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,430
But because some of these documents 
are legitimately classified

588
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,400
in ways that could cause harm 
to people and methods.

589
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm comfortable in my 
technical ability to protect them.

590
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,610
I mean you could literally 
shoot me or torture me

591
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,290
and I could not disclose 
the password, if I wanted to.

592
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,730
I have the sophistication to do that.

593
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,990
There are some journalists
that I think could do that,

594
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,340
but there are a number 
of them that couldn't.

595
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,520
But the question becomes,

596
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,770
can an organization

597
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,900
actually control that information

598
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,470
in that manner

599
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,550
without risking basically 
an uncontrolled disclosure?

600
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,800
But I do agree with that, honestly

601
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,100
I don't want to be 
the person making the decisions

602
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,130
on what should be public 
and what shouldn't.

603
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,590
Which is why rather than 
publishing these on my own,

604
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,680
or putting them out openly, 
I'm running them through journalists.

605
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,420
So that my bias, and my things,

606
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,200
because clearly 
I have some strongly held views,

607
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,460
are removed from that equation

608
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,340
and the public interest is being 
represented in the most responsible manner.

609
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,100
- Yeah.

610
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:22,750
- Actually given your sort of... 
Geographic familiarity

611
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,410
with the U.K and whatnot.

612
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:32,860
I'd like to point out that 
GCHQ has probably the most invasive...

613
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,980
- I know 
- network intercept program anywhere in the world.

614
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,450
It's called TEMPORA, 
(spelling) T. E. M. P. O. R. A.

615
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,500
and it's the world's first "full take", 
they call it, and that means 

616
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,100
content in addition to metadata

617
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,730
on everything.

618
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,930
- So this is what I'd like to do 
just in term of scheduling

619
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,690
if it's good with everybody else. 
Are you feeling you're done?

620
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,090
- Yeah yeah I'm done.

621
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,270
- So, I'm anxious to go back,

622
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,860
get those articles done

623
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,010
and then there is a 
bunch of documents

624
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,980
that aren't about those first two or three stories 
that I'd like to spend time with you...

625
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,900
- Sure yeah

626
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,010
- ...kinda going over.

627
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,610
- I'm not going anywhere.

628
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,160
- You're available? 
You want to check your book first?

629
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,950
- Let me check my schedule.

630
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,040
- Is that good for you Laura? 
You want to...

631
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,270
- It's great.
- OK

632
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,520


633
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,720


634
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,220
- Hello

635
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,750
- Yes

636
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,570
- My meal was great thank you very much

637
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,940
- No I still have some left and I think 
I'm gonna be eating it later

638
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,930
so you can just leave me alone for now.

639
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,440
- Ok great thank you so much, have a good one bye.

640
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,940
Let's fix that real quick.

641
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,880
So another fun thing I was telling 
Laura about this:

642
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,910
all these new VOIP phones

643
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,400
they have little computers in them

644
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,890
and you can hot mike these 
over the network,

645
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,200
all the time even when 
the receiver's down so...

646
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,840
as long as it's plugged in

647
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,020
it can be listening on.

648
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,010
And I haven't even considered 
that earlier. But yeah...

649
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,880
- OK.

650
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,770
- There are so many ways... This could be...

651
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,160
Everything that's in here 
is pretty much gonna be

652
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,860
on the public record at some point.

653
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,330
We should operate on that.

654
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,220
- Yeah. Yeah, I think... 
I think we are...

655
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,590
- So, do you have your 
air gapped machine with you?

656
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,730
- I do, I do.

657
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,030
- Let me pop that out.

658
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,050
- Do you have an 
understanding or commitment on

659
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,650
when you guys are gonna 
to press for the first stories?

660
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,550
- It's very seven or eight 
in the morning in London.

661
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,200
- Uh uh, OK.

662
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,440
Oh, let's see here.

663
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,830
Ok, hey look there's another one.

664
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:10,260
Pro tip, let's not leave the same SD cards
in our laptops forever in the future.

665
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,520
- Did you know this was still 
kicking around in your laptop?

666
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,640
- Yeah, I mean that was the... mmh...

667
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,770
- OK, just to make it sure.

668
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,270
- OK, yeah. This is it?

669
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,680
- Yeah.

670
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,410
- OK.

671
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,260
- Right there.

672
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,310
- Thanks. You will have a new one 
who will look exactly identical

673
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,840
but it's a different archive. 
So you might want to take 
a sharpie to it or something.

674
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,400
Could you pass me my 
magic mantle of power?

675
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,060
- Uh uh...

676
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,530
Is that about possibility of overhead?

677
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:53,950
- Visual. yes, 
Visual collection.

678
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,700
I don't think at this point 
there is anything in this regards

679
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,700
that would shock us.

680
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,830
We become pretty... 
Ewen you once said before,

681
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,330
he's like, he's like: 
I'm never leaving my room,

682
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,490
I'm never leaving anything 
in my room again.

683
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,540
And the single machine...
I was like

684
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,280
you've been infected by the paranoia bug, 
happens to all of us.

685
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,260
He was like...
I would never leave a single of these device,

686
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,440
and I would never leave my and again alone.

687
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,290
- My bag's getting heavier and heavier

688
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,290
- Exactly

689
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,840
Alright, I'm gonna need you to enter

690
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,410
your root password 'cause 
I don't know what it is.

691
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,660
If you wanna use this 
you're more than welcome, so uh ..

692
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,660
- OK, looks like your root 
password's not 4 caracters long anyway.

693
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,970
- it's usually a lot longer 
but that's just like a one time only thing, right?

694
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,870
- So, it is uh...

695
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,300
- It had been a lot longer but ever since 
I knew is that it was a one time only session,

696
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,790
I've been making it shorter. Is that not good?

697
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,700
- It's actually not. I was expressing this 
with Laura either.

698
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,340
The issue is because of the fact 
it's got a hardware MAC address

699
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,370
and things like that,

700
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,130
and if people are able to identify 
your machine and they're able to...

701
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,310
- This is the fact you're about 
to break the most upsetting story?

702
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,620
- Yeah, that's true.

703
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,240
- So they might kinda prioritize

704
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,600
- It's ten letters I type very quickly. 
Actually it's ten letters but...

705
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,670
- So ten letters would be good 
if they had to bruteforce the entire key space.

706
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,070
That would still probably only take 
a couple of days for NSA. Uh...

707
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,470
That's a fire alarm, OK...

708
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,810
- hopefully this just sounds like a 3 seconds test 
or is this...

709
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,960
Do you wanna to call the desk and ask? It's fine.

710
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,780
- Yeah, I don't think it's an issue, 
but it's interesting that I just.

711
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,070
- did that happen before?

712
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,400
- Maybe they got mad cause they couldn't listen 
into us through the phone anymore.

713
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,880
- Has the fire alarm gone off before?

714
00:39:50,240 --> 00:40:00,040
- No that's the first time that has happened. 
Let me... so just in case they have like an alert 
that goes to...    That's unusual...

715
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,450
- We probably...

716
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,270
- We might have to evacuate.

717
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,900
- Should we ignore that, I don't know?

718
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,650
- It's not continuous.

719
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,160
- It's not continuous. 
No, I'm just saying if it continues...

720
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,110
- And then we come and 
meet the guys down in the lobby.

721
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,390
- Yeah, alright.

722
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,860
- Yeah.

723
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,540
- Yeah let's, let's leave for now 
when we'll have finished this up.

724
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,320
Not that they're gonna answer 'cause 
they probably have seven thousands calls.

725
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,690
- Yeah.

726
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,190
- Hi, we hear a loud buzzing on the tenth flour.

727
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,660
Can you tell us what that is?

728
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,900
Ah, OK.

729
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,500
OK, great.

730
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,900
Thank you, bye.

731
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,540
Fire alarm testing, maintenance.

732
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,530
- Yes. that's good, 
that's what I wanted to hear.

733
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:11,640
- Nice of them to... 
Nice of them to let us know 
about it in advance.

734
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,430
Uhm, I just wanna give you 
kind of a quick tour, uh..

735
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,870
when Laura was looking at this 
she was kind of salivating...

736
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,150
and couldn't stop like 
actually reading these documents

737
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,260
- Right, right. 
So we'll try and restrain ourselves

738
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,910
although I don't promise 
that it will succeed.

739
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,510
- I just wanna kinda explain 
a brief overview

740
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,060
of what these are 
and how they're organized.

741
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,400
On the beginning of 
document of interest,

742
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,090
the primary purposes of the second archive 
is to bring the focus over to

743
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,400
SSO as opposed to PRISM.

744
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,970
This is in general. 
SSO are the Special Source Operations.

745
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,750
This is the world wide 
passive collection on networks

746
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,610
they're both domestic to the US 
and international.

747
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,150
There's a lot of 
different ways they do it

748
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,210
but, uh corporate partnerships 
are one of the primary things,

749
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,560
they do domestically 
they also do this for multinationals

750
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,020
that might be headquarted 
in the US so they can kinda coerce

751
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,240
or just pay into giving them access.

752
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,720
And they also do bilaterally 
with the assistance of certain governments.

753
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,930
And that's based on the premise that they go

754
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,490
"All right, we'll help you set the system up 
if you give us all the data from it".

755
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,090
Hum, there's... there's a lot more here

756
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,510
than any one person 
or probably one team could do.

757
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,660
- Right

758
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,790
Hum, XKEYSCORE Deep Dive.

759
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,500
XKEYSCORE in general, and there's 
a huge folder of documentation

760
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
on XKEYSCORE and how it works,

761
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,490
is the front-end system 
that analysts use

762
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,830
for querying that sort of ocean of raw singing
that I was telling you about.

763
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,170
All that stuff where you can sort of 
do the retroactive searches,

764
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,320
live searches, get flagging, what not.

765
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,440
XKEYSCORE is the front-end for that.

766
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,980
I'm just gonna show you one slide here, 
'cause Laura thought it was valuable

767
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,590
on this talk on kinda 
how these capabilities ramp up

768
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,260
in sophistication over time.

769
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,020
This is kinda nice.

770
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,230
As of fiscal year 2011, they could monitor

771
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,040
1 billion telephones and internet sessions simultanously,

772
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,870
per one of these devices,

773
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,210
and they can collect at a rate of 125 Gigabytes a second,

774
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,090
which is a Terabit per second.

775
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,210
- That's for each one of these?

776
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,790
- That's for each one of these, yeah.

777
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,440
- How many TUMULT missions would that be then?

778
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,980
- Part of this, back then there were 20 sites,

779
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,250
there's ten at DOD installations.

780
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,220
But these are all outdated, we've expanded pretty rapidly.

781
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,960
But still 20 sites, that's at least 20 billion.

782
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,450
- This all need to get out. 
You know what I mean, it's like...

783
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:43,510
Just in terms of understanding, 
the capabilities, it's so opaque.

784
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,040
- It's not science fiction. 
This stuff is happening right now.

785
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,420
- No, that's what I mean, it's like... 
The magnitude of it,

786
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:53,490
and like this a pretty inaccessible 
technical document.

787
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,190
But, even this it's really chilling, 
you know what I mean?

788
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,210
Yeah, I mean, we should be having debates

789
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,410
about whether we want Government

790
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,250
I mean this is massive and extraordinary. 
It's amazing...

791
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,840
Even though you know it...
Even though you know that...

792
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,780
to see it like the physical blueprints of it

793
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,930
and sort of the technical expressions of it,

794
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,210
brutally hits home like...
in a super visceral way that is so needed.

795
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,810


796
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,080

<font color="#FFFF00">blanket access to millions of 
Verizon customer's records</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">on a daily basis.</font>

802
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,610
<font color="#FFFF00">Earlier I had the chance to 
conduct the first TV interview</font>

803
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,150
<font color="#FFFF00">with the reporter 
who broke this story wide open,</font>

804
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,920
<font color="#FFFF00">Glenn Greenwald, of The Guardian.</font>

805
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,920
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations on the scoop!</font>

806
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,190
<font color="#FFFF00">Explain for our viewers 
why this is important?</font>

807
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,510
<font color="#FFFF00">It's important because people have understood</font>

808
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,280
<font color="#FFFF00">that the law that this was done under, 
which is the Patriot Act</font>

809
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,120
<font color="#FFFF00">enacted in the wake of 9/11.</font>

810
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,980
<font color="#FFFF00">Was a law that allowed the government 
very broad powers to get records</font>

811
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,560
<font color="#FFFF00">about people with a lower level of suspicion 
and probable cause to traditional standards.</font>

812
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,930
<font color="#FFFF00">So it has always been assumed 
that under the Patriot Act,</font>

813
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,350
<font color="#FFFF00">if the government had even any suspicion 
that you where involved</font>

814
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,770
<font color="#FFFF00">in a crime or terrorism, 
they could get a lot of information about you.</font>

815
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,000
<font color="#FFFF00">What this court order does 
that makes it so striking</font>

816
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,920
<font color="#FFFF00">is that it's not directed at any individuals 
who they believe or have suspicion of</font>

817
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,450
<font color="#FFFF00">committing crime or a part of 
a terrorist organization.</font>

818
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,480
<font color="#FFFF00">It's collecting the phone records of 
every single customer of Verizon business</font>

819
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,000
<font color="#FFFF00">and finding out every single call 
that they've made internationally and locally.

820
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,890
<font color="#FFFF00">So it's indiscriminant and it's sweeping.
It's a Government program designed</font>

821
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,900
<font color="#FFFF00">to collect information about all Americans</font>

822
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,460
<font color="#FFFF00">not just people 
where they believe there is reason to think</font>

823
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,740
<font color="#FFFF00">they've done anything wrong.</font>

824
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,710


825
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,030
It's a tough situation

826
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,490
You know hearing that

827
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,560
the person that you love 
that you've spent the decade with

828
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,710
may not be coming back.

829
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,780
- What did they ask her?

830
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,410
- Hum... When was the last time she saw me?

831
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,880
Where am I?

832
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,660
What am I doing?

833
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,740
Hum.. you know.

834
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,800
What does she know about my illness?

835
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,320
Things like that.

836
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,580
So yeah they're pretty solidly aware.

837
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,760
Cause she's...

838
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,920
I'm clearly not at home ill.

839
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,690
- Hello, hello

840
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,100
- Hello, let me disconnect 
from the Internet.

841
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,150
- So there is some news?

842
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,280
- Yes there was indeed some news.

843
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,800
- I have config today, I think, 
maybe just a few hours ago.

844
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,530
- What kind of people does it...?

845
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:23,920
- An HR lady I'm assuming from NSA 
as opposed to Booz Allen.

846
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,950
Because she has was accompanied by a police officer

847
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,300
which mean the NSA police 
and they're planning to break into my house

848
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,140
which regular police don't do.

849
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,840
- Does she lives there?

850
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:37,200
- Yeah she lives there so I told her to cooperate fully

851
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,260
I can't find my phone just one second.

852
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,800
and don't worry about herself

853
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,200
You know what I gonna do, 
I'll just take out the stuff I want to use.

854
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:44,430
- OK

855
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,790
- OK well look I mean this is not a surprise at all.

856
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,000
- Not yeah I know I planned for it but it's just you know 
when it's impacting

857
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,400
and when they're talking to you 
it's a little bit different.

858
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,350
- Absolutely

859
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,640
- But it's possible that they just noticed 
that you're missing

860
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,140
I guess it's not really possible.

861
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:06,260
- It is but yeah they're I mean

862
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,340
Hum... let me just get rid of this.

863
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,310
So I obviously was focused on other things 
than appearance this morning.

864
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,430
- How was she? How does she reacted? 
Was she relatively calm about it?

865
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,810
- She's relatively calm.

866
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,680
- Does she know anything about what you're doing?

867
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,010
- She has, she has no idea

868
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,050
and that's I mean I feel badly about that

869
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,090
but that's the only way I could think of where

870
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,540
like she can't be in trouble.

871
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,400
- Did you just basically do a 
"I have to go somewhere for reasons

872
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,250
that I can't tell you about" kind of thing?

873
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,640
- I just disappeared when she was on vacation

874
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,270
and I left a note saying

875
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,520
"Hey I'm gonna be away for a while for work"

876
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,760
which isn't unusual for me in my business

877
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,820
- Right

878
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:51,640
you know so

879
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,120
- OK so let me ask a couple things just quickly.

880
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,550
Are they gonna be able to go into your stuff 
and figure out what you took?

881
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,960
- Hum in some kind of some sort of like 
peripheral sense but not necessarily

882
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,110
- Yes because I cast such a wide net

883
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,400
I they do that the only thing they're gonna do 
is they're gonna have a heart attack

884
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,460
because they're gonna go 
"He had access to everything"

885
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,180
- Yeah

886
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,630
and they not gonna know what 
specifically has been done.

887
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,740
I think they're gonna start to actually feel a little better

888
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,570
although they're not gonna be wild about this in any case.

889
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,040
When they see that the stories are kind of cleaving to a trend

890
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,230
you know it's not like

891
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,440
"Here is the list of everybody who works everywhere"

892
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,460
- Right

893
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,370
- I also think you know there're gonna be 
paranoid in the extreme

894
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,520
and assuming all kind of 
worst case scenarios

895
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,510
which is gonna you know I think

896
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:47,050
make them react in ways that probably aren't like 
gonna be particularly

897
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,380
rational on their part

898
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,130
but at the same time there's... 
I do think they're limited

899
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,470
for the moment.

900
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,940
- I agree and I mean, 
I had kind of time to set a stage where

901
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,420
we all enjoy at least a minimum 
level of protection you know

902
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,210
no matter who we are who's involved in this 
you know you're either a journalist

903
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,040
- Right

904
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,530
or you're either out of jurisdiction

905
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,240
so we have some time to play this 
before they can really get nasty.

906
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,730
I think it's over you know the weeks 
when they have times to get lawyers,

907
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,420
really sort of go

908
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,290
"This is a special situation 
how can we interpret this to our advantage?"

909
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,210
like we seen them do this all the time you know

910
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,980
whether it's drones or wiretapping 
or whatever they'll go.

911
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,460
Well according to this law 
from the 1840's you know

912
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,910
- Yeah yeah of course

913
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:27,840
we can apply x, y to the Authority.

914
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,040
But that takes time and that takes agreement.

915
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,080
Yeah and also you know I mean I think

916
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,790
the more public we are out there 
to like as journalists

917
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,060
and the more protection 
it's gonna give as well.

918
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,680
- Have you started to give thoughts 
to when you're ready to come forward?

919
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:48,930
- I'm ready whenever huh honestly 
I think there is sort of an agreement

920
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,600
that it's not going to bias 
the reporting process.

921
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,810
That's my primary concern at this point.

922
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,590
I don't want to get myself into the issue 
before it's gonna happen anyway

923
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,610
and where it takes away 
for the stories that are getting out.

924
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,870
We're talking about tens of millions 
of Americans

925
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,750


926
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,560
who weren't suspected of doing anything

927
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,690
who were surveilled in this way.

928
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:54,420


929
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,280
...thoughts for a moment, I want to 
continue this conversation,

930
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,100
these are really important sensitive issues

931
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,670
and the public out there has the right 
to know what's going on... Stand by...

932
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,520
<font color="#FFFF00">This is CNN breaking news</font>

933
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,320
<font color="#FFFF00">Another explosive article has just appeared 
this time in the Washington Post</font>

934
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:06,880
<font color="#FFFF00">it's breaking news and it reveals another 
broad and secret US government surveillance program.</font>

935
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,150
<font color="#FFFF00">The Washington Post and The Guardian in London
reporting that the NSA and the FBI</font>

936
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,570
<font color="#FFFF00">are tapping directly into the 
central servers of nine leading Internet companies</font>

937
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:23,620
<font color="#FFFF00">including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, 
Facebook, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.</font>

938
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,330
<font color="#FFFF00">Reports says they're extracting audio, 
video, photographs, e-mails, documents</font>

939
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:34,490
<font color="#FFFF00">and connection logs that enable analysts
to track a person's movements and context over time.</font>

940
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,900
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's discuss this latest revelation 
that coming out fast,</font>

941
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,680
<font color="#FFFF00">Bill Binney, the formal official of the NSA</font>

942
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,810
<font color="#FFFF00">who quit back in 2001, you were angry about 
what was going on</font>

943
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,910
<font color="#FFFF00">you've been known as 
a whistleblower right now.</font>

944
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,090
<font color="#FFFF00">- Bill, what do you think about 
this Washington Post story?</font>

945
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,560
<font color="#FFFF00">- Well, I assume it's just the continuation 
of what they've been doing all along.</font>

946
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,700
<font color="#FFFF00">- So you're not surprised?</font>

947
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,760
<font color="#FFFF00">- No</font>

948
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,490
<font color="#FFFF00">- Do you have any idea who's leaking this information?</font>

949
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,590
<font color="#FFFF00">- I don't know who leaked this,</font>

950
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,960
<font color="#FFFF00">I have no doubt that the administration will 
launch an investigation</font>

951
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,000
<font color="#FFFF00">not into who approved these programs 
but into who leaked the information.</font>

952
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,050
I'm not shocked they come to denying it, I don't assume that...

953
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,270
- Do you believe it?

954
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,600
<font color="#FFFF00">- There're maybe some technical basis on which 
they can say that we are not</font>

955
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:20,090
<font color="#FFFF00">actively collaborating or they don't have 
what we consider in our definition</font>

956
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,500
<font color="#FFFF00">to be direct access to our servers 
but what I do know is that I've talked to</font>

957
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,610
<font color="#FFFF00">more that one person</font>

958
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,510
<font color="#FFFF00">who has sat at a desk at a web portal 
and typed out commands</font>

959
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,420
<font color="#FFFF00">and reached into those servers 
from a distance.</font>

960
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,190
<font color="#FFFF00">So, whatever they want to call that, 
that's what's happening.</font>

961
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,580
Hold on, what are we calling the 
single biggest infringement on American civil liberties

962
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,550
probably of all time, isn't it?

963
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:47,030
<font color="#FFFF00">- ...we already have the New York Times now today
saying that the Administration has lost all credibility.</font>

964
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,200
<font color="#FFFF00">- The New York Times slammed 
President Obama for this</font>

965
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,590
<font color="#FFFF00">and frankly I was used to that</font>

966
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,060
<font color="#FFFF00">the New York Times used to slam George Bush
for protecting the country for the steps he took.</font>

967
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,720
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want us to drop our guard.</font>

968
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,900
I don't want us to be struck again as we saw in Boston,

969
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,160
I understand,

970
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,290
<font color="#FFFF00">people are willing to sacrifice their 
civil liberties, people are sheltered inside which is enough...</font>

971
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,850
- How can you believe in freedom, do you see?

972
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,920
I mean try and play the devil's advocate for me, 
when you have secret courts,

973
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:13,670
secret operations like PRISM, secret investigations which go into

974
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,090
every spit and cough of every American's lives without any Member 
of the American public

975
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,090
knowing about it. That's not freedom is it?

976
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,350
<font color="#FFFF00">- In 2008, they eliminated the 
warrant requirement for all conversations</font>

977
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,340
<font color="#FFFF00">except ones that takes place 
by and among Americans</font>

978
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,460
exclusively on America's soil.

979
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,780
So they don't need warrants now for people 
who are foreigners

980
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,130
outside of the US but they also don't need 
warrants for Americans

981
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,480
who are in the United States 
communicating with people

982
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,050
reasonably believed to be 
outside of the US.

983
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,110
So again, the fact that there are no checks, 
no oversight about who's looking over the NSA's shoulder,

984
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,080
means that they can take whatever they want 
and the fact that it's all behind a wall

985
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,490
of secrecy and they threaten people 
who want to expose it

986
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,900
means that whatever they're doing 
even violating the law

987
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,830
is something we're unlikely to know 
until we start having real investigations

988
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,770
and real transparency into 
what it is the government is doing.

989
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,670
<font color="#FFFF00">Glenn Greenwald, congratulations again 
on exposing what is a true scandal,</font>

990
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,130
I appreciate you joining me.

991
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:02,260
Hey I just heard from Lindsay and huh... 
she's still alive, which is good and free.

992
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,190
My rent checks apparently are no longer 
getting through to my landlord

993
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,700
so they said if we don't pay them 
in five days we will be evicted,

994
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,260
which is strange because I got a system 
set up that automatically pays them.

995
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,580
So there is that apparently there is 
construction trucks all over the street

996
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:31,250
of my house, so that's, I wonder 
what they're looking for.

997
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:18,180
It is... It is an unusual feeling 
that's kind of hard to...

998
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,760
hard to like, describe or convey in words 
but not knowing what's gonna happen

999
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,040
in the next days, the next hour 
or the next week

1000
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:31,310
it's scary but at the same time 
it's liberating, you know,

1001
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,960
the planning comes a lot easier 
because you don't have

1002
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,260
that many variables to take into plate, 
you can only act, and then act again.

1003
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,800
Now all these phone calls 
are being recorded digitally

1004
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,670
not for content but 
for origin and destination

1005
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,820
now word the government is going right into 
the servers of these large Internet companies.

1006
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,580
- How does the government politically speaking 
make the argument that this is essential

1007
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,420
to National Security and not 
a dramatic overreach

1008
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,370
in terms of personal privacy?

1009
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,670
- It's difficult Matt, because 
as Peter was pointing out, overnight

1010
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,470
we had an extraordinary late night 
close to midnight announcement

1011
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,180
and a declassification from the 
Director of National Intelligence.

1012
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,390
They are scrambling, the Administration is 
already supported strongly by leaders

1013
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,760
in both parties from the 
Intelligence Committees.

1014
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,620
GCHQ has an internal Wikipedia at the top secret
you know, super classified level

1015
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,850
where anybody working intelligence 
can work on anything they want.

1016
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,400
That's what this is, I'm giving it to you, 
you can make the decision on that what's appropriate what's not.

1017
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,550
Hum it's gonna be documents of, 
you know, different types,

1018
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,740
pictures and Power Points and Word documents.
Stuff like that ...

1019
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,540
- Sorry can I take that seat?

1020
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,750
- Yeah

1021
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,860
- Sorry, I'm sorry I've got used to repeat, 
so in these documents, they will show...

1022
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,790
- Yeah there will be 
a couple more documents on that,

1023
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,990
that's only one part though, 
like it talks about Tempora

1024
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,780
and a little more thing 
that's the wiki article itself.

1025
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:59,750
It was also talking about a self-developed tool 
called UDAQ U.D.A.Q. it's their search tool

1026
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,340
for all the stuff they collect 
was what it looked like.

1027
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,030
- Yeah

1028
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,040
- Hum it's gonna be projects, 
it's gonna be troubleshooting pages

1029
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,580
for a particular tool.

1030
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,510
- Thanks

1031
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,000
- And, the next step, 
when do you think you'll go public?

1032
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,350
- Arh... I think it's pretty soon, 
I mean, with the reaction, this escalated more quickly,

1033
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,400
I think pretty much as soon as they 
start trying to make this about me

1034
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,130
which should be any day now.

1035
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:23,980
- Yeah

1036
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:29,660
- Hum I'll come out just to go hey, 
you know, this is not a question of

1037
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,000
somebody skulking around in the shadows. 
These are public issues,

1038
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,180
these are not my issues 
you know these are everybody's issues,

1039
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,150
I'm not afraid of you, you know, 
you're not gonna bully me in the silence

1040
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,180
like you've done to everybody else

1041
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,230
and if no body else is gonna do it I will

1042
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,500
and hopefully when I'm gone 
whatever you do to me,

1043
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,680
there will be somebody else 
who will do the same thing.

1044
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,910
It will be the sort of Internet principle 
you know, of the Hydra:

1045
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,860
you can stop one person 
but there is gonna be seven more of us.

1046
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,140
- Yeah

1047
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,960
Are you getting more nervous?

1048
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:11,680
- I mean...  no. I think the way 
I look at stress... particularly because

1049
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,500
I sort of knew this was coming...
because I sort of volunteered to walk into it.

1050
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:26,140
I'm already sort of familiar with the idea.

1051
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,410
I'm not worried about it.

1052
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,680
When somebody like 
busts in the door suddenly

1053
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,250
I'll get nervous and it'll affect me
but until they do, you know...

1054
01:01:30,000 --> 00:42:33,720


1055
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,980
- Yeah, yeah.

1056
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,630
But until they do umm... you know.

1057
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,840
I'm eating a little less 
that's the only difference I think.

1058
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,140
- Let's talk about the issue with when we're gonna say 
who you are.

1059
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:49,900
- Yeah

1060
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,920
- This is, you know, you have to talk me through this 
because I have a big worry about this.

1061
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:55,930
- OK tell me

1062
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,510
- Which is that...
if we come out and

1063
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:05,120
I know that you believe 
that your detection is inevitable

1064
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,240
and that it's inevitable imminently.

1065
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,400
There is, you know, in the New York Times 
today Charlie Savage the fascinating

1066
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,650
Sherlock Holmes of political reporting deduced that

1067
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,480
the fact that there has been these leaks in succession

1068
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,110
probably means that there's some one person 
that decided to leak...

1069
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,470
- Somebody else quoted you saying 
it was one of your readers

1070
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,280
- Yeah

1071
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,890
- And somebody else is putting on things

1072
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,100
- Yeah so you know, I mean it's fine 
I want people to, I wanted to be like

1073
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,940
- Yeah

1074
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,880
- You know like this is a person, 
I want to start introducing the concept of

1075
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,510
this is a person who has a particular set 
of political objectives

1076
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,770
about informing the world about 
what's taking place.

1077
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,480
Like you know, 
I'm keeping it all anonymous totally

1078
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,270
but I want to start introducing you 
in that kind of incremental way.

1079
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,610
But here's the thing.

1080
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,790
What I'm concerned about it 
that if come out and say

1081
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,160
here's who this is, here's what he did 
the whole thing

1082
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,220
that we talked about.

1083
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,670
Then we're gonna basically be doing 
the government's work for them

1084
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,070
and we're gonna basically be handing them 
you know a confession

1085
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,100
and helping them identify who find it.

1086
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,390
I mean maybe you're right, 
maybe they'll find out quickly

1087
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,100
and maybe they'll know but is there 
any possible idea that they won't?

1088
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,670
Are we kind of giving them stuff 
that we don't...? Or...

1089
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:17,030
- It's possible that they already know 
but they don't want to reveal

1090
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,240
it because they don't know...

1091
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,790
- Or that they don't know 
and we're gonna be telling them like

1092
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,200
is it a possibility that 
they're gonna need like 2 3 months or uncertainty

1093
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,210
and we're gonna be 
solving their problem for them?

1094
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,890
or let me just say the or part 
maybe it doesn't matter to you,

1095
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,870
maybe you want it, maybe, I mean,

1096
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,930
you're not coming out because

1097
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,030
you think inevitably 
they're gonna catch you

1098
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:38,610
and you want to do it first,

1099
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,960
you're coming out because 
you want to fucking come out and...

1100
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,210
- Oh there is that, 
I mean that's the thing,

1101
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,640
I don't want to hide on this 
and skulk around,

1102
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,260
I don't think I should have to

1103
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,690
obviously there is circumstances 
that are saying that.

1104
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,620
I think it is powerful 
to come out and be like

1105
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,550
look I'm not afraid and I don't think 
other people should either,

1106
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,590
you know, I was sitting 
in the office right next to you last week,

1107
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,400
we all have a stake in this, 
this is our country

1108
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,530
and the balance of power 
between the citizenry and the government

1109
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,450
is becoming that 
of the ruling and the ruled

1110
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,390
as opposed to actually, you know, 
the elected and the electorate.

1111
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,750
- OK so that's what I need to hear, 
that this is not about...

1112
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:21,020
- But I do want to say, 
I don't think there is a case

1113
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,370
that I'm not gonna be discovered, 
in the fullness of time.

1114
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,010
It's just a question of time for me.

1115
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,730
You're right, it could take them 
a long time, I don't think it will

1116
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:32,370
but I didn't try to hide the footprint 
because again I intended to come forward.

1117
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,130
- OK I'm gonna post this morning 
just a general defense of whistleblowers

1118
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,570
and you in particular 
without saying anything about you.

1119
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,920
I'm gonna go post 
that right when I get back

1120
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,690
and I'm also doing like a big fuck you 
to all the people who keep like talking

1121
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,990
about investigations like that. 
I want that to be like...

1122
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,690
the fearlessness and the fuck you to like 
the bullying tactics,

1123
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,990
has go to be completely preventing 
every thing we do.

1124
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,850
- I think that's brilliant. 
I mean your principles on this I love,

1125
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:03,530
I can't support them enough because it is, 
it's inverting the model

1126
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,000
of the government has laid out 
where people where trying to,

1127
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,880
you know, say the truth, skulk around, 
and then hide in the dark,

1128
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,390
and then quote anonymously. 
I say yes, fuck that, let's just...

1129
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,430
- OK, so here is the plan then, 
I mean, and this is a thing, it's like

1130
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:19,970
once, I think we all just felt the fact 
that this is the right way to do it.

1131
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,530
You feel the power of your choice, 
you know what I mean,

1132
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:26,280
it's like I want that power 
to be felt in the world.

1133
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,080
- OK

1134
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:30,500
- and it is the... 
it's the ultimate standing up to them

1135
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,890
right like I'm not gonna fucking hide 
even for one second,

1136
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,590
I'm gonna get right in your face,

1137
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:39,290
you don't have to investigate, 
there's nothing to investigate,

1138
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,900
here I am!

1139
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,550
You know, and I think that 
is just incredibly powerful,

1140
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,660
and then the question just becomes

1141
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,250
how do we do this in the right, 
you know the perfect way,

1142
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,320
that's my burden and 
that's what I'm gonna spend...

1143
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,650
So today it's gonna be 
this story in the morning,

1144
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,880
assuming that 
it doesn't change in The Guardian,

1145
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,230
it's gonna be this story in the morning,

1146
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,320
just to keep the mental going, 
just to keep like the disclosures coming.

1147
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,430
A big one at night, now it's becoming like

1148
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,230
"OK, this is a major leak"

1149
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,760
and after today when we post 
the two stuff things that we're gonna post.

1150
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:14,890
It's gonna be 
"what the fuck is this leak and who did it?"

1151
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,230
I guarantee you.

1152
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:28,410
I just want to make sure, 
move over slightly...

1153
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,920
- Do you want me to move 
a little move over...

1154
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,700
- I just wanna move... all right

1155
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,870
- OK

1156
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:36,730
- We are ready

1157
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,150
- So let's us begin with some basic

1158
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:39,550
background information like

1159
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:40,850
just state your name,

1160
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,400
what position you held 
in intelligence community

1161
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,700
and how long you worked 
within that community

1162
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,620
- OK, uh... just some... 
how are we going, like,

1163
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,970
in depth or 
are we going like in general,

1164
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,030
like I'm currently 
an infrastructure analyst, you know,

1165
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,690
Booz Allen Hamilton, 
not going through my whole back story

1166
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:57,520
- Yes

1167
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,330
- OK,

1168
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,560
- Just like summary kind of

1169
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,420
- OK

1170
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,540
- My Name is Ed Snowden, 
I'm 29 years old,

1171
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:07,570
I work for Booz Allen Hamilton 
as an infrastructure analyst

1172
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,050
for NSA in Hawaii.

1173
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,980
- And what are some of the positions 
that you held previously

1174
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,760
within the intelligence community?

1175
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:19,370
- I've been a system engineer, 
system administrator, uh...

1176
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:25,740
senior advisor, uh... 
for the, Central Intelligence Agency,

1177
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:29,620
solutions consultant and a 
telecommunications information

1178
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,580
systems officer.

1179
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,880
- And what kind of clearances have... 
have you held,

1180
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,280
what kinda classification?

1181
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,270
- Uh... Top secret,

1182
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,590
So, people in my levels of access 
for systems administration

1183
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:50,550
or as a infrastructure analyst 
typically have higher accesses

1184
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,100
than an NSA employee would normally have.

1185
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,370
Normal NSA employees have a 
combination of clearances called

1186
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:01,580
TS SI TK and Gamma.

1187
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,880
Uh, that's a Top Secret Signals 
Intelligence Talent Keyhole

1188
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,180
and Gamma.

1189
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:12,080
And they all relate to certain things 
that are sort of core to the NSA mission.

1190
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,040
As a systems administrator 
you get a special clearance

1191
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,750
called PrivAcc 
for Privileged Access,

1192
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,940
which allows you to be exposed 
to informations of any classification

1193
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:26,060
regardless of what 
your position actually needs.

1194
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:48,680
Monday

1195
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,590
June 10, 2013

1196
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,880
Just before we go, 
a remind of our top story,

1197
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,240
and that's the full map, 
CIA typically worked at Edward Snowden

1198
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,860
says he's responsible for leaking information 
that US authorities have been monitoring

1199
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,250
phone and Internet data.

1200
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,500
The US justice deparment confirmed 
it is the first stages

1201
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:20,010
of a criminal investigation.

1202
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,560
- Leave it long or got it shorter, 
what do you think?

1203
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,770
As far as the video the people saw. 
Am I less identifiable now?

1204
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:26,550
- lose it?

1205
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:30,240
- lose it? Cause I can't go 
all the way down, it's still gonna be stubble.

1206
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,730
I don't have the blade for closer.

1207
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:37,390
- Will you be talking 
to any other media about this story today?

1208
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:38,930
- I am.

1209
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,280
- Uh, will you be coming to our office

1210
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,300
- ... about where is Snowden now, what his plans are?

1211
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,510
- No, I won't talk about that, 
so unless you have any other questions...

1212
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,210
- OK

1213
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,750
- What are you plans please? 
Are you staying in Hong Kong

1214
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:52,760
for a the time being?

1215
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:53,740
- For a little while.

1216
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:56,580
- And do you have any hopes 
to write more about this story

1217
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,980
or are you stopping 
new writing about this story?

1218
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,330
- No, I'm gonna continue 
to write about it.

1219
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,560
- Have you had any pressure 
from the US Authorities

1220
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,260
about continuing to report on this?

1221
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,160
- No.

1222
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,720
- And have you heard anything about 
what could be...

1223
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:11,750
asked you the Hong Kong Authorities 
towards this case,

1224
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:15,090
whether they contacted you or asked you 
anything about the whereabouts of Snowden

1225
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,040
and whether that's just another...

1226
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,290
- I haven't heard about 
the Authorities of any Government.

1227
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,950
- And do, where do you think 
this story is going then?

1228
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,290
For you and of course for Snowden 
and of course for the US media

1229
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,910
and the US Administration in general?

1230
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,610
- Uh, for me, I'm gonna continue to report.

1231
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:36,740
Reporting on what the Government has been doing 
and what I think people should know about.

1232
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,310
As for him I don't think anyone knows

1233
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:45,570
... people come after me or any of their third partners 
you know they work closely with a number of other nations

1234
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,580
or you know they could pay off the trial 
you know any of their agents are assets ...

1235
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:32,800
A criminal investigation the whistleblower... 
monitoring phone calls and Internet data goes public...

1236
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:38,100
Security forces in Afghanistan 
say a number of...

1237
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,440
Now it's time for our news paper review 
and looking at what's making headlines

1238
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,950
around the world.

1239
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,810
Let's start with The Guardian our top story 
which is revealing the identity of the former CIA employee.

1240
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:57,630
The paper says he leaks information exposing the scale 
of American's surveillance of the Internet.

1241
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,130
Edward Snowden, 
what a great story...

1242
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,050
Well I think it's a fantastic story this could be 
straight out from a John Le Carré novel

1243
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,920
I mean when you read what he did, 
yes he got the material,

1244
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:13,530
he then decided to go to a place he identified to be 
very difficult for America to get at him

1245
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,770
- God dammit

1246
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:20,330
which is Hong Kong because of course technically inside China, 
the one country two systems policy

1247
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:23,540
there meaning he would get potentially some protection,

1248
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:27,040
he thought, all very well planned, 
could be just out of a spy novel.

1249
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,820
But what about the details.

1250
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:41,500
- That could make it worse. 
But just the lower half of my face.

1251
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,680
Snowden says he'd become increasingly 
dismay by what he saw as the growing power

1252
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,080
of the NSA.

1253
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,530
And it's his decision to pass on 
documents which is said to reveal

1254
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:29,070
the organisation monitored 
millions of phone calls

1255
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,850
but that it had direct access 
to some of the...

1256
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,170
- How do you feel?

1257
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,440
...Internet companies in the world.

1258
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,000
- uuh what happens, happens. 
We've uh we've talked about this

1259
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,570
I knew what the risks and if I get arrested, 
I get arrested,

1260
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,860
we were able to get the information 
that needed to get out, out.

1261
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:57,170
And you and Glenn are able to keep reporting 
regardless what happens to me.

1262
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:04,580
Now 29 year old Edward Snowden says that US intelligence agencies 
gathered millions of phone records

1263
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,730
and monitored Internet data...

1264
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,420
- Yes. I'm sorry who's asking?

1265
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:23,050
- I'm afraid you have the wrong room thank you. 
Wall Street Journal.

1266
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,340
- Yes. I'm sorry say again?

1267
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,440
Uh, no thank you. No calls.

1268
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,460
I think they have the wrong number.

1269
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,430
Yeah, no calls. Thank you.

1270
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:56,120
Uh wait I'm sorry if it's two men from the front desk 
they can call but no outside calls.

1271
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:01,590
Wait actually just... let them through. Wait, wait m'am?

1272
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,600
Fuck

1273
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:20,050
- Yes. Wait is it a lawyer? Yeah, no no no I mean,

1274
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,170
the people who are asking. Ask them if they are lawyers.

1275
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,130
No tell her that she has the wrong number 
and there is no Mr. Snowden here.

1276
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:41,000


1277
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,520


1278
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,050


1279
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,730


1280
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,270


1281
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:58,930


1282
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,430


1283
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,210


1284
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:12,060


1285
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:18,210
Would you mind to talk in speakerphone?

1286
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,420
- Sorry

1287
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,750


1288
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,370


1289
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,850


1290
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:25,890
- Hi. I'm the client

1291
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,750


1292
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,200
- Pretty good. I'm doing well

1293
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,960


1294
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:41,280

1295
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,620


1296
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,180


1297
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:46,950
- Ok

1298
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:52,390


1299
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,390
- Ok

1300
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:57,030


1301
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:01,550

1302
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,100

1303
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:10,270
- Ok, that's great. Is it OK if i bring equipment? 
Because i'm just kind of going, so i can leave in any direction,

1304
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,120
at any time, and not come back. If necessary.

1305
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,920


1306
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,950


1307
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:21,790


1308
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:23,740


1309
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,140
- Ok, that sounds good.

1310
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,300


1311
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,390
- Thank you, thank you so much for helping us.

1312
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,410


1313
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,790


1314
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,980


1315
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,010


1316
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,470


1317
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,160


1318
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,810


1319
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:48,390


1320
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,460

1321
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:01,040


1322
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,070


1323
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,610

1324
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:15,220
- Yeah... And so, is there a precedent for this 
where Hong Kong would extradite someone

1325
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,990
for political speech ?

1326
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,480


1327
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:23,180


1328
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,380


1329
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,790

1330
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:26,620
"The President surely does not welcome 
the way that this debate

1331
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,530
has earned a greater attention 
the last week,

1332
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,210
the leaked classified information about 
sensitive programs that are

1333
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,190
important in our 
fight against terrorists

1334
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,950
who would do harm 
to Americans is a problem,

1335
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,820
but the debate itself is legitimate 
and should be engaged.

1336
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:49,250


1337
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,680


1338
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,820


1339
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,190


1340
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,530


1341
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:17,740


1342
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:23,530


1343
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:27,540


1344
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,060


1345
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,570


1346
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,380


1347
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,840


1348
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,980


1349
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,970


1350
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,580


1351
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,700


1352
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:56,990

1353
01:20:57,230 --> 01:21:00,680

1354
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,760

1355
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:06,590

1356
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:13,710

1357
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,320


1358
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:27,330


1359
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,150

1360
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,890


1361
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,590


1362
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:47,500


1363
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,350


1364
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:53,110


1365
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,600


1366
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,830


1367
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:02,220


1368
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,090


1369
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:08,500


1370
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:11,800


1371
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,350


1372
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,050


1373
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:23,480


1374
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:28,500


1375
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:30,580


1376
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,110


1377
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,340


1378
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,370


1379
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,930

1380
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,060

1381
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:02,580

1382
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:04,760

1383
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,500

1384
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:12,040

1385
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:18,860

1386
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:22,000

1387
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,120

1388
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,510


1389
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,070
- Right, so which one do we want here then.

1390
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:37,760
This is operational stuff, 
so we mustn't say any of this.

1391
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:38,950
- So redact that.

1392
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:40,770
- Go near the top

1393
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,810
- What about the Alexander's quote, 
is that something ...

1394
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,820
- Yeah. That's in TARMAC. 
"Why can't we collect all the signals all the times?

1395
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:50,190
Sounds like a good 
summer homework project for Menwith"

1396
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:53,500
Keith Alexander the head of the NSA 
on a visit to the UK. This one.

1397
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,740
- Yeah.

1398
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:58,370
- Yeah. It's a secret document 
in that secret document.

1399
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:02,320
We've got a stick here 
that should just have three single slides on it.

1400
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:06,150
If it's got more than three single slides, 
we have to be extremely careful.

1401
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:09,620
- Yeah?

1402
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:10,860
- Yeah, that's it.

1403
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,980
This is really dangerous stuff for us, Guardian

1404
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,500
If we make mistakes, ...very angry.

1405
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:20,180
We kept it all under lock and key
and no one knows. No, I'm not saying that.

1406
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:21,950
- OK

1407
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:24,860
- They will come in and snap the front door down 
if we elaborate on that...

1408
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:26,720
And he said...

1409
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,720
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned about this.

1410
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,030
And they kept saying, "this is from the very top."

1411
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,260


1412
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:41,570


1413
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:45,750


1414
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,520


1415
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:52,870


1416
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:58,590


1417
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,590


1418
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,200


1419
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:12,540


1420
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:24,270


1421
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:43,150


1422
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,030
As you can see on this map 
the flight that probably has Snowden aboard,

1423
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,350
has almost reached its destination here 
in Moscow's scheduled plan,

1424
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,930


1425
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,650
in the Russian capital within minutes...

1426
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:59,210
As you may have heard, there is a CIA agent 
who has revealed a lot of information

1427
01:25:57,410 --> 01:26:03,430


1428
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,220
and he is now trapped in the

1429
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,460
airport in Moscow

1430
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,880
We managed to get him out of Hong Kong,

1431
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,040
but when he landed in the Moscow airport,

1432
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,630
the American government had canceled his passport.

1433
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,680
So formally he hasn't entered into Russian territory,

1434
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,250
he is in the transit area of the airport

1435
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:22,790


1436
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,830
And one of our people is accompanying him

1437
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,610
We are trying to arrange a private jet

1438
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:31,990
to take him from Moscow

1439
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:37,870
to Ecuador or perhaps maybe Venezuela

1440
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,130
or maybe Iceland,

1441
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:41,480
countries where he would be safe.

1442
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:47,220


1443
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,470


1444
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:58,060


1445
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,240


1446
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:04,050


1447
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:10,550


1448
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,830


1449
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,540


1450
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,330


1451
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:27,170


1452
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:30,350


1453
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,950


1454
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,220


1455
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:42,980


1456
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:49,200


1457
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:56,540


1458
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:00,090


1459
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:05,290


1460
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,700


1461
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,530


1462
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,730


1463
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,250


1464
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,460


1465
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,600


1466
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:26,510


1467
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:30,530


1468
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,760


1469
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:39,040


1470
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,960


1471
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,470


1472
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:59,670


1473
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:05,190


1474
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,060


1475
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:16,410


1476
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,920


1477
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:21,470


1478
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,930


1479
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,870


1480
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:34,220


1481
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,880


1482
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:40,220


1483
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:46,700


1484
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:52,030


1485
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:55,840


1486
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,190


1487
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:03,240


1488
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,910


1489
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:15,760
May I collect all the phones please?

1490
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,900
I have everything in here

1491
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,600
Put them in the refrigerator

1492
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:38,500


1493
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:42,650
- So, as you know, in June,

1494
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:46,380
Snowden was in charge with 3

1495
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,170
legal violations felonies

1496
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:51,320


1497
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,650
Principaly under a World War I era

1498
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:54,280
criminal law called the Espionage Act

1499
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:58,330
The Espionage Act is an extremely broad

1500
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:00,110
criminal prohibition against

1501
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:03,110
the sharing or dissemination

1502
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,280
of what's called 
"National Defense information"

1503
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,640
it was only used to

1504
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:11,080
prosecute people who had been accused of

1505
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,530
acting with a foreign power, 
spies not whistleblowers

1506
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:17,050
and it's a very unusual legal 
representation I think

1507
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,240
not just for all of you, 
but for me as well.

1508
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:24,200
The Espionage Act has not 
distinguished between

1509
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,490
leaks to the press 
and the public interest,

1510
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:29,130
and selling secrets to foreign enemies

1511
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,210
for personal profit.

1512
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,220
So, under the Espionage Act

1513
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:36,570
it's not a defense if the information that was disclosed

1514
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,980
should not have been withheld 
in the first place,

1515
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:40,510
that it was improperly classified.

1516
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,100
It's not a defense if the 
dissemination was in the public interest

1517
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,730
that it led to reforms.

1518
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:49,740
Even if the court determines 
that the programs that were revealed

1519
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,670
were illegal or unconstitutional.

1520
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,190
that's still not a defense under the Espionage Act,

1521
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,230
the Government doesn't have 
to defend the classification,

1522
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:00,500
it doesn't have to demonstrate 
harm from the release,

1523
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,760
All this is irrelevant.

1524
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,920
So when we say that 
the trial wouldn't be fair,

1525
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:09,090
we are not talking about 
what human rights lawyers think

1526
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:10,740
of this fair trial practices

1527
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:12,740
We are saying the law, the statute itself,

1528
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:16,480
eliminates any kind of defense

1529
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:18,500
that Snowden might be able to make

1530
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,200
and essentially will equate him with a spy.

1531
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:25,850
And of course those three counts 
could be increased to a hundreed or two hundreed

1532
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:27,830
or three hundreed, they could charge him separately

1533
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,220
for each document that has been 
published by a journalist.

1534
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,600
And I think that we all recognize, 
even though we sit here as lawyers

1535
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,020
in a lawyer's meeting

1536
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:42,100
that it's propably 
95% politics and 5% law.

1537
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,790
How this would be resolved.

1538
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,310


1539
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,530


1540
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:58,300


1541
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,070


1542
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:05,880


1543
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:12,310


1544
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:19,780
"Mr. Snowden has been charged with very serious crimes

1545
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:23,640
and he should be returned to the United States 
where he would be granted full due process

1546
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,710
and every right available to him 
as a United States citizen.

1547
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,830
Facing our justice system 
under the Constitution."

1548
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,270


1549
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:53,420


1550
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:16,030


1551
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:22,690


1552
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,640
No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a Patriot.

1553
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,340
I called for a federal review

1554
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,880
of our surveillance operations

1555
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,830
before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.

1556
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,760
My preference,

1557
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,900
and I think the American people's preference,

1558
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:42,630
would have been for a lawful, orderly

1559
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,250
examination of these laws.

1560
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:50,590
A thoughtful, fact based debate,

1561
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,260
that would then lead us to a better place.

1562
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:23,580


1563
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:38,440
- Oh my God. David. Hello my baby.

1564
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,360
- I'm OK.

1565
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:41,810
- You're OK?

1566
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,390
- I just wanna go home.

1567
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:51,010
- OK, OK OK. You just have to walk...

1568
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,970
- How are you?

1569
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,670
- Good, good. I'm totally fine, I didn't sleep at all, I couldn't sleep.

1570
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,870
- I know.

1571
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:07,720
"Brazil Demands Explanation from UK Government"

1572
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,800


1573
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:24,940


1574
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:29,270
Recent reports have revealed that the NSA 
have access to encryption keys

1575
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:32,890
and they paid tech companies to introduce 
backdoors in encryption protocols

1576
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:38,400
So we are going to talk about ways in which 
we can defend ourselves against

1577
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,770
governments spying on us.

1578
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:44,660
So Mr. Jacob Appelbaum, as an encryption and 
security software developper,

1579
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:45,980
and journalist.

1580
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,530
Ladar Levison, the founder of the 
encrypted email service

1581
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,350
Lavabit

1582
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,670
used by Edward Snowden.

1583
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:53,560
You have the floor.

1584
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:54,880
Thank you

1585
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:57,680
Lavabit is an email service 
that hopefully one day

1586
01:36:57,930 --> 01:37:03,470
will be able to stand on its own 
without any references to Snowden.

1587
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:06,720
My service was designed to remove me

1588
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,870
from the possibility of being forced

1589
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:12,130
to violate a person's privacy.

1590
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,370
Quite simply

1591
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,900
Lavabit was designed to remove the service provider

1592
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:17,420
from the equation,

1593
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:19,890
by not having logs on my server

1594
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,600
and not having access to 
a person's emails on disk,

1595
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,920
I wasn't elimitating

1596
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:26,350
the possibility of surveillance,

1597
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,700
I was simply removing myself 
from that equation.

1598
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,630
And that surveillance 
would have to be conducted

1599
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,230
on the target

1600
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,620
either the sender

1601
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,540
or the receiver of the messages.

1602
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,690
But I was approached 
by the FBI quite recently,

1603
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,010
and told

1604
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,690
that because I couldn't 
turn over the information

1605
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,680
from that one particular user,

1606
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,990
I would be forced to 
give up those SSL keys

1607
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:52,140
and let the FBI 
collect every communication

1608
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:54,700
on my network without 
any kind of transparency.

1609
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,050
And of course,

1610
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,920
I wasn't comfortable with that,

1611
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,570
to say the least!

1612
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:06,640
More disturbing was the fact that 
I couldn't even tell anybody that it was going on.

1613
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,870
So I decided:

1614
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,940
"If I didn't win the fight to unseal my case,

1615
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,570
if I didn't win the battle

1616
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:16,470
to be able to tell people 
what was going on,

1617
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:20,130
then my only ethical choice left 
was to shutdown".

1618
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,620
Think about that.

1619
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:29,600
I believe in the rule of law, 
I believe in the need to conduct investigations,

1620
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:34,390
but those investigations 
are supposed to be difficult for a reason.

1621
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:38,570
It's supposed to be difficult 
to invade somebody's privacy.

1622
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:41,230
Because of how intrusive it is,

1623
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,810
because of how disruptive it is.

1624
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,790
If we can't, if we don't have 
a right to privacy,

1625
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,890
how do we have 
a free and open discussion?

1626
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,460
What good is the right 
to free speech,

1627
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,240
if it's not protected,

1628
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,730
in a sense that you can't have 
a private discussion

1629
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:02,750
with somebody else 
about something you disagree with.

1630
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:05,500
Think about the chilling effect 
that that has.

1631
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,800
Think about the chilling effect 
it does have

1632
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,260
on countries that don't have 
a right to privacy.

1633
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,630
I've noticed a really interesting 
discussion point

1634
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:16,220
which is that what people used to call 
liberty and freedom

1635
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,850
we now call privacy.

1636
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,710
And we say in the same breath

1637
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:22,630
that privacy is dead.

1638
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:25,120
This is something 
that really concerns me

1639
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,400
about my generation

1640
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,280
especially when we talk about 
how we're not surprised by anything.

1641
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,060
I think that we should consider that

1642
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:33,340
when we lose privacy we lose agency,

1643
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:34,770
we lose liberty itself

1644
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,310
because we no longer feel free 
to express what we think.

1645
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:40,130
There is this myth of 
the passive surveillance machine

1646
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:43,080
but actually what is surveillance 
except control?

1647
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,260
This notion that the NSA are passive

1648
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:46,340
this is nonsense

1649
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,790
what we see is that they actively attack

1650
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,850
European citizens, American citizens and,

1651
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:52,240
in fact, anyone that they can

1652
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,560
if they perceive an advantage.

1653
01:39:56,510 --> 01:40:00,890


1654
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,480


1655
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,160


1656
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:19,170


1657
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:20,910


1658
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:27,160


1659
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:30,300


1660
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,900


1661
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,840


1662
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:42,200


1663
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:49,380


1664
01:40:53,400 --> 01:41:00,050


1665
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:19,760


1666
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:27,120


1667
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,470
- OK. Right.

1668
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,580


1669
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,390
- I have to give that in testimony.

1670
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:42,130
- What are you going to tell?

1671
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:45,630
- Everything I can truthfully.

1672
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,050
- What will you talk about?

1673
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,880
- Uh, whatever the questions they ask me.

1674
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,040
- Yeah I think it's over there.

1675
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:55,450
- Ok, it's alright. Thank you.

1676
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,110


1677
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:03,250
- Hey, how are you?

1678
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:04,030
- Good.

1679
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:04,730
- How are you?

1680
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:05,490
- Good to see you again.

1681
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:06,840
- Nice to meet you again, yes.

1682
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,320
- Yeah

1683
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,470


1684
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:25,210


1685
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:27,350


1686
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:30,280


1687
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:33,460


1688
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:37,320


1689
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:42,160


1690
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:44,830


1691
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,830


1692
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:59,490


1693
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,160


1694
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:21,790


1695
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:26,630


1696
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:34,480


1697
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:37,840


1698
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:42,080
- What do you think they're doing to reporters, 
those of us that are working directly with...

1699
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:44,000
Snowden documents?

1700
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,300
How do you think they would approach 
dealing with people like us?

1701
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,720
- You're.. You're on a cast iron cover list.

1702
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:53,650
Which means any electronic device you use

1703
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:57,600
that they can attach to you 
they all record and capture all that data.

1704
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,350


1705
01:43:58,010 --> 01:44:00,150
- And what do they do with that data? 
They're just trying to figure out what we're doing?

1706
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,250
- Uh, well the primary...

1707
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:05,130
That's part of it. But the other part, primarily part,

1708
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,640
is for them. I think it's to find the 
sources of information you're getting.

1709
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:12,040
- So if I have a confidential source 
who's giving me information as a whistleblower,

1710
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,430
and he works within the US Government, 
and he's concerned about

1711
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,680
what he perceives as 
violation of the Constitution,

1712
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:21,270
uhm... and he gets in touch with me, 
they...

1713
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,110
- Yeah...

1714
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:23,210
- Go ahead. Yeah.

1715
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:26,850
- Yeah. From there on, they would nail him 
and start watching everything he did.

1716
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:30,820
and if you start passing data,
I'm sure they'd take him off the street.

1717
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:34,260
I mean, the way you have to do it 
is like Deep Throat did, right?

1718
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:38,110
In the Nixon years, 
meet in a basement of a parking garage...

1719
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:40,160
physically.

1720
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:04,470


1721
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:15,700


1722
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,500
Let's disassociate our metadata one last time.

1723
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,850
So we don't have a clear record of your true name 
in our final communication chain.

1724
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:35,080


1725
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,800
This is obviously not to say 
you can't claim your involvement,

1726
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:34,320
but as every trick in the book 
is likely to be used and looking into this,

1727
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:38,000
I believe it's better, 
that that particular disclosure

1728
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,730
come on your own terms.

1729
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:42,630
Thank you again for all you've done.

1730
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:44,670
So sorry again for the multiple delays.

1731
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:46,370
But we've been entering a territory

1732
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,060
with no model to benefit from.

1733
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,040
If all ends well,

1734
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,560
perhaps the demonstration that our mess has worked

1735
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:55,770
would embolden more to come forward

1736
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,020
Citizen.

1737
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:06,920
- So the update that I want to give you is about the new,

1738
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:10,910
uh.. the new source that, that we...

1739
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,370
- OK.

1740
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:19,460
- that... uh, this is what... this is the...

1741
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:23,620
you know this is the person who is doing 
the... the most of the...

1742
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:24,840
- Right, right, right.

1743
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:28,820
- ...the work on it, uh... 
And now... and now,

1744
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,730
what basically, what happens is...

1745
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:34,460
- and...

1746
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,720
- That's actually... 
That's really dangerous...

1747
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:41,000
uh, on the source's side.

1748
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,570
Do they know how to 
take care of themselves...

1749
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:43,790
-  Well he knows...

1750
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,460
- ...or do you know anything about...

1751
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:46,790
- ...he means it's, uh...

1752
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,310
It's all being done.. 
through this...

1753
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,240
- OK.

1754
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,870
- and they're all talking this way...

1755
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:55,930
- OK.

1756
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,160
- and, uh...

1757
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,840
- I was gonna say 
one of the big questions there is:

1758
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,560
can they handle it? 
You know with...

1759
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,370
- Yeah, they're very careful...

1760
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:04,960
even they're through that.

1761
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:05,960
- OK

1762
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:06,940
- Yeah.

1763
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,420
- And...

1764
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,800
- That's what that is.

1765
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:24,600
- Wow, that's really something.

1766
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,350
- Oh, oh...

1767
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:38,890
- Did you know that?

1768
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:46,360
One key thing: ALL drone strikes are done through 
Ramstein Air Base in Germany - German govt has always 
denied this. Will be a huge controversy.

1769
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:47,890
- It's not the actual plan.

1770
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,950
- Right, right right. You mean the control.

1771
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,810
- It's the process, who's sending the...

1772
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:53,030
- Yeah.

1773
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:57,670
- There's a... There's a chart. 
You know, it goes like a whole layout in it

1774
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:58,850
for everyone and it's...

1775
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,390
- Yeah. It's really bold, but it's really risky.

1776
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,380
But you know that... that's the thing if...

1777
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:03,290
- There's more...

1778
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,430
- ... if they understand what they're doing.

1779
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:09,060
-  There's this chart, it goes like this... 
It shows the decision making chart.

1780
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:15,680
It's a chart... It's, it's... it's shaped like this.

1781
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:19,270
- Hum hum...
- So up here it says "POTUS" (President of the Uniteed States)

1782
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,190
- That's the decision making chart for each... one.

1783
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,830
- And...

1784
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,660
- And it's so political...

1785
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:33,810
- This is...  This part's amazing.

1786
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:38,960
- That's...

1787
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,190
- That's fucking ridiculous.

1788
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:43,770
- This... This is... it's so shocking.

1789
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,930
- (laugh) That's...

1790
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:50,990
- No, I know...

1791
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:51,600
- That's...

1792
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:52,230
- ... I know...

1793
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:55,380
There are 1.2 m people on various stages 
of their watch list.

1794
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,640
- ... the population of an entire country.

1795
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,910
- I know.

1796
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:02,480
- That's... what we're working on.

1797
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:15,150
- That person is incredibly bold, but, uh...

1798
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:17,480
- But also very well aware.

1799
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,550
- Right. I... You know, I just hope. I mean...

1800
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:21,300
- No, I mean...

1801
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,710
the boldness of it is shocking, 
but I mean it was obviously..

1802
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,850
- But the other thing is just...

1803
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,260
- ...motivated by what you did, 
I mean, it...

1804
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:29,640
- This is going to... This is going to...

1805
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:32,120
That could raise a profile

1806
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:34,290
of this whole political situation

1807
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,890
with whistleblowing 
to a whole new level, because...

1808
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:37,810
- exactly...

1809
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,250
- It's gonna...

1810
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,300
- Yeah, I mean...

1811
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:41,890
I actually think 
that's a great thing.

1812
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,180
And I think people 
are gonna see what's being hidden...

1813
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:48,730
again, again.. 
by a totally different part 
of the government.

1814
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,660
POTUS
