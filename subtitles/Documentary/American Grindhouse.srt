1
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:13,502
When I hear the term “grindhouse,”
what I think of is Hollywood Boulevard

2
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:18,659
in the ‘70s—very much like 42nd
Street New York in the ‘70s.

3
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,114
42nd Street, in its heyday, was a
collection of about a dozen cinemas,

4
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,622
all contained within one block.

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,593
When you would go into these theatres,
there was an ever-present feeling of danger.

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,511
There was a murder there, one night, and
so people, there was a big pandemonium

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,318
and I'm still sitting there, I wanna
see the movie, I don't wanna leave.

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,861
I did I stayed, the police came in,
they never turned on the house lights.

9
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,864
"We're at the Bijoux Theatre, where
it's reported that a man has gone beserk

10
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:47,149
while watching a
double-feature horror program.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,795
If you ever saw the movie
Midnight Cowboy, that probably had

12
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:53,892
the best depiction of 42nd
Street I ever saw in a film.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,462
Because that really was
what it was all about;

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,404
it was either people watching movies,
or having their own party in the theatre.

15
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:05,435
Grindhouse? It's like did you ever
see Pinocchio, Disney's Pinocchio?

16
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:09,919
There's a wonderful thing in Disney's
Pinocchio where Pinocchio is kidnapped

17
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,545
and goes off to this
island-Pleasure Island

18
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:16,362
and there's this guy with a derby
and a cigar, and he's barking.

19
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,680
He's at a podium and he's
saying, "The rough house!

20
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,180
Go inside, boys,
it's the rough house!"

21
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,946
And that's what I like about
it, it's sheer hucksterism.

22
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,295
A grindhouse is a
theater that never closes.

23
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,641
Are grindhouse films and
exploitation the same? Ahh, not really

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,338
Some theaters would show all day and
all night and they weren't showing,

25
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:38,823
questionable marginal material,
they were showing regular films.

26
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:42,398
In the late 40s there were
probably only about 100 theaters

27
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,107
in the United States that you
could classify as "grindhouses".

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,631
And so I think it's in the 1960s and
the 1970s that you begin to see that

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,527
association with, inner
city urban theaters

30
00:01:56,586 --> 00:02:00,367
aka grindhouses and exploitation.

31
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:04,934
Exploitation basically means; there
is an element that you can exploit.

32
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:10,441
Now whether it’s nudity, or
sex or violence or a monster

33
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:14,571
or just an idea, a lot of exploitation
it's just how outragreous is the idea.

34
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:19,921
It's something to take
advantage of in promotion.

35
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:23,166
It's, it's a hook to get
them into the theater...

36
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:26,811
"No one admitted except
at the beginning!"

37
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,087
I'm happy to join the
management of the this theater.

38
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,657
"YOU will take an unforgettable journey
down deep into the dungeons of hell!"

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,546
Why was this girl
chosen to be tortured?

40
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:41,296
This motion picture is a vicious
expose of a part of a young generation.

41
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:44,112
Im gonna give you the
time of your life, baby.

42
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:48,918
Scenes ofsuch brutal honesty will be shown
on this screen. Attention hungry housewives.

43
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:52,551
A mixture of tender romance
and pornographic realism.

44
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:55,935
If you were smart, you'll keep
away from prostitutes and pick-ups.

45
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,756
They're not safe.
And they can't be made safe.

46
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:03,317
"That's a good shot. - "Knock-out!"
- I'm a woman! And I'll do as I please!

47
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:07,124
"The shocking scenes that you are about
to see, are not suggested for the weak.

48
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,667
Soon at this theater.
They'll be coming together.

49
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,491
"Here's your chance
to see all the bad…"

50
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:16,753
"Ask not what your
country can do for you…"

51
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:19,608
#AMERICAN GRINDHOUSE#

52
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,780
And remember: Get more out
of life. Go out to a movie.

53
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,313
#IN THE BEGINNING
FROM EDISON TO FREAKS#

54
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:39,226
You could say that exploitation
is as old as the movies themselves.

55
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:44,851
Thomas Edison's company was making films
around the turn of the 20th century.

56
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:50,321
So there's always been this sort of
element of exploitation in the film business

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,797
from its very earliest days.

58
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:58,798
You know the old joke goes that as
soon as the movie camera was invented,

59
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,752
expliotation started like 5 seconds later,

60
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,324
somebody said to his girlfriend, Would you
mind taking your clothes off for the camera?

61
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,861
That is the story of
exploitation in the cinema.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,520
Now that we have a way to make a
permanent record of all of this.

63
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:18,429
What is it what we want to record.

64
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,959
And by and large that they wanted
to record was stuff that was taboo.

65
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:27,386
Exploitation and the dawn of the
motion picture went hand in hand.

66
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:30,904
Many of Thomas Edison's films from
the beginning of the 20th Century

67
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:35,566
were widely considered excessive,
salacious, and prurient in content.

68
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,343
Thomas Edison's company helped pave
the way for the exploitation film

69
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,910
by simply catering to audience’s tastes.
- You know PT Barnum was a genius.

70
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:47,400
Part of his genius was just
giving people what they wanted.

71
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,839
Combining the sensationalism of
PT Barnum and the innovation of

72
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:54,926
Edison's moving picture camera, the
first feature length exploitation film

73
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,961
was released on November 24th, 1913.

74
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,767
Traffic in Souls, in
a lot of ways, sort of

75
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:05,132
established the prototype
for exploitation films.

76
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:10,235
During the time around
1910, 1911, 1912,

77
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:14,192
there were these tremendous
scares in the United States,

78
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:17,610
in big cities, about the
so-called "white slave" traffic,

79
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,999
prostitution, forced prostitution.

80
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,250
These tracks usually
found-universally found

81
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:28,462
that this traffic didn't really exist,

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,841
but it captured the popular imagination,
and eventually George Lone Tucker

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,548
a director who was working at Universal put
together this film called Traffic in Souls,

84
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:43,601
which traded on the sensational
aspects of the white slave scare.

85
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:47,651
Traffic in Souls was made for $57,000.

86
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:52,373
It would gross a staggering
$450,000 during its theatrical run,

87
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:55,716
and would place Universal
Pictures firmly on the map as

88
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,857
one of the major players in
the blossoming movie industry.

89
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:03,078
The film was one of the first feature
films made in the United States.

90
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:07,650
It promised tremendous
things in its advertising:

91
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,078
hundreds of scenes and a
cast of thousands and so on,

92
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:15,646
plus this really sensational topic,
none of which it really delivered on.

93
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:18,461
In, you know, good old
exploitation fashion.

94
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:20,737
Exploitation movies
flourished in Hollywood

95
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,588
during the transition from
Silent films to Talkies.

96
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,187
In the Pre-Code Era, the
motion picture industry

97
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,954
was often viewed as a
hotbed of moral depravity.

98
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:33,341
Even today, it's easy to see why
many of these films raised eyebrows.

99
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:36,719
Pre Code Hollywood in the 1930s.

100
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:40,035
When you discover them it's kind of
like discovering exploitation films,

101
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:42,937
because you're seeing things that
you can't believe you're seeing.

102
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:51,435
There were always woman changing, taking
their clothes off, you can see nipples.

103
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,802
To me they're not really
like exploitation films.

104
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:57,458
To me, they sort of like realistic
depictions of what was going on

105
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,170
in American life because
people were really screwed up.

106
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,454
People want to see these things
on camera they want to see sex,

107
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,714
they wanna see violence,
they wanna see drugs.

108
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:08,365
You know, I think it's important
to remember that in the late teens,

109
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:12,846
the early 1920s, movies had only
been around twenty, twenty-five years.

110
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,126
They were a very young industry.

111
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,797
They were very susceptible to
all sorts of public pressure.

112
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:24,631
In 1920, Hollywood begins to go
through this series of scandals.

113
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:30,769
So by 1922, there's tremendous pressure
on Hollywood to clean up its act,

114
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:35,542
that people are thinking this is just
a Sodom and Gomorrah on the west coast.

115
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,503
And so finally, the
heads all get together,

116
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,418
and they decide that they're
going to bring in Will Hays.

117
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,016
Will Hays is the Postmaster General,
he's kind of a Republican stalwart,

118
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:49,047
he's an elder in the
Presbyterian church, and they say,

119
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:54,159
"Will Hays, come out here, come to work
for us, and help us clean up our image."

120
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:58,410
"To the Warner Brothers to
whom this due credit, for this,

121
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:02,591
the beginning of a new era
in music and motion pictures.

122
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:08,229
I offer my solicitations and
my sincerest appreciations."

123
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:11,669
This had to be like the cushiest job
in the entire film industry, right?

124
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,010
Something like $100 thousand
dollars a year during the depression!

125
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,473
"Service is the supreme
commitment to life.

126
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:24,646
It can be argued that the day the
Hollywood Production Code was established

127
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,123
the real exploitation
film industry was born.

128
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:31,876
The Code really did create exploitation
films much like Prohibition created

129
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:36,807
speakeasies so you really had to go
of your way to find these pictures.

130
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:40,310
The Hays Code created

131
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,479
all of these sort
of carnie "shysters".

132
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,848
But before the Production Code
would be strictly enforced,

133
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:52,083
one more major Hollywood film would
test the boundaries of acceptable tastes

134
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:55,743
and would ironically, become
one of the most infamous films

135
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,415
ever released on the
exploitation circuit.

136
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:02,957
MGM, after Dracula and Frankenstein they
said we have to make a horror picture.

137
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:06,773
And you know, we're Metro,
we're the best so therefore

138
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,595
we will make the best horror picture.

139
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:13,986
And they hired Tod Browing who
made Dracula and he made Freaks.

140
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,234
Freaks is an MGM picture
it's well produced.

141
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,910
It is a really good movie but they
got more than they bargained for.

142
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,223
Freaks may be the most
shocking and controversial film

143
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,515
ever released during
the pre-Code era.

144
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:36,453
Browning's choice to cast real life
circus oddities caused an outrage

145
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:41,847
resulting in a backlash that cost
the studio $160,000 in ticket sales.

146
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:46,212
Although today, it is widely considered
to be the director's masterpiece,

147
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:51,253
the release of Freaks effectively put an
end to Tod Browning's prosperous career.

148
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,069
It was released during the
so-called "Pre-Code" period,

149
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,174
before the production code
was really being enforced.

150
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:02,062
And MGM sort of immediately cans
it, you know puts it on the shelf

151
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:06,030
but some years later,
exploitation entrepaneur

152
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,660
Dwain Esper got the rights to Freaks

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,210
and gave it a second life during
the 1940s and into the 1950s

154
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,687
by releasing it on the
exploitation circuit.

155
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,483
#LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN...
SEE OUR MOVIE#

156
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,103
Before licensing Freaks from MGM,

157
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,572
director Dwain Esper made the
early grind house film, Maniac.

158
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,479
Loosely inspired by Edgar
Allen Poe's The Black Cat

159
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:39,307
and taking various cues from
Universal horror films of the time,

160
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:42,184
Maniac was written by
Espier's wife, Hildegard,

161
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:45,070
and produced during
the summer of 1934.

162
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,090
A benchmark in the
evolution of exploitation,

163
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:53,484
Maniac represents the classical
age of exploitation films

164
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:56,214
which prospered during
The Great Depression.

165
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:58,484
The exploitation filmmakers,

166
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:03,042
they weren't showing in
Hollywood owned theaters.

167
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,950
They existed completely
outside the law.

168
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:12,139
with its emphasis on sex and violence,
maniac also established a blueprint for

169
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:16,166
subsequent exploitation films
in which it's production quality

170
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:20,638
took a back seat to the required
doses of graphic content.

171
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:24,842
Dwain Esper was interesting
because the films

172
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:28,617
that he made were
really amazingly awful.

173
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:33,537
But they were movies
that drew audiences.

174
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,328
The films of Dwain
Esper and others like him

175
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:39,941
represent a group of nomadic
independent filmmakers and distributors

176
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,062
who traveled the country
in the 1930s and peddled

177
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:46,624
the virtues of cinematic sin
to thrill seeking audiences.

178
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:51,465
Affectionately known as The 40
Thieves, these carnie road show men

179
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:54,170
had little regard for
proper business ethics

180
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,012
and stopped at nothing
to make a quick buck.

181
00:11:57,053 --> 00:12:01,297
Grind house movies and exploitation
movies were the domain of

182
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:06,543
kind of fly by night independents
who swooped in and gave the public

183
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:11,564
what they really wanted, but they
had to do it in marginal little cracks

184
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:16,330
in cities and rural areas where
they'd find a place to show this stuff.

185
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:21,204
Just pitch a tent or find a theater
that wasn't part of the Hollywood system

186
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,620
where they could just grind away.

187
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:29,876
One of the key things about
exploitation movies during this time

188
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,817
was thay they were virtually
always shown for Adults Only.

189
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:39,298
Hollywood films were for everyone, but
these films by having that "adults only"

190
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:42,134
told people that this was something
different this is something

191
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,198
out of the ordinary. This was
something that I'm not going to see

192
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:50,320
when I go down to see that MGM
film or that 20th Century Fox film.

193
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,987
There's going to be something you know
maybe a little special in this movie.

194
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:57,337
Many of the exploitation films
released by The 40 Thieves

195
00:12:57,357 --> 00:13:00,373
reveled in the
sensationalism of true crime.

196
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:03,256
Take for example police
sherrif Louis Sonney.

197
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,374
After achieving nationwide
publicity for his apprehension of

198
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:11,869
train robber Roy Gardner in 1921,
Sonney was convinced to re-create

199
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,863
the capture of Gardner for his
first film,You Can't Beat The Rap!

200
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,659
"Well, goodbye Roy.
- Good luck"

201
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,146
Sonney was the sherif of
Centralia Washington and actually

202
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,066
tracked him down, caught him,
arrested him in a hotel up there.

203
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,434
"Mr Sonney, I don't how to begin
to thank you for all you've done…"

204
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,776
They initally started
with live appearances,

205
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,149
where he and Roy Gardner
would appear together.

206
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,844
This established this wonderful
tradition in exploitation of;

207
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,305
it's okay to talk about all
this stuff that's off limits,

208
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:45,786
it's okay for crime to pay and long as

209
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,768
in the end everyone
gets their cumuppins.

210
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:52,260
So as long as in the end,
Roy Gardner is in shackles and

211
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:58,054
is testifying to never get
involved in crime it's all okay.

212
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,405
"I paid the hard way…"

213
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,866
But in the mean time you can exploit
all the stuff that's off limits.

214
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,590
That was essential to
how these things opperated

215
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,739
and Louis Sonney was the
guy who originally did that.

216
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,343
And that became the way
exploitation filmmakers

217
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:16,640
got around the criticism
of what they were doing.

218
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:20,413
But we're mearling offering
lessons in morality.

219
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:24,283
Some people did go hoping
to learn something about

220
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:28,886
either drug use or child birth, or
whatever the case happened to be.

221
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,956
#IT'S NOT VULGAR...
IT'S EDUCATIONAL#

222
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:40,618
"It happens to the rich. It happens to the
poor, perhaps to your own son or daughter!

223
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:45,000
When a girl faces disgrace, many
times the parent are at faulty.

224
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,254
Trying to keep today's teenagers
innocent through ignorance,

225
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:51,497
it simply will not work!
Too many learn the hard way.

226
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:55,865
Your girl or boy could be the
next victim of unwed motherhood

227
00:14:55,927 --> 00:15:00,734
or VD bring them to see the truths and learn
facts, facts, facts before it's too late!

228
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:08,562
At that point in history and maybe even
today, alot of guys didn't stand in the room

229
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:12,556
when their wives gave birth and if they did,
they didn’t stand down on the business end.

230
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,260
You know, guys used to pace in
the waiting room, waiting, waiting,

231
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,521
waiting for somebody to tell
them what kind of kid they had.

232
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,452
And you're, your're right it was
just something that most people

233
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,700
even people who had
children had never seen.

234
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:26,637
"Love may be the most beautiful or
most dangerous thing in the world.

235
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:32,597
But it is never a thing to be gigled
about or fouled with dirty stories.

236
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,345
Child birth is a sacred thing.

237
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,042
Exploitation films during this sort of

238
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:53,188
classical era were obviously
selling titilation on the one hand,

239
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,048
but on the other hand they
were also selling education.

240
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:59,226
This is the why a lot of these
films, kind of got a way with it.

241
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:03,343
Now lets consider that
other public enemy, gonereha

242
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:08,188
an arch criminal with a half dozen
vulgar alias' such as "The Clap",

243
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:13,387
"The Dose", "The Gleet", "The
Strain" or "The Running Range"!

244
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:16,143
This was information that was
hidden away from a lot of people and

245
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:20,950
these movies were providing that
information at least to some extent.

246
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,116
So, particularly of the sex hygeine
films often the audience was

247
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:30,427
largley made up of women who had no other
way of getting this kind of information

248
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:35,192
The birth of a baby stuff, you had
almost a protective shield around you.

249
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,164
You know Dave Friedman used to call tent
evangelists they called them 'sky grifters'

250
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:42,601
because they'd get a big tent and
it was almost just like a carnival.

251
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:46,018
The guy was using God to fleece
you of whatever your money was,

252
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,066
he had a perfect cover. And that's
what the birth of a baby movies

253
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:53,230
and stuff was, it was the perfect
cover for people who might be

254
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:57,619
a little seedy to come
in and be respectable

255
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,928
and still show you something that

256
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,212
had they approached it in
a different factor they,

257
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,509
they probably would have been
run out of town on a rail.

258
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,513
Perhaps the most infamous
of all "birth of a baby"

259
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:11,205
films was 1945's Mom and Dad.

260
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:15,861
Produced and distributed by Kroeger
Babb, the film was direeted by

261
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,295
William "One Shot" Beaudine

262
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,145
in just six days and
on a budget of $63,000.

263
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:26,739
It would go on to become the third
highest grossing film of the decade.

264
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,361
Mom and Dad had a lecturer,
named Elliot Forbes

265
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,422
the eminant hygience
commentator Elliot Forbes

266
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:37,801
who would travel with
the roadshow units,

267
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,651
now this of course meant
you had like 15 Elliot Forbes

268
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,846
in the United States criss-crossing
the nation at any given time.

269
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:49,817
"See Mom and Dad. You'll be glad you did.
Children under 16 must be in adult company.

270
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:52,825
See Mom and Dad"

271
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,605
While films like Mom and Dad continued
to appear on Grindhouse cirquit

272
00:17:57,628 --> 00:18:01,951
adult themes were still being addressed
in the studio films of the 1940s.

273
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:05,097
The Production Code forced
filmmakers to creatively depict

274
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:08,800
sexuality and violence in
a much more subtle approach.

275
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:13,799
The result was a style of motion
pictures known today as film noir.

276
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:16,667
Have'nt you tried to buy my
loyalty with money and nothing else?

277
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:19,110
What else is there
that I can buy you with?

278
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:23,164
I've thought about whether
there was any kind of connection

279
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:29,161
between grindhouse cinema and
film noir and in reality there is.

280
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,753
What's the matter, aren't
you going to kiss me?

281
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:37,767
Both of these type of films
specialize in adult themes.

282
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:47,237
The difference of course is that in
film noir the artists making these movies

283
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:51,135
had to find creative ways
to express all this stuff

284
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:53,776
within the constraints
of the Production Code.

285
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,489
The grindhouse guys, just showed it.

286
00:18:56,528 --> 00:19:00,165
Grindhouse theaters flourished in
red-light districts and skid row sections of

287
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,143
major cities by the mid-20th century;

288
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:07,174
an image that was illustrated
in this film from 1941…

289
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:12,175
Probably the best representation
of a grindhouse in a

290
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:15,747
mainstream Hollywood film
is in "I Wake Up Screaming".

291
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,131
You know it doesn't seem very well mainted,
people are in there because they're sleeping,

292
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,054
they are spending the night in the theater
becuase they have no place else to go.

293
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:27,268
It's a very interesting
depiction of what a grindhouse is,

294
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,790
that you didn't see too
often in a mainstream movie.

295
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:34,045
The depiction of a grindhouse theater
in "I Wake Up Screaming" may have been

296
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,908
a sign that the Production Code was
loosing touch with American audiences.

297
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:41,608
By the 1950s, the
portraial of adult themes

298
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,878
in mainstream movies
would change once again

299
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:50,442
In 1948 you finally had the prosecution that
had been brough by the Justice Department.

300
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:55,183
It ends with a Supreme Court decision
known as The Paramount Decision.

301
00:19:55,343 --> 00:20:00,112
That meant - for the Majors - that they
no longer had a garanteed place to show

302
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:05,797
their movies, they bassically had to begin
to compete in a much more open market place.

303
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,374
And that's when I think
the exploitiers thought:

304
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,855
Our days may be numbered here.

305
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,385
If they start letting Hollywood do
these movies, what are we going to do?

306
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:23,160
The Paramount decision bassically
means that the Production Code,

307
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:28,055
begins to fall apart because there is
really no way to enforce it any more.

308
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:31,712
Once the Production Code
begins to fall apart that means

309
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:35,285
Hollywood begins to gradually take on

310
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,978
these more adult suject matters.

311
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:40,908
This is the 19 year-old Baby Doll.

312
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:43,521
She wouln't let her
husband come near her.

313
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,882
She wouldn’t let the stranger go away.

314
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:49,319
Why Mr. Vicarro. You
certainly are getting familiar.

315
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:53,730
For the sort of old line
exploitiers and The 40 Thives,

316
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:58,014
that was bad news, because a
lot of the topics that they had

317
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:02,177
pursued for years, gradually
become the province of Hollywood.

318
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:15,436
#PERVERSION...
FOR PROFIT#

319
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,440
After World War II, sex became
a little more acceptable.

320
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:25,089
It was recognized that at
least pin-up and cheesecake art

321
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:29,182
and all of that was really a big
moral booster during the war.

322
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:34,768
And so burlesque became a more
acceptable form of entertainment

323
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:40,148
I don't think people realize just prevelent
striptease and burlesque was in our country.

324
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:46,562
We are in such a prudish, puritanical
moment right now I think people forget that

325
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:49,707
there's always been the grind,
theres always been strip,

326
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:53,062
there's always been this side
of American showbusiness.

327
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:57,757
The term bump and grind' was
lifted from the burlesque stage and

328
00:21:57,796 --> 00:22:01,264
as many of the nation's red light
districts burlesque houses made

329
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:05,579
the transition to movie houses
the term grindhouse came with it.

330
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:09,224
This change in venues paid off
handsomely for the theater owners,

331
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,751
but it was another story
for the stripping starlets.

332
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:18,515
And then a lot of producers in grindhouses
understood that the economic benefits

333
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:22,309
of filming burlesque acts and

334
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:25,198
finding venues in which
they could show the films

335
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:29,590
was a lot cheaper then sending
women around on the circuits

336
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:33,411
That was just you know,
mana from heaven for

337
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:38,361
the exploiters because they could
get Lili St. Cyr and Tempest Storm

338
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:41,916
and all these popular burlesque
artists to do a film.

339
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,490
And quite frankly I think
these women undersold themselves

340
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,798
because they didn't understand

341
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,220
this new quote en quote technology an
issue that still exists to this day;

342
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:54,962
where they said yeah, ok fine you
wanna film me doing my act, so what?

343
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:58,082
And they didn't understand
that, that was going to cut

344
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:02,418
deeply into their ability to
make money as a live performer.

345
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:06,185
And then little by little,
once burlesuqe was acceptabe,

346
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:10,401
then it just became
the inevitable flood.

347
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,922
I mean how long the the damn
going to hold at that point.

348
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:15,193
Kiss me quick

349
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:19,552
And it was like, how much
skin can you actually show?

350
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:23,348
Besides adapting the tradition
of burlesque to exploitation,

351
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,761
many of the grindhouse
filmmakers turned to the

352
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,738
world of men's magazines
as a source for insperation.

353
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:32,350
And as the 50's progressed with
relaxed attitudes toward sex,

354
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:36,222
there was serious opposition from
concenred organizations as evidensed

355
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:41,041
in this propaganda film produced by
The Citizens for Decent Literature.

356
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,320
And then we come to nudist magazines.

357
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,743
If they were printed only the
nudist cult, they would never exist.

358
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:51,394
Group exposure is a
hallmark of these cultists.

359
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:53,963
However it's been
well stated that very

360
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:57,972
few blind people join
the nudist colony.

361
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,989
Nudist camp movies hit their
peak in the post war era

362
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:04,248
with Walter Bibo’s The Garden of Eden.

363
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:08,571
Released in 1954, the film stirred up
a considerable amount of controversy.

364
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:13,273
When The Garden of Eden appears in
the mid 1950s, it was also during

365
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,591
this much more, seemingly
conservative and buttoned down period.

366
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,599
It drew a lot of attention,
it also drew

367
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,469
a fare amount of censorship activity.

368
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,357
Eager and ready to challenge the
censorship issue that faced his film,

369
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:32,353
Bibo took his case to the New
York court of appeals and won.

370
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:35,950
What that meant was you could
show people naked on screen,

371
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,255
they just couldn't be engaged in sex.

372
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,727
Encouraged by Bibo's
court room triumph,

373
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:43,463
exploitation filmmakers
jumped on the bandwagon

374
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:49,017
and pumped out a plethora of nudist camp
movies, each more cheeky than the last.

375
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,331
It was a very innocent sort of film
where people just kind of walked around,

376
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:54,822
threw a ball here and
there and this and that.

377
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,864
And again, much like the
birth of a baby films,

378
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,126
they promoted it as
a healthy lifestyle

379
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:04,104
you know sunshine and
fresh air, people with a high

380
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:06,540
moral fiber who just happend
to be walking around naked.

381
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,208
But what you really buy is a
ticket to see a bunch of people,

382
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:11,915
walking around naked
and mostly girls I hope.

383
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,808
#TEENAGE...
RAMPAGE#

384
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:23,052
And so another job, for
the police and the courts.

385
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:26,493
Johny Marvin is now in
the hands of the law.

386
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:30,969
This is the first time he's been caught, but
his delinquent tendancies began long before

387
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:35,597
in the conflicts of an unhappy home and in
the hangout of the gang which was his refuge

388
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:39,423
By the mid 1950s, teenagers
were growing up in a world

389
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:42,278
with more progressive
attitudes toward sex.

390
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,256
I love you, Jim.
I really mean it.

391
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:52,335
As the American teenager clashed with the
conservatiove morals of the older generation

392
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:56,904
their stories of anger and rebellion
found their way to the silver screen.

393
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:59,310
Teen movies have always been
around, if you go as far back as

394
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,218
Wild Boys On The Road from the 1930s.

395
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:05,331
Ahh, heck.
- Hey whats the matter?

396
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,642
Somebody stole our gas, c'mon!

397
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:10,813
But they didn't really
explode until the 1950s.

398
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:20,647
And I think a lot of it had to do
with teenagers living in the suburbs,

399
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,763
they had disposable
incomes, they had cars.

400
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:26,821
Rock'n'roll certainly
had a large part of it.

401
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:32,551
Say, they ain't made are they? - No, that's
just the ways kids are dancing nowadays.

402
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,214
They call it rock n rolling,
or bop or something like that.

403
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:40,423
You know generally it was that you
were not understood by your parents,

404
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:42,763
you were not understood
by your school.

405
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:46,595
I suppose you're going out
again tonight? - Yeah, so what?

406
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:49,644
You were an outcast in someway.

407
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:53,667
Johnny and two hundread thousaned other
youngsters who are arrested each year,

408
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:56,414
are America's number
one crime problem.

409
00:26:56,477 --> 00:27:01,166
In the post war era
when things changed,

410
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:04,964
people started
thinking of young people

411
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,223
differently and there
also was a lot of crime.

412
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:11,205
Young people and crime became
a Blackboard Jungle kinda thing.

413
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,487
Blackboard Jungle was a
tremendously influential movie.

414
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:16,661
It was not made as an exploitation film
but it performed the same functions.

415
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,499
Dragstrip Riot! Leading to a fight
fought with all the fierce fury of youth.

416
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:26,909
Dangerously angry one minute!
Rockin and rollin the next!

417
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,023
The teen exploitation movies
would take a teenage diliema

418
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,136
and AIP really knew
how to do this well.

419
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:37,295
AIP was a company, James
Nicholson and Sam Arkoff.

420
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:40,636
They would make posters
and come up with titles.

421
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:43,129
These were pictures that
peoples parents wouldn't go see.

422
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:45,414
Here's 50 thousand dollars
go give us that movie!

423
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:48,017
They did a lot of crime pictures, they
did a lot of juvveile delinquent pictures,

424
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:50,377
they did a lot of horror pictures,
science fiction pictures.

425
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,451
All the sort of
disreputable genres.

426
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,074
I think a lot of us who came out of
the American Independent Movement.

427
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:59,739
That was the basis
for a lot of our work.

428
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:05,013
It preceeded punk rock and the DIY
spirit and they were put together

429
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:08,378
almost the same way punk rock
records put together, you know.

430
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,122
Very fast, very cheap, down and dirty,
lets get it out there kind of thing.

431
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,339
By the mid-60s, teen
exploitation films temporarily

432
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,672
diverted their attention to the beach

433
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:23,282
and traded in their pompadours and leather
coats for swimming trunks and boogie boards.

434
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,517
The beach movies are so bizarre.

435
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,792
They were really odd.

436
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:36,440
How do you like this title:
The Behavior Patern of

437
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,490
the Young Adult and its
Relation to Primitve Tribe.

438
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,941
I've got a shorter title.
- What's that? - Teenage sex.

439
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:47,466
The whole point of them was to see tits
and ass. But wholesome, tits and ass.

440
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:52,087
Teen exploitation films represented a
major movie market during the 50s and 60s,

441
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:57,032
even though they were not, solely restricted
to the confines of Grindhouse theaters.

442
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,979
Teens needed a place that they
could see these films, alone,

443
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:05,830
without adults, and the drive in
theater provided the perfect escape.

444
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:10,801
The drive in theaters also showed a lot
of the same product, exploitation product.

445
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,190
But they weren't nessesarily
grind, I don't consider those grind.

446
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,169
What they were interested
in was the teenage market.

447
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:24,287
By the time of the drive in movies and
films like I Was A Teenage Werewolf.

448
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,628
He turns into this monster!
Talk about hairy palms.

449
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:35,277
They specifically were gearing for
adolescent, hormonal, horny boys and girls.

450
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:38,589
So they wanted to go after
them and they went after them

451
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:41,887
with whatever was popular at the time

452
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:59,587
Now they make Hostel, they make these
torture porn movies for kids, but then…

453
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:04,448
These pictures all have a lot to
say and they're all very interesting.

454
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,813
Most of them are shit, but
every so often theres a good one.

455
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:11,205
Along with the proliferation
of teen exploitation films,

456
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,586
new ways of depictions of sex

457
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,545
in exploitation cinema were also
finding their way into the market place.

458
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:21,350
But upon closer investigation,
it would appear that both

459
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,013
of these markets may have
shared a common audience.

460
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:26,333
How many times have I
told you not to walk around

461
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,300
the house like that!
- But dad, it's only a slip.

462
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:33,069
You heard what I said! No go upstairs
and put something on. - But dad.

463
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:36,447
You know, I'm not really sure how
many people actually went to go the the

464
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:39,559
Beach Party movies, because when I was
a kid we all thought they were square.

465
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,266
I think they were actually aimed at
adults! You know Sam Arkoff was the guy.

466
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:46,810
No, no, it's the teenage market we don't
need money in these old tired stars.

467
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:49,673
And what do you see Buster Keaton! All
of a sudden, the Beach Party movies,

468
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,995
they were supposed to
be aimed at kids and they

469
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:54,859
started bringing Silent
Film stars out of retirement.

470
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,373
Please?
What kid would go see that?

471
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:02,797
But my father might?
- Papaya Surprise - Papaya Surprise?

472
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:05,424
Lord Love a Duck with Tuesday Weld.

473
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:08,530
Have you seen this movie?
No? Oh my God!

474
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:12,487
She's a High Schooler is is
trying on sweaters with her father,

475
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:16,158
who is getting sexually while
she's saying things like

476
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:19,024
Perrywinkle Pussycat.

477
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:23,353
Don't you just love it!
- Masterpiece film.

478
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:31,429
#SEXPLOITATION
FROM NUDIE CUTIES TO ROUGHIES#

479
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,407
In 1959, director Russ
Meyer took the sex film and

480
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:41,600
the celebration of female
nudity onscreen a step further.

481
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,271
Both voyeuristic and comical,
Meyer's The Immoral Mr. Teas

482
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:51,601
was the incarnation of a critical though
short lived style of exploitation movie.

483
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:54,528
Russ invented the Nudie Cutie

484
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:57,024
Besides placing naked
women in a contemporary

485
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,737
setting outside of the nudist camps,

486
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:05,283
The Immoral Mr. Teas featured something
that nobody else had ever thought a plot.

487
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,283
The Immoral Mr. Teas had a plot and in that
plot there were situations with naked girls.

488
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,969
The nudit cuties were
very, very innocent and

489
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,545
they were basically like pin
up calendars come to life.

490
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:19,110
Russ is very influential to
that he made a movie with a plot.

491
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:23,404
Kinda like The Great Train
Robbery, Edwin S. Porter.

492
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:27,343
These movies and their importance to the
history of cinema and narrative filmmaking

493
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,913
Russ is that way to the history of porno,
because he made those Nudie Cuties.

494
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:36,163
Nudie cuties were unashamed in
their depictions of nudity on screen.

495
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:41,074
The girls were plentiful and the
storylines equally ridiculous.

496
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:45,179
But as the cycle of “nudie
cuties” continued to proliferate,

497
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,164
a darker and more sinister style
of film was also about to emerge.

498
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:53,424
Get up!
- Get away from her!

499
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:59,407
When the violence was added,
they were later called roughies

500
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:03,629
“Roughies” were just that:
rough, violent, and raw.

501
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,712
These films offered a
startling and uncompromising

502
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:09,278
view of the battle between the sexes;

503
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,007
a dramatic contrast to the
sexual revolution that lay ahead.

504
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:18,087
You can certainly see elements of what
are often referred to as the Roughies

505
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:22,476
in movies as early
as Violated from 1953

506
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,582
and The Lonely Sex from
later on in the 50s.

507
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,699
Like nudist camp magazines
that inspired those films,

508
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,896
the “roughies” were adapted
from men's pulp magazines.

509
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:35,961
Take a look at what they are reading.
Go on, they won't even know you're there.

510
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:40,085
You had Men's Magazines,
you know that kind of fixated

511
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:45,713
on these notions of women in
danger; tied up and lashed.

512
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:51,160
It's pulled from the dark ressess
of peoples minds, ya know.

513
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:54,814
And predominetly men.

514
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,166
No please, no.

515
00:33:57,205 --> 00:34:02,604
That these were the male fantasies
that were turned into movies

516
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:07,112
When these kinda pictures started to
play, again when I was in Philidelphia

517
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:09,376
there were always at theaters
that would run pictures

518
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:12,384
like Olga's House of
Shame and stuff like that.

519
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:15,818
These pictures were they had a
clientele, they were pretty popular.

520
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:18,610
The Roughies grew out
of the Nudie Cutie.

521
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,975
And they're ugly, they're
ugly movies really.

522
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,261
Discovering a squeeler
amoung her girls,

523
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:27,158
Olga cuts out a part of a girls
tongue as a warning to the others.

524
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:31,811
More than just the next
phase in sexploitation films

525
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,063
the “Roughies” represented a deeper
shift in the nation's subconscious.

526
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,320
You could say that roughies developed
because the culture got really violent.

527
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:46,557
1963 was really the end of the 50s.

528
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:55,196
In the grindhouse come these
movies, the Roughies where no

529
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:59,725
longer are the women on a
pedestal as objects of adoration.

530
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:05,456
They're things to be beaten
and whipped into submission.

531
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:10,795
That kind of product as it was
called was just not thought of in

532
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:14,410
the same breath as the kind of
things that played in normal theaters.

533
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:18,189
Films like The Lusting Hours,
directed by The Amero brothers,

534
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:22,656
helped to establish New York City as a major
player in the sexploitation film industry.

535
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:27,007
Featuring the likes of husband and
wife team Mike and Roberta Findley

536
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:30,413
and Doris Wishman the roughies
that emerged from New York

537
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:34,646
during the 1960s offer a glimpse
into the world of Times Square,

538
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:38,780
42nd Street and the
grindhouse theater lifestyle.

539
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:43,034
The movies coming out of New York
were cranked out like sausages.

540
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:47,220
They were being made by
people who were just going out,

541
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:51,255
making a movie maybe over the
course of a few weekends or so.

542
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:57,156
They, they really have this kind taste,
this sort of flavor of New York in the 1960s

543
00:35:57,826 --> 00:36:02,042
Once in a great while,
a sensational and starkly

544
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:05,488
realistic motion picture
comes to the screen.

545
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:10,437
This whole different type of film
developed where the sex was really intense.

546
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:14,269
And a huge part of the
reason for this, I believe,

547
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:18,424
is because you could
not show sex on screen.

548
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:21,983
So you had to show a substitute.

549
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:24,764
And violence was the substitute.

550
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:32,510
#GORE-GALORE#

551
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:36,859
Following their production of a
series of nudist camp movies, two men

552
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:40,461
Hershell Gordon Lewis and Dave
Friedman produced what is now

553
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:44,967
often regarded as the archetypal
“Roughie”, Scum of The Earth.

554
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:48,895
That same year, the duo stumbled
upon an idea for a new kind of movie

555
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,264
and the world of exploitation
would never be the same again.

556
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:54,597
Scum of The Earth
was a transitional picture.

557
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,468
It was the last picture I
ever shot in black and white.

558
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:03,713
Well it became clear after a while that
this particular kind of motion picture

559
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:07,885
that was getting into a field
that was terribly crowded because

560
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:11,727
the number of theaters that would
play it, that number was quite limited.

561
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:16,045
And the number of competitors,
well they were beginning to swarm

562
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,831
I began to think they
could fill Yankee Stadium.

563
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,775
The question then became the standard
question that I ask throughout my

564
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:26,375
what we might laughingly
call my feature film career.

565
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:29,986
What kind of motion
picture might there be

566
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:34,727
that the major film companies
either will not make or cannot make,

567
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:39,507
but a theater will play and somebody
might plop down in a chair to look at.

568
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:43,163
I was watching some ancient
gangster movie on television.

569
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:48,977
The police shot this fellow
full of bullet holes and I said

570
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:51,303
wait a minute
as his eyes closed.

571
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:53,810
I said, that's not right.

572
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:56,659
And that gave us the
idea for that marvelous

573
00:37:56,698 --> 00:38:00,453
four letter word
G- O-R-E.

574
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,782
Well the next questions was, what?

575
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:07,685
And so was born, Blood Feast

576
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:16,434
We were terrified. I was cutting this
thing in my little cutting room in Chicago,

577
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:20,905
and it was to use a euphamism ghastly.

578
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:29,339
So, we decided to open that movie in Peoria,
figuring if we die in Peoria, who will know?

579
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:35,804
Instantly, it was a gigantic smash.

580
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:39,938
So Dave and I looked at each other and said
What if we made a decent one?

581
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,676
With Blood Feast and it’s
follow up, Two Thousand Maniacs

582
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:48,418
Friedman and Lewis unleashed a
maddening onslaught of lacerated limbs,

583
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,732
dismembered maidens and
blood hungry hillbillies.

584
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:56,313
It's really hard to remember, or to
imagine for those of us who were not alive.

585
00:38:56,565 --> 00:39:00,301
What it must have been like to
see people be eviserated in movies.

586
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,214
Herschel is the genius
who first did that.

587
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:08,448
Oh my God.

588
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:13,044
And whether you think that his
movies are exciting or not exciting.

589
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,990
Great or terrible, they're
incredibly fucking important

590
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:19,257
because nobody had
ever thought to do that.

591
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:22,758
I'm not a big fan of Herschel Gordon
Lewis as a filmmaker, but wonderful posters

592
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:26,074
The campaign is more
important than the film itself!

593
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:28,859
You know, he had this
extreme gore but grand

594
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:31,098
I'll mispronounce it grand
guingold how do you say it?

595
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,953
But Grand gingold I'm embarassed.
The french word.

596
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,990
I cannot pronounce grand
guignol but I know what it means!

597
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,881
There used to be a theater in Paris
for many years, that would stage plays

598
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,529
where there were
murders and executions

599
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,621
and battle scenes with explicit gore.

600
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:53,438
So the idea of the gore movie, or the
gore piece has always been with us.

601
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:59,352
The key scene in Blood Feast, he reaches
into a girls mouth and pulls out her tongue.

602
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:03,852
And that became that watershed
scene that to this day

603
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:08,200
has been, its, its the one
that every film biographer

604
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,944
who cares about this kind
of movie singles out as

605
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:14,236
the scene that changed the
course of motion pictures.

606
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,378
The cultural impact of Blood Feast's
excessive violence is debatable,

607
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:22,966
but what is clear is the history of
contemporary violence in American cinema

608
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:28,000
owes a debt to different film that
debuted three years before Blood Feast,

609
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:33,456
was directed by the premiere film artist
of his day and released by a major studio.

610
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:39,102
Well I think the movie would be the
movie that changed violence was Psycho.

611
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:49,736
Everybody after that had
the liberation to do what

612
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,777
was in their minds based on the
success and acceptence of Psycho.

613
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:59,611
In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock's
Psycho was released.

614
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:03,633
Utilizing similar marketing tactics
that would make The 40 Thieves proud,

615
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:08,124
much of Psycho's success had to do with the
advertising methods used to promote the film

616
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:11,945
offering further proof that the
distinction between Hollywood

617
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:15,668
and exploitation films boils
down to little more than

618
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:18,576
the cost and quality of
the individual productions.

619
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:22,427
So the question begs to
be asked is there really

620
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:25,113
much of a difference
between these two films?

621
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,226
Other than the fact that somebody using
a knife on another person and they're

622
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:31,914
both shot on a motion picture film, I
don't see too many great similarities.

623
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:37,427
In terms of exploitation, I
see great similarities between

624
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:41,080
a film like Blood Feast
and a movie like Psycho.

625
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,903
Hitchcock's film was pure ballyhoo.

626
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:48,251
I mean he had a brilliant
marketing campain for that.

627
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:50,740
The entire motion
picture indusry knows that

628
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,649
Psycho is being exhibited a
special presentation policy.

629
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:57,867
A creation of Paramount
Pictures showmanship!

630
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,266
Alfred Hitchcock when he makes Psycho,

631
00:42:00,306 --> 00:42:05,538
truly he wants every single person
in America to see that movie.

632
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:11,317
I believe that his motivations are almost
exactly the same as Friedman and Lewis.

633
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,811
What do these movies have in
common? Quite a bit actually

634
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,909
See the movie version that TV
didn't dare show! Uncut! Intact!

635
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,210
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
- Ballyhoo, PT Barnum you know.

636
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:24,064
It's all about getting the suckers in.

637
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,249
#THE TIMES...
THEY ARE A CHANGIN'#

638
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:36,014
As the 1960s ended, so would
The Hollywood Production Code.

639
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:39,920
Spanning over thirty years
and countless motion pictures,

640
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,657
the views of The Production
Code had clearly grown out

641
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:45,565
of touch with the changing
times and societal views.

642
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:49,922
In order to adapt, the studios
introduced a new rating system.

643
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:53,999
This seal is a part of the self-regulation
of the Motion Picture Association.

644
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,015
It means that the film
displying this seal is within

645
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,758
the creative boudries of
reason and good judgment.

646
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:02,437
And that the theaters showing
this film, supports the code

647
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:06,301
And with the changes in the ratings
system, came a new and expanded audience.

648
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,955
Orgy, orgy! Have an orgy!

649
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:11,833
This period in American
film history was the most

650
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:14,629
exciting and liberating
since the pre-Code era.

651
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:19,186
I blinked in 1965 and
suddenly the 60s appeared.

652
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:24,096
When I left everybody had short hair,
when I came back everybody had long hair,

653
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,222
they were smoking dope, the Beatles
had just played The Hollywood Bowl.

654
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:30,797
And everything changed overnight.

655
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:34,478
With the 1966 film The Wild Angels,

656
00:43:34,553 --> 00:43:37,559
American International
Pictures took the conventions of

657
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,329
the previous decade's youth market
films and embelished them with

658
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:45,530
a contemporary view to reflect
America's growing counter culture.

659
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:51,215
Just what is it that you want to do?
- Well we want to be free.

660
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,654
We want to be free to, to do what we
want to do. We want to be free to ride.

661
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,068
We want to be free to ride our machines
without being hassled by The Man

662
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,654
And then of course when the
sixties came, there were some really

663
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:08,202
intersting political movies. All these
movies about the youth generation.

664
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:12,243
Individual against the collective
conforming society and all that.

665
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:15,819
And in these movies they
condemn drugs, drugs are bad.

666
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,448
Unless you're in the movie
and then they're pretty good!

667
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:23,350
During this time, you would
see drug movies everywhere.

668
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:29,848
There's nothing wrong with
blowing a grass! - Yeah!

669
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:32,114
You can do it a thousand times
and never go to harder drugs!

670
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,509
I think, the only time
I think I've ever been

671
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,168
able to understand myself
was on an acid trip.

672
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:42,827
So even outside of what you were getting
in legitimate exploitation cinema,

673
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:45,324
you were getting
in your classroom.

674
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:49,893
If you become a pothead, you risk blowing
the most important time of your life

675
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:53,468
Im Peter Fonda. We've just
come back from making a movie,

676
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:57,175
dealing with the most talked
about sujects of the day; LSD

677
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:02,808
Drugs were always around.
Psychadelics didn't really arrive

678
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:05,455
until the late sixties even though

679
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:08,657
there are little traces of psychadellia
in The Tingler for instance.

680
00:45:08,715 --> 00:45:13,270
Dave, that drug you brought?
- It's not a drug, it's an acid

681
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:17,635
The trip he has in that movie is
not that interesting to me

682
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:22,531
The walls! The walls!

683
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:25,668
The walls!

684
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:29,138
The exploitation films produced for
the youth market during the late sixties

685
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:32,502
featured a mind-numbing array
of anarchistic attitudes,

686
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,695
sexual freedom, and graphic violence.

687
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:41,486
Not even the Godfather of Gore himself could
resist the allure of a rumbling motorbike.

688
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:44,110
American International
was making biker movies,

689
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:46,407
but their biker movies
were all of a pattern.

690
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:51,412
I thought we could brake that mold by having
female bikers who in fact became dominant.

691
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:54,263
Man Eaters, get those ugly mothers!

692
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:57,518
There's no question who ran
the show in She Devils On Wheels.

693
00:45:57,578 --> 00:46:01,295
And that's why its so funny when someone
says some of my movies were sexist,

694
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:05,226
that we take it all out on women and I say
"Ever see She Devils on Wheels?"

695
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:11,142
In 1969, inspired by the financial
success of American International Picture’s

696
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:15,569
earlier biker movies, Columbia
Pictures released Easy Rider.

697
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:18,869
A film that would eventually
come to symbolize the era.

698
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:22,733
Easy Rider is a picture that exists
because of exploitation pictures.

699
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:27,784
I don’t think that itself it is,
because I think it's a message movie.

700
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:31,872
It does not have a
clear western like plot.

701
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:34,473
It's basically an odyssey.

702
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:38,090
America's growing opposition to
the Vietnam War inspired a number of

703
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:42,210
low budget filmmakers who sprang
into action with their own responses.

704
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,717
The result was a handful of
angry and nihilistic pictures

705
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:49,061
that now depicted
America’s youth as victims.

706
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:52,869
Here's the first motion picture
two offer, to the daring,

707
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:58,201
a look into the final, maddening
space between life and death.

708
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,935
The Last House On The Left.

709
00:47:02,995 --> 00:47:08,894
To avoid fainting, keep repeating:
Its only a movie; Only a movie

710
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:12,849
You see Last House On The Left is
interesting because it is so nasty.

711
00:47:12,908 --> 00:47:16,097
I want you to take the gun. And
I want you to put in your mouth

712
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:21,138
and I want you to blow your
brains out! Blow your brains out!

713
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:26,626
And just in your face sick.

714
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:29,831
That a studio would
have never made that.

715
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:33,073
You would have never seen that
in any way except exploitation.

716
00:47:40,062 --> 00:47:44,438
Growing up in the sixties,
nothing was holy anymore.

717
00:47:47,022 --> 00:47:50,253
We were growing up as
Americans and I think probably

718
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:53,187
were experiencing our own
history for the first time.

719
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:58,504
As the 1960s counter culture
movement evolved and expanded,

720
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:03,023
evil was no longer restricted to the
conventions of low budget monster movies.

721
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,551
Now, in the wake of the
Manson Family murders

722
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:10,515
and Vietnam, the face
of fear was human.

723
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:16,386
I wanted to poke your eyes out
while you were feeling it in your gut.

724
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:20,410
Ya know.

725
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:24,097
And to cut your dick off
while you were smelling roses.

726
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:30,268
With 1972's The Last House on The
Left, Wes Craven used Swedish director

727
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,402
Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring
as a source of inspiration for

728
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:39,643
his first film and as an indirect
response to an raging and unpopular war.

729
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:45,804
I had a subway car empty out on me
once, when I was just sitting there.

730
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,871
And this was because all of the
posters were up in the subway so God

731
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,327
of course people were going to
look at the posters and see me there

732
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,833
with a fucking knife like this,
ya' know and they're gonna go

733
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:56,237
I gotta get outta here!
Ya' know.

734
00:48:56,277 --> 00:49:00,948
But even an exploitation film with a
social message needs a bit of ballyhoo.

735
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:06,807
Last House's infamous marketing campaign
proved successful, if not wholey original.

736
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:12,307
The promotional tagline "Its Only a
Movie" had in fact alrady been used to

737
00:49:12,346 --> 00:49:17,671
market Herschel Gordon Lewis' "Color
Me Blood Red" released 7 years earlier.

738
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:22,911
You must keep reminding yourself:
It's just a movie; It's just a movie.

739
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:28,258
The counter culture movement
of the late sixties had been

740
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,741
immideitly proceeded and inspired
by the Civil Rights Movement.

741
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:36,332
Even before the so-called black
exploitation boom of the 1970s,

742
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:40,052
low budget filmmakers had been
quick to exploit racial tension in

743
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:43,886
a series of politically charged
potboilers, which often remain

744
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:48,133
overlooked when re-counting the
evolution of exploitation films.

745
00:49:49,827 --> 00:49:52,985
Movies are reactionary,
people don't understand that.

746
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:57,260
Movies are certainly infuential. But
the reality is, its called the business.

747
00:49:57,298 --> 00:49:59,808
They want to sell tickets,
so they will make anything

748
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:03,402
Hitler Eats A Baby they will
make anything, if it makes money.

749
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:10,125
#BLAXPLOITATION
YOU DIG?#

750
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:18,253
Shaft! Hotter than Bond.
Cooler than Bullit!

751
00:50:18,293 --> 00:50:22,582
They started making a lot of
movies for a black audience.

752
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:26,649
To exploit The Civil Rights movement
and the trouble in the country.

753
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:31,027
C'mon run! Run!

754
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:35,362
Melvin Van Peebles, who was an
avant garde artist and playwright;

755
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:38,687
he made a movie called Sweet
Sweetback's Baaaad Assss Song.

756
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:41,547
And it was made down and dirty.
It was made the same time I was

757
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:44,576
making Schlock we shared equipment,
I don't know if you knew that.

758
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:47,534
According to legend, only
two theaters in America

759
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:51,121
would agree to play 'Sweet
Sweetback's Badasss Song.

760
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,536
On it's opening night in Detroit,
the film broke theater attendance

761
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:58,354
records and would eventually
gross over 4 million dollars.

762
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,579
The film's success inspired both
exploitation filmmakers and mainstream

763
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:07,646
studios alike to make films that depicted
inner city life from a black perspective.

764
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:11,571
At a time of racial division in
America, inner city audiences rushed

765
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,307
to the theaters to see movies that
portrayed them in a heroic light.

766
00:51:15,346 --> 00:51:18,747
Eventually the movie industry was
forced to sit up and take notice.

767
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:22,322
And the era of the
black hero had arrived

768
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:27,001
Oooo, Super Fly! Success of
the new notion picture Super Fly

769
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,266
had brought Ron O'Neal to
sudden nation wide attention.

770
00:51:30,322 --> 00:51:34,126
Here he talks about how they made the
film in which he takes the title role.

771
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:38,624
Above all I think we wanted to
make a, a film that was realistic

772
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:41,052
in content, realistic in nature.

773
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:44,186
A black man becomes a
hustler, because he is forced

774
00:51:44,243 --> 00:51:49,439
into it or led into it
by socio-economic force.

775
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:51,979
Because being a hustler
is not a fun thing.

776
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:54,723
In the days of the chitlin
circuit, where you'd make

777
00:51:54,762 --> 00:51:56,982
black westerns or whatever it was.

778
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,700
This suddenly, was for
black and white audiences.

779
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:02,476
Hey, what kinda talk
is that soul brother?

780
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:06,940
Don't you know that black is beautiful?
- It was something to be proud of.

781
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:11,162
I mean to see the black audience
seeing their super heros on screen.

782
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,173
It was just amazing. It was
just a great time for the

783
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:17,151
black audience because we
weren't used to seeing that.

784
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:21,217
Blaxploitation may have been popular
among audiences of all colors,

785
00:52:21,294 --> 00:52:26,671
but some critics suggest that these films
contributed to cultural stereotypes and,

786
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:30,111
in some cases, even
promoted reverse racism.

787
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:33,975
People criticized Coffy
and Foxy Brown for being

788
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:37,551
almost racist from the
black point of view?

789
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,791
And my feeling was well why not?

790
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:46,678
We've been watching racist
movies all our lives.

791
00:52:46,756 --> 00:52:50,427
Why not see what it looked like
from the other side and enjoy it.

792
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:52,892
And I thought it was fun.

793
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:56,133
One actor whose image transcended
the characters associated with

794
00:52:56,177 --> 00:53:01,697
blaxploitation stereotypes was former
AFL Defensive Back, Fred Williamson.

795
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,255
Never a pimp, never a
pusher and always a hero.

796
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,958
Williamson's acting career went well
beyond the exploitation market of the 1970s.

797
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,257
Damn brother, you have
become one violent dude!

798
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:20,048
What we needed at
the time, were heroes.

799
00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:23,658
We needed physical hereos.

800
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:26,726
We didn't need, we didn't need
creative heroes, we didn't need actors.

801
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:30,014
We needed somebody saying:
You spray that water on me

802
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,776
If you put those dogs on
me, I'm killin' them and

803
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,160
when I'm done with them,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

804
00:53:35,468 --> 00:53:39,782
I don't do no singin; I don't do no
dancin' and you aint kilin' me and

805
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:42,952
I'm winning my fights and I'm gonna
get that girl - that's it - bottom line.

806
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:45,636
People like movies about
the wrong side of the law,

807
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:48,620
so I didn’t see that Black
Caesar for example was

808
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:52,373
anything different than
Little Ceasar or Pulic Enemy.

809
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:56,490
When I was a kid, sometimes I liked the
second features better than the first ones.

810
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,786
Those pictures meant more
to me than the big lavish

811
00:53:58,825 --> 00:54:01,274
MGM movie that played
as the main feature.

812
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,871
I liked the second feature better.

813
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,060
So I set out to make a couple
of good second features.

814
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:12,336
Well known for his guerilla style filmmaking
Larry Cohen's productions are notorious

815
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:15,480
not only for their content
but also for the bold and

816
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,339
occasionally illegal ways
in which they were made.

817
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:22,200
Larry Cohen is a shamless filmmaker.
It was shameless.

818
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,878
It was just to hear that certain
audience on 42nd Street go Yeeeeeeah!

819
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:31,227
From crowded Times Square to the
LAX baggage claim, Cohen rarely

820
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:36,154
if at all sought proper shooting permits
to make his movies in public places.

821
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,693
I learned a lot from Larry
Cohen. I learned how to

822
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:42,085
steal shots and how to do
big scenes without permits.

823
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:52,596
When we did the scene in Black Ceasar
when I get shot coming out of Tiffany's.

824
00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:55,651
I'm going down the street and
everybody they're slowing down and

825
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:58,302
they're looking at me like they don't wanna
be involved, who is this idiot down there?

826
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:01,225
And they see blood. Now for sure
they don't want to be involved.

827
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:04,414
And then I went across the
street and I fell on garbage can,

828
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:06,900
I fell up against the wall;
and people just look at me.

829
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:10,986
Nobody, nobody came by. Finally after
all of this which they didn't get on film

830
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,738
a cop came by and he says:
Hammer, whachyou doin'?

831
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:17,292
You shootin a movie here? You gotta
a permit. He said, I'm not asking.

832
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:20,752
I'm walking around the block. I'll
be back in 15 minutes. Be gone.

833
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,830
I said, ok but would you mind moving over cause
you're in my shot. Just move over a little bit.

834
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,367
As this era drew to a close, many
of the black exploitation films

835
00:55:28,427 --> 00:55:30,994
moved to parodies of the genre.

836
00:55:31,134 --> 00:55:34,061
These films began to turn away
from the social statements that had

837
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:38,141
been incorporated early on and
featured more outrageous storylines.

838
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:44,048
Hide your mamas.
Big brother is comin'.

839
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:48,469
Well, I feel two ways
about it. Its ashame that

840
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:51,912
African American artists had

841
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:55,722
this small window, into film.

842
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,759
That this was where the majority
of African Americans got to work.

843
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:02,928
And they were all, sort
of exploitation movies.

844
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:08,374
I think it was an incredibly creative time.
So. I found that I had more freedom,

845
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,548
within that context. You see thats
the other thing about exploitation.

846
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:14,985
If you deliver the elements of
exploitation that's all they care about.

847
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:18,073
So you're not dealing with
people who are cutting you

848
00:56:18,114 --> 00:56:22,686
and re-cutting you
and casting, you know.

849
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,731
Bassically, he delivers the
action, he delivers the nudity,

850
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:31,753
he delivers the gunfight, the, the
fist fights, the chases leave him alone.

851
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:36,289
Within the context of delivering the
exploitation, you get to be incredibly free

852
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:44,268
#THEY CAED THEIR BODIES...
BUT NOT THEIR DESIRES#

853
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:49,279
Women, locked behind
walls of concrete and steel.

854
00:56:49,337 --> 00:56:52,483
Guarded by barbed wire and
guns in a tropical hell.

855
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:54,744
They call it: The Big Dollhouse

856
00:56:54,804 --> 00:56:59,486
In 1970, director Jack
Hill made The Big Dollhouse.

857
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:03,952
Capitalizing on a decade of civil
unrest, the Philippines set action'er

858
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:08,609
transported the tride and true
formula of women in prison films

859
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:12,234
to an unnamed banana
republic, where forced labor,

860
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:15,730
prostitution and jungle warfare
was the name of the game.

861
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,171
Well it was the first real big huge
major hit of that type of movie,

862
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:22,971
it wasn't the first film
made on that subject matter.

863
00:57:23,034 --> 00:57:26,078
Watch out for her,
she likes to wrestle.

864
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:30,263
Women in prison films have
been around a long time.

865
00:57:30,304 --> 00:57:33,100
And those films are pretty sympathic
towards women in prison.

866
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,345
Each day the crimal courts
condemed scores of unfortunate girls

867
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:39,411
to prisons that need reforming
more than the prioners

868
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:42,637
So when I got back to the states.

869
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,618
Everybody was really
excited about the movie.

870
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:49,652
Which was great because when I read the
script I thought it was just horrible

871
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:52,471
I couldn't, I thought all God
what am I going to do with this?

872
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:56,967
Truthfully when you look at
that movie now, it's very sophomoric.

873
00:57:57,721 --> 00:58:00,894
Well, you don't look like
a hardened ciminal to me

874
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:09,519
I don't want to do things for Greer any
more. I'd like to do something for you.

875
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:15,184
And at the same time in a naïve
way it was ahead of it's time,

876
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:19,190
The triumph of The Big Dollhouse
was it's depiction of women

877
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,982
not only as the central characters,
but also the as aggressors.

878
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:25,823
Get it up, or I'll cut it off

879
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:29,759
These women confronted Freudian
complexities and shed the shackles of a male

880
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:35,478
dominated society albeit while wearing
minimal clothing and taking group showers.

881
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:39,802
Well, well, I have to say
that I like naked sweaty women.

882
00:58:39,863 --> 00:58:42,751
So I guess Women In
Prison films, are, are.

883
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:46,491
I enjoy Women In Prison films.
I don't watch them frequently

884
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:49,274
but if there was a Women
In Prison film playing

885
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,768
on 42nd st I'd make
a point of seeing it.

886
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:55,071
Women like to watch other
women naked and doing things.

887
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:57,693
I'm sorry, its something
that women like.

888
00:58:58,395 --> 00:59:01,200
Women don't have a problem with it.
Women like it.

889
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:06,810
Women get turned on by it too.
Wha, what?

890
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:15,407
Well I wrote The Big Birdcage
as a sequel to The Big Dollhouse.

891
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:20,196
And during the year after The
Big Dollhouse came out it was

892
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:25,120
so widely imitated everybody rushed out
with copies of it and even on television

893
00:59:25,181 --> 00:59:29,446
and so the only thing I could
do was to kinda do a spoof on it

894
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:33,415
and to make fun of the genre
in a way but still serious.

895
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:39,049
In The Big Birdcage, Hill turned the
Women In Prison Film convention on its ear,

896
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:42,447
by having his characters break
into the prison and placing

897
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:45,752
the caged women under the
watchful eyes of gay prison guards.

898
00:59:45,811 --> 00:59:48,978
Don't play coy with me missy,
you don't have anything

899
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,643
I would be interested in
anyway - Hi there, Rocco.

900
00:59:53,702 --> 00:59:58,727
You big stud. What's up?
- Nothing's up for you!

901
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:02,196
We had talked about doing another sequel
and I had the idea of a movie called

902
01:00:02,257 --> 01:00:06,268
The Pirate Women of Zambowanga,
but the genre kinda cooled off

903
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:09,678
and I didn't want to go back
to the Philippines again.

904
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:15,587
#THE SCHLOCKY...
SEVENTIES#

905
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:21,525
The Corpse Grinders.

906
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:28,411
Do you know what this is?
It’s a corpse grinding machine.

907
01:00:28,552 --> 01:00:33,009
I think that probably The Corpse Grinders is
the most famous at least in this country.

908
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:35,797
Corpse Grinders was a big
thing here in the United States.

909
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:39,790
The plot of the film was these
two guys that decided that

910
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:43,490
they wanted to make cat food and
they couldn't get ingrediants.

911
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,920
Couldn't get enough grain and so
on. So they decided well cadavers.

912
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:51,957
Directed by Ted V. Mikels,
The Corpse Grinders typifies

913
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:55,381
the filmmaker's love for
the absurd and ridiculous.

914
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,466
Completely devoid of any
socio-political subtext of the time,

915
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:04,875
most of the horror films from the 1970s
reflected the true spirit of exploitation;

916
01:01:05,134 --> 01:01:08,338
if an audience is curious enough
to see something outrageous,

917
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:11,176
then there will always be
someone to take the ticket.

918
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:14,560
A title like Corpse Grinders
is something different, unusual.

919
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:17,101
The Indredible
Two-Headed Transplant!

920
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:22,200
Written by James Gordon White, The
Incredible Two Headed Transplant

921
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:25,274
mixed the element of carny
freak show monstrosities

922
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:29,289
and the Frankenstein mythos
for modern horror audiences.

923
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:35,886
The Incredible Two Headed Transplant
was really a send-up of Frankenstein.

924
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:38,914
At least that’s what I thought,
when I was writing it.

925
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:43,940
It was meant to be just a
lite, little horror movie.

926
01:01:43,979 --> 01:01:47,349
Yet everyone just seems to
think it's just terrible.

927
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:51,952
People will sit through most movies.
No matter how shitty.

928
01:01:51,996 --> 01:01:54,268
People will actually.
Well I'm here now!

929
01:01:54,313 --> 01:01:57,363
Dracula Versus Frankenstein!

930
01:01:58,016 --> 01:02:01,656
It'll get better. We've been here an
hour and a half, it will get better.

931
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:05,426
Most of the exploitation films
of this era share one simple goal

932
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:08,845
to entertain audiences
and therefore, make a buck.

933
01:02:08,887 --> 01:02:11,237
The motion picture industry
has always prospered during

934
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:15,669
times of social turmoil and
the 1970s was no exception.

935
01:02:15,705 --> 01:02:20,308
Americans will always look for an escape
during dark days and storytellers like

936
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:25,988
Mikels and White prove that the carnie
spirit of exploitation will never change.

937
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:31,400
Overall my movies, I, I never wanted

938
01:02:31,477 --> 01:02:33,982
to make the great American movie.

939
01:02:34,023 --> 01:02:36,921
I wanted to entertain and

940
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,672
entertain myself while I
was working on the script

941
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:44,333
and then hopefully entertain an
audience so when the saw the movie.

942
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:47,010
If you're going to entertain people
you've got to grab their attention.

943
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:50,013
More spine tingling thrills.

944
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:52,462
More bone crusing
terror, terror, terror...

945
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,213
#SEND IN...
THE NAZIS#

946
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:03,050
The first phase of our operation
will be to remove The Messiah

947
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:07,335
Written by, co-produced and
co-starring James Gordon White,

948
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:11,604
The Tormentors a Nazi
versus Jesus action thriller

949
01:03:11,993 --> 01:03:14,638
is a rarely mentioned
foray into the curious

950
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:19,538
sub-genre of grindhouse cinema
known as Nazi Exploitation.

951
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,540
You will have a hard time
convincing a lot of people of

952
01:03:23,598 --> 01:03:27,808
the inherint Entertainment
Value of Nazi Exploitation films.

953
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:33,086
The Nazi Exploitation movies to me,
the image is of a semi-clad girl,

954
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:36,089
tied to a post being whipped.

955
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:39,387
And although there was
some of that in the 40s,

956
01:03:39,445 --> 01:03:43,260
it didn't really take
off until the 60s and 70s.

957
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:46,021
As the years go on and the
pictures get more and more graphic,

958
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,671
you really start to get beyond any
kind of concept of taste, whatsoever.

959
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:54,277
And the Nazis simply exist as a

960
01:03:54,337 --> 01:03:59,963
excuse to for images of horror
and degradation, sex and murder.

961
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:06,955
So you cannot honestly say Don
Edmonds was inspired to make

962
01:04:06,994 --> 01:04:10,213
an anti-Nazi film because of
his strong political feelings.

963
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:17,463
Well that movie was a picture
that I had been directing stuff.

964
01:04:19,012 --> 01:04:22,587
Again, low budget
stuff. I would shoot,

965
01:04:22,643 --> 01:04:26,413
in those days you know rent was 85
bucks a month and I couldn't make it

966
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:30,070
and I had balled tires on my car and
no gasoline in it anyway so, you know.

967
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:32,574
Just a broke guy
walking around Hollywood.

968
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:35,968
So I go into the
Intercontinental Hotel on Sunset

969
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:39,273
and here's this guy very distinguished
with the grey hair with the thing

970
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:43,197
and the suit and the thing and I meet
him in the coffee shop and he says

971
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:47,439
I'd like you to ah look at our film,
you come highly recommended,

972
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:50,083
I've seen some of your other pictures.

973
01:04:50,105 --> 01:04:54,806
I said 'sure'. I went home and I
read "Ilsa: She Wolf of The S.S."

974
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:00,696
And I'm reading this thing.

975
01:05:01,223 --> 01:05:05,007
this is the worst piece of
SHIT I have ever read in my

976
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:07,840
you know I'm going through.
I don't know if I can do this?

977
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:10,585
I, I…nobody has ever
done a film like this.

978
01:05:10,642 --> 01:05:13,440
I've never seen one! Well I said
that this is a terrible film.

979
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:17,863
You can't make it! Its a frontery
to everything and man.

980
01:05:17,903 --> 01:05:23,445
And I'm looking at this fucking money
man and this guy is dealing cash...CASH!

981
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:26,952
And then the total
whore in me comes out.

982
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,757
There maybe some underlying things
that we can that and I signed up.

983
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:35,793
Heil Hitler!
- Well you know in the ensuing time after

984
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:40,755
I became this incredible
whore and gonna do this movie.

985
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:44,661
I started looking at it like I
bought the job, I gotta do it.

986
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:47,664
I said I'm gonna go
balls out on this thing.

987
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:52,329
If I've never seen it, than the people have
never seen it cause I've seen all this stuff

988
01:05:52,586 --> 01:05:56,950
I thought Don Edomond's Ilsa She Wolf
of The S.S. was an amazing movie.

989
01:05:57,012 --> 01:06:01,460
I thought the script was great. I
thought it was smart, it was inventive.

990
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:06,914
But after that, I thought that a lot of
the films were uninspired and depressing.

991
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:11,384
Because, you know, there is
only so much you can do with Nazis.

992
01:06:12,128 --> 01:06:14,725
It's like Don Edmonds
created the kind of

993
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:20,580
Hogan's Heroes of
Nazi Prison Camp Movies

994
01:06:21,913 --> 01:06:26,502
The otutlandish Hogan's Heroes
spirit in Ilsa: She Wolf of The S.S

995
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:29,439
should come as no surprise
while viewing the film,

996
01:06:29,478 --> 01:06:33,761
it was in fact filmed on the same
sets of the popular television series.

997
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:36,568
If you're going to be
outrageous; be outrageous.

998
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:39,858
And I did.

999
01:06:43,787 --> 01:06:47,180
#PORN-O-COPIA#

1000
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:53,101
By the 1970s, sex in grindhouse
cinema had reached it's climax

1001
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:57,751
Clearly this was all
leading up to pornography.

1002
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:01,853
Right? And then it
was like, well now that

1003
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,656
we can actually show
sex everything changed.

1004
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:09,000
And then it really became
a question of now that

1005
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:12,133
you can see it, what is
it that you want to see.

1006
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:17,105
And the porn theaters were downtown and in
grungy areas and you felt dirty going to 'em

1007
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:20,846
You gotta be kidding me?
This is a dirty movie.

1008
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:25,239
Do you wann see people
happily making love on camera?

1009
01:07:25,303 --> 01:07:28,617
Or do you still wanna
see, the ugly stuff?

1010
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:31,143
The people making the
films, the early porn films

1011
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:33,840
thought they were really
doing something great.

1012
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:37,463
They actually thought
there was culturally very,

1013
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:39,850
very significant about
what they were doing.

1014
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:45,530
That they were liberating the culture from
its stayed, old fashioned, puritan ethic.

1015
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:48,233
That lasted only so long.

1016
01:07:48,386 --> 01:07:51,570
By the time of Deep Throat. I
mean that became a phenomenon where

1017
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:54,945
it was respectable almost. I mean
everybody went to see Deep Throat.

1018
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:00,321
Lets watch Deep Throat. No time to
masterbate, we've got to fornicate.

1019
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:04,599
With the wide theatrical
release of Deep Throat in 1972,

1020
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,642
the business of soft core
pornography had essentially ended.

1021
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:12,801
The Amazing Transplant!

1022
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:17,877
While many producers from the classic era of
sexploitation continued to produce for time,

1023
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:21,289
what they knew best, these
filmmakers were eventually

1024
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:25,442
either forced to adapt or
gracefully bow out of the game.

1025
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:28,495
When Deep Throat opened,
it was the gold rush.

1026
01:08:28,552 --> 01:08:34,442
Everybody who had access to a 35 mm
camera both here on the West Coast

1027
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:36,721
and the East Coast were
running out and making

1028
01:08:36,753 --> 01:08:40,757
hardcore porn films,
and making tons of money.

1029
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,000
This is a culture for salesmen.

1030
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,831
And that's what America is all about; the
bottom line America is about making money.

1031
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:52,550
Because anything that makes money is good.

1032
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:55,832
It's American. In the
terms of the business,

1033
01:08:55,872 --> 01:08:58,947
a profitable picture,
is a good picture.

1034
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:08,277
#THE FINAL GRIND
...OR IS IT?#

1035
01:09:09,296 --> 01:09:13,596
And action! - Gun
doesn't work. - Cut!

1036
01:09:13,637 --> 01:09:18,855
Upon the release of Jaws in 1975,
the line between Hollywood blockbuster

1037
01:09:18,913 --> 01:09:21,835
and drive-in second
features had became blurred.

1038
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:25,949
Exploitation and mainstream
cinema had merged as the convetions

1039
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:30,732
of b-movie monster mayhem met
with massive box office success.

1040
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,729
What I've found is whether
it's Warner Brothers, Paramount,

1041
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:37,871
Universal, Fox, Columbia,
they're going to steal from you.

1042
01:09:37,951 --> 01:09:41,008
I mean they're all pretty
much equally dishonest,

1043
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,465
just some are more
upfront than others.

1044
01:09:43,504 --> 01:09:46,865
Jaws was a phenomenon partly because
it was a terrific movie and also because

1045
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,527
it was based on a big best seller
and it had a tremendous release,

1046
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:52,201
you know advertising
and lots of play dates.

1047
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:57,425
It is really just a big budget version
of The Creature From The Black Lagoon

1048
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,642
which even Steven
Spielberg has admitted.

1049
01:10:00,919 --> 01:10:04,512
You make a studio picture and you have an
oppurtunity with bigger budget and enough to

1050
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:07,782
you know hopefully
make a better product.

1051
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:10,125
But, it's the same business

1052
01:10:10,185 --> 01:10:14,770
Following the astounding success of
Jaws, low budget exploitation versions of

1053
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:18,536
“man versus animal” horror
movies quickly flooded the market.

1054
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:21,555
It was now the exploitation
filmmakers who were looking

1055
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:25,574
to knock off and capitalize
on the big studio films.

1056
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:31,245
Pirannha was, unfortunately
came two years after Jaws

1057
01:10:31,307 --> 01:10:34,165
and right around the time that
Jaws II was going to be released

1058
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:37,509
and it had ocurred to me that
maybe it was a little late

1059
01:10:37,588 --> 01:10:39,979
for a rip off of a picture
that was two years old.

1060
01:10:40,038 --> 01:10:42,528
Roll 'em! I mean action,
whatever I mean...

1061
01:10:42,568 --> 01:10:47,498
A Los Angeles distributor of
exploitation films named Frank Woods

1062
01:10:47,538 --> 01:10:51,989
who owned a small film company,
decided that he wanted to start

1063
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:56,273
making films himself and a
friend of his had written a script

1064
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:58,518
about a giant alligator which

1065
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:03,278
I guess was to be a rip off of Jaws.

1066
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,322
So I loved the idea, but the
script was awful I agreed to

1067
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:13,348
do it if I could bring in John
Sayles to re-write the script.

1068
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:17,244
With the global success of
Jaws, the major studios began

1069
01:11:17,264 --> 01:11:20,717
to see b-movie concepts as
a recipie for blockbusters

1070
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:25,028
That seems to have baded now, ya know.
They do, do come back every so often.

1071
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:28,533
I think that the giant rabbit movie
kind of put the kibash on some of it.

1072
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:34,558
Now that audiences can see it
all, what is there left to see?

1073
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:38,050
Have the traditional elements
of exploitation gone away

1074
01:11:38,108 --> 01:11:42,656
or have they simply evolved into
acceptable mainstream entertainment?

1075
01:11:42,975 --> 01:11:45,288
That was the best lovin' I ever had.

1076
01:11:45,328 --> 01:11:47,562
You're gonna wake up
the rest of the bitches.

1077
01:11:47,563 --> 01:11:51,752
Now with such recent homages
as Black Dynamite and Hell Ride.

1078
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:56,701
The truth is clear, the
spirt of grindhouse lives on.

1079
01:11:58,643 --> 01:12:04,044
Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez made
Grindhouse and I love the trailers in it.

1080
01:12:04,084 --> 01:12:07,370
But the only real
grindhouse movie in the last,

1081
01:12:07,429 --> 01:12:10,357
10 or 15 years is The
Passion of The Christ.

1082
01:12:10,415 --> 01:12:13,246
You know it was famously
called Texas Chainsaw Jesus.

1083
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:15,889
That movie was the rough house!
That was a grindhouse movie.

1084
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:18,165
It's all showbusiness.

1085
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,467
It's all showbusiness,
they're all in enertainment.

1086
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:24,475
American Gangster is a very
big budget film out now.

1087
01:12:24,554 --> 01:12:27,925
He's presented as a totally,
admirable and charismatic

1088
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:31,344
he's Super Fly! And that, that,
that's Black Exploitation picture.

1089
01:12:31,385 --> 01:12:34,823
Better made. Bigger budget.
But the morality is the same.

1090
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:39,915
Well I think there was something uniquely
American about exploitation cinema.

1091
01:12:40,512 --> 01:12:45,014
You know a lot of these little
movies were made for pennies.

1092
01:12:45,053 --> 01:12:48,090
But they were really striving
for something and if that's not

1093
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:51,366
part of what America was all
about, they I don't know what is?

1094
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:54,527
Movies, they're only a hundred years
old little over a hundred years old

1095
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:57,973
but the movies have become
our contemporary mythology.

1096
01:12:58,013 --> 01:13:00,879
And, the grindhouse is
very much a part of that.

1097
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:06,608
