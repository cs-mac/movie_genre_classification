1
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,344
Listen.

2
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:16,372
I am standing at the door, knocking.

3
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,922
And if you hear my voice
and open the door,

4
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:24,238
I will come into you
and eat with you,

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,020
and you with me.

6
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:27,980
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,392
John.

8
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:34,311
Write

9
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,134
to the church in Ephesus,

10
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,341
that anyone who has an ear,

11
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:42,657
listen to what the Spirit is saying.

12
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:04,811
I, Ceasar Augustus Titus Flavius Domitianus,

13
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,402
glory of the Empire,

14
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,485
do hereby proclaim myself

15
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:14,691
divine.

16
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,912
This is the dawn of a new day.

17
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:22,270
The whole universe will recall it

18
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:24,860
as the day of new birth.

19
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:28,313
The advent of the reign

20
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:31,862
of the god

21
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:32,823
Domitian.

22
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,441
Pretending to be a god,
when he is still alive,

23
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:40,400
it's unheard of!

24
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:50,662
Quintus.

25
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,485
My lord and god.

26
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:59,583
These Christians continue to profane
my honour and glory.

27
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,557
Especially those in Asia Minor.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,065
You assured me, general,
that the last of the apostles

29
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,655
was dead.

30
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,149
Yet, his very name

31
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:15,987
is still on their lips.

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,248
I am certain, my lord,

33
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:21,263
John is dead.

34
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,853
I know you.

35
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,444
You said "dead".

36
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,034
But the myth

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,761
lives on.

38
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,830
The god Domitian will not

39
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,092
tolerate this.

40
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:41,024
You will give these
Christians an ultimatum.

41
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:41,985
They have 28 days

42
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:46,589
to acknowledge me publicly
as their god.

43
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,001
Their only god.

44
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,851
Should they resist,

45
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:58,867
you

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,909
put them to death.

47
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,926
Valerius.

48
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,325
Irene.

49
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:38,861
Let's go.

50
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,602
You know the situation.

51
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,754
One month's time.

52
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:51,714
We must betray our faith,

53
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,400
proclaim Domitian as our god,

54
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,360
or die.

55
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,005
What are we waiting for?
Let's get out of here!

56
00:03:59,006 --> 00:03:59,965
Brothers!

57
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,227
The Romans are out there now,
seizing every Christian they can find.

58
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,337
But no one is gonna force me out.

59
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,448
I can't believe a Christian
doesn't have a right

60
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:08,888
to defend his own life.

61
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:09,848
Defend his life! Ha!

62
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,383
What about the women and children?

63
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:12,822
What about the old?

64
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:16,563
The Lord is closer to us now
than you think.

65
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:23,373
This is from John.

66
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,019
The Lord has returned to speak to us

67
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:37,089
through his apostle, John.

68
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,214
John is still alive.

69
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,804
Every church has started to receive letters.

70
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,339
But we have to be sure

71
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:47,258
they're truly from him.

72
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,177
Why isn't he here?

73
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:52,246
Because he has to hide from our enemies.
Like we do. More than we do.

74
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:53,974
Don't you see that?

75
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:23,320
- Irene, I wanted to tell you...
- I saw John once.

76
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,581
Did you know that?

77
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:33,487
I was only a girl at the time,
but I remember it so clearly.

78
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:37,324
My mother went to listen to him
and brought me along.

79
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,777
He came over to me. To me!

80
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,518
And he took me in his arms

81
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:48,355
and he kissed me on the cheek.

82
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:51,617
And whispered something in my ear.

83
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,494
What did he say?

84
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:59,195
'My child, you have the eyes of a doe'.

85
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,114
Now lok at me.

86
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,663
I run like a doe, carrying his
letters to the brothers.

87
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,678
Do you remember the first time we met?

88
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,666
You couldn't believe that I'd loved
the same things as you...

89
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,913
- I'm afraid, Valerius,
- You?

90
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,832
Everything is at stake now.

91
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,669
Our lives are about to change,
they have to or we will die!

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,355
And nothing will ever be the same.

93
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,438
Listen to me.

94
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,097
I'm leaving Ephesus.

95
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,168
You're leaving? Now?

96
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:41,402
"Escaping" is what you mean to say?

97
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:42,361
No.

98
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:03,557
I'll miss you, Valerius.

99
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:07,873
General.

100
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:08,833
At last!

101
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,382
What news do you bring to god Domitian?

102
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,493
A spy, my lord.

103
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,754
He's just this minute arrived from Ephesus.

104
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,824
I raised him myself.

105
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,031
He's like a son to me.

106
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:25,334
A son who's a spy?

107
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,773
Well, speak!

108
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,746
Your lord and god
are ready to hear.

109
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,378
Bring him to me!

110
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,161
My lord.

111
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,998
There are rumours in Ephesus.

112
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:55,068
It seems that John the apostle...
is still alive.

113
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,753
It appears that an old man
by the name of Theophilus,

114
00:07:57,754 --> 00:08:00,728
another Christian, is in touch with him.

115
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,126
-Strange letters have been...
- Silence!

116
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,333
Legends, my lord, legends.

117
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,539
They take a while to die out.

118
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,514
It's to be expected.

119
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:16,844
- Somebody pretending to be their apostle...
- This is your dream, general.

120
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,817
My supreme patience has run out.

121
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:23,175
I'm sending you to take over
as governor of Ephesus.

122
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:28,738
Crush the vermin who perpetuates these lies!

123
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:33,150
I want you, I implore you...

124
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:39,289
eliminate every trace

125
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:42,263
of this impostor.

126
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:48,018
And Quintus,

127
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:51,758
My lord.

128
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,787
You will also cut off your

129
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,049
spy's head...

130
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,009
But my lord!

131
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,518
...if what he has spoken
reveals itself to be...

132
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,107
untrue.

133
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,247
I should have told him myself.

134
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:29,165
Do you know where
the old man is at least?

135
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,085
He's a prisoner
on the island of Patmos.

136
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,387
It puts him under
the jurisdiction of Ephesus.

137
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,362
You'll have to get yourself arrested
and sent off to Patmos.

138
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,321
No.

139
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,679
You raised me to be a soldier.

140
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,503
To face my enemies in the battlefield,

141
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:45,571
not to go around lying
to everyone all the time.

142
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,504
I turned you into one of the finest
officers in the empire.

143
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,999
And I have no intention
of repeating myself.

144
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,398
You have your orders.

145
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,124
And if I refuse?

146
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,852
Refuse?

147
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,963
You can't refuse.

148
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:01,881
You can't even think about refusing.

149
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:03,513
You are obliged to me.

150
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,336
Look what you are today.

151
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,734
Your real parents weren't just slaves.

152
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,708
They were criminals,
traitors to the empire.

153
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,696
What were they?

154
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:19,341
Christians?

155
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,369
Were my parents Christians?

156
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,809
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:29,605
But you are not free to choose.

158
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,716
You're a soldier.

159
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,396
We have to keep you alive... for now.

160
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,323
Come on, scribes,
even you need to eat.

161
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,433
That's for you, Theophilus.

162
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:05,860
John.

163
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,121
I'm afraid of even calling you by name now.

164
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:11,136
Jesus saved us.

165
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:15,356
He brought you, his last apostle,
here into this pit.

166
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,316
Why?

167
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:18,619
<i>Give me that bowl!</i>

168
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,647
This is enough for you, old man.

169
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,279
<i>And consider it a gift,</i>

170
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,115
<i>for what little you get done in the mine.</i>

171
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,890
You only earn yourself
more enemies like that.

172
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,152
Is that a sin, Demetrius?

173
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,277
I wish I had your strength.

174
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,716
My strength...

175
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:51,553
My strength does not come from me.

176
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,663
It comes from the Lord.

177
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,542
Gaius, no one has seen John,
except Theophilus.

178
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:04,501
Who is that?

179
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:06,517
He's the one John gave the letters to.

180
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,395
The one who passed the letters
onto Ionicus, my brother.

181
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,794
He travels there with supplies for the prison.

182
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,041
Where is this Theophilus?

183
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,247
He's a prisoner in the mines on Patmos.

184
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,742
All I know is that he's a very old man.

185
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:19,181
I see...

186
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:23,882
John is not only alive,
he speaks with a prisoner

187
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,800
on an inaccessible island.

188
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,336
Listen to me.

189
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:28,487
The letters are too important.

190
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:33,476
Irene, convince your brother
to take it to Patmos.

191
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:38,655
I want you to speak
to Theophilus yourself.

192
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,697
Only you can do it.

193
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,414
Father,

194
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,676
hallowed be your name,

195
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,554
your kingdom come,

196
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,103
give us this day our daily bread,

197
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,748
and forgive us our sins

198
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,051
as we forgive everyone

199
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,737
who is indebted to us.

200
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:48,478
And lead us not into temptation,

201
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,356
Amen.

202
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,893
John,

203
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,634
tell me more about Jesus,

204
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,896
how he died.

205
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:30,103
Blood was running from his hands,
his feet and his side.

206
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:37,968
And his breathing so suffered
I could not bear to listen to it.

207
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,709
It was very cold,

208
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,298
a strange wind came up.

209
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,999
And his mother took a veil

210
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:53,124
to shield herself,

211
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,384
but she stayed.

212
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,701
She would have stayed
until the end of time.

213
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:05,210
And then before Jesus died,

214
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,855
he opened his eyes
and looked at her

215
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,349
and said, 'Mother,

216
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,282
do not cry'.

217
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,159
And then

218
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,764
he said to her,

219
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:24,971
'Mother,

220
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:28,711
this is your son'.

221
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,124
And he looked at me.

222
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:45,112
John...

223
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:47,607
John...

224
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,708
What you see, write in the Book

225
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:47,257
and send it to the churches of Asia.

226
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:21,815
Lord...

227
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:27,282
Do not fear, I am Alpha and Omega.

228
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:30,255
The first and the last.

229
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,216
And he that lives.

230
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:35,819
I was dead, but now
I am alive for evermore.

231
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,466
And have power over death and hell.

232
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:42,055
Write the things I will show you.

233
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,796
They are messages for all churches.

234
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,676
Come, I will show you things
which must be hereafter.

235
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:22,048
I entered the door of Heaven.

236
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,735
There were 24 old men

237
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:34,037
dressed in white robes,

238
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:36,819
with golden crowns on their heads,

239
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,794
and four living beings.

240
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,768
Bless the Lord fire and heat.

241
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:14,414
Bless the Lord all waters.

242
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,282
Let the earth bless the Lord.

243
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:03,133
Bless the Lord every wind.

244
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:23,369
You are worthy, o Lord, to receive glory,

245
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:27,206
for You created all things.

246
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,059
There was a sea of glass like crystal.

247
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:54,635
Behold the throne
that was set in heaven.

248
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:59,527
And on the throne there was a scroll
that was written on back and front,

249
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,405
and was sealed with seven seals.

250
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,283
Seven seals...

251
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,887
Yes. To guard the story of man

252
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,875
- the past, the present, the end, the truth.

253
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:20,630
Who is worthy to open the scroll
and break its seals?

254
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:27,535
Who can reveal the true meaning
of the things God has prepared?

255
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,098
No one in heaven,

256
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,854
nor on earth, or under the earth,
can open the scroll and read it.

257
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,389
No one is worthy.

258
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:48,541
No.

259
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:53,529
Oh my God.

260
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,447
No.

261
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,518
I beseech you.

262
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,313
Someone must break the seal.

263
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,452
It is our only hope.

264
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:11,274
Our only hope.

265
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:12,619
John.

266
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:15,113
Master.

267
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,417
John, what did you see?

268
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,856
Tell me.

269
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:29,885
Please. Tell me.

270
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:33,625
I saw Heaven.

271
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:40,244
And the secret of all things
protected in God's hands.

272
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:57,506
Wait.

273
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,466
Open the gates!

274
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:09,111
Open the gates!

275
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:22,347
New prisoners from Ephesus.
There are ten of them.

276
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,925
First five inside for registration!

277
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:06,271
Don't you understand, Irene?

278
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:07,902
Maybe I'll help some friends to escape,

279
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,012
but I don't want to risk anyone's life.

280
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,836
- Be careful.
- Ionicus, please.

281
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:13,371
Not a word when we land on Patmos.

282
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:15,385
I'll do the talking.

283
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:17,976
They already know you came
to help with supplies.

284
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:21,141
You don't have to explain anything.

285
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,116
How can I get to Theophilus, brother?

286
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,075
Demetrius will introduce you to him.

287
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,338
After all the letters
he's given me for your Christians

288
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,448
we've become acquaintances.

289
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:34,093
There it is - Patmos.

290
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,848
Ionicus, is the mine
as bad as they say?

291
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:43,685
It's my idea of hell.

292
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:50,399
Next.

293
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,195
Your name?

294
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,127
Valerius

295
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,758
From Ephesus.

296
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:04,212
If you need another scribe,
I can also read and write.

297
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,476
A Christian.

298
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,738
We're not the ones to decide.

299
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,725
You know what you've come here for.

300
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:51,110
You may go.

301
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,664
Come on, let's go.

302
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:55,748
- Demetrius.
- Ionicus.

303
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:57,763
And you're Irene?

304
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:00,449
I'm Demetrius
and here's Theophilus.

305
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,272
Since you are new to us,

306
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,247
let me show you
the warehouse straight away.

307
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,590
Come with me.

308
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:07,933
Irene, come with me.

309
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:14,744
This is what you asked me for.

310
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,088
This is from John.

311
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,459
Guard it with your life.

312
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:33,446
Trust me.

313
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:36,229
When can I speak with Theophilus?

314
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,189
Well, I don't...

315
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,012
He's the only one who knows
where John is hiding.

316
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,835
I have to convince
John to come to us.

317
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:43,904
And if the Romans find him?
You know what that would mean.

318
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:45,631
He's the only one who can save us.

319
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:47,550
What's going on in here, eh?

320
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,963
Hurry up, sister.

321
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:55,703
We have to get back
to Ephesus before dark.

322
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,157
Open the gate.

323
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:04,049
I believe something
very important for all of us

324
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:05,200
is written on that scroll, son.

325
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,161
Visions!

326
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:09,998
Tell them to our brothers,
who are hiding in their houses.

327
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:13,643
Tell them to our brothers
in the Roman prisons.

328
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:16,329
If John doesn't come here,

329
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:19,687
if he doesn't show us that he's alive,

330
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:25,825
will they find the courage
to keep their faith?

331
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:38,005
We must wait until
his letters show us God's will.

332
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:42,992
The Romans won't wait.

333
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,311
I see you have made
yourself at home, general?

334
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:10,422
There's no time for formalities, Corvus.

335
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:13,396
The situation here
has slipped out of control.

336
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,122
I'm talking about Christians.

337
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:17,425
And the lies they spread.

338
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,728
You've done nothing to stop them.

339
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,030
What lies are you referring to?

340
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,142
Of the apostle called John.

341
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,540
He's still alive.

342
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,499
Ah, that one.

343
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:30,569
Yes, they've been saying that
for a hundred years now.

344
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:33,735
You know that these
Christians love old wives tales.

345
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,134
But the emperor doesn't.

346
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:40,737
You are removed from your
responsibilities as governor.

347
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,726
I am in charge of Ephesus, starting now.

348
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,890
This hardly comes as a surprise, general.

349
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,098
There's something you can do for me

350
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:53,879
while you set your affairs
before your departure.

351
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,374
Stay out of my sight!

352
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,539
I see.

353
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:06,637
Well, if that is all, governor,
I shall be on Patmos.

354
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,419
One more thing.

355
00:32:11,338 --> 00:32:15,845
Have any more prisoners
been taken to the island of Patmos?

356
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,093
More Christians?

357
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,971
There's hardly room for another one.

358
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:22,561
And they accuse me of being lenient.

359
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:25,631
We shall make plenty of space
when the ultimatum expires.

360
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,782
We?

361
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,277
"We" won't do anything at all. I will.

362
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:30,524
If I so decide.

363
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,471
You won't take a single
initiative, is that clear?

364
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,487
Valerius.

365
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,174
Thank you.

366
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,724
You!

367
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:15,026
Get down in the mines
and help the others.

368
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:25,960
Did you get the map from Ionicus?
Did he get the boat?

369
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:26,920
Look, we have an ultimatum over our heads.

370
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,881
Which means they are going to kill us.

371
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,470
Just see to that we have the boat.

372
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,581
The tunnel does not lead to Ephesus.

373
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:34,308
We're just as anxious to get
out of here as the rest of you.

374
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,857
We still have to convice Theophilus.
We're not moving without him.

375
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:41,790
Be all ready! Because I won't wait for
anyone when the time comes.

376
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:14,204
Where do you think you're going?

377
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:15,549
Where is it going?

378
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,755
Stick your nose where it doesn't belong

379
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,153
and you'll end up losing it.

380
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:48,924
You die in here. Bit by bit.

381
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:56,980
You've been here for a while.

382
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,571
Do you know everybody here?

383
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:01,490
More or less.

384
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:06,958
Must be hard at your age.
For you and the other one.

385
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,562
Theophilus, right?

386
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:17,125
He's the only human being
you find down here.

387
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:18,086
Hey!

388
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:20,772
You haven't done a lick of work all day.

389
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,937
And now you are wasting his time too.

390
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:24,897
Now!

391
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,104
Get up if you wanna earn your meal.

392
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:30,557
I said get up!

393
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:31,518
Get up now or you'll be sorry for...

394
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:37,656
Don't ever touch that old man!

395
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:38,615
Guards! Guards!...

396
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,890
You'll see what's in store for you.

397
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:46,769
And don't say you didn't deserve it.

398
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,773
He'll die.

399
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:42,392
Stop!

400
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,722
Be quick.

401
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,426
Why did you do this?

402
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,387
You said you're a Christian.

403
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:38,880
You should know.

404
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,142
What I know is we are going to die soon.

405
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,363
You are afraid to be in a cage.

406
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:50,392
Because you have known
the value of liberty.

407
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:51,543
No.

408
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,819
I thought I was free.

409
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,409
But I'm a slave.

410
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:02,096
I'll always be a slave.

411
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:06,699
Your servitude does not
depend on Rome.

412
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:11,399
No Roman can ever free you.

413
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,620
What do you know about me?

414
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:20,224
Your chains are in your heart.

415
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:27,321
You drag them around
with you wherever you go.

416
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:32,309
You must free yourself.

417
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,954
Who are you?

418
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,175
That's enough.

419
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,956
Who are you?

420
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:55,329
Why do you lie to your brothers?

421
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:57,727
You write the letters.

422
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:00,989
John is dead!

423
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:17,197
My Lord!

424
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:21,321
I am the last of your apostles alive.

425
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:25,350
Yet, you keep me here

426
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:28,325
as if it were my tomb.

427
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,120
Lord,

428
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:38,779
you revealed your truth to me.

429
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:42,807
Truth that can free us all.
Yet...

430
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,672
you hold me here
where liberty is denied.

431
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,456
Did you not call me to lead
my brothers to your kingdom?

432
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:06,210
Why do they think that
I have abandoned them?

433
00:40:08,129 --> 00:40:11,869
They are lost. Lord, forgive them.

434
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,186
They are only human.

435
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:20,597
And I am only human.

436
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:25,009
Forgive us all.

437
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,409
Oh, God,

438
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,863
lift the shadow from my heart.

439
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:41,507
Make me worthy of your call.

440
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:47,454
Make me worthy of the Light.

441
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:52,921
Do not weep.

442
00:40:55,608 --> 00:40:59,348
Look. The Messiah has triumphed.

443
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:05,103
And he will open the scroll and its seven seals.

444
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:43,655
Come.

445
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:45,478
Come triumphant.

446
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:49,219
To triumph once more.

447
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:00,632
Here is the power of the risen Christ.

448
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:03,222
The rider who wins over death.

449
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:24,993
Come, take away peace from earth.

450
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,364
Who was that?

451
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:35,255
It was war. He's the one who
sets people killing each other.

452
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:37,750
How can he have such power?

453
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,929
So they know where the paths of hate lead.

454
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,536
Come.

455
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:13,907
A crust of bread for a worker's wages.

456
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:17,359
To spread hunger and misery
throughout the world.

457
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:21,772
And injustice - the fruits of selfishness.

458
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:46,132
Come.

459
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:48,818
Now the worst scourge of them all.

460
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:49,969
What is its power?

461
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,560
The most terrifying power there is.

462
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,205
The power of death.

463
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:59,466
To remind the world that
only in God there is life.

464
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:04,550
So that men may turn to Him
again and praise Him.

465
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,169
Who can stop all of this?

466
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:23,061
Only the love of Him
who gave His life for us.

467
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:28,144
Death will not have the last word.

468
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:48,955
He who believes
shall have eternal life.

469
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:00,944
God is love.

470
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:08,808
And whosoever lives in love
lives in God.

471
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:13,221
And God in him.

472
00:45:15,618 --> 00:45:20,318
If we bear all pain and
suffering with faith and love,

473
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,059
we will find true joy in the Lord.

474
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:37,391
We've decided to leave Ephesus
before it's too late.

475
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:41,803
May God protect us all.

476
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,285
Let's go.

477
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:50,340
Come on.

478
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,369
What does "apostle" mean, father?

479
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,960
It means that John
is a very special person.

480
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:58,207
Like an angel?

481
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:01,277
No. He's a person like you and me.

482
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:03,387
It's his life that is special.

483
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:06,266
Jesus chose John when
he was still a boy.

484
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,856
And John was Jesus'
favourite disciple.

485
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:11,254
He never left Jesus' side.

486
00:46:11,255 --> 00:46:13,460
Even if He was on the cross.

487
00:46:13,461 --> 00:46:16,819
And all the others had fled
because they were afraid.

488
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:19,696
I wouldn't be afraid
to stay by Jesus' side.

489
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:20,944
I know.

490
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:24,013
Irene,

491
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:28,042
go back to Patmos.

492
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,865
Find Theophilus.

493
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:34,278
Find John.

494
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:43,773
Unload the supplies.

495
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:08,899
This map guides you
to the boat landing.

496
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,201
We're going to the island
after tomorrow.

497
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:42,370
Demetrius.

498
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:45,344
Theophilus has left the
list of supplies at the back.

499
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:47,550
- He's not well today.
- What happened to Valerius?

500
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,278
Come with me.

501
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,813
I'll watch out for the guards.

502
00:47:55,992 --> 00:48:00,404
Valerius tried to defend another prisoner.
They put him in isolation for four days.

503
00:48:00,788 --> 00:48:01,747
Oh my God.

504
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:06,639
-John's had another vision?
- Yes.

505
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,942
And he gave it to you in person?

506
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:13,545
No..., he passed it onto Theophilus.

507
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:16,616
How does he do it?
I have to see John.

508
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:18,534
He has to come to us.
I told you that.

509
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:20,933
How does Theophilus do it? Tell me!

510
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:23,523
It's through a friend, a guard, I think.

511
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:24,483
- A guard?
- Yes.

512
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:29,662
He... he's a convert...
he comes from Laodicea and...

513
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:32,445
Ionicus told me the guards
are all from Rome.

514
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:34,268
It's not a guard.

515
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:36,283
There's no one.

516
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:37,818
No one at all.

517
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:41,079
You two invented it all
to keep his name alive.

518
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,149
- But John is dead.
- No. John is alive.

519
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,588
He's as alive as you and me. Trust me.

520
00:48:45,781 --> 00:48:49,233
Then explain to me how we...

521
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:57,674
My child,

522
00:48:58,825 --> 00:49:02,565
you still have the eyes of a doe.

523
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:07,073
John.

524
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:12,445
Master.

525
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:16,474
Thank God I've found you.

526
00:49:18,393 --> 00:49:20,407
We need you so badly.

527
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:24,244
You are the only witness
to the resurrection of our Lord.

528
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:27,217
They will listen to you.

529
00:49:27,986 --> 00:49:30,576
- You'll save us.
- Oh, no.

530
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:34,700
Don't cry, my child, don't cry.

531
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,688
Only the Lord can save us.

532
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,387
But now He wants me here.

533
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,458
To deny my own name

534
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:50,335
and testify to His.

535
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,598
If you stay here, you will be killed.

536
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:57,723
Listen, there's a plan to escape.

537
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:59,066
Come with us.

538
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:04,054
Tell our brothers and sisters
what God wants from us.

539
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,260
There's no other way.

540
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:11,728
We cannot escape
from the will of the Lord.

541
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,140
But I will continue
to send you His messages

542
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,936
until the final mystery is revealed.

543
00:50:23,431 --> 00:50:24,390
Please.

544
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:29,953
Please, share my secret with me.

545
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,546
Corvus... Just what we need.

546
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:31,810
- We have the boat. It's for tonight.
- Where's the map?

547
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:35,551
Hold on. We still have to
convince Theophilus.

548
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:40,059
I'm not gonna rot in here.
Give me the map!

549
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:13,912
Put it on your head.
It'll keep you from drying.

550
00:52:14,777 --> 00:52:18,517
I don't wanna see you die.
I'm gonna need you now.

551
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:21,010
Look, those other Christians
don't have any brains.

552
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,121
When they take you to the cell tonight,

553
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:26,287
get your hands
on the map they're hiding.

554
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,276
Enough!

555
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,034
Why do you tend him?

556
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:28,912
He will soon cut your throat.

557
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:36,489
You stubborn fool.

558
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:54,712
Take this old man
and put him in the cage!

559
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,631
Let the other one go.

560
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:59,318
<i>Back to work!</i>

561
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:15,430
It is claimed that in Laodicea they
speak of no one but John the immortal.

562
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:19,745
Thence by decree of Domitian,
divine emperor of Rome,

563
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:23,582
the said province shall be purged by fire.

564
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:30,104
Not a single blade
of grass be left standing.

565
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:35,188
He can't blot out the entire land!

566
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,847
An ultimatum one day, a decree the next!

567
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:44,300
This is sheer madness.

568
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:45,931
What do I tell the emperor?

569
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:48,906
Tell him that his orders
will be carried out.

570
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,772
The map of the coast!

571
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,787
Where did it come from?

572
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,351
No one knows about it.

573
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:40,119
Foolish of you!

574
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:47,697
Cut the rations.

575
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,246
Back to work!

576
00:55:57,768 --> 00:56:00,836
Attack every Christian
village in the area.

577
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:03,332
Kill all the Christians.

578
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:07,360
They're orders from
the emperor Domitian himself.

579
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,197
And I want them carried out.

580
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:16,472
Company!

581
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,117
Centurions!

582
00:57:04,231 --> 00:57:07,301
Mum, look! It's Romans!

583
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,753
Oh my God, it's Roman soldiers!

584
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:15,550
The children! We must get the children!

585
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:19,099
Quickly!

586
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:20,537
Come on!

587
00:58:40,327 --> 00:58:42,053
No!

588
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:47,137
No, God...

589
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:59,988
Is this your will, Lord?

590
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,389
John!

591
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:28,600
<i>(CROWD CHANTING: Miserere nobis)</i>

592
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,302
Sostenes...

593
01:01:01,976 --> 01:01:04,086
When, my Lord,

594
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:09,745
will innocent blood
no longer be spilt?

595
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:15,883
Be patient a little longer,

596
01:01:16,556 --> 01:01:19,528
until the number of your
brothers is complete.

597
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:26,434
Now share my victory over death.

598
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:40,244
Get up! Time to work!

599
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:42,930
Let's go!

600
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,714
Sostenes, come on, old man.

601
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:56,358
You'll make it.

602
01:01:59,812 --> 01:02:00,770
Come on.

603
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:03,841
Sostenes...

604
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,717
Sostenes is dead!

605
01:02:10,938 --> 01:02:12,089
Sostenes is dead!

606
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:22,160
John! John!

607
01:02:24,463 --> 01:02:25,517
Did you hear?

608
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:26,478
Sostenes is dead.

609
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:31,081
No, no.

610
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:34,151
He is alive.

611
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:40,769
He is standing
in the presence of God.

612
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:49,592
This is our chance.

613
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:52,758
Old Sostenes has given us
the keys to freedom.

614
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,883
Come on. It's now or never.

615
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:02,734
Come on!

616
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:12,133
When we get to the port,
we'll try to seize the boat. Let's go!

617
01:03:25,464 --> 01:03:26,902
They've found out!

618
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,314
The knew all the time.
Let's get ot of here! Come on!

619
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:36,207
Oh my God, no!

620
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:38,509
Hold it!

621
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:06,033
How stupid of them to think
they catch me unprepared.

622
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:19,172
You can go back to your friends now.

623
01:04:23,872 --> 01:04:28,860
If anyone else attempts to escape,
I'll sacrify others along with him.

624
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:33,943
As it is, the ultimatum
expires in a couple of days.

625
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:40,657
And we will be forced to kill
everyone of you who still refuses

626
01:04:40,754 --> 01:04:44,014
to give up the Christian God.

627
01:04:44,303 --> 01:04:46,987
You have two days!

628
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:52,167
What a waste of breath.

629
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:58,402
What a waste of manpower.

630
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:28,515
John,

631
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:32,352
give me your blessing.

632
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:37,244
And prepare me for death.

633
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:43,095
I am not afraid any more.

634
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:46,932
May the Lord forgive me

635
01:05:47,795 --> 01:05:49,139
for my sins.

636
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:53,838
I have known you,

637
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:58,250
His friend.

638
01:06:00,745 --> 01:06:03,237
I bow to His will.

639
01:06:11,678 --> 01:06:13,404
Master,

640
01:06:15,707 --> 01:06:16,762
John,

641
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,874
Blessed are you, poor,

642
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:37,382
for yours is the Kingdom of God.

643
01:06:38,151 --> 01:06:40,644
Blessed are you that hunger now,

644
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:43,809
for you shall be satisfied.

645
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,126
Blessed are you that weep now,

646
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,004
for you shall laugh.

647
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,841
The wicked will not stand
firm at the judgement,

648
01:06:55,129 --> 01:06:59,253
nor sinners in the
gathering of the righteous.

649
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:07,309
The path of the wicked is doomed
- chaff blown around by the wind.

650
01:08:08,398 --> 01:08:10,220
Who are these people?

651
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,838
Where have they come from?

652
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,717
They have been saved.

653
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:23,074
These are the people who have
been through a great trial.

654
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:27,294
They've washed their robes white again
in the blood of the Lamb.

655
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:30,268
They will never hunger or thirst again,

656
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:34,200
because the Lamb will be their shepperd

657
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:37,463
and guide them to the springs of life.

658
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:43,026
And God will wipe away
all tears from their eyes.

659
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:46,863
There, look.

660
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:53,768
The Lamb, the Messiah,
is breaking the seventh seal.

661
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,334
John,

662
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:36,925
John,

663
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:40,954
answer me, John.

664
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:44,790
The Lamb,

665
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:50,161
has broken the seventh seal.

666
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,341
and there was silence.

667
01:09:58,411 --> 01:09:59,370
Silence,

668
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:02,152
in Heaven.

669
01:10:13,661 --> 01:10:15,387
I must be mad. We'll never make it.

670
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:17,594
We have to make it.

671
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:51,735
You, come here. Now listen...

672
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:56,530
Valerius.

673
01:10:57,203 --> 01:10:58,162
Irene.

674
01:11:05,163 --> 01:11:06,506
We have to go now.

675
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:07,850
John,

676
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:11,591
John, come with us.

677
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:16,099
I...

678
01:11:19,552 --> 01:11:20,894
I have to stay.

679
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,910
You can't. If you stay
here, it means death.

680
01:11:23,103 --> 01:11:25,500
I have to stay here.

681
01:11:26,555 --> 01:11:27,803
Please, come with us.

682
01:11:32,023 --> 01:11:33,942
The Lord has spoken to me.

683
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:38,305
The seventh seal...

684
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:41,710
Perhaps it is my life
for the Romans to take.

685
01:11:41,999 --> 01:11:45,163
John, God doesn't
want you to die now.

686
01:11:45,164 --> 01:11:46,123
He's freeing us.

687
01:11:46,124 --> 01:11:47,083
We've got to hurry.

688
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:50,153
We're in your hands.

689
01:11:50,154 --> 01:11:53,606
Save us. I beg you.

690
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:55,621
I beg you in the name of Jesus.

691
01:11:55,814 --> 01:11:56,773
Please, John.

692
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,253
Please, John.

693
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:11,735
God help me,

694
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:14,900
if I am making a mistake.

695
01:12:16,052 --> 01:12:18,066
- Come.
- Yes.

696
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:26,794
Stop.

697
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,534
Stay where you are.

698
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:35,619
There are fewer guards on that side
and they removed the sentries from the gate.

699
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,058
Now, move!

700
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,169
Guards!

701
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,992
Prisoners are escaping!

702
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:52,116
That's enough centurion,
kill them all!

703
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,957
Pull up! Form two groups!

704
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,835
Cut them up before they
get to the port!

705
01:13:27,795 --> 01:13:28,657
This way!

706
01:13:36,714 --> 01:13:38,632
They've found our trail.

707
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:39,976
Leave me here.

708
01:13:40,551 --> 01:13:41,895
I'm not gonna
make it any further.

709
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:44,293
I'll delay them. Please.

710
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:48,130
It's our only chance.

711
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:12,297
In the name of Jesus,
your sins are forgiven.

712
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,449
Amen.

713
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:22,752
Go with God.

714
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,356
John will never keep up.
I'll stay with him.

715
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:36,756
The rest of you go ahead
to the boat.

716
01:14:36,757 --> 01:14:37,716
We'll meet you there.

717
01:14:37,717 --> 01:14:39,539
- Valerius is right.
- No. We should stay together.

718
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:41,362
I'm not leaving John.

719
01:14:41,363 --> 01:14:43,760
Yes, you are. This time
listen to me, sister. Let's go!

720
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,556
Let her do what her heart commands.

721
01:14:49,324 --> 01:14:51,913
Hurry, they're almost here. Let's go!

722
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:01,025
Seize him!

723
01:15:05,054 --> 01:15:06,108
Get round behind him!

724
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:07,739
Where are the others?

725
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:09,945
Answer me!

726
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,057
That way!

727
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,168
Quick! Let's go.

728
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:29,032
There.

729
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:30,951
Over there.

730
01:16:15,449 --> 01:16:18,039
Lord, Lord,

731
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:20,628
forgive me.

732
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,425
I thought You had no more voice left for me.

733
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:29,552
Salvation has been won by our God

734
01:19:29,649 --> 01:19:31,567
and all the authority for His Christ.

735
01:19:31,568 --> 01:19:36,267
For all evil has been defeated
for evermore.

736
01:19:43,077 --> 01:19:44,994
They must be somewhere.

737
01:19:56,408 --> 01:19:57,750
They are here.

738
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:20,000
Do not be afraid of the truth,

739
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:25,275
if you don't want to remain a slave.

740
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,495
The truth could kill you.

741
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:32,566
Only the truth will free you.

742
01:20:53,856 --> 01:20:55,294
Valerius...

743
01:21:00,282 --> 01:21:01,624
The soldiers of Rome,

744
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:04,599
Corvus is a traitor and thief.

745
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,668
I am here by order of the
new governor from Ephesus,

746
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:12,848
Quintus Maximus, to unmask
the real enemies of the empire.

747
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:18,027
And I order you to arrest him
in the name of the emperor Domitian...

748
01:21:18,028 --> 01:21:18,988
Seize him!

749
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:23,687
If you do so, you will answer
to Quintus personally.

750
01:21:23,688 --> 01:21:26,566
Look! A ship flying
the emperial colours.

751
01:21:27,525 --> 01:21:28,676
Quintus...

752
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:33,088
I said seize him!
That's an order!

753
01:21:38,748 --> 01:21:40,186
Kill him! Kill him!

754
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:16,533
Arrest them all!

755
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:20,178
Quintus will judge them
in the name of the emperor.

756
01:22:51,347 --> 01:22:54,031
What has been going on here?
Who are they?

757
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,526
These are the prisoners
who tried to escape.

758
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:00,746
One of them claims he knows you.

759
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:13,215
If they have to die, I choose
to die along with them.

760
01:23:13,599 --> 01:23:15,421
I am a Christian.

761
01:23:16,188 --> 01:23:18,011
The son of Christians.

762
01:23:18,012 --> 01:23:22,615
I will accept your
sentence under the laws of Rome.

763
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:25,398
Remove the chains.

764
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:29,427
What? They must die. That's
the order of the emperor.

765
01:23:30,194 --> 01:23:32,591
Domitian has been assassinated.

766
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:37,962
Nerva is the emperor now.

767
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:42,759
He has declared an amnesty
for all prisoners.

768
01:23:44,294 --> 01:23:47,650
And an end to the persecution
of Christians and Jews.

769
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:50,145
Move the chains!

770
01:24:06,065 --> 01:24:07,791
You are free man now.

771
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:11,533
Your father admires your courage, son.

772
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:47,687
Now you know the truth.
I lied to you.

773
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:50,853
I didn't understand.

774
01:24:52,867 --> 01:24:54,690
I didn't understand myself.

775
01:24:57,184 --> 01:24:59,486
But now my eyes are open.

776
01:25:01,405 --> 01:25:03,515
I love you, Irene.

777
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,544
I love you.

778
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:13,969
Can you forgive me?

779
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:18,669
Irene.

780
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:27,302
Jesus told me once
that God forgives the most

781
01:25:27,495 --> 01:25:31,138
those who love the most.

782
01:25:51,278 --> 01:25:54,251
I've always loved you, Valerius.

783
01:26:42,586 --> 01:26:44,408
Your suffering is over.

784
01:26:49,203 --> 01:26:51,504
You're free to go, old man.

785
01:26:51,793 --> 01:26:55,437
My name is John.

786
01:27:15,673 --> 01:27:18,934
God will always win, friends.

787
01:27:19,798 --> 01:27:26,223
His victory over evil
is the root of our faith.

788
01:27:30,252 --> 01:27:31,307
The words of Jesus

789
01:27:33,897 --> 01:27:36,007
come true before our eyes every day

790
01:27:36,008 --> 01:27:38,693
and will continue to come true

791
01:27:39,652 --> 01:27:41,571
to the end of time.

792
01:27:48,285 --> 01:27:56,340
Blessed is he who obeys His
commandment to love one another

793
01:27:57,012 --> 01:27:59,314
and make a better world.

794
01:28:04,782 --> 01:28:11,110
May the grace of the
Lord Jesus be with you.

795
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,619
Amen.

796
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:39,115
And then I saw a new Heaven
and a new Earth.

797
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:44,966
I saw the holy city
the new Jerusalem

798
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:48,132
come down out of Heaven from God,

799
01:28:48,228 --> 01:28:52,640
prepared as a bride for her husband.

800
01:28:53,216 --> 01:28:56,477
Here God lives with human beings

801
01:28:56,478 --> 01:29:00,409
and He will make
His home among them.

802
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,918
They will be His people
and He will be their God.

803
01:29:05,302 --> 01:29:07,412
God with them.

804
01:29:08,277 --> 01:29:12,880
And He will wipe away
the tears from their eyes.

805
01:29:14,511 --> 01:29:18,347
And there will be no more death,
no more mourning,

806
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:20,745
no sadness or pain,

807
01:29:22,088 --> 01:29:26,500
the world of the past is gone.

808
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:30,145
The Spirit and the bride say:

809
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:35,707
"Come, let all who are thirsty, come.

810
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:40,983
And all who want it may
have the water of life.

811
01:29:42,518 --> 01:29:45,203
And have it free".

812
01:29:47,505 --> 01:29:48,656
Amen.

813
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,836
Come, Lord Jesus.
