<i>Discovery of Love </i>

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,500
<i> Episode 3</i>

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,500
Whenever I see you, I still get mad.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I only remember the difficult times I went through because of you.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
I only remember the good memories.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,100
So what?

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,900
Han Yeo Reum,

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,100
you...

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,300
If I ask you if you can break up with that man and come to me, would you?

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,600
If you come back...I will never make you cry again.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,000
I...

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,700
never forgot anything about you from beginning to end.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,700
From when we started at Jinju Station until we ended at Jinju Station.

14
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,700
<i>10 Years Ago</i>

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>It was nice to meet you. I'm Kang Tae Ha.</i>

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
<i>I'm Han Yeo Reum.</i>

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
<i>Han Yeo Reum... That's a pretty name.</i>

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>Let's meet again. <b>- Okay, again.</i></b>

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,100
<i>You go first.</i>

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,400
<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,500
<i>You even followed me to the bathroom...</i>

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,300
<i>Did you look for train tickets to go back to Seoul?</i>

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
<i>Oppa!</i>

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>Why is she like this now?</i>

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,800
<i>There is a really pretty island around here. Did you hear about Yeonhwa-do?</i>

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,100
<i>What 'do'(island)?</i>

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,000
<i> Why? <b>- Oppa, you have money, right?</i></b>

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>I don't have money!</i>

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,700
<i> You get lots of allowance!</i>

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>I don't have any!</i>

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
<i> What the..?</i>

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,600
<i>Let's go.</i>

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
<i>I'm not going.</i>

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>Don't say anything and just follow me.</i>

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
<i>I don't want to go!</i>

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>You should smile. Is this a funeral?</i>

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
<i>I'm not going to go!</i>

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
<i>Let go of me!</i>

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
<i>I will let you go when we get to Yeonhwa-do.</i>

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
<i>It's an island, anyways, so you can't go anywhere.</i>

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,100
<i> Hurry up.</i>

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>Let's go!</i>

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
<i>Hey, I'm going first.</i>

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,100
<i>Hey, hey! Han Yeo Reum!</i>

45
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,100
<i>You two can go! Can't I just visit Soonam in the military?</i>

46
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,700
<i>No! If you go there, you will be called a crazy b*tch.</i>

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,600
<i>Please! Why do you interfere so much with my life?</i>

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>Really! You are getting yourself more in trouble.</i>

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,200
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
<i>Is she crazy? Hey!</i>

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
<i>Oh, Han Yeo Reum!</i>

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,300
<i>She doesn't have any money!</i>

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,800
<i>Hey!</i>

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
<i>Oh! What a coincidence.</i>

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
<i>Oh!</i>

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>Are you going to Yeonhwa-do?</i>

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
<i>I told you before, that I'm going to Yeonhwa-do.</i>

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>Oh, did you?</i>

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,200
<i>I didn't hear.</i>

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,100
<i> That is a strange coincidence.</i>

61
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,100
<i>Don't you call things like this, "fate"?</i>

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
<i>We call it a coincidence.</i>

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,800
<i>In the beginning, most fates begin with a coincidence.</i>

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,600
<i> Well, it depends on how you look at it.</i>

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,200
<i>Then, let's say that it's "fate".</i>

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,900
<i>I'm about to go crazy. They didn't get on!</i>

67
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,800
<i>You should go now.</i>

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,700
<i>Why? Are you waiting for someone?</i>

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
<i>No...</i>

70
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>You were alone the whole time.</i>

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,900
<i> You should climb up. If you go up right now, you might see the setting sun at Yeonhwa Mountain.</i>

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,100
<i>Excuse me.</i>

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,700
<i>I'm sorry to say this when we just met, but can you lend me some money?</i>

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
<i>Follow me.</i>

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,600
<i>Excuse me, I'm not relieved.</i>

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,400
<i>That's the last boat, but I don't have any money for a place to stay.</i>

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,800
<i>I can sleep anywhere, but I just need a transportation fee to go back to Seoul.</i>

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,700
<i>Do you really have no money?</i>

79
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,700
<i>Then when you said that you fell in love with me at first sight on the train, were you serious?</i>

80
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,200
<i>Yes! <b>- You didn't want to just get money?</i></b>

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,300
<i>Look here! What do you take me for?</i>

82
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>You didn't follow me here because of money, either?</i>

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
<i>You have to go to the mental hospital if you are this suspicious.</i>

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,100
<i>Do you really, really have no money?</i>

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
<i>I can't believe you.</i>

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,700
<i> They are my friend and a close oppa.</i>

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>Who?</i>

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,700
<i>Oh, the rude couple that were talking on the train?</i>

89
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,400
<i> They didn't get on! I thought they did.</i>

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>They have all the money, and I only have this bag.</i>

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
<i>You really have no money.</i>

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,200
<i>Please lend me some. I will pay you back in Seoul.</i>

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,700
<i> If I lend you money, will you not follow me around?</i>

94
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,000
<i>Of course. I won't bother you.</i>

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,100
<i>I thought that you fell in love with me.</i>

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,600
<i>I will promise you that I won't bother you.</i>

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,300
<i>Then, I can't lend you money.</i>

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>That man, really.</i>

99
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,800
<i>I don't have anybody I know here,</i>

100
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,700
<i>and you are the only person that I know.</i>

101
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,000
<i>Let's not be like this. Can you look at this world in a more optimistic, beautiful light?</i>

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,900
<i>How old are you?</i>

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
<i>I'm scared. Why do you want to know that?</i>

104
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,100
<i>How are you asking me for money without revealing your personal information?</i>

105
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,800
<i>Your name is Han Yeo Reum. How old are you?</i>

106
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
<i>I'm twenty-two.</i>

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,200
<i>You said your major was Woodworking and Furniture Design... What school do you go to?</i>

108
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
<i>Korea University. <b>- Did you make that ring yourself?</i></b>

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
<i>Yes!</i>

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>Oh, then. Do you want this and lend me money?</i>

111
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,200
<i>A wooden ring?</i>

112
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>It's fine.</i>

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,600
<i>Aish! He is really evil!</i>

114
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
<i>Kang Tae Ha!</i>

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
<i>Don't! I'm scared!</i>

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>Stop!</i>

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,700
<i>Wow, look at that.</i>

118
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,000
<i>I learned an important lesson in my life today.</i>

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,100
<i>I can't trust a man that I fell in love with at first sight.</i>

120
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,900
<i>Why don't you keep those thoughts to yourself? It wouldn't be beneficial to me if I know that.</i>

121
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,800
<i>Since we observed the scenery, can you lend me money now?</i>

122
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>I don't have money either. I have to go back down and get some from the bank.</i>

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>Then you should have done that for me before!</i>

124
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
<i>Did you just yell at me?</i>

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>No.</i>

126
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,100
<i>Let's go back down. It's getting dark.</i>

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,600
<i>Let me take some more pictures.</i>

128
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
<i>I hope you have a happy trip!</i>

129
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
<i>Broken</i>

130
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
<i>Is this a dream or reality?</i>

131
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,200
<i>It's reality, reality.</i>

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
<i> Did you not hear that woman?</i>

133
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>She can fix it when the ship comes back! Tomrrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</i>

134
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
<i>Where are you going?</i>

135
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,900
<i>Why do you care?</i>

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
<i>Excuse me!</i>

137
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,800
<i>It's 60 cents.</i>

138
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>I'm 10 cents short.</i>

139
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,670
Was that your entire money in your bank?

140
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,640
Only ten cents?

141
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,300
Aren't you hungry?

142
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,800
If you don't want to eat it, then never mind.<b>- Did I say that I didn't want to eat it?</b>

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,100
We're in big trouble. Where do we sleep?

144
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,850
Well, I can sleep right here.

145
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,790
No way. It gets really cold at night!

146
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,680
Excuse me!

147
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,050
By chance, is there a community center, school or church nearby? There should be at least one of the three, right?

148
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,810
How do you even know about these things?

149
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,320
If you grow under a mom who often kicks you out for no reason, you learn these tips.

150
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,850
I didn't think they would let us borrow blankets as well.

151
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,550
I'm on this side, and you are over there.

152
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,290
Don't roll over onto my blanket while you're sleeping.

153
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,290
I'm the one who should be saying that.

154
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,140
I've taken care of the money for food and lodging,

155
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,290
so when you get money from the bank at 2 o'clock tomorrow, promise that you'll lend me fare money.

156
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,030
How are we going to eat breakfast and lunch before 2 o'clock?

157
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,830
There is a way.

158
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm a woman that could survive being dropped in the middle of the desert.

159
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,400
I think there's a mouse.

160
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,920
What do I do?! I think there's more than one! What do I do?

161
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,340
I thought there was nothing you were afraid of, but you're scared of mice?

162
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,370
I really don't like gray animals, like salamanders.

163
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,530
Do you think it's here, too?

164
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,980
Well, there could be.

165
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,710
Umm, Kang Tae Ha.<b> Yes?</b>

166
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,120
Can't we sleep closer together?

167
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,750
Let's just sleep close together.

168
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,070
I won't do anything.

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm really innocent.

170
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,280
I'll just sleep really calmly next to you.

171
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,380
Then I'm putting the blankets together.

172
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,410
I'm a bit relieved now.

173
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,940
You're not afriad of men, are you?

174
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,870
What's so scary about men, they are human, too.

175
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,270
It's probably better than mice, we can at least communicate.

176
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,980
Are you sure?

177
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,250
I'm telling you in advance,

178
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm very good at Taekwondo, I'm a black belt.

179
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,460
Oh wow, you're an amazing person.

180
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,000
She was an amazing person.

181
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,010
I'm not scared of you at all.

182
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,210
If you can risk your life, then try coming over.

183
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,050
What do I do?? The mice... really...

184
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,030
Please hold my hand.

185
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,310
Let's sleep just holding hands.

186
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,350
Please?

187
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,020
Don't let go. Just hold it and sleep.

00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,550
What kind of feeling?

195
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,510
Like something ticklish?

196
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,760
Like something... tingling, too.

197
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,010
And something...

198
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,660
warm and mushy...

199
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,010
Something blooming, too.

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,270
I think the ramen from earlier was a bit weird.

201
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,450
It's not the ramen.

202
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,510
It's probably the feeling of something new starting.

203
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,590
What's starting?

204
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,110

How honest you were,

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,720
how easily you smiled,

221
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,300
how cute you were,

222
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,030
all that is still very clear in my head.

223
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,640
Even how your lips felt.

224
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,820
You didn't get flustered by what I just said, right?

225
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,790
You have no intentions of going back with me.

226
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,220
Of course, isn't that obvious?!

227
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,080
Then there is no reason for you to not work with us.

228
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,610
You have a boyfriend and have no reason to be shaken by me.

229
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll tell you this for sure, I have no intention to start over with you nor any other intentions.

230
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,030
I just found this work place while looking for the perfect work partner.

231
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,410
I hope you don't interfere business with your personal feelings.

232
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,290
Think about it and call me.

233

What in the world.

234
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,990

235
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,240
Yes, CEO.

236
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,520
Can you come to the car within ten minutes, I don't think I can wait long.

237
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,340
We have a GK Apartment meeting at 2 o'clock.

238
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,450
<i>I really can't tell what's on his mind.</i>

239
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,550
He was like that before. It's not like he's playing around with me, but...

240
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,500
he hides his true feelings and plays with people. He did that ten years ago too!

241
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>Oh! Money!</i>

242

<i>A promise is a promise.</i>

246
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,760
<i>You had a place to sleep last night thanks to me, and it's not proper if you repay me like this.</i>

247
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,700
<i>You will get out of the island in that ship if I lend you money, right?</i>

248
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,590
<i>Of course.</i>

249
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,750
<i>That's why I'm not lending you money.</i>

250

<i>Hey, you crazy jerk!</i>

251
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,630
<i>What kind of jerk is he?</i>

252
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,950
<i>Hey, you crazy jerk!</i>

253
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:04,460
I'm a business man. Put simply, a merchant.<b>I need her now.</b>

254
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,810
Also, I have an animal sense to know how to get what I want.

255
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,730
Right now there's only one way to get a hold of Han Yeo Reum.

256
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,520
By pricking her pride.

257

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,900
<i>So this is is the joined trees.</i>

309
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,200
<i> - Is this your first time seeing it? <b> - Yes. It's amazing.</i></b>

310
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,850
<i>There really are branches attached to it.</i>

311
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,080
<i>How much do they have to like each other<b> to become one like that?</i></b>

312
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,450
<i>See. We're also joined trees now.</i>

313
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,370
<i>I know, right?</i>

314
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,460
<i>Trees are always there, in the same place.</i>

315
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,090
<i>Not harming anyone, they stay still in the same place.</i>

316
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,630
<i>I like it. It makes people feel comfortable.</i>

317
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:11,070
<i>If I make furniture, I won't let trees go to waste and treat them properly.</i>

318
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,490
<i>If you're a carpentry major, then do you want to open a woodshop store later?</i>

319
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,390
<i>I already have a name made. Summer & Pine Tree.<b>My friend's name is Sol(pine).</i></b>

320
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,810
<i>I once went to Heuksan-do before I went to the army.</i>

321
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:28,840
<i>There's joined zelkova trees there and the size is amazingly big.</i>

322
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,080
<i>Do you want to see it with me later?</i>

323
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,070
<i>It's raining.</i>

324
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,710
<i>It must be sudden showers.</i>

325
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,340
<i>Let's go.</i>

326
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,200
It will go the way I want. I'm sure of it.

327
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,680
She will probably call me tomorrow.

328
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,670
She's a person with a lot of pride.

329
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,930
She will want to prove that she doesn't have any feelings for me.

330
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,220
CEO!

331
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,830
I'm just five minutes late.

332
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,780
But seriously... Oh, so hot.

333
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,870
So who told you to run? I gave you 10 minutes.

334
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,040
Don't chew anything hard and...

335
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,300
call me if the problem worsens.

336
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes.

337
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,040
I think you're right. It was Ahn Ah Rim that you've been looking for.

338
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,060
But she still hasn't finished college yet.

339
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,740
She's on leave working three part-time jobs to pay for school tuition.

340
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,540
Including this.

341
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,020
What's your relationship with her that you had to search so desperately for her?

342
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,900
Is she someone you knew when you were little?

343
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,720
Excuse me, but are you the doctor that can turn even the most unfortunate face into a goddess?

344
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,520
But is this face possible to work with?

345
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,190
I'm sorry but it will be impossible in this hospital.

346
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,160
Please go to another hospital.

347
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,420
How would you like me to change it?

348
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,510
To Kim Tae Hee.

349
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,810
Kim Tae Hee. Hey, go to another one. Another one.

350
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,210
Hey, she's not much to look at. You're much prettier.

351
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,710
I feel like throwing up.

352
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,640
I'm leaving.

353
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,060
Hold on.

354
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,680
Take this.

355
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Thank you, Kim Tae Hee.

356
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,570
What brings you here, what about your workshop?

357
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,970
I was nearby doing work.

358
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,550
Should we kiss for a bit in the other room?

359
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,220
Do you know how pretty you are when you do that?

360
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,200
Where did you learn to say those cheesy words?

361
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
From my mother's dramas.

362
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,990
Wow.

363
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,870
Han Yeo Reum, listen to me carefully.

364
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,750
You work hard all day and come home,

365
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,370
but a friend that knows you very well and is very close with you is waiting for you. It must be nice, right?

366
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,530
Yeah.

367
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,780
But this friend won't go home even if it's very late.

368
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,140
You can play with him all night.

369
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,030
Even if you spend the night cuddling with him in one bed, no one says anything and even mother takes it for granted.

370
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,790
They sleep together everyday and go together everywhere, too.

371
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:38,400
Even if the two stick together all the time, people don't say anything and actually, they get quite jealous.

372
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,360
I think of that as marriage.

373
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,170
Give me your hand.

374
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,420
Which hand?

375
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,430
It's a bit late because I was thinking of a graceful way to do this.

376
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,380
But I couldn't really think of anything.

377
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,650
Let's get married.

378
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,510
I'll come next time.

379
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,240
Oh- wait, wait!

380
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,930
Hey- wait, catch her!

381
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,200
What's the matter?

382
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,750
You didn't leave yet?

383
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:35,010
I... just got... proposed to.

384
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,690
Already?

385
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,360
But I still didn't hear an answer.

386
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,930
It must be a rejection.

387
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,630
It's not that.

388
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,120
It's not a rejection.

389
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,450
It's just that I can't right now.

390
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,640
It's a rejection alright.

391
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,370
Ah, I'm so full.

392
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,020
Yeo Reum,

393
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,200
you can just start right now without your mother's help at Ha Jin's place.

394
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,530
Frankly speaking, what do they <i>not</i> have in that house?

395
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't want to. It hurts my self esteem.

396
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,320
Ha Jin's mother won't be still either.

397
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Ha Jin is her only child.

398
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,780
And especially... a doctor son.

399
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,210
Hey. You must think that we marry and use our occupation to marry, but these are only a few.

400
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,060
Yoon Sol, what do you think about this?

401
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,570
I miss Choi Eun Kyu so much.

402
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,110
All the men that pass by look like Choi Eun Kyu.

403
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,900
Even in my ramen, Choi Eun Kyu's face bobs around.

404
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,640
Really... I wish I can have a proper conversation with her.

405
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,280
That's what I mean.

406
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,130
What should I do? It's mom.

407
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,600
Was there no money in my bank account?

408
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,320
I took out cash.

409
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,800
Rock, papers, scissors!

410
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,300
Arrgh!

411
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,320
I lose every time!

412
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,880
Clean up, hurry.

413
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,070
Then as of today, Jun Ho is $0, Sol is $1,100, and Yeo Reum is $2,650.

414
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,280
Including what you borrowed when you set up the workshop.

415
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,720
How is it that the debt doesn't shrink no matter how much I pay?

416
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,330
Let me see this.

417
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,530
You count the cost of appendectomy I had <b>when I was 24 as debt too?</b>

418
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,020
It's your body, you should have paid for the surgery.

419
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,100
If you're like this, then I can't be responsible for you<b> when you get old.</b>

420
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,020
Just take responsibility of your own life. I'll take care of mine until I die.

421
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,940
Don't you think this is too much to your daughter?

422
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:58,270
No one knows what will happen when you get older, Mother.

423
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,150
I like you very much, Mother.

424
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,520
Hey.

425
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,070
Where else would we find a house like this<b> for a room-and-board fee of $500?</b>

426
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,160
When my parents emigrated, my future looked dark,

427
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,960
but I am very satisfied right now, Mother.

428
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,890
You said well.

429
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:19,380
Imagine if I collect monthly rent after I move out of this house.

430
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,700
It's $1500 for you three combined now, and<b> I'll probably ask for more, right?</b>

431
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,030
Of course.

432
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,660
Aren't you even thankful to me?

433
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,630
It's a relief that I don't do drugs.

434
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,210
That's the truth, Mother.

435
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,110
These days, people over thirty stay home getting supported by parents with the excuse of studying.

436
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,510
I heard you sleep outside often these days.

437
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,780
Mother, do you have CCTV installed here somewhere?

438
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,430
Do you sleep at Ha Jin's?

439
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,610
You should scold her on that, Mother.

440
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,100
You need to live a more sound life.

441
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,460
You're on birth control, right?

442
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,830
Is that all, Mother? When she's sleeping in her boyfriend's house?

443
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:03,140
Even if you wear a wedding dress pregnant, or even divorce, it's all your life but since I'm your mother, I will warn you this.

444
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,310
Make sure you're on birth control.

445
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,770
You, too.

446
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,430
As expected, our Mother.

447
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,020
You are very cool, Mother!

448
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,250
I respect you, Mother!

449
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,400
So, the world these days is where only the official virgins get the short end of the stick.

450
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,270
Where do I need to go to get my virginity praised?

451
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,170
Mom.

452
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,670
Ha Jin asked me to marry him.

453
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,840
And?

454
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,330
I don't have any money.

455
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,240
Did he tell you to buy the house?

456
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,310
It's not that.

457
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,190
Just do it in range with what you have. Is marriage a big deal?

458
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,050
All you have to do is sign papers.

459
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,640
Don't muster up useless pride and just tell him you don't have any money.

460
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,430
Mom, why are you like this to me?

461
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,050
This is too much.

462
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,300
Am I a daughter Dad brought from outside?

463
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,570
What a load of bullsh*t.

464
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,950
Darn it. Even my teary acting didn't work.

465
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,440
Even though they came out in the perfect timing this time.

466
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,350
What did Mother say?

467
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,020
Can't you tell from her expression?

468
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,970
She probably said "It's your life so you do whatever you want".

469
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,620
The only answer is Kang Tae Ha.

470
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,000
What do you mean, Kang Tae Ha?

471
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,470
He came to our store, asking to work together.

472
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,770
Was I the only one that didn't know that important fact?

473
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,710
Hey! Tell me!

474
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,910
That's not what's important.

475
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:55,150
If you work with Kang Tae Ha, you can pay off your debt in one shot.

476
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,300
It's not like you still have feelings for him, right?

477
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,850
It's not!

478
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,850
Why do you say it twice, making me suspicious?

479
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,190
It's because Ha Jin worries me.

480
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,200
Trust me.

481
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Ok, listen well.

482
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,260
This could be a very nice way to do revenge.

483
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,990
On the day you finish the job and get paid, you tell Kang Tae Ha,

484
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:21,520
"With the money you paid me, I'm getting married!"

485
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,470
Isn't it so cool and beautiful and amazing?

486
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,000
Isn't it such a happy ending for you? Isn't it?

487
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,680
Wow, women are so cruel.

488
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,680
I actually do want to give that jerk a taste of his own medicine.

489
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,930
Just feed it to him, feed it to him.

490
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,480
Let's feed it to him.

491
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,250
Let me think about it again.

492
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,190
Ugh.

493
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,050
<i>You're difficult, Han Yeo Reum.</i>

494
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,090
<i>I sent Chief Yoon, so go take a look at the site.</i>

495
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,390
<i>Prepare a design soon and get ready for a presentaton.</i>

496
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,830
What are you going to do?

497
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,630
I'm not doing it. If you want to do it, do it alone.

498
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,970
<i>This is a huge one.</i>

499
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,220
<i>It's a 330 sq. meter (3500 sq.ft) wine bar.</i>

500
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,110
<i>We're just checking out the place for now.</i>

501
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,350
<i>This is the equivalent of 5 sets of wedding furniture.</i>

502
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,840
<i>Are you in the luxury of rejecting work when you can't even get married because you're broke?</i>

503
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,610
Stop poking my painful spots!

504
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,140
Excuse me?

505
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,080
Are you hurt somewhere?

506
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,130
No.

507
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,280
It's nice, right?

508
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,330
The main construction is over and we just need the final touch. Take a quick look around.

509
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,810
We might die while working.

510
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,540
We didn't agree on this deal yet.

511
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,210
Just do it. Let's do it.

512
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,010
Han Yeo Reum.

513
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,860
Stop it.

514
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,330
A fun work came in.

515
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:01,030
An construction company wants us to do<b> interior carpentry work for a wine bar.</b>

516
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,130
That's nice.

517
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,600
You said that you wanted to expand to interior design once your workshop does well.

518
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,460
Can I do it?

519
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,950
I think it will be fun. I will get to experience how the interior works out.

520
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,670
You'll do it even if I tell you not to.

521
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,130
That's not true. If you tell me not to, then I won't.

522
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,750
Do it. Do everything that you want.

523
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,990
Instead of just looking at me. Kiss.

524
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,890
If you work more, then your hands will be more chapped.

525
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,710
It's okay. You put the hand cream on me every day.

526
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,610
Alright. Let's sleep.

527
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,260
Hold on. I'll check on my mom's situation.

528
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,910
<i>She will probably stay in the office the whole night.</i>

529
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,590
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

530
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,150
It's childish.

531
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,370
<i>What have you done to me to make me like this?</i>

532
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,160
Bullsh*t.

533
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,100
<i>What's wrong with you that you'd say that, Chief? </i> <b> - Idiot, you don't even know that?</b>

534
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,540
<i>You're all I think of the whole day. <b> - What?</i></b>

535
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,330
<i> I'm saying you're all I think of all day! <b> - Chief.</i></b>

536
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,790
Such a fool.

537
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,870
Teacher!

538
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,270
You were the one who wrote it...

539
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,320
That's why it's irritating. That I'm writing that sort of stuff.

540
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,310
Yoon Hee. I'm here.

541
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,640
I pity him. He is bereaving without much sleep after his loss.

542
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,380
In this scenario, should I have them kiss again?

543
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,480
<i>Ahn Jin Soo</i>

544
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,790
<i> Oppa, I'm hungry.</i>

545
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,300
<i> Hang on. It's been two days,</i>

546
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,840
<i>so we should be able to get down tomorrow morning.</i>

547
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,230
<i> If we go down today, then you won't have to go with that ahjussi and ahjumma.</i>

548
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,990
<i>Then I can stay with you.</i>

549
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,430
<i>When we go down, we will eat</i>

550
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,260
<i>and oppa will wash you too.</i>

551
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,320
<i>Ah Rim. Ah Rim!</i>

552
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,450
<i>I'm fine, oppa. Put me down. I can walk.</i>

553
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,290
<i> No, oppa will carry-</i>

554
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,280
<i> Ah Rim! Ah Rim!</i>

555
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,990
<i>Ah Rim. Ah Rim. Ah Rim.</i>

556
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,700
<i>Wake up. Ah Rim!</i>

557
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,010
<i>Ah Rim!</i>

558
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,430
<i>Ah Rim! Wake up! Open your eyes!</i>

559
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,630
<i> At first, we thought they hid somewhere inside the nursery.</i>

560
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,100
<i> So we searched everywhere including storage rooms.</i>

561
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,990
<i>Over there. It's Jin Soo and Ah Rim!</i>

562
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,890
<i>Where did you go? Where have you been?</i>

563
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,840
<i>My God. Please call an ambulance!</i>

564
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,530
<i>What do we do. She's badly hurt.</i>

565
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,840
<i> What are you doing? Please call an ambulance!</i>

566
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,760
<i> We'll take care of her. <b> - Put her down.</i></b>

567
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,200
<i>No!</i>

568
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,830
<i> What are you doing? We have to take care of Ah Rim's wound.</i>

569
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,280
<i>Don't! I don't want to! I said, no!</i>

570
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:16,380
<i>If I put her down, you're going to send her away for adoption.</i>

571
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,250
<i>I'm not going!</i>

572
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,500
<i>I want to be with oppa!</i>

573
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,800
<i>Please don't send her away for adoption.</i>

574
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,630
<i>Let's bring her to the hospital first.</i>

575
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,500
<i>Ah Rim. No. No.</i>

576
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,660
<i>Oppa! <b>- No!</i></b>

577
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,100
<i> Ah Rim! <b> - Oppa!</i></b>

578
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,910
<i>Let go! Let go!</i>

579
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,920
<i>Ah Rim, no! <b> - Oppa!</i></b>

580
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,190
<i>Ah Rim. <b> - Oppa!</i></b>

581
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,640
<i> Ah Rim! Ah Rim! Ah Rim! <b> - Oppa!</i></b>

582
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,250
<i>Oppa! <b> - Ah Rim!</i></b>

583
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,270
<i>Don't go! Ah Rim.</i>

584
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,090
No...

585
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,270
Did you have a nightmare again?

586
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:14,530
You're sweating so much. Should I go prepare you a bath? Or should we go take a walk?

587
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,120
Take a walk.

588
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,600
What kind of nightmare are you having that makes you go this way?

589
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,300
Hold on, let me bring a wet towel.

590
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm fine.

591
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,340
Please press here for me.

592
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,620
Your heart hurts again?

593
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,230
Stay here to sleep. I will come back later.

594
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,230
I don't want to. I'm coming with you.

595
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,950
You woke up because of me. You are going to be tired tomorrow.

596
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,460
I will not leave you to suffer alone. We are going to through this together.

597
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,170
I love you, Han Yeo Reum.

598
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,240
I told you to drink Camomile tea before bed every night.

599
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,650
It works for insomnia.

600
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,640
Get up.

601
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,810
One, two! <b><i>♫Take a chance♫</i></b>

602

604
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,910

605
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,460

611
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,220
This feels nice. <b> - It's nice.</b>

612
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,840
It's great we came out. Thanks.

613
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,670
Can I ask you something?

614
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,690
What your nightmare is about?

615
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,160
You get it at least once a month;

616
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,730
those times you wake up from sleep and just sit there.

617
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,210
At least we came out here because I saw you tonight.

618
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,940
If I did not, then you would have come out to the living room and just sat there.

619
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,380
And I would have been sleeping without knowing anything.

620
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,790
It's nothing.

621
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,910
It's nothing, really.

622
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,240
You would have told me if it was nothing. It's not just nothing since you're not telling me.

623
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,620
Like right now, you won't tell me.

624
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,920
<i> It suddenly came up to me.</i>

625
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,570
<i> The secret I can never tell Ha Jin.</i>

626
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,820
<i>I had forgotten I had such a secret as well.</i>

627
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,510
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

628
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,000
When I was young,

629
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,990
I did something wrong to someone.

630
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,670
I keep seeing the kid in my dreams.

631
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,130
Before, I read in a book,

632
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,210
that someone who has frequent nightmares is an innocent person.

633
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:17,250
It says that those people have nightmares to atone for even the littlest evil thoughts.

634
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,620
Next time, I will tell you when I'm ready.

635
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,280
I hope you can open up quickly.

636
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,600
You're telling me to run into your arms now?<b>- Yeah!</b>

637
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,010
Just try coming over here.

638
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,380
I love you, Nam Ha Jin.

639
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,870
Wait, it's not the right way.

640
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,790
Look at you sleeping outside often so skillfully.

641
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,800
I hear you check out your mother's schedule with Writer Jang.

642
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,710
I'll make breakfast.

643
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,380
Hey. Pay some attention to Sol.

644
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,320
I thought she was okay for a while,

645
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,780
but she got so drunk yesterday and cried her eyes out. It was no joke, I thought I was going to die.

646
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,420
She went crazy again, didn't she? <b> - What did I do wrong to deserve this?</b>

647
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,890
Looking after you guys all the time.

648
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,610
I had to hold back the thought of beating up Choi Eun Kyu, yesterday.

649
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,950
Should I just go punch him?

650
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,870
You know they didn't sleep together. Don't you know Sol?

651
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:42,820
She just looks fine on the outside but she is no better than a fool.

652
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:46,760
Good morning.

653
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,280
Good morning.

654
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,220
Guess your love life is going well.<b>You're staying out overnight quite frequently now.</b>

655
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,230
Yeah...

656
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,900
The world has become very kind.

657
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,270
Even though a single man and woman sleep together openly,

658
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,900
a so-called mother doesn't even care. Right?

659
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,790
♫ A girl who is warm and humane during the day.<b>(lyrics from Gangnam Style)</b>

660
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:17,230
♫ A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee.

661
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,890
♫ A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes.

662
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:27,190
♫ Where is that kind of woman?

663
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,000
Do Joon Ho,

664
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,910
as a man, what do you think?

665
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,170
Men don't have a conscience.

666
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,090
Right, right? <b>- Yes. They are bastards.</b>

667
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,280
I'll be out. <b>- Where are you going?</b>

668
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,730
I'm going to exercise.

669
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,570
We're in big trouble.

670
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:04,880
<i>How are you? I'm doing well.</i>

671
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,040
<i>I'm riding the bicycle in the Han River. The world looks beautiful.</i>

672
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,610
<i>I'm doing the things I used to do with you alone.</i>

673
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,640
<i>No matter what I do, it's not fun.</i>

674
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,000
<i> Choi Eun Kyu, it's fine if we are friends, so let's meet and hang out.</i>

675
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,230
I miss him.

676
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,630
Why do you miss that kind of rascal?

677
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,420
Where is your pride?

678
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,770
Right, I have to regain my pride.

679
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,920
Yes! You are valuable, Sol.

680
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,490
What are you going to do now...

681
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:52,160
I thought about why Choi Eun Kyu didn't sleep with me.

682
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,760
It's because I have small boobs.

683
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,940
How big does it have to be from that?

684
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,320
So I'm going to get surgery.

685
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,730
Where? Your boobs?

686
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,170
Yes, I will do it for you.

687
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,850
I will get you water drop shaped breast implants for free.

688
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,510
It's fine. I'm not going to ask you to do it.

689
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,950
Who else would you ask?

690
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,760
Doctor Nam.

691
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,540
So dirty!

692
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,550
Isn't it okay? <b>- No! You can't.</b>

693
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,000
Hey! I'm the professional at breasts.

694
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,270
It's too small. Can you make it this big?

695
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,410
You might not be able to walk.

696
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,690
It's okay.

697
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,600
We're the only ones like this, the competition is no joke.

698
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,620
They're saying they'll work on the renovation no matter what-<b>- So you're going to work for them?</b>

699
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,420
You don't have to put it that way- <b>- Did you check the planning fee?</b>

700
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,130
No, other companies don't have such an item.

701
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,620
And considering the work and view, tell them to go do it somewhere else.

702
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,070
Then we should at least do consultations. Just in case...<b>- Did you see doctors give free consultations to lawyers?</b>

703
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:09,120
Tell them to pay for the consultation! Then I will be more than happy to do it.

704
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,720
Hey!

705
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,870
I'm still older than you! How can you interrupt all of my sentences!

706
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,350
I didn't this time.

707
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,420
When is Summer & Pine Tree's design coming out?

708
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,030
Next week.

709
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,410
Is she sleeping again?

710
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,160
How are you here?

711
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,320
Let's have a drink.

712
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,020
Why would I drink with you?

713
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,140
Do you think that I would spend money for somebody else's girl? I just want to check out a place.

714
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,550
You really talk meanly.

715
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,430
There is a bar that we can refer to.

716
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,260
Where is that?

717
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,760
This is not really a wine bar, but more like a pub.

718
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,750
The designs and concepts are completely different, but the point in which people can freely hang out is similar.

719
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:13,730
♬ <i> What should I do? I keep looking at you.</i> ♬

720
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:25,630
♬ <i>It is too early to call it love, but it seems like it will become love.</i> ♬

721
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:37,830
Thank you. <b><i>♫What's up with me? I don't know if I'll start this love♫</i></b>

722
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,310
Here, this is the thing that you guys looked forward to the most.

723
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:55,390
You guys will sing. But you can't sing

724
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,920
just because you practiced. "I'm really bad at singing,

725
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,160
I don't want to."

726
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,450
Even if you are like that, you have to sing if you are pointed at. Do you guys agree?

727
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,600
Yes!

728
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,960
Good. Today, I will point at people on my own.

729
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:19,130
Between people who are sitting on the standing seats, a woman who is wearing a t-shirt.

730
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,230
Me?

731
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:25,330
The person next to her that is wearing a peach-colored dress will sing.

732
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:28,320
Me? <b>- Come to the stage!</b>

733
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,710
I have to sing? <b>- Try it.</b>

734
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,570
You think that I will back out on things like this, right?

735
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,470
Why are you like that? I'm Han Yeo Reum, the hottest woman in this world.

736
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,450
You are pretty! <b>- Fighting!</b>

You're beautiful!

738

What song do you want to sing today? <b>- Doctor Nam!</b>

739

Oh, Sol. Are you with Yeo Reum? She isn't answering her phone.

740

Where are you? Are you outside?

741
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,220
Oh, we're at a bar.

742
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,220
Oh, that song is quite hard to sing, will you be fine?

743
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,520
Where are you that you won't tell me?

744
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,850
You know I have a GPS finder app with Yeo Reum, right?

745
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,440
Han Yeo Reum's boyfriend is coming.

746
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,680
