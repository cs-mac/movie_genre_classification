1
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,649
- Pretty close. It's good.
- Not too bad.

2
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,633
It's gonna be about two minutes,
so come on.

3
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,801
Do what you got to do.

4
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,012
We got to go.
I need a wrist band.

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,140
It's something that you can't do
forever, you know?

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,435
This is not a lifetime career
that we can do, you know.

7
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,437
- So...
- It's not?

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,278
All right, let's go.

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,005
Thank you, and good evening.

10
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,132
We're the Eagles from Los Angeles.

11
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,099
One, two, three, four.

12
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,083
People are always
saying things to me like,

13
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,919
"You're just like a normal person."

14
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,297
And I always say, "Of course."

15
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,135
All right!

16
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,149
We might be a little more
world-wise, you know,

17
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,269
than some of those kids, that's all.

18
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,354
We just maybe have
less innocence than they do,

19
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,242
but, I mean, I eat, I sleep,
I fall in love,

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,774
I fall out of love, I work.

21
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,734
You know, I do pretty much
the same thing.

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,478
We saw a poster of us
when "On the Border" was made.

23
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,273
Everybody looked like
little kids, you know,

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,150
like, early 20s and stuff.

25
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,195
And everybody didn't have
their wrinkles and their baggy eyes.

26
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,655
Sort of like a president
when he first takes office.

27
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,700
And then,
like four or five years later,

28
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,786
you know, he just walks out,
and his hair is gray,

29
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,121
and his eyes are drooping,

30
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,874
and he's just really,
you know, real burned.

31
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,386
The first thing that happens
is you get some kind of label,

32
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,096
and then you got to live up to it,

33
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,390
and then you just
get caught in that,

34
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,269
and I forget
what the second thing is.

35
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,868
It's hard.
It's like living two lives.

36
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,537
You know, I have a family,
three kids.

37
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,749
And it's just hard
to live in between that line,

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,753
you know, of being out on the road
and being away for a month.

39
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,947
Maybe we wouldn't want
to do this anymore,

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,740
or maybe we can't do this anymore,

41
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,410
or maybe nobody will give a shit
if we do this anymore.

42
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,087
Thank you.

43
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,101
No, I insist. You first.

44
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,103
Hi, there.

45
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,941
Lock it up.
A hearty bunch out there.

46
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,401
Oh, he's not even here.
Now...

47
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,370
Hey, driver, lock 'em up
for us tonight, okay?

48
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,237
Out of sight.

49
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,324
You just don't know
what those kids will do.

50
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,534
Doggone.

51
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,790
How about a beer?

52
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,334
- Is that what I heard?
- You got it, brother.

53
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,712
Don't hurt yourself, young America.

54
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,006
Would you like one?

55
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,175
Yeah, I would like one.
I'm gonna drink tonight.

56
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,721
I think they feel like
they're up there, you know,

57
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,848
like they're on the stage.

58
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,476
'Cause we look like them.
We dress like them.

59
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,227
Part of it is that,
and part of it's the records.

60
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,437
I think they just relate to the songs.

61
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,648
I think it's 50/50, I guess.

62
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,233
The thing is now is to try to see

63
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,602
how long we can stay up here
at the top of the mountain.

64
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,155
It's very narrow and windy up here.

65
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,865
We can probably continue
doing what we're doing

66
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,076
as long as the songs keep coming.

67
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,452
That's the only thing
that frightens us

68
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,871
is to not be able
to do that anymore.

69
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,998
If nothing comes up,
we would be in trouble.

70
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,208
So far, so good.

71
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,544
I think we can maintain this
for a few more years.

72
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,254
I don't see why not.

73
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,672
Other people have...
the Rolling Stones

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,966
and the Who and the Led...
and Led Zeppelin...

75
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,970
I almost said the Led Zeppelin...
have done it.

76
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,972
Chicago's done it.

77
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,603
Groups last longer
than they used to, you know.

78
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Shit don't float.

79
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:04,506
90% of the time, being in the Eagles
was a fucking blast.

80
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,758
You know, I was living the dream.

81
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,765
We never in our wildest dreams

82
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,436
figured on being this successful
and lasting this long.

83
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,606
We were a bunch of guys out there
touring the country.

84
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,942
We had a little private plane.

85
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,195
We had parties after the shows.
We had a good time.

86
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,364
We were starting to make
some money.

87
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,038
We had three guitar players finally,
you know, so we could rock a bit.

88
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,458
So, it was a good time,
a good time for me,

89
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,626
a good time for Don.

90
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,090
Everybody was really happy...

91
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,886
...then.

92
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,979
It was going really fast,
and probably too fast.

93
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,155
There was turmoil within the band.

94
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,491
We put a lot of pressure
on ourselves.

95
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,161
As Glenn used to say,
"We made it, and it ate us."

96
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,163
It's hard to be in a group.

97
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,581
It's a bit like being in a marriage,

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,958
if you quadruple it
or quintuple it, in our case.

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,504
They asked Don
when the Eagles broke up,

100
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,672
"What was that like for you?"

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,675
And he said
it was a horrible relief.

102
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,305
And I think
that clocks it pretty well.

103
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,809
You're a real pro, Don, all the way.

104
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,686
Yeah, you are, too...
the way you handle people.

105
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,055
Except the people you pay,
nobody gives a shit about it.

106
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,859
Fuck you. I've been paying you
for seven years, you fuckhead.

107
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,196
So much stuff just happened.

108
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,243
You know,
there's a philosopher who says,

109
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,454
As you live your life...

110
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:06,753
...it appears to be
anarchy and chaos

111
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,714
and random events,

112
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,344
non-related events
smashing into each other

113
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,846
and causing this situation,"

114
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:22,352
and then... then this happens,
and it's overwhelming,

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,942
and it just looks like,
"What in the world is going on?"

116
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,282
And later, when you look back at it,

117
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,995
it looks like
a finely-crafted novel,

118
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,082
but at the time, it don't.

119
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,129
And a lot of the Eagles' story
is like that.

120
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,424
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

121
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,511
I can't wait. I can't wait.

122
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,475
We might as well start
at the beginning.

123
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,566
I grew up in Detroit, Michigan.

124
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,817
My dad worked in a factory.

125
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,570
My mother baked pies
at General Motors.

126
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,531
I started taking piano lessons
when I was five years old.

127
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,118
That alone could get you beat up
after school in suburban Detroit.

128
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,297
Detroit was Motown, and so
they played all the Motown hits.

129
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,807
And that was the kind of stuff
that we would listen to.

130
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,727
I stopped playing piano
when I was 12.

131
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,811
It was too much.

132
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,313
I wanted to do other things,

133
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,524
and I think the girl thing
was starting to happen, as well.

134
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,112
Then the Beatles came along,

135
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,032
and my Aunt took me down to see
the Beatles at the Olympia.

136
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,743
It was crazy.

137
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,370
I remember having a girl

138
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,497
that was standing on her seat
in front of me

139
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:11,461
fall backwards into my arms,
delirious, going, "Paul, Paul."

140
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,297
You know, and I thought,
"Oh, my God."

141
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,676
I have a very vivid memory
of seeing the Beatles

142
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,928
with my parents
on our old Admiral TV set.

143
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,429
It was like a bolt of lightning.

144
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,140
It had a huge impact on me.
It was revolutionary.

145
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,810
And it was an impact
that would last a lifetime,

146
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,104
and I know that had
a huge impact on Glenn, too,

147
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,272
even though we didn't know
each other at the time.

148
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,028
Linden, Texas, is my hometown.

149
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,656
It's a small town
in Northeastern Texas.

150
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,074
When I was growing up,

151
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,660
the population
was about 2,500, 2,600.

152
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,542
It's primarily an agricultural area.

153
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,377
Some people worked
at the steel mill.

154
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,671
It's just a typical
small Texas town.

155
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,715
There's an old courthouse

156
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,010
dating back to before the Civil War
and one stoplight.

157
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,472
It's kind of like "The Last
Picture Show," you know?

158
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,891
It was a great place musically

159
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,394
because it was kind of
a cultural crossroads.

160
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,520
It's really located

161
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,856
where the old South
begins to meet the West.

162
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,360
Linden, Texas, was the birthplace
of Scott Joplin

163
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,112
and T-Bone Walker.

164
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,742
Both my parents loved music,

165
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,494
so we had a lot of records
in the house.

166
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:31,040
I was exposed to music
of all kinds from an early age...

167
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,375
you know,
country-and-western music,

168
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,253
Western swing music,
gospel music, blues,

169
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,798
Johnny Cash, Hank Williams,
and Patsy Cline.

170
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,349
There was a 50,000-watt
radio station in New Orleans,

171
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,228
and I heard things on that station
that I didn't hear anywhere else.

172
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,940
So, I had a lot of radio coming in.

173
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,527
And when I would go to work
with my dad,

174
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:04,032
he would listen to a station
in Shreveport, Louisiana... KWKH.

175
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,670
And that station
broadcast a radio show

176
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,130
called the "Louisiana Hayride,"

177
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,218
where Elvis Presley made
his first radio broadcast in 1954.

178
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:40,401
The very first rock-'n'-roll record
I bought was by Elvis Presley.

179
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,282
My playing the drums was
sort of an organic process.

180
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,326
I began by beating
on my school books

181
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,663
with my fingers and with pencils.

182
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,872
I would beat out little cadences,

183
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,458
and I used to drive
my classmates crazy doing that,

184
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,293
until, I think, one day,
somebody said to me...

185
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,753
I think it was my friend
Richard Bowden...

186
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,041
he said, "Why don't you just
start playing the drums?"

187
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,051
I managed to cobble together
a drum kit from old drums

188
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,346
that I found stashed in the back
of the band hall in high school.

189
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,932
And then one day, my mom said,
"Come on, get in the car."

190
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,726
And she drove me to a town
about an hour and a half away

191
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,313
called Sulphur Springs, Texas,
to McKay Music Company.

192
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,023
Much to my surprise,

193
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,818
she bought me a set
of red-sparkle Slingerland drums

194
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,362
that I still have today.

195
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,698
So, I have to give my parents
a lot of credit.

196
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,199
They bought me that drum kit

197
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,618
even though
they couldn't really afford it.

198
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,290
The first band I was in

199
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,293
was a band with my high-school
buddy Richard Bowden

200
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,670
and another high-school friend,
Jerry Surratt,

201
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,547
and we played Dixieland jazz music.

202
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,675
Nobody sang.
We just played music.

203
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,683
I went to a high-school party,

204
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,435
and there were four kids
who were freshmen in high school

205
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,644
who were playing.

206
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,272
I was a junior, and I had
a couple beers that night

207
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,900
and said, "Hey, you know,
do you know 'Satisfaction'?

208
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,192
'Cause I can sing it."

209
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,404
So, I became the lead singer
of the Subterraneans.

210
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,119
I played in the Subterraneans
for a while,

211
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,747
and then I played in another band
called the Mushrooms.

212
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,916
The most important thing
that happened to me

213
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,001
when I was in Detroit
was I met Bob Seger.

214
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,345
He took me under his wing.

215
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,556
He invited me to recording sessions
that he was having, you know,

216
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,892
so I could see
how records were made.

217
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,685
I was his mentor.

218
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,103
He was just so young,

219
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,898
and I liked him right away
because he was so funny.

220
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,025
He had a great sense of humor,

221
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,987
and, like me, I could see
he was really ambitious.

222
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,156
He really wanted to be on the radio.

223
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,992
He cut a song
called "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man."

224
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,787
He let me play acoustic guitar
on the basic track

225
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,830
and sing background vocals.

226
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,381
You can really hear Glenn
blurt out on the first chorus.

227
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,633
He comes out really loud.

228
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,093
Tremendous gusto.

229
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,719
Of course, that was
a national hit for us,

230
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,138
so that was really cool.

231
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,724
Bob was the first guy
that wrote his own songs

232
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,476
and recorded them
that I had ever met.

233
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,395
He said, "You know,
if you want to make it,

234
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,313
you're gonna have to
write your own songs."

235
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,065
And I said,
"Well, what if they're bad?"

236
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,900
And he said,
"Well, they're gonna be bad."

237
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,988
He says, "You just keep writing
and keep writing,

238
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,821
and eventually,
you'll write a good song."

239
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,435
We were gonna have
a band together.

240
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,095
He was gonna get rid
of his other guys,

241
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,286
and I was gonna be his bass player.

242
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,330
It didn't work out.

243
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,958
My mom found me smoking pot
with a friend of mine

244
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,251
in somebody's basement,

245
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,712
and she called up
Seger's manager, Punch Andrews,

246
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,632
and said,
"Just a minute, not so fast."

247
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,970
In the years leading up
to the Great Depression,

248
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,222
my dad had to quit school
after the eighth grade.

249
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,598
He had to go home
and work in the fields

250
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,018
with his brother and sister
to help support the family.

251
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,854
His fondest wish...
in fact, his life's goal

252
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,856
was that I would go to college.

253
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,776
Every Saturday night, he would
bring home seven quarters,

254
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,778
and we'd put them in a piggy bank,

255
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,365
and when those quarters
amounted to $100,

256
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,076
he would take me to the bank
and we would buy a savings bond,

257
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,287
a United States savings bond,

258
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,665
and put that away
for my college education.

259
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,668
So, between what my dad had saved

260
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,171
and between what I was making
doing gigs all over Texas

261
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,964
and Arkansas and Louisiana
on weekends,

262
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,092
I paid for 31/2 years of college.

263
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,636
They have a world-famous
music department

264
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,388
in which I did not excel.

265
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,639
I took one music course.

266
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,518
I think it was beginning theory,
and I flunked.

267
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,353
I made an "F."

268
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,607
But I didn't really care
because I was an English major.

269
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,531
Well, after the Mushrooms,

270
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,868
I got invited to join this band
called the Four of Us.

271
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,913
Started getting into
some of the California bands...

272
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,665
the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield,
the Beach Boys.

273
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,126
Always wanted to go to California.

274
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,879
And I got out there,
my mind was blown.

275
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,090
The vegetation...
I'd never seen palm trees.

276
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,383
You know, it was just like
a dream come true.

277
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,605
The first celebrity I saw
was David Crosby.

278
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,197
And he had on
that flat-brimmed hat

279
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,074
that he wore
on the second Byrds album,

280
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,492
and he had a little leather cape on,

281
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,704
and I just looked and I thought,
"My God, there's David Crosby."

282
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,290
Zoom, and we went right by.

283
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,300
And the first person I met
was John David Souther.

284
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,636
We wanted to get high
and play music.

285
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,555
There were two of us with guitars.

286
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,307
We were listening to a lot
of that sort of interface

287
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,977
between rock 'n' roll
and country-and-western music

288
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,813
that was happening
in Southern California at the time

289
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,106
with the Byrds
and Dillard & Clark

290
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,942
and the Burrito Brothers and Poco.

291
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,415
There was a lot of great music
of that sort going around then.

292
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,833
Longbranch Pennywhistle here.

293
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,751
I suppose you wonder
what that name meant,

294
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,919
and John David and I...

295
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,547
It was a well-kept...
funky women.

296
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,133
The songs weren't very good.

297
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,927
I don't think Glenn and I were very
far along as songwriters then.

298
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,060
We were a funny little group,
but we got gigs.

299
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,688
We, you know, managed to play
in some of the folk clubs

300
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,564
around L. A.

301
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:56,527
The Golden Bear
and the Ash Grove.

302
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,497
We had a chance meeting
with Kenny Rogers

303
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,790
in Dallas, Texas, one day.

304
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,918
He was coming through town
with the First Edition.

305
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,086
They were very hot at the time.

306
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,050
I remember this
like it was yesterday.

307
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,053
This little kid came up
and said, "Mr. Rogers,"

308
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,556
he said, "I'm Don Henley,
and I'm with a group called Felicity,

309
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,308
and we're doing a show tonight,

310
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,644
and we'd love to have you
come see us."

311
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,230
And I said, "You know,
I'm really sorry, but I don't do that.

312
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,358
I don't just go to clubs
and watch groups."

313
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,236
He said,
"I really think you'd like us."

314
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,197
And I thought,
"Well, that's pretty cool," so I did.

315
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,923
Kenny is a Texas boy, and he was
looking for groups to produce.

316
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,172
So, I brought them to L.A.,

317
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,761
and they literally lived at my house
for about four months.

318
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,139
We changed their name to Shiloh.

319
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,685
It was so much fun
to take them into the studio.

320
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,699
With Shiloh, we made one album,
and it had a single called

321
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,994
"Simple Little Down Home
Rock and Roll Love Song for Rosie."

322
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,121
Not exactly a short title.

323
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,254
We didn't know much
about the business at that point.

324
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,630
We were pretty naive.

325
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,053
We kicked around
in the L.A. Clubs for a while,

326
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,388
played the Whisky,

327
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,058
played some of the clubs
down in the South Bay area,

328
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,935
and nothing really happened for us.

329
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,400
J.D. And I were looking
for any place to play.

330
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,277
We had heard about
this guy Jackson Browne.

331
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,237
He'd been playing
the same clubs we had,

332
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,906
but we never had seen him perform.

333
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,242
This is California.
Mr. Jackson Browne.

334
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,493
Ah, thank you, thank you.

335
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,421
Then there were
a bunch of gigs that they had

336
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,580
and some gigs that I had

337
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,249
that they would show up at my gigs
and me at their gigs,

338
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,834
and we became really good friends.

339
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,085
This is...

340
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,837
And we'd start talking about,

341
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,756
"Where do you live,
and what's going on?"

342
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,468
And Jackson said, "You know,
you should come down to Echo Park.

343
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,678
Rent's real cheap."

344
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,681
Glenn got the apartment
next to my apartment,

345
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,561
and this apartment cost like $125
or something a month, you know.

346
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,979
And I needed to economize,

347
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,732
so I moved into the basement
underneath Glenn's place,

348
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,234
which I could get into
for $35 a month.

349
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,652
It only had one door.

350
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,365
It was really just kind of
an illegal place, just a cubbyhole,

351
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,077
and that's where Jackson lived,
with J.D. And I above.

352
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,203
You know, that was it.

353
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,081
There was a stereo, a piano,
a bed, a guitar,

354
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,042
you know, a teapot.

355
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,381
We slept late in those days,

356
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,424
except around 9:00 in the morning,

357
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,010
I'd hear Jackson Browne's teapot
going off,

358
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,388
this whistle in the distance.

359
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,182
And then I'd hear him
playing piano.

360
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,559
I didn't really know
how to write songs.

361
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:20,064
I knew I wanted to write songs,
but I didn't know exactly...

362
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,526
you just wait around for inspiration,
what was the deal?

363
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:28,739
Well, I learned through Jackson's
ceiling and my floor

364
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,325
exactly how to write songs
'cause Jackson would get up,

365
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,745
and he'd play the first verse
and first chorus,

366
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,997
and he'd play it 20 times

367
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,583
until he had it
just the way he wanted.

368
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,419
And then there'd be silence.

369
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,046
And then I'd hear the teapot
go off again.

370
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,507
Then it'd be quiet
for 10 or 20 minutes.

371
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,926
Then I'd hear him
start to play again,

372
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,178
and there was the second verse.

373
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,555
So, then he'd work
on the second verse,

374
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,889
and he'd play it 20 times.

375
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,058
And then he'd go back
to the top of the song,

376
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,185
and he'd play the first verse,
the first chorus,

377
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,438
and the second verse
another 20 times

378
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,357
until he was really comfortable
with it and, you know,

379
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,027
change a word here or there,
and I'm up there going,

380
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,113
"So, that's how you do it...

381
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:15,411
elbow grease, you know,
time, thought, persistence."

382
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,804
I wanted to kill him sometimes.

383
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,476
Jackson would play the same phrase,
"Doctor, My Eyes" for six weeks.

384
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,203
The same thing with "The Pretender."
I just wanted to murder him.

385
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,527
And it was during that period of time
that I met Glenn Frey

386
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,196
because we were
on the same label

387
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,489
called Amos records.

388
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,866
Some of the things that struck me
when I first met Glenn

389
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,618
were things we had in common.

390
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,330
Both of our dads made a living
in the automotive industry.

391
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,208
Glenn and I loved old cars,
especially cars from the '50s.

392
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,586
He had a '55 Chevy
that he named Gladys.

393
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,173
And we drove around Los Angeles
in Gladys.

394
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,382
Check out some of the new talent.

395
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,509
There's no better place in town

396
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,316
to catch those new singers
and songwriters

397
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,179
than down
at the Monday night Hoot Night,

398
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,932
Doug Weston's world-famous
Troubadour, happening tonight.

399
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,684
The Troubadour club was
the center of the musical universe.

400
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,811
It was a very seminal place.

401
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,813
It was the place to see and be seen.

402
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,275
Every Monday night
they had an open stage.

403
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,152
It was called Hoot Night.

404
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,617
The Troubadour was the place to go
if you were young and happening

405
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,204
and trying to get involved
in the music scene.

406
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,289
It was happening there.

407
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,974
I saw a lot of great acts
at the Troubadour.

408
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,952
I witnessed Elton John's American
debut performance in 1970.

409
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,655
Everybody who was anybody
at the time played at the Troubadour.

410
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,805
Of course, Linda...

411
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:44,184
And she still has one of my favorite
voices in the business, ever.

412
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,114
The Troubadour is really responsible
for the entire music scene.

413
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,603
I mean, everything I got, really,

414
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,994
was virtually through either
performing there onstage

415
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,496
or in the bar, you know?

416
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,045
I was just started
managing Linda then,

417
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,089
and Linda was gonna be a star...
that voice as big as a house.

418
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,425
There wasn't anybody in the room

419
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,469
that cared about anything
but that voice.

420
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,784
One night, we're down
at the Troubadour,

421
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,727
and John Boylan comes to me...
he's managing Linda Ronstadt...

422
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,480
and he says,
"I'm taking Linda on the road.

423
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,607
We need guys who can sing.

424
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,442
You want to play rhythm guitar
and sing?"

425
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,403
I offered him $250 a week,
and he took it.

426
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,742
I went back to him, I said,

427
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,411
"Can you give me
some of that money right now?"

428
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,622
I think he gave me 50 bucks.

429
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,958
And then I found Don
from this band called Shiloh.

430
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,835
I heard him playing
at the Troubadour.

431
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,008
I was looking for a job.

432
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,968
Glenn introduced me to John Boylan.

433
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,346
I auditioned at this little house
in Laurel Canyon.

434
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,724
I had listened to her album
hundreds of times,

435
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,572
so I knew the songs
backwards and forwards,

436
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,063
and I guess I passed the audition
because I got the job.

437
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,258
I learned a lot from Linda.

438
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,301
It was a very formative experience
for me.

439
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,012
And she could hang
with the guys, you know.

440
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,267
She could drink tequila
with the rest of us and hold her own.

441
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,108
It was really very ad hoc.

442
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,694
We had a station wagon,
put the gear in the back.

443
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,905
We'd all get in it and drive
to the college and play there.

444
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,533
As a cost-cutting measure,

445
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,502
band members had
to share rooms in those days,

446
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,662
so Glenn and I were roommates.

447
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,415
- What did you guys eat?
- I had a bowl of Rice Krispies.

448
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,835
Ladies and gentlemen,
Linda Ronstadt.

449
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,133
It's funny. I seem to get people

450
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,718
at a critical stage
in their development,

451
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,844
and they sort of build their chops.

452
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,596
I mean, there's nothing
that gets your chops up better

453
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,097
than playing every single night.

454
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,272
Linda and John Boylan

455
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,232
really like the way
Henley and I play,

456
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,943
really like the way
we sing with her,

457
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,987
and they start to get a vision

458
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,365
of putting together a super group
to back up Linda...

459
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,744
the best of the new
country-rock musicians,

460
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,621
and we were gonna be part of it.

461
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,165
I remember talking with Don,
and Don said,

462
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,252
"Well, you know, I'd rather, like,
just be in a band with you."

463
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,047
And I said, "Well, yeah, me too.

464
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,634
You know, I'd rather just be
in a band with you."

465
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,640
So, we went to Linda and said,

466
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,893
"You know, we really appreciate
everything you've done for us,

467
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,979
and it means a lot,
and we love playing with you,

468
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,774
but we'd like to have
our own band."

469
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,159
Now, you know,
I think a lot of people,

470
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,744
you know, could get miffed by that,

471
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,038
say, "Well, wait a second.
I brought you out here, you know.

472
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,581
I gave you a paying job

473
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,417
when you couldn't afford your own
drinks at the Troubadour bar,

474
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,753
and now you want to quit?"

475
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,552
Linda was extremely gracious
about the whole thing,

476
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,928
as was John Boylan.

477
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,014
They weren't resentful
or bitter at all.

478
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,349
They were great.

479
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,157
They were supportive,
as a matter of fact.

480
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,282
They started talking
about putting a band together,

481
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,493
and we told them
they should get Bernie Leadon.

482
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,997
I was in several bands in L.A.
Early on, I met Linda.

483
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,790
Then I worked
with Dillard & Clark...

484
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,794
Doug Dillard, banjo player,
and Gene Clark from the Byrds.

485
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,298
And so, now I'm in an offshoot
of the Byrds world,

486
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,884
and then that turned
into an invitation

487
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,886
from the Burrito Brothers
from Chris Hillman

488
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,472
to come join them
for their second album on A&M.

489
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,233
And I was still in the Burritos,
but they had lost Gram Parsons,

490
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,361
and it had changed, and I wasn't
that interested anymore.

491
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,325
Bernie was a very accomplished
banjo player,

492
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,784
and he could also play guitar

493
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,828
in what we called
the Bindi lick style.

494
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,164
It was pioneered by a fellow
named Clarence White.

495
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,250
And then Glenn told me
about this guy named Randy Meisner

496
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,377
who had been in a band called Poco.

497
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,797
Randy could sing really high,
and he also played bass.

498
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,677
So, Glenn just kind of
asked me one day

499
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,931
if I'd be interested
in starting a group with him.

500
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,392
And he had Henley and Bernie.

501
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,687
That was the first Eagles.

502
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,065
So, the plan was that Glenn and I

503
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,400
would try to recruit
Bernie and Randy,

504
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,235
and then we would all go
to David Geffen

505
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,280
and see if he would give us
a recording contract.

506
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,909
In the '70s, Asylum Records
was considered the L.A. Sound...

507
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,038
Joni Mitchell, Crosby, Stills,
Nash & Young, Jackson Browne.

508
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,417
David Geffen, who started Asylum,
is our patron, you know.

509
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,754
A medici, medici of rock 'n' roll.

510
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,465
It's a very artist-oriented company,

511
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,968
and whatever they want to do,
we support them.

512
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,344
If we believe in them,
we'll stick with them,

513
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,633
whether they make it or not.

514
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,932
Jackson was our conduit
to David Geffen.

515
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,059
He was the first guy to get signed

516
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,145
by Geffen's new
Asylum Records label.

517
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,147
So, we all walk in Geffen's office,

518
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,274
and we basically said,
"Here we are."

519
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,569
Bernie Leadon just boldly
says to Geffen,

520
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,239
"Well, do you want us or not?"

521
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,949
They were dying to sign with me.

522
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,868
I think they were very ambitious,
particularly Glenn.

523
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,662
Glenn wanted to have a hit band.

524
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,330
I loved the way Don sang.

525
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,749
You know, we all had hopes for it.

526
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,585
All of a sudden, we were signed
to Geffen's new label.

527
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,421
They sent us back
to the drawing board.

528
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,506
They said, "You guys need to go
and rehearse some more."

529
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,674
They said, "You know,
you need to write some songs.

530
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,196
You're not really ready
to record yet."

531
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,849
So, they packed us off
to Aspen, Colorado.

532
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,142
It could have been worse.

533
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,352
There were people
who were way higher

534
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,187
than any of us had ever been.

535
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,735
It was a Wild West
wide-open town at that point.

536
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,997
We played at a club up there
called the Gallery,

537
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,746
which was located right
at the foot of Aspen Mountain.

538
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,299
We didn't have a big catalog
of our own tunes at that point.

539
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,593
We were just getting started.

540
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,723
We needed to learn how to play
together as a band, and we did.

541
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,491
And then it was like,
"Okay, we need to make a record.

542
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,058
Who are we gonna get
to produce it?"

543
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,244
We wanted to shoot
as high as we could.

544
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,081
Glenn Frey came up
with Glyn Johns as an idea.

545
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,501
Glyn Johns was a name
that kept popping up

546
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,212
on records we loved.

547
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,341
The first time I heard them
was in Aspen.

548
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,926
I was not at all impressed, really.

549
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,683
I thought they were confused.

550
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,437
Glenn Frey wanted to be
in a rock-'n'-roll band,

551
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,606
and Bernie Leadon,
on the other side,

552
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,109
was one of the greatest
acoustic players...

553
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,693
country players, if you like.

554
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,530
And there was a bit of a confusion.

555
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,449
I didn't see what all the fuss
was about at all.

556
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,201
So I passed.

557
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,620
We're like, "God dang, what..."

558
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,581
You know,
it's not what we expected.

559
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:31,294
He had worked with Led Zeppelin,
the Who, the Stones,

560
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,046
so he was coming from that,

561
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,758
and he said flat-out,
"You're not that, man."

562
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:42,013
It isn't always easy to spot
what's hot about an artist

563
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,302
if you go and see them play.

564
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,712
You can see them on a bad night.

565
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,853
You know, it's not necessarily
the fairest way of doing it.

566
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,772
So, I thought,
"Well, the best thing to do

567
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,942
would be for me to see them
in a rehearsal situation

568
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,486
where we could converse
and they could play new stuff

569
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,821
and I could stop and start."

570
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,324
And they played the stuff
that they played in Aspen,

571
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,826
and it all sounded
pretty much the same.

572
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,871
Well, I was thinking, "I don't get it.
I still don't get it."

573
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:12,169
So, we decided
to take a break for lunch,

574
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,795
and as we were leaving,

575
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,507
somebody said, "Oh, why don't we
play Glyn that ballad?"

576
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,897
And it just completely
blew me off my feet.

577
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,191
I mean, there it was.
That was the sound.

578
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,661
Extraordinary blend of voices,
wonderful harmony sound.

579
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,789
Just stunning.
And that was it.

580
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,166
I was in with both feet.

581
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,383
Except that Glyn Johns

582
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,511
didn't want to come
to the United States and work.

583
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,929
He wanted to work in London

584
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,096
in the recording studios
that he was familiar with,

585
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,662
and so they shipped us
off to England.

586
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,949
I don't think that any of us
except Bernie

587
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,645
had ever been out of the country,

588
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,356
so it was a little bit like
going to the moon for us.

589
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,575
And I'm stoked.

590
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,664
You know, I'm thinking,

591
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,704
"I'm gonna go to Beatle country
with Glyn Johns.

592
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,581
I'm gonna record in the same studio

593
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,209
where Led Zeppelin
did 'Rock and Roll'.

594
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,461
Oh, my God, I can't wait."

595
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,590
We were recorded
at the famous Olympic studios,

596
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,260
where a lot of legendary records
had been made.

597
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,595
Glyn Johns... he had
a certain style of recording,

598
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,389
which was very organic.

599
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,766
He would simply place
a few mikes around the room,

600
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,725
and off you go.

601
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,019
You know, rather than, for example,

602
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,188
placing a microphone
on each and every drum,

603
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,440
he would just put
three microphones on the drum kit.

604
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,048
He was accustomed
to recording people

605
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,444
like John Bonham
with Led Zeppelin.

606
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,073
And I said to Glyn,
"I want the bass drum to be louder."

607
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,909
And he said, "If you want it louder,
hit it harder," you know?

608
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,357
And I hit it as hard as I could,

609
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,372
but I couldn't hit it
as hard as John Bonham.

610
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,542
He had a bunch of rules
that really didn't suit me

611
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,502
and some of the other guys, too.

612
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,130
You know,
no getting high in the studio,

613
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,798
no drinking in the studio.

614
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,718
I agreed wholeheartedly
with Glyn Johns

615
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,470
regarding drugs and alcohol
in the studio...

616
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,515
that we'd get more work done
and that it would be better work.

617
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,643
When I got the opportunity
to produce

618
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,729
and therefore be in the chair,

619
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,274
I decided that I would no longer
put up with that.

620
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,803
Somebody said to me
the other night

621
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:47,741
that I was the designated driver
in the '60s and early '70s.

622
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,576
Glyn had worked
with the Rolling Stones

623
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,828
at a time
when they went to the studio

624
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,873
and did nothing
except wait for Keith, you know,

625
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,834
to go down in the basement
and play his guitar

626
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,294
until he came up with some riff.

627
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,838
So, Glyn was impatient.

628
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,633
The Stones had burned him out
on the, you know,

629
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,042
"get high in the studio
and wait for something to happen"

630
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,012
kind of thing.

631
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,222
Let's go. We're rolling.

632
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,391
One, two, three.

633
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,552
There were three hit singles
on the first album.

634
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,805
"Peaceful Easy Feeling"
was written by Jack Tempchin,

635
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,224
who is our friend
and frequent collaborator.

636
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,441
"Peaceful Easy Feeling"
captures the time,

637
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,443
captures this attitude.

638
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,405
You can feel the wind
blowing across the desert.

639
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,425
The second hit was "Witchy Woman,"
which I wrote with Bernie.

640
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,263
"Witchy Woman"
started as a guitar figure.

641
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,474
Then we were jamming it one day,
and everybody was digging it.

642
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,352
And then Henley came back
the next day with the lyrics.

643
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,400
During the time that the Eagles
were on the road

644
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,982
for the first album,
we had just come through the '60s...

645
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,485
civil rights movement, '68...

646
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,779
all the assassinations,
all the rioting.

647
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,949
The Vietnam War still winding up.

648
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,951
Nixon, Watergate.

649
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,328
I welcome this kind of examination.

650
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,122
I really think that part of the reason

651
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,208
that the Eagles succeeded
the way they did

652
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,127
was because the country
and people and young people

653
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,046
needed to feel
like things were okay.

654
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,466
So, here comes this song
"Take It Easy."

655
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,646
Jackson had this song
called "Take It Easy."

656
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,939
He couldn't finish the song.

657
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,108
He was stuck in the second verse.

658
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:54,862
He had "I'm standing on a corner
in Winslow, Arizona."

659
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,866
And so, I filled in,
"Such a fine sight to see.

660
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,785
It's a girl, my Lord,
in a flatbed Ford

661
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,353
slowing down to take a look at me."

662
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,012
Girl, Lord, Ford... I mean,
all the redemption, you know...

663
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,223
girls and cars and redemption
all in this one line.

664
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,475
I mean, he's very mercurical.

665
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,770
You know... mercurial? Mercurial.

666
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,356
And he's mercurical, too.

667
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,371
All right!

668
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,546
Someone once asked
Stephen Stills about the Eagles,

669
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,008
and his response was,
"They just wanted to be us."

670
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,594
But when it came time
to do our album covers,

671
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,889
they suggested that we use
Gary Burden and Henry Diltz.

672
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,642
They had done the first
Crosby, Stills, Nash cover

673
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,268
and some stuff for Joni.

674
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,646
The one I really remember
was the Mamas and Papas

675
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,105
all sitting in the bathtub.

676
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,816
That was one of their album covers.

677
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,403
So, these were, like, the cool guys
to have work on your album.

678
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:22,158
Gary Burden is about
40 years old, full beard,

679
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,912
long, grayish, wavy hair,
crystal-blue eyes.

680
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:32,251
Henry was sort of magical,
non-invasive photographer guy.

681
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,380
For the Eagles,
it was the peyote spirits

682
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,674
which the American Indians,
of course,

683
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,177
ate peyote and had a very,
very spiritual experience,

684
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,430
and they would maybe
meet their animal totem

685
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,392
or they would get
their quest for life.

686
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,771
My deal was always to take
the bands out of their comfort zone.

687
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,274
Take them away from their girlfriends,
from telephones,

688
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:59,070
from anything,
and have them under my control

689
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,616
so that I could get things to happen
without any interference.

690
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,660
And so, we would take trips.

691
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,496
Now, how this plan
came about exactly,

692
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:13,626
today you have to scratch your head,
but this was the plan.

693
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,378
Okay, we'll all go
to the Troubadour,

694
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,339
and we'll stay there
till closing time.

695
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,592
And then we'll drive to Joshua Tree.

696
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,348
We had a bag of peyote buttons,
a bunch of trail mix,

697
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,643
some tequila, and some water,
and some blankets.

698
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,229
And the seven of us
set out for Joshua Tree.

699
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,399
We got there probably
about 4:30 in the morning,

700
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,025
parked in this special place

701
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,611
that I don't know
how we found it in the dark.

702
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,954
We all took one peyote button,
put it in our mouths,

703
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,500
and started hiking up to the place
that we were supposed to go.

704
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,337
So, right around the time
that we're getting to the campsite

705
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,945
and we're starting to build the fire

706
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,551
and starting to cook some peyote tea,
and the first buttons...

707
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,179
everybody's chewing
the first button,

708
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,558
and the drug starts coming on
just as the sun is rising.

709
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,618
I think everybody got higher

710
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,245
than they ever imagined
anybody could be,

711
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,414
and it was a good thing.

712
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,752
We were after getting
into life deeper and better

713
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,587
and more and surrendering.

714
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:49,972
I had to go to the bathroom,
so I left the campsite,

715
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,769
and I hear the guys yelling
from the campfire, "Eagle! Eagle!"

716
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,980
I look up, and it's soaring
right above me.

717
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,649
Huge wingspan.

718
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,819
I'm, like, scuffling to get my pants
back up, and I'm slipping.

719
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,405
I fall down, and the bird
just kind of goes,

720
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:10,159
"Eagles, huh?
Yeah, I don't think so."

721
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,040
The images of the first album cover,

722
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:21,003
I think, really set the tone
for visually what Eagles are.

723
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,964
Gary designed the album cover

724
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,176
so that it would open up
into a whole poster,

725
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,013
and at the bottom were
the Eagles around the campfire.

726
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,140
And then, up at the top,

727
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,978
it would go on up into the sky
and the eagle up in the sky.

728
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,523
But David Geffen thought
that would be confusing,

729
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,651
and without consulting us
or consulting Gary or the Eagles

730
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,237
or anybody, he told them,
"Just glue it shut."

731
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,490
And so, then, when they glued
it shut, you would get this...

732
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,201
this album, front and back,
and you'd open it up,

733
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,744
and it would be upside-down,

734
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,122
which didn't make any sense
to anybody.

735
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,046
The fact was that the success
of the first album

736
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,715
scared the hell out of us.

737
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,634
Why me instead of some guy
down the street, you know?

738
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,344
Why me and some friends of mine

739
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,805
who are just as good of musicians
as I am, you know,

740
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,308
but it happened to me
and it didn't happen to them?

741
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,684
I don't know.

742
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,062
Success can sometimes be
just as disconcerting

743
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,981
and frightening as failure,

744
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,510
especially when you have questions

745
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,068
about your own worthiness
and your abilities.

746
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,280
It came time to do another album.

747
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,700
Don and I decided we'd try
to write some songs together.

748
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,869
I had been sitting over
on Aqua Vista.

749
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,077
I was living on the couch,

750
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,964
and I'm just laying there
playing the guitar,

751
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,665
and I started going...

752
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,712
You know, I'm thinking,
"Yeah, that's pretty cool,

753
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,338
kind of Roy Orbison,
kind of Mexican.

754
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,714
Yeah, I like that."

755
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,675
So, I showed him,
you know, that guitar riff.

756
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,803
I said, "Maybe we should
write something to this."

757
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,002
Songs like "Desperado"
and "Tequila Sunrise"...

758
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,254
that's when Glenn and I
began collaborating,

759
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,840
and that's when we really became
a songwriting team.

760
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,858
Earlier that year,

761
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:52,488
someone had given Jackson Browne
the book of gunfighters.

762
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,281
It had all the big outlaw groups...

763
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,743
Frank and Jesse,
the Doolin-Dalton gang.

764
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,037
We were all just fascinated
with those guys,

765
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,415
and we thought it would make
a great analogy.

766
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,127
Well, for example, we live
outside the laws of normality.

767
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,630
Also, you usually... because
of records or bank robberies,

768
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,508
you usually heard about these guys
before you ever saw them.

769
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,847
They had posters that were wanted
posters up for people.

770
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,520
There just seemed to be
some parallels.

771
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,943
It wasn't really like
we were outlaws,

772
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,905
but I think they did have
their nobler characteristics.

773
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,331
We started talking about it.

774
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,125
Then we said,
"Well, maybe we should do, like,

775
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,753
an album all about the rebels."

776
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,379
We got to doing this outlaw album,

777
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,383
and we had eight songs finished,
and we needed two more.

778
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,637
An idea Randy came up with
was how the guy became an outlaw

779
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,015
and how he became a guitar player.

780
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,927
I kind of started it,
and that's what usually happened.

781
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,346
I'd get a verse or two,
and then I'm done,

782
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,598
and they would
help fill in the blanks.

783
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,987
Nobody expected there
to be a concept album

784
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,448
with Western cowboys music.

785
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,285
Don Henley was from Texas.
He was a cowboy.

786
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,622
Glenn was from Detroit.
He wanted to be a cowboy.

787
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,626
Because I knew all these guys
had a little cowboy inside of them,

788
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,628
I took them to Western costume

789
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,798
and just said,
"Pick out your persona."

790
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,844
Their premise was that,
if they had lived 100 years ago,

791
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:23,889
in like 1872, they probably
would have been gunslingers.

792
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,138
Everybody's gonna be firing

793
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,642
in the direction
of this building right here.

794
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,812
Jackson, J.D., Boyd, you all
got to be in the picture more.

795
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,147
We're gonna be in there.

796
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,483
You ready?
One, two, three!

797
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,366
And we fired so many blanks

798
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,953
that it was a cloud of smoke
hanging over this Western town,

799
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:50,791
and the fire department came
'cause they thought it was a fire.

800
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,086
Keep firing!

801
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,535
We were just a bunch of kids.
We were just playing around.

802
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,982
The picture
that's on the back of the album...

803
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,266
there's a lot of reality in it.

804
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,144
All of the agents and managers
and road managers,

805
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,479
all the guys who didn't play
are standing up,

806
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,690
alive with badges and guns,

807
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,402
and the four Eagles at the time
and Jackson and I are all dead,

808
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,362
bound up the way they used to do

809
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,114
when they'd catch outlaws
in those days.

810
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,603
They'd stand them up for display.

811
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,745
People never tired of looking
at the corpse of a bad boy.

812
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,791
We all felt, when we were doing it
and as it was delivered,

813
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,170
that it was another
really remarkable record

814
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,755
on the part of the band.

815
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,048
I mean, it was pretty extraordinary.

816
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,009
The band and I were
enormously thrilled with it.

817
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,054
They literally carried me
out of the control room.

818
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,640
They chaired me
out of the control room.

819
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,232
"Desperado" comes out,
and it bombs.

820
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,654
Jerry Greenberg was the Vice
President of Atlantic Records.

821
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,740
They were excited
to get the second Eagles album.

822
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,868
We played him "Desperado,"
and he said, "Hmm, that's, yeah,

823
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,704
that's nice, that's good,
that's nice,"

824
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,953
and turned around and said,

825
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,751
"God, they made
a fuckin' cowboy record."

826
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,265
I was extremely flattered
that Linda recorded "Desperado."

827
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,101
It was really her
that popularized the song.

828
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,521
Her version was very poignant
and beautiful.

829
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,913
There have been
a lot of articles and things

830
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,165
that identify me
with the L.A. Sound.

831
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,252
It's sort of, like, me and
Jackson Browne and the Eagles.

832
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,581
All of us are reaching out
for other musical influences

833
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,714
all the time.

834
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,092
The so-called southern California
sound was developing.

835
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,678
It was fresh, it was different,
it was unique.

836
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,014
It was a melting pot,
people moving here

837
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,433
from all over the United States
to pursue their dream...

838
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,020
actors, musicians,
wannabe managers, agents,

839
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,521
wannabe, you know, like me.

840
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,112
I picked up the phone cold
and called David Geffen,

841
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,989
who was just starting
Asylum Records.

842
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,242
Long story short, I took a job
as a manager with Asylum.

843
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,955
I was intrigued. I wanted to know
about the Eagles

844
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,458
and meet the Eagles
'cause I was a fan.

845
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,002
Emergency.

846
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,671
I get a phone call.
Glenn Frey's on the phone.

847
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,507
"We need money for Christmas.
Can you book dates?"

848
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,633
I book some dates.

849
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,511
So, I get on a plane
and go out to meet them.

850
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,847
First of all,
the show was fantastic.

851
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:56,685
Crowd was nothing like I'd seen
a year, year and a half earlier.

852
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,938
Good evening. Welcome
to the Portland version of...

853
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,732
- Spread eagle.
- Spread eagle.

854
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,276
Tonight, the promoter
gave us chopsticks.

855
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,779
I don't think we ever
checked in a hotel.

856
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,907
We went from there
to a party at a sorority house.

857
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,742
One thing led to another,

858
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,578
and I'd never seen
anything like this.

859
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,996
They wouldn't give us any booze
in the bar.

860
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,457
We tried to get some booze,
but they fucked up,

861
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,875
so we may burn
the fucking place down.

862
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:20,876
We're not sure.

863
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,671
I don't think we went to sleep.
It was Eagle mania.

864
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,259
And then they went off to England

865
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,637
to record "On the Border"
with Glyn Johns.

866
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,392
They were quite open
to being produced.

867
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,394
Understandably, that changed.

868
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:43,899
They began to be more opinionated
and less insecure, perhaps.

869
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,235
We wanted to play rock 'n' roll

870
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,862
or at least a more rock-'n'-roll
version of country music,

871
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,781
and Glyn Johns was of the opinion

872
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,158
that we weren't
really capable of that.

873
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,577
I think he had been bombarded
by loud,

874
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,580
aggressive rock 'n' roll
for many, many years.

875
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,873
At that point in his life,

876
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,001
he wanted mellow people
and mellow music,

877
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,589
and we weren't exactly
at the same stage in life.

878
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,050
Frey sort of took over more.

879
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,428
He had this desire to be something

880
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:16,515
that I didn't really feel
that they were capable of doing.

881
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,726
He and Glenn Frey
were like oil and water.

882
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,271
They clashed frequently.

883
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,732
In the studio, Glyn Johns
was pretty much a schoolmarm.

884
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,444
He'd push, push, push, you know?

885
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,811
And then he'd say, "That's it.

886
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,530
That's good enough.
We're moving on.

887
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,699
You're not a rock-'n'-roll band.

888
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,786
The Who is a rock-'n'-roll band,
and you're not that."

889
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,456
After each of those records,

890
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:45,085
the band freaked out and said,
"We've made a huge mistake.

891
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,087
Glyn Johns missed it."

892
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,755
We actually had conversations.

893
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,633
You know, "Desperado" hadn't done
as well as the first album.

894
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,138
None of them were thrilled
with the way the record sounded.

895
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,225
We wanted more input into
how our albums were being made.

896
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,604
We wanted more input
into the recording process itself.

897
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,107
Don and I thought
that the vocals were too wet.

898
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,734
There was too much echo on them.

899
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,987
And he definitely told us,
"Excuse me, that's my echo.

900
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,448
It's my signature.
It's my bloody echo.

901
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,417
It stays there.
You don't tell me what to do."

902
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,619
We needed to make a change.

903
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,833
I joined the Navy
at the height of the cold war.

904
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,585
One of the main things
they were doing

905
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,380
was looking for Russian submarines,
and you do that by using sonar.

906
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,844
When I got out, I had a lot
of electronics education, obviously.

907
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,932
And I got a job in a recording studio
here in New York.

908
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,602
The first session I ever saw,
like day one, day two,

909
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,270
was a Carole King demo.

910
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,980
She sat down and played piano,

911
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:52,319
and it was like, "Boy, this is fun.
These people are having fun here."

912
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,491
I worked my way up
through the ranks,

913
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,160
and then, of course, after
engineering for four or five years,

914
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,848
I was like,
"Well, I can produce better

915
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,706
than some of these guys
I'm working for."

916
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,292
At the time,
I was managing Joe Walsh,

917
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,545
so I played them Walsh music

918
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,341
that I thought was an example
of how it could be edgier.

919
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,189
Joe and I had just finished
an album called

920
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,720
"The Smoker You Drink,
The Player You Get."

921
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:22,266
And they heard that and said,
"That's what we want to sound like."

922
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,892
So, Irving arranged for us

923
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,727
to have a meeting
with Bill Szymczyk.

924
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,522
We really only had two questions
that we wanted to ask him...

925
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,732
Do you mind if we have some input

926
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,609
about how much echo
is on the vocals?

927
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,903
And we wanted somebody
who would put a microphone

928
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,071
on each and every drum

929
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,031
so we could have more control
over the mix.

930
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,741
He said yes to every question,

931
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,911
and so we knew
he was the guy for us.

932
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,080
I said, "Okay, under one condition.

933
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,250
I have to call Glyn
and make sure it's okay with him."

934
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,127
So, I called him, and I said,

935
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,589
you know, "Glyn, the Eagles
want me to produce them."

936
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,424
"Better you than me, mate."

937
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,176
That's pretty much how I felt.

938
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,764
I mean, it had come
to a fairly unpleasant end.

939
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,558
Well, okay, you know,

940
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,145
so much for Beatle country
with Glyn Johns.

941
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:15,652
Let's have a warm round of applause
on a hot afternoon for the Eagles.

942
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,253
Along about the third album,

943
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:37,507
I was having some difficulty
in communicating,

944
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:38,842
I felt, in the band,

945
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,803
and I was starting to think
maybe I should go at some point.

946
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,806
They still had
this unfulfilled desire

947
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:48,852
to be a mainstream rock band
and not just a vocal band,

948
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,813
but I think they wanted to go
in a tougher direction.

949
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,319
Bernie Leadon was
a country-based guitar player,

950
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,572
but every time I wanted to do
a rock-'n'-roll song,

951
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,491
he was the lead guitar player.

952
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,916
Every time we wanted to do
something country that Bernie sang,

953
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,293
I was supposed to be
the lead guitar player,

954
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,254
and I wasn't a country musician
by any stretch.

955
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,341
It always felt like we needed
a third guitar player.

956
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,763
We had met this friend of Bernie's,
this guy named Don Felder.

957
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,307
We were playing in Boston,
and he came back to visit Bernie,

958
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,768
and we were jamming upstairs
in the dressing room,

959
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,813
and this guy was all over the neck.

960
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,611
What he brought was great chops.

961
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,197
I mean, we called him Fingers...
Fingers Felder...

962
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,824
because he was
an incredible player.

963
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,246
We did that session.
I think it was like three hours.

964
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,878
And then I packed up and went home,

965
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,767
not thinking anything more about it
than it was just another session.

966
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,717
And the next day, Glenn called me

967
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,052
and asked me
if I would like to join the band.

968
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,013
I said, "Absolutely."

969
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,350
- All right, let's do...
- I'm in heaven.

970
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,644
- Let's go another one.
- All right, do it right!

971
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:16,606
The banter that would go on
in between takes was hysterical,

972
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:21,820
and so I took to running a two-track
to pick up these silly things.

973
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,905
We were young men
with raging hormones

974
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,657
and something to prove.

975
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,951
In the context of the times
and the profession,

976
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,954
the way we behaved
wasn't really all that remarkable.

977
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,205
The creative impulse

978
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,750
comes from the dark side
of the personality,

979
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,585
so we worked it good, you know.

980
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,380
We did a lot of stupid things,
said a lot of stupid things.

981
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,092
It was the '70s.
There were drugs everywhere.

982
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,221
Cactus sunrise was in my face

983
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:52,934
Everyone was dying,
everyone was lying and trying

984
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,605
Well, rub your belly
in the linseed oil

985
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,607
There you go.

986
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,235
Well, the heartbreak of psoriasis

987
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,822
has once again descended
upon the adolescent experience,

988
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,365
and we'll see you later.

989
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,785
See you at the show
later on tonight.

990
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,871
The question was, you know,
who could handle it?

991
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,499
Who could function?
Who could show up?

992
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,809
There were always girls.

993
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,694
There were a lot of opportunities
out on the road

994
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,072
to entertain ourselves
with one thing or another.

995
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,658
So, we started to perfect
after-show partying,

996
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,578
and we invented a place
called the Third Encore.

997
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,956
We did two encores in our show,
so the third encore was the party.

998
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,709
Everybody in the band
and everybody in the crew

999
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,086
was given a bunch of buttons,
and all we said was,

1000
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,172
"No weirdos,
no strange people, okay?

1001
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,383
If you're gonna give a button
to somebody,

1002
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,051
you know, make it count."

1003
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,219
Totally sick.

1004
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,805
There's some real warped shit
coming on now, ladies and gentlemen.

1005
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,391
A member of Andy Warthog's
pop-bowel movement

1006
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,185
has just tried to crash our party.

1007
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,186
What the...

1008
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:04,232
Welcome to Pittsburgh Spread Eagle.

1009
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,650
We want to just ask these girls

1010
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,153
why they think they have to leave
now that it's 2:00.

1011
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,655
One thing, he smells like beer.

1012
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:13,158
We'd fill the bathtubs up
with Budweiser,

1013
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,577
and we'd have a party
after every show.

1014
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,412
- Your name, please.
- Tammy Farley.

1015
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,539
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy.

1016
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,347
Here we have Karen.
Karen is 20 years old.

1017
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,459
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.

1018
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,919
What's your name, dear?

1019
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,337
- Fuck it, man.
- Pardon?

1020
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,380
Fuck it. Her name's fuck it, man.

1021
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,343
I want to talk about sex and drugs.

1022
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,886
Who wants to go first?

1023
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,764
I'm not lost for words
on either subject.

1024
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,059
Sex and drugs kind of came
as a big package in the '60s.

1025
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,727
You know,
it seemed like everybody...

1026
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,105
the sexual revolution
and the drug thing, I guess,

1027
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:48,109
probably started out together.

1028
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,986
Didn't they?

1029
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,115
Don and I both tried
to have relationships

1030
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,118
while we were members
of the Eagles,

1031
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:01,831
but it was always like the Eagles
trumped everything.

1032
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,125
When the Eagles
became successful,

1033
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,503
we challenged all the rules.

1034
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,799
Like when David Geffen
left Asylum Records

1035
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,636
and sold everything to Warner Bros.
And started his new empire.

1036
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,262
Let's be frank.

1037
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,099
When we signed that contract,
we were idiots.

1038
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,851
We knew nothing
about the business.

1039
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,479
We had poor legal representation,

1040
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,398
nobody looking out for us.

1041
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:31,027
Remember, bands don't really get
record royalties usually ever.

1042
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:35,615
So, they get money from touring,
but they get publishing money.

1043
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,034
So, in the very beginning,
one thing that Geffen did

1044
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,411
that I thought was great...

1045
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,038
he had us form
a band publishing company.

1046
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,165
All the band's publishing
went in that.

1047
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,501
The problem
was Geffen had the other half.

1048
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,669
Half the Eagles' publishing,
half of my publishing,

1049
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,151
half of all the artists
that he signed

1050
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:55,510
went to Warner Bros.,
but he got them to return mine.

1051
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,013
Jackson turned me on to the Eagles.

1052
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,098
He had turned me on
to a lot of artists,

1053
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,684
and I felt I owed him something.

1054
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,519
And that, not surprisingly,

1055
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,480
was not acceptable rationale
to the Eagles.

1056
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:10,191
There's a certain amount of ire,

1057
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:14,029
like, real, you know,
like, "What the fuck?

1058
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,656
I mean, we didn't get
our publishing back."

1059
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,074
So, it was the publishing issue

1060
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,951
and the fact that
the business managers

1061
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,037
and the lawyers
were all shared common guys,

1062
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,874
and did they have a conflict
when an issue came up

1063
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,250
and which side to take?

1064
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,461
Well, it just makes you feel
like meat, you know?

1065
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,464
It started out as such a personal,
nurturing endeavor,

1066
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,008
you know, with Mr. Geffen saying,
"Oh, I'm going to protect you guys.

1067
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,177
"That's why I'm calling
my new label 'Asylum'.

1068
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:40,847
It's going to be a sanctuary
for real artists."

1069
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,184
He once said to Irving Azoff,
"You know, Irving,

1070
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,644
this would be a great business
if there weren't artists."

1071
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,775
Irving was the one guy
who really believed in us,

1072
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,819
that I thought could do something
to help us.

1073
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,571
I basically hired a lawyer
and went in

1074
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,908
after I said the Eagles would like
their publishing back,

1075
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,243
to which the obvious response
was "No".

1076
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,830
He sort of drew a line in the sand
and declared war,

1077
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,958
so I felt, for my survival
as their manager,

1078
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:12,587
I needed to prove to them
that I wasn't afraid of Geffen

1079
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,547
and would stand up and, you know.

1080
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:16,341
The lawsuit was filed
as a last resort.

1081
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,261
I don't think David liked
reading his name in the lawsuit.

1082
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,847
I thought
it was incredibly ungrateful

1083
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:27,018
and they misrepresented the facts,
but so be it.

1084
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,812
Ultimately, we settled out of court,

1085
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,688
and I don't believe
it took very long.

1086
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,565
He just wanted to get rid of us.

1087
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,859
This is our new record contract.

1088
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,364
Just paper.

1089
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,699
So, then we headed off
for parts unknown

1090
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,077
with Irving Azoff at the helm.

1091
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,004
This card game
is called Eagle Poker.

1092
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,215
It's a bastardization of Red Dog.

1093
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:01,678
I invented it
in Detroit, Michigan, in 1947,

1094
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,514
one year before I was born.

1095
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,600
We were big gamblers.
We played poker all the time.

1096
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:13,148
Oh, boy. They should have
never given me money.

1097
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:17,318
So, we decided we'd go
to the Bahamas to gamble.

1098
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,779
Everybody but Don was holding.

1099
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,824
I had like four joints in a baggie,

1100
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,512
stuffed down my sock
in my cowboy boot.

1101
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,703
Durkin, the pilot, has a joint.

1102
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,039
Irving had about 30 valiums
in a sugar pack.

1103
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,960
There was a couple
of customs officials there

1104
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,629
that asked us to collect
all our luggage and come over,

1105
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,340
and they wanted to search us
'cause we looked terrible.

1106
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,676
We had really long hair
and patches on our jeans

1107
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,512
and a beard and not slept.

1108
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,765
Now, I'm freaking out.
Bernie's freaking out.

1109
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,685
Irving's freaking out.
Henley's pissed off.

1110
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,021
Don't touch me.

1111
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,023
Well, the guy proceeds
to put us all in a room together,

1112
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,318
and they start searching us
one by one.

1113
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:02,989
My greatest fear is that
I'm gonna be locked in a jail cell

1114
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,533
with Bernie Leadon.

1115
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,368
So, at this point, Irving steps in

1116
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,121
and takes one
of the Bahamian customs guys

1117
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,832
over to the side
and has a chat with him.

1118
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,169
I'm not sure, to this day,
what Irving said to him.

1119
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:23,384
The next thing I knew,
they let us pass with no problem.

1120
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,261
It was sort of miraculous,
really, it was,

1121
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:28,473
because I thought for sure
we were gonna be in the slammer.

1122
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,600
It was dumb luck
that this guy bought my line

1123
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,726
and didn't search them.

1124
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,603
That was the day
I decided Irving Azoff

1125
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,022
was the greatest manager
in rock 'n' roll

1126
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,067
and I would never do anything
without him by my side.

1127
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,821
I had the only seat
in a major championship fight...

1128
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,616
to be sitting there when,
you know,

1129
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,119
when a lyric was thrown out
and then hear a track.

1130
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,044
And I've watched the creative process
with lots of other people,

1131
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,714
but I've never seen it
the way it fell in place with them.

1132
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,592
I remember watching
"Lyin' Eyes" written.

1133
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,262
Glenn just had a way of coming up
with a phrase, you know?

1134
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,013
He had written some kind of a tune,

1135
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,015
and they were sitting
in Tana's one night

1136
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:14,811
and looking at some young girl
with an older guy at the bar,

1137
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,814
and Glenn said,
"Look at those lyin' eyes."

1138
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,942
And just... just like that,
wow, there's the song.

1139
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,177
It was just about all these girls

1140
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:50,385
who would come down
to Dan Tana's looking beautiful,

1141
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,640
and they'd be there
from 8:00 to midnight

1142
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,310
and have dinner and drinks
with all of us rockers,

1143
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,813
and then they'd go home
because they were kept women.

1144
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,781
You know, when we were doing
the "One of These Nights" album,

1145
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,426
we'd gone through three albums,

1146
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,928
and the only people
who'd sung on any hit records

1147
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,722
were Don and myself.

1148
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,559
And Randy always felt like,
you know, he was a lead singer, too.

1149
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,354
And I actually felt that way, too.
I liked his voice.

1150
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,440
So, he brought in the beginnings
of "Take It To the Limit,"

1151
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:46,069
and it became the Eagles'
first number-one single.

1152
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,125
The line "Take It To the Limit"

1153
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:06,714
was to keep trying
before you reach a point in your life

1154
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,300
where you feel, you know,
you've done everything

1155
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,677
and seen everything sort of feeling.

1156
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,638
You know, a part of getting old,

1157
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,015
and just to take it to the limit
one more time,

1158
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:19,227
like every day,
just keep punching away at it.

1159
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,896
And that's all that I really...
that was the line,

1160
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,317
and from there, the song took
a different, you know, course.

1161
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:42,083
I think everybody in the Eagles
did the level best we could.

1162
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,460
You have to remember
how young we were,

1163
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:47,380
the fact that nobody
had anything when we started,

1164
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,799
and you got all this stuff
coming at you.

1165
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,176
Meanwhile,
you're touring all the time.

1166
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,178
It's a lot.

1167
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:58,307
To Bernie, success on any scale
was synonymous with selling out.

1168
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:01,227
He wanted us to remain
sort of an underground band.

1169
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,688
We had our problems with Bernie,

1170
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,023
and Bernie
had his problems with us.

1171
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,943
Some of it was based
on him being able to have a voice

1172
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,278
in the Eagles

1173
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,157
and record the songs he wanted to
the way he wanted to.

1174
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,325
We were getting
more and more rocked out,

1175
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,829
and I think Bernie was
less and less happy about that...

1176
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,792
...to the point that, one time,
we had worked on a track all night.

1177
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,321
I mean, it was a rocked-out track,

1178
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,838
and we're all sitting
behind the board the next day,

1179
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,486
listening to the various takes of it,

1180
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,800
trying to decide
which take we like the best.

1181
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,469
Bernie hadn't said a word.

1182
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,970
So, I asked him over the board,

1183
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,972
I said, "Bernie, what do you think?"

1184
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,682
There's a long pause,
and he gets up,

1185
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,853
and he stretches, and he says,
"I think I'm going surfing."

1186
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,105
And he left.

1187
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,698
I was caught in the middle
a lot of times.

1188
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,742
And sometimes I would agree
with Bernie,

1189
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,077
but most of the time,
I would agree with Glenn.

1190
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,997
Glenn and I always wanted
the band to be a hybrid,

1191
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,000
to encompass bluegrass
and country and rock 'n' roll.

1192
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,045
There was a part of Bernie
that really resisted that.

1193
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,464
After a while,
it became a real problem,

1194
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,926
particularly between
Bernie and Glenn.

1195
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,595
Finally, we were
at the Orange Bowl in Miami.

1196
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:18,888
We were backstage,

1197
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:22,517
and we were talking about
what our next move was gonna be,

1198
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,084
what our plans were supposed to be,

1199
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:29,524
and I was animated and adamant
about what we needed to do next

1200
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,983
here, there, and everywhere,

1201
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,445
and Bernie comes over
and pours a beer on my head

1202
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,740
and says,
"You need to chill out, man."

1203
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:41,285
I have no idea.
It was a spontaneous thing.

1204
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:45,331
I mean, I take that incident now
quite seriously.

1205
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,084
That was a very disrespectful thing
to do.

1206
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:53,464
Obviously, it was intended to be
humiliating to him, I would say,

1207
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:57,552
and is something
I'm really not proud of.

1208
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,680
It did illustrate a breaking point.

1209
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,731
During that time,
we got a couple shows

1210
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,400
opening for the Rolling Stones,

1211
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,319
and Irving was managing Joe Walsh.

1212
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:20,366
Joe Walsh was a bona fide
rock-'n'-roll guitar player.

1213
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:27,832
So, for a couple of those shows,
just for our encores,

1214
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,001
we'd put Joe Walsh in a road box,

1215
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:34,171
and we'd come back to do an encore,
and we'd roll the road box out,

1216
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:37,466
and just like the model
jumping out of a cake,

1217
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,677
we'd open the guitar case,

1218
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,763
and there would be Joe Walsh
with his Les Paul,

1219
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,975
and he'd climb out of the box
and plug in, and the Eagles...

1220
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,061
We would play
"Rocky Mountain Way."

1221
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,195
I loved the way he played.

1222
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:01,616
I'd loved the James gang
when I was growing up in Detroit.

1223
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:06,579
Now I started thinking,
"Joe Walsh for Bernie Leadon."

1224
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,844
Okay, maybe the vocals
won't be quite as good,

1225
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,472
but, boy, are we gonna
kick some ass.

1226
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,321
I think one of the things
that I brought into the band

1227
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,448
that was good for the band

1228
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,202
was to bring it up a notch
when we played live.

1229
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:50,581
Just keep kicking it in the butt
a little bit, you know?

1230
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:22,530
All right, D.C.,
come on, give it up.

1231
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,034
I went to a show
maybe eight months later,

1232
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,787
and the band
are interacting with each other

1233
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,415
exactly like we did
with me onstage,

1234
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:35,167
except instead of me,
Walsh was up there,

1235
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:38,546
and it just was, like,
really, really odd, you know,

1236
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,549
to be watching it
and not be part of it.

1237
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,467
So, I actually left that show.

1238
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:46,345
I was just like,
"This is, like, too weird."

1239
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,514
So, we got Joe Walsh in the band.

1240
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,516
That's another adventure

1241
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,643
because Joe was
an interesting bunch of guys.

1242
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,651
Hey, I tell you what.

1243
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,647
If you got firecrackers,
just wait until you get home,

1244
01:18:56,815 --> 01:19:01,193
lock yourself in the closet,
and light everything you got, okay?

1245
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,405
Thank you, Joe.

1246
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,698
He brought a lot of levity

1247
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,325
to just about everything
that happened,

1248
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,828
which was needed at that time.

1249
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,413
Heads or tails?

1250
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,081
Heads.

1251
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,084
Well, I could use
a little head myself.

1252
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,712
In those days, you didn't know
what he was gonna do next.

1253
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,340
It was fun most of the time,
although not all the time.

1254
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,843
It was fun, depending
on how much you'd had to drink,

1255
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,554
to see a television go sailing
off the 14th-floor balcony

1256
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:32,433
and into the pool,
as long as nobody got hurt.

1257
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:41,525
Joe Walsh was
the American King of room trash.

1258
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,278
He had studied under
some of the best.

1259
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,364
One of the most terrifying things
that ever happened to me

1260
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,951
was that Keith Moon
decided he liked me.

1261
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,537
All those Keith Moon stories
are true.

1262
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:58,334
This guy was full-blown nuts,

1263
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:02,338
and you never knew
what was coming next.

1264
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,931
Keith was my mentor at chaos,

1265
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:16,435
getting arrested, practical jokes,
pranks, room damage.

1266
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,502
One year, we gave him a chain saw
for his birthday as a joke.

1267
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,138
By this time, we were eating
in nice restaurants

1268
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:57,977
and buying expensive wine
and staying in great hotel rooms.

1269
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,704
There were a lot of hotels that
we weren't allowed to go back to.

1270
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,022
We were in Chicago,

1271
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,108
and we were staying
at the Astor Towers.

1272
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,111
In Chicago, here's what happened.

1273
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:10,948
There was a knock on the door,
and in walked John Belushi.

1274
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:17,162
John wanted to show me
the finer restaurants of Chicago.

1275
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,915
So, we went to the restaurant,

1276
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,963
and they wouldn't let us in
'cause we had jeans,

1277
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:26,088
and he got the maitre d'
up to like $300 bribe,

1278
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,465
and still they would not let us in.

1279
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,552
And John said, "I know what to do.
I know what to do."

1280
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,473
And the next thing I knew,
we were standing in the alley,

1281
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:41,228
and he spray-painted my jeans black
and made me do his,

1282
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,148
and we went back, and we got in.

1283
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,403
We were sitting
in these Queen Anne-period chairs

1284
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:50,905
that had needlepoint,

1285
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,866
and when we stood up,
that was all black,

1286
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,785
and the butts of our pants
were jeans again.

1287
01:21:56,953 --> 01:22:01,081
So, we had to kind of back out
of there and leave fast.

1288
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,501
But that was the beginning of it.

1289
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:08,589
And so that night, with much glee,

1290
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,509
Joe set about to set
the world record for room trash.

1291
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:18,682
John and I did $28,000
of room damage.

1292
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,772
Glenn and Don
didn't really ever approve

1293
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,191
of the room trashing,
but they understood it.

1294
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,693
They wanted respect
as rock 'n' rollers,

1295
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:32,112
and Joe brought that respect.

1296
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,075
I was insecure always and afraid,

1297
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:42,039
so I hid behind all of my hang-ups
with humor.

1298
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:47,461
I was totally in awe
of Don and Glenn.

1299
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,965
I was intimidated by Don and Glenn

1300
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:56,136
because they sang so good
and they were writing stuff

1301
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:00,432
I could never come close to writing.

1302
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,769
After we just had
a bunch of hit records

1303
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:06,689
on "One of These Nights,"
we were under the microscope.

1304
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:09,441
Everybody was gonna look
at the next record we made

1305
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,776
and pass judgment.

1306
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,196
Don and I were going,
"Man, this better be good."

1307
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,241
Look at that.

1308
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,493
It's gonna be quite a nice guitar.

1309
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,620
Felder, you see this?

1310
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,956
Who, uh, who tuned this?

1311
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,290
Well, it has no nut.

1312
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:29,169
With Joe in the band with me,
I wanted to write something,

1313
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,965
musically, that would fit
two guitar players,

1314
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,175
that we could
play off of each other.

1315
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:37,636
So, I was sitting on a sofa in Malibu

1316
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,014
at this rental house
that I had on the beach,

1317
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,224
and I was playing
this acoustic guitar,

1318
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,852
and this introduction came out,
that progression.

1319
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,855
I kept playing it
three or four times.

1320
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,024
I had an old reel-to-reel
tape recorder,

1321
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,569
so I went back and recorded
that introduction to that song

1322
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,613
and laid down that progression,
made a mix of it,

1323
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:59,366
and put it on a cassette
with, I don't know,

1324
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:02,745
the other 14 or 15 pieces of music
that I had assembled,

1325
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:06,290
and I gave a copy of the cassette
to Don, one to Glenn.

1326
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:11,587
Don Felder used to send
Henley and I instrumental tapes,

1327
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:12,796
song ideas.

1328
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,758
95% of them were cluttered
with guitar licks,

1329
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:18,594
and we would
listen to these things and go,

1330
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:19,970
"Well, where do you sing?"

1331
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,515
As Don and I were listening
through one of the Felder cassettes

1332
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,143
and this song came up,
we both sort of said,

1333
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,604
"Hmm, now, this is interesting."

1334
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,691
The music sounded to me
like some sort of a cross

1335
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,694
between Spanish music
and reggae music,

1336
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,488
and that one
really jumped out at me.

1337
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,784
So, we set out to write
a song to that progression.

1338
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,913
I'm pretty sure
it was Henley's idea

1339
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:49,124
to have a song
called "Hotel California."

1340
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:56,715
I think Henley's and Glenn's
lyric writing really came to a head.

1341
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,551
They became real honest-to-God
songwriters then.

1342
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:04,762
During the recording of it,

1343
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,350
I thought that we were on
to something.

1344
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,893
I knew we were on to something.

1345
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:13,524
We were in a really creative phase,

1346
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:19,196
and it just so happened
that Bill Szymczyk pushed record.

1347
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,407
Thank God.

1348
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:34,313
We've been asked a million times,
"What does that song mean?"

1349
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,982
Don and I were big fans
of hidden, deeper meaning.

1350
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,942
You know, you write songs,

1351
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,862
and you send them out
to the world...

1352
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:58,003
And maybe somewhere in that song
is some stuff that's just yours

1353
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,172
that they're never
gonna figure out.

1354
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,306
There has been a great deal
of ridiculous speculation

1355
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,849
about that song over the years.

1356
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,810
I mean, it's really taken on a life
or a mythology of its own.

1357
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:15,687
You know, it's sort of like
the "Paul is dead" thing

1358
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:17,481
or who was the walrus?

1359
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:24,571
It's been denounced by evangelicals.

1360
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,949
We've been accused
of all kinds of wacky things,

1361
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:29,159
like being members
of the Church of Satan.

1362
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:32,412
People see images
on the album cover that aren't there.

1363
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,914
Just lunatic stuff.

1364
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,692
My simple explanation is

1365
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,612
it's a song about a journey
from innocence to experience.

1366
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,072
That's all.

1367
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:34,308
Whereas Felder was technically
very, very good,

1368
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:38,061
Walsh brought spontaneity to it,

1369
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,940
and the two of them playing off
each other was just brilliant.

1370
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,918
Out of great respect for each other,

1371
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,254
there was always
a little competition

1372
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,506
between Felder and I.

1373
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:10,510
We always tried to kind of
one-up each other, you know?

1374
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:17,184
And that's really healthy.

1375
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,771
It always made the song better

1376
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,775
when we were kind of,
"Oh, yeah? Listen to this."

1377
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,575
We got to the end,

1378
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:36,870
where now is the harmony guitars
that are playing together,

1379
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:40,123
and Joe said, "We should
do something that's like...

1380
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,602
The ending of "Hotel California"...

1381
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:05,941
that's one of my high points
of my entire recording career.

1382
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,326
To have a seven-minute single
be number one...

1383
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:17,577
that was unheard of.

1384
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,037
The record company said,
"You got to do an edit.

1385
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,247
You got to do an edit."

1386
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,083
And we all said,
"No. Take it or leave it."

1387
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,418
And they took it.

1388
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:28,713
We had no idea that that song

1389
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:32,300
would affect as many people
on the planet as it did.

1390
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,055
Thank you.

1391
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:41,226
The rest of the album kind of
developed around that song.

1392
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,186
The album, you could loosely say,

1393
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:46,565
is a thematic album,
a concept album.

1394
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,276
Not unlike "Desperado,"

1395
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:54,322
"Hotel California" was our reaction
to what was happening to us.

1396
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:00,245
On just about every album we made,
there was some kind of a commentary

1397
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,290
on the music business
and on American culture in general.

1398
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,001
The hotel itself
could be taken as a metaphor

1399
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,004
not only for the mythmaking
of Southern California

1400
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,965
but for the mythmaking
that is the American dream

1401
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,010
because it's a fine line
between the American dream

1402
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:16,636
and the American nightmare.

1403
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:25,645
All the songs
we write for this album

1404
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,482
can fit inside this concept.

1405
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,306
Once the rest of the guys
in the band

1406
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:41,495
understood what the song
"Hotel California" was about,

1407
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:42,996
it became kind of a theme,

1408
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,999
and they started to customize
their writing to fit in with it.

1409
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,511
I think that the Eagles
started breaking up

1410
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,387
during the recording
of "Hotel California."

1411
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:01,014
There were creative tensions,

1412
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:03,141
but there was always
tension tensions.

1413
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:06,937
By the time we got to recording
"Hotel California,"

1414
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,313
if the song wasn't good enough

1415
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:10,941
to survive the amount of time
we were working on the record,

1416
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,388
it didn't make it on the record.

1417
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,236
Perfection is not an accident.

1418
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:17,322
Our goal was just to be
the best we could be.

1419
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,325
We wanted to get better
as songwriters and as performers,

1420
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,826
and we worked on it.

1421
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:27,791
Don and I felt like there was
no space now for filler,

1422
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,586
and Don Felder, for all
of his talents as a guitar player,

1423
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:32,879
is not a singer.

1424
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:37,133
Felder wanted to write more,
sing more,

1425
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:39,010
and Felder had kind of demanded

1426
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:42,681
that "I'm gonna sing two songs
on 'Hotel California."'

1427
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,981
We were all Alphas,

1428
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:56,111
and we were all very assertive
and powerful in our own way.

1429
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:01,074
You could bring in a great track
to Don and Glenn

1430
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,326
and be really excited about it.

1431
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,912
This happened to Felder.

1432
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:12,210
I wrote the track
for "Victim of Love."

1433
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:14,921
It was gonna be a follow-up song

1434
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:18,425
on the "Hotel California" record
for me to sing.

1435
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,180
I have no recollection of anybody
being promised anything.

1436
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:27,726
"Victim of Love" was not brought
to the band as a complete song.

1437
01:33:27,893 --> 01:33:30,061
It was simply
another chord progression

1438
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:31,605
that Don Felder brought in.

1439
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,733
It had no title,
no lyrics, and no melody.

1440
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,153
Glenn and I and J.D. Souther
all sat down

1441
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,697
and hammered out the rest of it.

1442
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,198
We did let Mr. Felder sing it.

1443
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:44,784
He sang it dozens of times
over the span of a week,

1444
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,244
over and over and over again.

1445
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:49,331
It simply didn't come up
to band standards.

1446
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,211
"Victim of Love" had been recorded
with Felder as the lead vocalist,

1447
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:58,548
and my job was to take Don Felder
out to lunch or dinner

1448
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,010
while they went in the studio
and put Henley's vocal on it.

1449
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:13,021
Irving took me out and said
that everybody in the band thought

1450
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:14,898
that it was better if Don sang that.

1451
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:17,651
And it was a little bit
of a bitter pill to swallow.

1452
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:21,446
I felt like Don was taking
that song from me.

1453
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:24,449
I'd been promised a song
on the next record.

1454
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,242
But there was no real way to argue

1455
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,495
with my vocal
versus Don Henley's vocal.

1456
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,539
There was no way to argue
with anybody's vocal in the band

1457
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:32,832
compared to Don Henley.

1458
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,842
Felder demanding to sing that song

1459
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:45,679
would be the equivalent of me
demanding to play lead guitar

1460
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:46,846
on "Hotel California."

1461
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:48,306
It just didn't make sense.

1462
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:55,647
If you look at my vocal participation
in the Eagles

1463
01:34:55,815 --> 01:35:01,111
over the course of the 1970s,
I sang less and less.

1464
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:04,989
It was intentional.
We had Don Henley.

1465
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:12,163
Don and Glenn's position was,

1466
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:16,793
"This is the best thing
for the Eagles."

1467
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,796
And Don Felder never forgot that.

1468
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,685
Get it! Get it!
Run! Run! Run!

1469
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,895
Shit.

1470
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,816
This is a real healthy thing.

1471
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,694
It promotes good feelings,
you know, among the guys,

1472
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:45,113
and it keeps us
from killing each other.

1473
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,575
Where's my glove?
Who's got my glove?

1474
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,869
We can yell at each other
on a baseball field,

1475
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:53,396
then we don't have to yell
at each other when we're working.

1476
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:56,332
Get all my frustrations out.

1477
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,042
What frustrations?

1478
01:35:58,210 --> 01:35:59,669
I haven't been getting laid.

1479
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:02,589
We try to get out
and play softball with the crew

1480
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:03,882
if we have a day off.

1481
01:36:04,049 --> 01:36:05,133
Swing, batter!

1482
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:07,343
Oh, it's gone, it's gone.
It's gone.

1483
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:10,221
Something to help
release the tension.

1484
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:14,017
That's really what I do
to keep from going crazy.

1485
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,728
How do you keep
from going crazy, Joe?

1486
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:21,274
Well...

1487
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:27,238
I tell you, I just, uh...

1488
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:29,991
In the press and the media,

1489
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:34,662
it was presented
that we were constantly at war,

1490
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,707
and I can't say
that's exactly the case.

1491
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:46,299
We were interacting,
and we were all intense.

1492
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,718
Glenn said to me one time,

1493
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:53,223
"I get nuts sometimes,
and I'm sorry."

1494
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,682
Hey, Joe.

1495
01:36:54,850 --> 01:37:02,315
But that tension had a lot to do
with fanning the artistic fire.

1496
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:08,947
Having that dynamic was important
in making the music.

1497
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,660
Well, we're rehearsing now,
and before we're even playing

1498
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,620
and guys are just noodling around

1499
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,039
and getting their amps going
and stuff, we hear Joe go...

1500
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:27,006
You know, and everyone would
kind of go, "What did you play?

1501
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:28,091
Play that again."

1502
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:33,012
That was an exercise I was doing
because it's a coordination thing.

1503
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,057
You know,
it's like one of these deals.

1504
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:38,017
So, I was doing that to warm up,

1505
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,228
and they said,
"Well, what is that?"

1506
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:45,066
And I said, "Well, that's just
something I have, you know?

1507
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:46,442
There you go."

1508
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,652
That's the lick.

1509
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,488
That's what we should
build the song around.

1510
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,623
I was riding shotgun in a corvette
with a drug dealer

1511
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:03,543
on the way to a poker game,
and the next thing I knew,

1512
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,338
we were going about 90 miles
an hour, holding big time.

1513
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:10,675
I was like, "Hey, man.
What are you doing?"

1514
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,644
You know, and he looked at me,
and he grinned.

1515
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,597
He goes, "Life in the fast lane."

1516
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:20,226
And I thought immediately,
"Now, there's a song title."

1517
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,781
Then they put out the greatest hits.

1518
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:35,158
There was a period

1519
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,494
where we sold a million records
a month for 18 months.

1520
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:41,080
It's a little-known fact
that the Eagles

1521
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:44,918
had the biggest-selling album
of the 20th century.

1522
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:51,549
But the music business never ever
got honest of its own volition.

1523
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:54,427
No record company ever went
to an artist and said,

1524
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:55,887
"You've done a great job.

1525
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:58,097
We're gonna increase
your royalties."

1526
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,059
So we created
our own promotion company.

1527
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:03,895
We created
our own management company.

1528
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:05,521
We had our own booking agency.

1529
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:08,483
Stop any time.

1530
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:20,244
We achieved an amount of success
beyond our wildest imagination,

1531
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:24,123
and Randy really had trouble with it.

1532
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,959
Bam! Bam!

1533
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:28,544
Randy used to have trouble
singing the high note

1534
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:30,152
at the end
of "Take It To the Limit."

1535
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:44,602
Oh, yeah, I was always
kind of scared, basically.

1536
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:45,770
"What if I don't hit it right?"

1537
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,022
It was a pretty high note.

1538
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:55,071
And in the middle of the fade,

1539
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,991
you crank the volume knob
and go, "What?!"

1540
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:03,246
Randy could do it,
but if you made him do it,

1541
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:06,416
"Oh, no, man, I, uh..."

1542
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:14,173
Thank you.

1543
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:16,009
Randy Meisner.

1544
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,928
He'd call the road manager and say,

1545
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:21,264
"Tell Glenn I don't want to do
'Take It To the Limit' anymore.

1546
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:22,432
Take it out of the set."

1547
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:23,933
I confronted him about this.

1548
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,501
I called him up,
and I said, "Randy,

1549
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:29,439
there's thousands of people
waiting to hear you sing that song.

1550
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,767
"You just can't say,
'Fuck them. I don't feel like it.'

1551
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,735
Do you think I like singing
'Take It Easy'

1552
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:35,463
and 'Peaceful Easy Feeling'
every night?

1553
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:38,698
I'm tired of those songs,
but there's people in the audience

1554
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:42,243
who've been waiting years
to see us do those songs."

1555
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:46,539
We just got fed up with that
and just said, "Okay, don't sing it.

1556
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:51,210
Why don't you just quit?
You say you're unhappy. Quit."

1557
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,797
Randy never knew
how great he was.

1558
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:57,133
He wasn't Alpha.

1559
01:40:57,968 --> 01:41:01,471
Confrontations were
really hard for him.

1560
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:05,558
All I want to see is five guys
happy playing together, you know?

1561
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,685
And that's what makes the music.

1562
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:14,817
We were backstage,
and the crowd was going wild.

1563
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:17,195
And our encore number
was "Take It To the Limit."

1564
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:18,446
People loved that song.

1565
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,656
They went crazy when Randy
hit those high notes.

1566
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,992
But Randy didn't want
to do the song that night.

1567
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,410
He'd been up partying all night

1568
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:26,454
with a couple of girls
and a bottle of vodka.

1569
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:28,456
And Glenn kept trying
to talk him into it.

1570
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,708
He said, "Man, the people
want to hear that song.

1571
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:32,126
You got to do it."

1572
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:34,170
And Randy kept saying, "No."

1573
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:36,214
So after about the third or fourth
time that Randy refused,

1574
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:37,924
Glenn just backed up
a couple of steps and said,

1575
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,258
"Well, fuck you, then!"

1576
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:44,388
There were police officers
standing backstage,

1577
01:41:44,556 --> 01:41:47,809
and when they saw us about to go
at it, they started to move in.

1578
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:50,603
And Henley turned
right to the cops and said,

1579
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:51,938
"Stay out of this.

1580
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:54,565
This is personal,
and it's private...

1581
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:56,150
real fucking private."

1582
01:41:57,986 --> 01:42:01,364
The writing was on the wall
that Randy was gonna leave.

1583
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:08,996
There was only person
to ever replace Randy Meisner

1584
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:12,208
in the Eagles in my mind,
and it was Timothy B. Schmit.

1585
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,504
He replaced him in Poco

1586
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,757
and plugged in
and sang the same parts.

1587
01:42:21,009 --> 01:42:23,302
And I remember sitting with Irving
and saying,

1588
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,222
"Irving, I think we should
get Timothy Schmit."

1589
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,225
He said, "Well, I just saw Timothy.
I was out on the road

1590
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,227
when the guys in Poco
were in the hotel bar,

1591
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,646
and Timothy was smashed
out of his mind.

1592
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:35,898
He was gacked up.
Are you sure about this?"

1593
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:38,818
I said, "Irving," I said,
"If you'd been in a band

1594
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,737
for 11 years and you were still
making $250 a week

1595
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:43,197
working 40 weeks a year,

1596
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:46,492
maybe you'd be a little smashed
and gacked-up yourself."

1597
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,912
They asked me to join their band

1598
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,915
before I even played
a note of music with them.

1599
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:56,294
I just said, "You know,
where do you want me? When?

1600
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:58,171
I'm definitely in."

1601
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:01,507
We want to introduce you
to the newest member of our band.

1602
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:02,884
He's our new bass player,

1603
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,678
and we got him
from a really fine band... Poco.

1604
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:08,890
Please give a nice Houston, Texas,
welcome to Timothy Schmit.

1605
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:17,356
I went on the road with them
in 1978 as the new guy.

1606
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,782
And I heard a few, "Where's Randy's"
from the audience, you know?

1607
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,494
But I knew it was a good move
for them and me.

1608
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,545
There were a lot of decisions,
business-wise,

1609
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:43,132
that needed to be made
in a secret session...

1610
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,052
Glenn and Don and Irving
in the back of the plane.

1611
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,512
I didn't like
that I wasn't part of that,

1612
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:53,392
but I knew that it was good
for the Eagles.

1613
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,730
Don Felder really didn't like it.

1614
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,567
Glenn and I saw ourselves
as the leaders of the band,

1615
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,236
but other people saw us
as dictators.

1616
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:07,198
You just cannot have
five leaders in a band.

1617
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:10,826
It doesn't work. People have to do
what they do best.

1618
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,664
There was all this undercurrent
and resentment

1619
01:44:14,831 --> 01:44:17,875
and, you know,
plotting and complaining.

1620
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:21,545
And I'm sure Timothy thought,
"What have I gotten myself into?"

1621
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:23,756
I was just really happy to be there,

1622
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:27,260
and all these tensions...
it's not that I didn't feel it,

1623
01:44:27,427 --> 01:44:29,345
but I had no idea how deep it was.

1624
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:31,973
In my experience,
all rock-'n'-roll bands

1625
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:34,976
are on the verge of breaking up
at all times.

1626
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,606
The band at that point
had begun to split up into factions.

1627
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,858
Don Felder, in an effort
to gain more control,

1628
01:44:43,026 --> 01:44:44,402
had co-opted Joe Walsh.

1629
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:45,736
So much of the time,

1630
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:48,614
it was Felder and Walsh
against me and Glenn.

1631
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:50,491
At that point, even Glenn and I

1632
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,035
were beginning
to have our differences.

1633
01:44:53,203 --> 01:44:55,579
And it was tearing the band apart.

1634
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:59,083
The magic ingredient
that made the band successful

1635
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,377
was the relationship
between Don and Glenn.

1636
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:04,714
Through years of touring,
years in the studio...

1637
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:07,758
all of that friction
really started driving a wedge

1638
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:09,885
in between that relationship.

1639
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:15,850
It reached a point where we were
just tired of each other...

1640
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:18,602
tired of the hoopla,
tired of touring,

1641
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,730
tired of pretty much everything.

1642
01:45:20,897 --> 01:45:24,442
At that point, songwriting
was becoming very difficult.

1643
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,652
How much sleep did you guys get?

1644
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,112
When did you get finished
loading out?

1645
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,530
- 2:00?
- 5:30.

1646
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:30,990
- 5:30 this morning?
- Yeah.

1647
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:32,241
Okay.

1648
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:34,910
After the success
of "Hotel California"...

1649
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:38,956
Grammy winner, mega sales...
top that.

1650
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:43,294
And we show up at the studio,
and nobody has one song done.

1651
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:48,674
I don't know
what we'll do first, but...

1652
01:45:49,968 --> 01:45:53,220
I had enough of a piece
where they both went,

1653
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:55,556
"That's great.
Let's develop that."

1654
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:58,434
And I was really pleased
that they wanted to develop that one

1655
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,687
because it came out more
as an R&B song.

1656
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:06,359
And it's very simple.

1657
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,570
Very simple instrumentation.

1658
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:12,239
Very simple arrangement.

1659
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,244
There's a lot of air in it.

1660
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:22,833
That's why it works.

1661
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:43,562
About halfway through,
Don comes up to me and says,

1662
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,190
"There's your hit."

1663
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:08,421
We're on top of the world.
We're young.

1664
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,424
We were overdoing everything.

1665
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:23,185
There was a lot of chemical
dependency going on within the band.

1666
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:24,937
And that was rough.

1667
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,941
During all of that time
of writing and recording

1668
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,485
"The Long Run"
and all the time on the road...

1669
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:33,293
we were on the road
during "The Long Run,"

1670
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,906
we were all using cocaine.

1671
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:40,035
When we first started snorting coke,
it was like a writing tool.

1672
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:43,330
Do a couple bumps and kind of
get started talking about stuff,

1673
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:45,082
get yourself going

1674
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:48,752
and launch into some sort
of idea for a song.

1675
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:53,382
But in the end, cocaine brought out
the worst in everybody.

1676
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:58,095
Yes, this half-hour of the show
is brought to you by cocaine...

1677
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:00,514
the makers of hits.

1678
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:11,775
Making that album was excruciating.

1679
01:48:11,943 --> 01:48:13,652
We were just completely burned out.

1680
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:17,239
We had driven ourselves really hard
for almost a decade,

1681
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,741
and we were just fried.

1682
01:48:19,576 --> 01:48:20,826
It was long, too.

1683
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:22,870
I mean, the days and hours
would drag on,

1684
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:25,239
and it would feel like
we weren't getting anything done.

1685
01:48:33,256 --> 01:48:36,008
It was more painful
than "Hotel California."

1686
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:37,676
It was more of a painful birth

1687
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:39,512
because all of this stuff
was going on,

1688
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,139
and we were getting
pretty frazzled.

1689
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:50,898
And the record company didn't care
if we farted and burped.

1690
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:55,778
They would put that out.
They didn't care.

1691
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,280
"When can we have it?"

1692
01:48:58,448 --> 01:49:01,617
Because that was
their whole corporate quarter.

1693
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:15,881
At that point, we inked in
"The Long Run" as the title.

1694
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:19,552
I think Henley said,
"Well, I know what to call this one.

1695
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:20,970
Look at us."

1696
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:27,726
Hold it. Stop.

1697
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,395
That's it!

1698
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,273
Song two.

1699
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,733
Eagles... "The Long Run"...
song two take one.

1700
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:38,195
It was a struggle...
an endless start-stop-start-stop.

1701
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:41,073
We called it "The Long One."

1702
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:43,993
It was the beginning of the end,

1703
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:47,204
even though I don't think
I saw it right then.

1704
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:53,210
There were a lot of things
building up

1705
01:49:53,378 --> 01:49:56,213
and a lot of things I tried
to overlook for the good of the band.

1706
01:49:56,381 --> 01:50:00,551
And ultimately, I just couldn't
look past some of this anymore.

1707
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,096
And it festered because
we didn't talk about these things.

1708
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,057
It finally came to a head
in Long Beach.

1709
01:50:07,225 --> 01:50:10,603
We were doing a benefit
for Senator Alan Cranston.

1710
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,230
He was concerned
about a lot of the same issues

1711
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:14,565
we were concerned about,

1712
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:17,401
including environmental destruction
and the war,

1713
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,028
so we wanted to support him.

1714
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:20,863
Now, Felder didn't like us
doing benefits.

1715
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,532
He just thought that was money
that should be going into his pocket.

1716
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:27,828
Why were we doing it
for Jerry Brown or anti-nukes?

1717
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:36,420
Alan Cranston and his wife
are coming around

1718
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:40,132
to personally thank every member
of the Eagles for doing this.

1719
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:44,219
I was very uninformed
about politics.

1720
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:46,430
I could care less about politics.

1721
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:48,974
I didn't even know or care
who Alan Cranston was.

1722
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:51,935
And Senator Cranston
went up to Felder and said,

1723
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:53,312
"I want to thank you."

1724
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,840
And Felder looked at the Senator
and said, "You're welcome."

1725
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:58,901
Then as he was turning away,
he said, "I guess."

1726
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,152
"I guess."

1727
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,280
"I guess." And Glenn heard it.

1728
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:06,950
And I just got really mad.

1729
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:09,718
I was drinking a longneck Bud
and then walked into the tuning room

1730
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:11,997
where Walsh and Felder was
and took the beer bottle

1731
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:14,166
and threw it against the wall
and smashed it.

1732
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:17,503
I stormed out.

1733
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:20,673
I got more mad and more mad.

1734
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:23,967
By the time we went onstage,
I was seething.

1735
01:51:24,135 --> 01:51:25,761
I wanted to kill Felder.

1736
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:28,263
Thank you again very much
from all the Eagles

1737
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:30,099
and from Senator Cranston

1738
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:33,143
for coming out here
and checking it out.

1739
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,853
One, two, three, four.

1740
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:44,321
A lot of tensions
between Glenn and Felder,

1741
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:50,202
and the real manifestation of it
came that night.

1742
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:58,412
So now we're playing the show

1743
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:00,504
and trying to act
like everything's okay,

1744
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:02,381
and we'll get through a few songs.

1745
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:04,675
And I just keep
looking over at him.

1746
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:07,302
"You ungrateful son of a bitch."

1747
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,519
The scene there...

1748
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:17,980
I really saw how serious it was
at that show.

1749
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:19,648
They were fighting onstage.

1750
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:21,275
Szymczyk's got audio of it.

1751
01:52:32,871 --> 01:52:35,038
So we started getting
towards the end of the set,

1752
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:38,250
and I'm looking at him going,
"Three more songs, asshole."

1753
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:41,086
You know, and I'm looking at him,
and I am ready to go.

1754
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:45,090
I can't wait
to get my hands on him.

1755
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:48,552
"When we get off the stage,
I'm gonna kick your ass."

1756
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:56,769
Whoa. When that kind of stuff
is onstage

1757
01:52:56,936 --> 01:53:01,231
and you're in front of people,
you got problems.

1758
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:08,197
Thank you very much.

1759
01:53:08,364 --> 01:53:10,949
We got through the show,
and it just...

1760
01:53:11,117 --> 01:53:13,035
all hell broke loose backstage.

1761
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:16,872
When the set ended,
he was out ahead of me,

1762
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,457
took his cheapest guitar...

1763
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:26,965
...busted it in a million pieces

1764
01:53:27,133 --> 01:53:29,176
and jumped in his limousine
and drove off.

1765
01:53:31,262 --> 01:53:32,721
And that was it.

1766
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:35,098
That was really the straw
that broke the camel's back.

1767
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:48,654
Someone wrote, "The Eagles went out
with a whimper, not a bang,"

1768
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,447
which was true.

1769
01:53:58,289 --> 01:53:59,414
I didn't want to hear it.

1770
01:53:59,582 --> 01:54:02,668
This was, like,
my super dream had come true.

1771
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:10,843
So I called Glenn, and I said,
"What is the status?

1772
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:13,095
What's going on?
Is this thing really broken up?"

1773
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,888
He said, "Yeah, it's over."

1774
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:18,767
We were beat,

1775
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:22,813
and it was really affecting
the foundational core...

1776
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:24,523
the soul of the band.

1777
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,817
We hit the wall.

1778
01:54:26,985 --> 01:54:28,306
You work, work, work, work, work.

1779
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:33,031
You get up to a peak,
and then it's almost, you know,

1780
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:37,619
invariably people head-butt
and, "Whose band is it?"

1781
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:41,331
And, "I'm in charge," and,
"No, you're not," and there you go.

1782
01:54:49,716 --> 01:54:51,842
We had always said
that we wanted to step off the wave

1783
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,969
just before it crashed
into the beach.

1784
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,638
And we did.

1785
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:18,076
The Beatle guys say
they never thought...

1786
01:55:18,244 --> 01:55:20,124
McCartney never thought
that band was gonna last

1787
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,873
more than two years
because no pop band did.

1788
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,250
I think it's part of it.

1789
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:26,138
It comes together.

1790
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,420
It's magic,
and it falls apart, you know?

1791
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:34,009
But, you know, how cool
that it even happens at all.

1792
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:39,514
It was magical.

1793
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:44,144
They wrote
a lot of great, great songs

1794
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:46,563
that will be celebrated
and listened to

1795
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:47,940
and loved for a long time.

1796
01:55:49,817 --> 01:55:56,740
We managed to represent
that period of time in the '70s,

1797
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:03,163
Southern California,
which was very artistically creative.

1798
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:10,170
I hope that's remembered
like the Roaring '20s are, you know...

1799
01:56:10,338 --> 01:56:12,589
our generation and what we did.

1800
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:48,166
We set out to become
a band for our time,

1801
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:51,294
but sometimes
if you do a good enough job,

1802
01:56:51,462 --> 01:56:53,880
you become a band for all time.

1803
02:00:20,602 --> 02:00:23,437
A funny thing happened
right when we broke up.

1804
02:00:23,605 --> 02:00:29,235
1980 is when the format
"classic rock" hit American radio.

1805
02:00:29,403 --> 02:00:30,724
So even though the band broke up,

1806
02:00:30,862 --> 02:00:35,199
they kept playing our songs
all the time.

1807
02:00:35,367 --> 02:00:39,662
It was like we never went away.
We were still on the radio.

1808
02:00:47,004 --> 02:00:48,170
Somebody once told me

1809
02:00:48,338 --> 02:00:50,047
people didn't just listen
to the Eagles.

1810
02:00:50,215 --> 02:00:52,425
They did things to the Eagles.

1811
02:00:52,593 --> 02:00:54,594
They went on fandangos
and drove across the country

1812
02:00:54,761 --> 02:00:56,345
with three
of their high-school buddies.

1813
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:02,018
People broke up
with their girlfriends.

1814
02:01:23,415 --> 02:01:25,958
People quit their jobs
or changed their lives.

1815
02:01:26,126 --> 02:01:29,378
They did things to the Eagles.

1816
02:01:36,595 --> 02:01:39,347
Songs from that album have even
been played in outer space.

1817
02:01:39,514 --> 02:01:41,474
And they used to pipe the music
up to the space shuttle

1818
02:01:41,642 --> 02:01:43,309
to wake the astronauts up
in the morning.

1819
02:01:43,477 --> 02:01:47,605
Shortly after having their breakfast
of steak and eggs and toast,

1820
02:01:47,773 --> 02:01:50,566
he then put on his space suit
and helmet.

1821
02:02:30,357 --> 02:02:31,757
That song has really gotten around.

1822
02:02:47,332 --> 02:02:48,332
There's been a lot of conjecture

1823
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,501
about how and why
we got back together.

1824
02:02:50,669 --> 02:02:53,879
We began to realize
that we'd been away for 14 years.

1825
02:02:54,047 --> 02:02:56,924
Maybe we could have that rarest
of things in American life,

1826
02:02:57,092 --> 02:02:59,593
which is a second act.

1827
02:02:59,761 --> 02:03:01,011
You know, a second chance.

1828
02:03:11,314 --> 02:03:13,441
Thank you.

1829
02:03:19,364 --> 02:03:21,657
When we stopped, I was really sad.

1830
02:03:21,825 --> 02:03:23,868
Like, "What are we gonna do?"

1831
02:03:34,045 --> 02:03:36,088
No!

1832
02:03:36,256 --> 02:03:38,215
I was pretty devastated.

1833
02:03:38,383 --> 02:03:41,510
I had only been part of it
for barely three years,

1834
02:03:41,678 --> 02:03:43,262
and I'd loved it.

1835
02:03:51,438 --> 02:03:53,522
We created this monster,

1836
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:55,441
and it took its toll
on all of our lives.

1837
02:04:14,336 --> 02:04:15,961
Somebody was quoted as saying

1838
02:04:16,129 --> 02:04:18,410
the Eagles would get back together
when hell freezes over.

1839
02:04:18,548 --> 02:04:20,841
So, hell froze over.

1840
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:34,814
We're all ready.

1841
02:04:34,981 --> 02:04:36,816
The gentleman in blue over there.

1842
02:04:36,983 --> 02:04:38,484
After the acrimony
and the bitterness

1843
02:04:38,652 --> 02:04:39,819
that marked the demise of the band,

1844
02:04:39,986 --> 02:04:42,655
it must have been a long road
to reunion.

1845
02:04:42,823 --> 02:04:44,824
Can you just take us through
the steps that you went through

1846
02:04:44,991 --> 02:04:48,536
on the road to reunification?

1847
02:04:50,455 --> 02:04:52,081
No.

1848
02:04:59,798 --> 02:05:01,131
Anybody want that one?

1849
02:05:01,299 --> 02:05:03,509
No, really, it's a fair question.

1850
02:05:03,677 --> 02:05:06,387
From the time
that we disbanded in 1980,

1851
02:05:06,555 --> 02:05:09,014
there were always offers
on the table

1852
02:05:09,182 --> 02:05:10,474
for us to get back together.

1853
02:05:10,642 --> 02:05:12,226
It started with the first US festival,

1854
02:05:12,394 --> 02:05:15,020
and Steve Wozniak wanted
to pay us a million dollars.

1855
02:05:15,188 --> 02:05:16,730
I said no.

1856
02:05:20,944 --> 02:05:23,612
I needed to do something else.

1857
02:05:34,207 --> 02:05:36,709
I called my first solo album
"No Fun Aloud"

1858
02:05:36,877 --> 02:05:38,794
because I was having
so much fun.

1859
02:05:38,962 --> 02:05:41,589
It was so liberating to know
that whatever I did

1860
02:05:41,756 --> 02:05:43,173
was gonna be more fun
than what I just did

1861
02:05:43,341 --> 02:05:45,509
for the last three years
on "The Long Run" album.

1862
02:05:47,429 --> 02:05:49,722
I knew I wanted to have
a songwriting partner,

1863
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,432
so I asked my friend
Jack Tempchin

1864
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,726
if he wanted to write
some songs together.

1865
02:05:54,394 --> 02:05:56,645
And Jack's a very bright guy
lyrically,

1866
02:05:56,813 --> 02:05:59,231
and so I started working with him.

1867
02:06:00,442 --> 02:06:03,068
He had become a disciplined
co-writer with Don Henley,

1868
02:06:03,236 --> 02:06:04,528
and when the Eagles broke up,

1869
02:06:04,696 --> 02:06:07,698
he just wanted to let go and have
some fun with music, you know?

1870
02:06:07,866 --> 02:06:10,659
So we were fiddling around
with some grooves,

1871
02:06:10,827 --> 02:06:13,245
and one of us said,
"You belong to the city."

1872
02:06:13,413 --> 02:06:15,373
And then we're going,
"Oh, yeah, yeah. That's it."

1873
02:06:26,593 --> 02:06:28,969
You just show up
and good things happen.

1874
02:06:34,392 --> 02:06:38,062
Henley's solo career
was really, really successful.

1875
02:06:40,774 --> 02:06:43,108
Going solo was
the scariest part of my life.

1876
02:06:46,821 --> 02:06:50,366
The whole MTV thing was a difficult
transition for me to make.

1877
02:06:50,533 --> 02:06:51,700
You know, the Eagles, at one point,

1878
02:06:51,868 --> 02:06:56,121
had been accused by some critic
of loitering onstage.

1879
02:06:56,289 --> 02:06:58,374
So it was difficult for us loiterers

1880
02:06:58,541 --> 02:07:01,418
to make the transition
to the world of choreography

1881
02:07:01,586 --> 02:07:03,629
and costume and acting.

1882
02:07:08,426 --> 02:07:10,469
Did I benefit from MTV?
Yes, I did.

1883
02:07:10,637 --> 02:07:13,037
You know, I made a couple of videos
that won some MTV awards.

1884
02:07:13,098 --> 02:07:16,141
Nevertheless, I would just as soon
have skipped the whole thing

1885
02:07:16,309 --> 02:07:18,727
because I considered myself,
first and foremost,

1886
02:07:18,895 --> 02:07:22,815
a songwriter
and a recording artist.

1887
02:07:22,983 --> 02:07:25,025
I didn't really want to be
an actor, too.

1888
02:07:26,778 --> 02:07:27,861
Nice, huh?

1889
02:07:28,029 --> 02:07:30,072
The guy who sold it to me
said it was a lemon.

1890
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:31,782
But I'm telling you,
it may look like a cow,

1891
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:35,077
but she runs like a stallion.

1892
02:07:37,122 --> 02:07:39,999
I always like to take
a good-bye look at America.

1893
02:07:42,502 --> 02:07:46,005
Just in case it's my last.

1894
02:07:46,506 --> 02:07:48,799
I acted in television, in movies.

1895
02:07:48,967 --> 02:07:51,844
I wasn't really thinking about getting
back together with the Eagles.

1896
02:07:52,262 --> 02:07:54,513
The guy's got an attitude problem.

1897
02:07:54,681 --> 02:07:56,140
Yeah, well, he listens to me.
I can help you with that.

1898
02:07:56,307 --> 02:07:59,018
Cameron would call me up and say,
"Glenn, I got to find somebody

1899
02:07:59,185 --> 02:08:00,811
that's not gonna take any shit
off Tom Cruise,

1900
02:08:00,979 --> 02:08:02,521
and I think you're the guy."

1901
02:08:02,689 --> 02:08:04,106
We have history, Dennis.

1902
02:08:04,274 --> 02:08:06,191
Oh, yeah.
We got history all right, Jerry.

1903
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:07,276
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1904
02:08:07,444 --> 02:08:09,153
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!
Don't! Don't!

1905
02:08:20,999 --> 02:08:23,584
I signed Don Henley
to Geffen Records.

1906
02:08:23,752 --> 02:08:24,512
Now, you might say,

1907
02:08:24,586 --> 02:08:26,462
since the Eagles sued me
at Asylum Records...

1908
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:27,755
DAVID GEFFEN
FOUNDER, ASYLUM RECORDS

1909
02:08:27,922 --> 02:08:29,214
...why he did come with me
at Geffen Records?

1910
02:08:29,382 --> 02:08:31,008
Well, David uses
the same pickup lines

1911
02:08:31,176 --> 02:08:32,468
every time he comes a-courtin'.

1912
02:08:32,635 --> 02:08:34,555
"You know how much
I care about you as an artist.

1913
02:08:34,721 --> 02:08:36,555
You know what a big fan I am
of yours."

1914
02:08:36,723 --> 02:08:39,224
And so I bought it a second time
and I signed with him.

1915
02:08:39,392 --> 02:08:41,226
And then things started
to fall apart.

1916
02:08:42,771 --> 02:08:44,813
I produced several hits,

1917
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:47,524
but I could feel the support
somehow waning.

1918
02:08:47,692 --> 02:08:50,569
Don got into arguments with them

1919
02:08:50,737 --> 02:08:54,656
over things like budget, videos,
artwork, things like that.

1920
02:08:54,824 --> 02:08:57,242
I recall Don starting
to write letters to them

1921
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:59,745
referring to them
as Nickel and Dime Records.

1922
02:08:59,913 --> 02:09:01,663
When you feel like your label
is not supporting you,

1923
02:09:01,831 --> 02:09:03,540
it's completely deflating.

1924
02:09:03,708 --> 02:09:05,542
I used to call him "Golden throat."

1925
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,336
I thought he was
an incredible singer.

1926
02:09:07,504 --> 02:09:10,172
But, by nature, he's a malcontent.

1927
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:12,174
He's always been a malcontent.

1928
02:09:12,342 --> 02:09:15,094
And, you know, that's just life.

1929
02:09:15,261 --> 02:09:17,429
So I just said one day, "I'm not
gonna record for you anymore.

1930
02:09:17,597 --> 02:09:19,056
I'm leaving."

1931
02:09:19,224 --> 02:09:21,558
And so he sued me
for $30 million.

1932
02:09:33,571 --> 02:09:35,948
My wife has M.S.,
and they deposed her,

1933
02:09:36,116 --> 02:09:38,117
dragged her all the way
from Texas to Los Angeles

1934
02:09:38,284 --> 02:09:40,786
to sit her down
in front of his attorneys

1935
02:09:40,954 --> 02:09:43,622
and ask her
a bunch of pointless questions,

1936
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:45,457
because she didn't know anything.

1937
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:46,959
I thought that was really low.

1938
02:09:47,502 --> 02:09:50,379
I said to Irving
over the Henley contract,

1939
02:09:50,547 --> 02:09:52,965
"I'd sooner die
than let you fuck me.

1940
02:09:53,133 --> 02:09:54,800
You'd better win this case."

1941
02:09:54,968 --> 02:09:56,468
It was settled, you know,

1942
02:09:56,636 --> 02:09:59,263
and that was the end
of that relationship.

1943
02:10:13,194 --> 02:10:16,655
I've realized now
that we have adult rock stars.

1944
02:10:18,741 --> 02:10:23,453
You don't have to give this up
when you turn 30 or 35 or 40.

1945
02:10:25,999 --> 02:10:27,958
I'll always make records
and write songs.

1946
02:10:28,126 --> 02:10:30,419
I got to do them.
Otherwise, I'd go nuts.

1947
02:10:43,516 --> 02:10:46,935
This is a tune that was written
with my new friend Mike Campbell

1948
02:10:47,103 --> 02:10:49,229
and my old friend
John David Souther.

1949
02:10:49,397 --> 02:10:50,606
When the band broke up,

1950
02:10:50,773 --> 02:10:54,026
Glenn started writing songs
with Jack Tempchin.

1951
02:10:54,194 --> 02:10:56,862
I guess the rift
between Henley and Frey

1952
02:10:57,030 --> 02:11:00,073
probably spread
to between Frey and me.

1953
02:11:00,241 --> 02:11:03,160
Glenn and I had had some
outrageously fun times together.

1954
02:11:03,328 --> 02:11:06,038
And then Don and I did
for a decade or so.

1955
02:11:29,729 --> 02:11:32,648
How have you changed
as musicians over the years,

1956
02:11:32,815 --> 02:11:36,068
both as a group and individually?

1957
02:11:36,236 --> 02:11:39,238
Well, your whole mandate
is just to improve.

1958
02:11:39,405 --> 02:11:40,864
You know, life is about improvement,

1959
02:11:41,032 --> 02:11:44,284
whether it's as a musician
or as a singer or as a songwriter

1960
02:11:44,452 --> 02:11:47,496
or just, you know, all the other
different hats we all wear.

1961
02:11:47,664 --> 02:11:49,831
So, hopefully,
we're just getting better.

1962
02:11:49,999 --> 02:11:52,501
We've been doing this
quite a long time now on and off,

1963
02:11:52,669 --> 02:11:54,836
and we feel like we've got it down
pretty good.

1964
02:11:55,004 --> 02:11:57,005
And, in fact,
we've had five days off,

1965
02:11:57,173 --> 02:11:59,091
and we're ready to go now.

1966
02:12:01,844 --> 02:12:03,136
When the Eagles first broke up,

1967
02:12:03,304 --> 02:12:06,598
I wasn't quite sure
what I was gonna do with myself.

1968
02:12:06,766 --> 02:12:07,891
So I just hustled.

1969
02:12:08,059 --> 02:12:09,977
I went just as a singer with Toto,

1970
02:12:10,144 --> 02:12:11,687
I played bass for Jimmy Buffett,

1971
02:12:11,854 --> 02:12:13,981
I went out with Warren Zevon
and Dan Fogelberg,

1972
02:12:14,148 --> 02:12:15,941
and stuff I wouldn't have
necessarily done.

1973
02:12:16,109 --> 02:12:19,695
I sang on Poison records
and Twisted Sister,

1974
02:12:19,862 --> 02:12:20,946
although you'll never see my name.

1975
02:12:21,114 --> 02:12:22,406
They never gave me credit.

1976
02:12:22,573 --> 02:12:25,450
That was more like yelling.

1977
02:12:26,286 --> 02:12:28,996
It's not all gonna be
the greatest thing in the world.

1978
02:12:29,163 --> 02:12:32,291
But if you can work and support
yourself and your family,

1979
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:33,292
it's good.

1980
02:12:33,459 --> 02:12:34,418
Okay, next question.

1981
02:12:34,585 --> 02:12:36,962
Gentleman in the front here,
Richard.

1982
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:40,340
What position do you think
rock 'n' roll takes now about drugs?

1983
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,886
We came from a generation

1984
02:12:45,054 --> 02:12:50,892
that experimented with all kinds
of substances, of course.

1985
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,437
I think our message is that

1986
02:12:53,604 --> 02:12:56,648
you can be a damn good rock band
without all that stuff.

1987
02:12:56,816 --> 02:12:58,483
I'd like to propose a toast

1988
02:12:58,651 --> 02:13:04,740
to dedicate this song to you,
to us.

1989
02:13:05,992 --> 02:13:09,536
The drinking man's musician,
Joe Walsh!

1990
02:13:22,383 --> 02:13:26,178
I ended up an alcoholic.

1991
02:13:27,889 --> 02:13:30,724
And very fond of cocaine.

1992
02:13:34,937 --> 02:13:41,318
If I was awake,
I was doing that stuff.

1993
02:13:41,903 --> 02:13:44,029
Good morning, rock fans.

1994
02:13:44,197 --> 02:13:49,201
In the very early years,
it had briefly worked.

1995
02:13:49,369 --> 02:13:51,328
Wow.

1996
02:13:52,997 --> 02:13:59,294
And then you chase it
when it doesn't work anymore.

1997
02:13:59,504 --> 02:14:01,671
And I chased it
for years and years.

1998
02:14:20,983 --> 02:14:25,570
"Could Hemingway have written
like that if he was sober,

1999
02:14:25,738 --> 02:14:28,490
or could Hendrix
have played like that

2000
02:14:28,658 --> 02:14:31,868
if he didn't experiment
with hallucinogenics?

2001
02:14:32,036 --> 02:14:33,412
Well, probably not."

2002
02:14:33,579 --> 02:14:35,539
I used that one
for years and years,

2003
02:14:35,706 --> 02:14:39,960
and it never occurred to me
that all those people are dead.

2004
02:14:40,169 --> 02:14:45,215
They got further and further away
from reality.

2005
02:14:45,383 --> 02:14:46,744
Should I look at you
or the camera?

2006
02:14:46,884 --> 02:14:48,927
Look at me.

2007
02:14:51,514 --> 02:14:55,767
I ended up in bad shape.

2008
02:15:16,914 --> 02:15:19,708
I had hit bottom.

2009
02:15:19,876 --> 02:15:23,086
And I knew that I was done

2010
02:15:23,254 --> 02:15:25,839
and that...

2011
02:15:27,383 --> 02:15:29,759
...I would probably die
if I kept going.

2012
02:15:38,978 --> 02:15:40,520
Joe was a mess.

2013
02:15:40,688 --> 02:15:44,691
He was around a bunch of people
that were really just enablers.

2014
02:15:44,859 --> 02:15:45,942
Nobody wanted to intervene.

2015
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:48,153
Nobody wanted to tell him
he had a drug problem

2016
02:15:48,321 --> 02:15:50,322
or a drinking problem.

2017
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:53,950
Everybody was just
going along with Joe.

2018
02:15:54,118 --> 02:15:59,664
I remember what we all did
when it was an art form, you know?

2019
02:15:59,832 --> 02:16:04,961
And I'd like to fight
to get it back to that.

2020
02:16:05,546 --> 02:16:08,298
And I was very, very happy
in the Eagles.

2021
02:16:08,466 --> 02:16:09,883
I was just gonna say
I'm sorry we broke up,

2022
02:16:10,051 --> 02:16:11,009
but we didn't break up.

2023
02:16:11,177 --> 02:16:12,469
We just stopped, I think.

2024
02:16:12,637 --> 02:16:16,681
We just said, you know,
"The heck with the '80s."

2025
02:16:17,433 --> 02:16:18,892
Song 3, take 6.

2026
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:23,146
In 1990, we tried to get together
to refuel it.

2027
02:16:23,314 --> 02:16:26,775
Everybody was in on that,
but Glenn wasn't involved yet.

2028
02:16:29,862 --> 02:16:31,696
Irving got us together...

2029
02:16:31,864 --> 02:16:34,449
Timothy, Joe, myself,
and Don Henley.

2030
02:16:34,617 --> 02:16:36,701
Glenn was supposed to join us
in the studio,

2031
02:16:36,869 --> 02:16:38,537
and he was gonna bring
some songs in,

2032
02:16:38,704 --> 02:16:40,789
and we were gonna start making
another record.

2033
02:16:40,957 --> 02:16:43,416
So, we started rehearsing,
the four of us,

2034
02:16:43,584 --> 02:16:44,376
then we got a call,

2035
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:47,837
I think, about the third or fourth day
in the studio

2036
02:16:48,005 --> 02:16:52,592
saying that Glenn had refused
to come be part of it,

2037
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:54,135
to join the party.

2038
02:16:54,303 --> 02:16:55,512
So we just stopped.

2039
02:16:56,847 --> 02:16:58,723
He was still, "I'm not doing this."

2040
02:16:58,891 --> 02:17:00,141
Well, you know,
to tell you the truth,

2041
02:17:00,309 --> 02:17:02,978
I was having a fine time
doing what I was doing.

2042
02:17:03,145 --> 02:17:05,564
I mean, there's more to life
than being in the Eagles.

2043
02:17:05,731 --> 02:17:06,931
The moment was always gonna be

2044
02:17:07,024 --> 02:17:08,817
kind of when Glenn was ready
to do it again.

2045
02:17:08,985 --> 02:17:11,194
I think Henley would have been
more willing than Glenn.

2046
02:17:11,362 --> 02:17:12,862
For me, personally,

2047
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:15,282
I think that I had proved
pretty much everything

2048
02:17:15,449 --> 02:17:18,326
that I needed to prove
in my solo career.

2049
02:17:18,494 --> 02:17:19,452
I had won a couple of Grammys

2050
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:22,414
and had a few hits
and some successful tours.

2051
02:17:22,623 --> 02:17:24,791
And I had founded
the Walden Woods Project.

2052
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:26,042
When you're a solo artist,

2053
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:28,920
you have to take responsibility
for everything...

2054
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:31,715
every mistake, every bad record,
every sour note.

2055
02:17:31,882 --> 02:17:32,922
But when you're in a band,

2056
02:17:32,967 --> 02:17:35,885
you get to share the praise
and the blame with your bandmates.

2057
02:17:36,053 --> 02:17:37,345
So, I was okay with the notion

2058
02:17:37,513 --> 02:17:39,639
of maybe going back
and being in a band again.

2059
02:17:43,477 --> 02:17:45,437
The thing that sort of
turned my head

2060
02:17:45,605 --> 02:17:47,856
was the release
of the "Common Thread" album.

2061
02:17:48,024 --> 02:17:49,774
Irving and Don went to Nashville

2062
02:17:49,942 --> 02:17:53,403
and they talked a bunch of people
into recording some Eagles songs

2063
02:17:53,571 --> 02:17:55,947
with the royalties going
to the Walden Woods Project.

2064
02:17:59,493 --> 02:18:01,094
I don't know who asked me,
but they said,

2065
02:18:01,203 --> 02:18:03,413
"Travis Tritt's gonna do a video
of 'Take It Easy'

2066
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:06,791
and he wants to know if you guys
will be in the video."

2067
02:18:06,959 --> 02:18:09,544
I said, "Well, okay."

2068
02:18:15,384 --> 02:18:18,053
Never really talked to Travis
about whose idea it was.

2069
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:21,931
I think Irving probably had a hand
in that whole thing.

2070
02:18:22,099 --> 02:18:23,808
Was I trying to put
the band back together

2071
02:18:23,976 --> 02:18:26,144
by doing "Common Thread"?
No.

2072
02:18:26,312 --> 02:18:28,480
Was I waiting for the moment?
Yeah.

2073
02:18:38,949 --> 02:18:42,327
In the Travis Tritt video,
there was a little bandstand scene

2074
02:18:42,495 --> 02:18:45,413
and we all picked up our instruments
and started playing.

2075
02:18:45,581 --> 02:18:49,542
I was thinking, "Guys, come on."
You know?

2076
02:18:49,710 --> 02:18:52,003
You know, it's interesting.
After years pass, you know,

2077
02:18:52,171 --> 02:18:55,799
you really sort of remember
that you were friends first.

2078
02:18:55,966 --> 02:18:57,258
You have a lot
of common history together

2079
02:18:57,426 --> 02:19:00,679
and a lot of shared experiences.

2080
02:19:00,846 --> 02:19:02,972
I remembered
mostly the good stuff.

2081
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:06,059
I didn't really think
about the bad stuff.

2082
02:19:06,227 --> 02:19:09,229
I just remembered how much
we genuinely had liked each other

2083
02:19:09,397 --> 02:19:10,814
and how much fun we'd had.

2084
02:19:13,693 --> 02:19:16,152
We realized, after the success
of the "Common Thread" album

2085
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:18,905
that there were still
a lot of people out there...

2086
02:19:19,073 --> 02:19:22,117
a whole lot of people...
who wanted to see us play again.

2087
02:19:22,284 --> 02:19:25,164
You know, sometimes there's a little
bit of serendipity involved in this,

2088
02:19:25,246 --> 02:19:26,329
and I think what happened

2089
02:19:26,497 --> 02:19:30,542
is everybody's life
started to line up in a way

2090
02:19:30,710 --> 02:19:33,670
that now it made sense
for all of us.

2091
02:19:33,838 --> 02:19:36,840
And we discussed it.

2092
02:19:37,007 --> 02:19:41,094
Joe and Don came up and sat in
at a benefit that I did in Aspen.

2093
02:19:41,262 --> 02:19:42,887
We had a meeting in Aspen.

2094
02:19:43,055 --> 02:19:48,518
I was one of the first guys
that they wanted to try it out on.

2095
02:19:48,686 --> 02:19:52,147
You know, Joe was buzzed.
It was 1:00 in the afternoon.

2096
02:19:52,314 --> 02:19:55,400
You know, and he would say,
"Hey, I'm there, man.

2097
02:19:55,568 --> 02:19:58,903
I'm fine. Don't worry about me."

2098
02:19:59,071 --> 02:20:02,699
But Don and I could both tell
that he wasn't fine,

2099
02:20:02,867 --> 02:20:04,242
and we were worried.

2100
02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:06,035
They said what they wanted to do.

2101
02:20:06,203 --> 02:20:09,038
They wanted to try it,
get back together again.

2102
02:20:09,206 --> 02:20:11,499
They didn't know what I would say,

2103
02:20:11,667 --> 02:20:18,131
but I said, "I understand,
and, yeah, I can get sober."

2104
02:20:55,252 --> 02:20:58,087
We had to get Joe
into some sort of rehab,

2105
02:20:58,255 --> 02:20:59,964
and we couldn't be sure
it was gonna work.

2106
02:21:00,132 --> 02:21:01,674
So we better have Felder.

2107
02:21:01,842 --> 02:21:05,053
The Eagles reunion had better have
at least one of the two of them,

2108
02:21:05,221 --> 02:21:06,304
and hopefully both.

2109
02:21:06,472 --> 02:21:07,889
Irving called me up and said

2110
02:21:08,057 --> 02:21:11,518
that Don and Glenn and Joe
had gotten together,

2111
02:21:11,685 --> 02:21:13,770
and they were talking
about doing something,

2112
02:21:13,938 --> 02:21:15,021
and would I be interested
in doing it?

2113
02:21:15,189 --> 02:21:17,023
I said, "Absolutely."

2114
02:21:19,068 --> 02:21:20,735
One thing led to another,

2115
02:21:20,903 --> 02:21:23,947
and finally Irving and Don Felder
picked him up

2116
02:21:24,114 --> 02:21:25,824
and drove him to rehab.

2117
02:21:26,784 --> 02:21:31,663
I made a commitment to them
that I would clean up...

2118
02:21:32,456 --> 02:21:38,795
...and that I would be in the band

2119
02:21:38,963 --> 02:21:41,047
if that's what they wanted to do.

2120
02:21:50,391 --> 02:21:53,852
I'm really, really grateful
to those three guys...

2121
02:21:55,896 --> 02:21:58,565
...because I had...

2122
02:21:59,483 --> 02:22:05,280
...a really good reason to get sober.

2123
02:22:05,447 --> 02:22:11,494
And as soon as I got sober,
we started rehearsal.

2124
02:22:54,455 --> 02:22:58,583
From that first phone call from Irving
to showing up on a rehearsal stage

2125
02:22:58,751 --> 02:23:01,628
to start putting together
a show for MTV

2126
02:23:01,795 --> 02:23:04,923
was only a matter of weeks,
if not a month.

2127
02:23:10,471 --> 02:23:14,223
It was a little scary
rehearsing for the MTV thing.

2128
02:23:14,391 --> 02:23:17,518
Normally, I think people
would have their act down

2129
02:23:17,728 --> 02:23:19,145
a few weeks, at least,

2130
02:23:19,313 --> 02:23:21,439
before entering
into something like that,

2131
02:23:21,607 --> 02:23:25,485
but we just dove in headfirst.

2132
02:23:34,954 --> 02:23:36,795
Well, even though we had
rehearsed really well,

2133
02:23:36,956 --> 02:23:38,623
for the first time
to walk out on stage

2134
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:41,292
and actually play as a band
in public

2135
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:43,878
and kind of put the key
back into the ignition

2136
02:23:44,046 --> 02:23:46,005
and turn it over
for the first time,

2137
02:23:46,173 --> 02:23:48,341
it was really a lot of nerves.

2138
02:23:48,884 --> 02:23:50,677
Are we going the right way?

2139
02:23:50,844 --> 02:23:51,844
Glenn.

2140
02:23:52,012 --> 02:23:54,138
Not having played as a group
in 14 years,

2141
02:23:54,306 --> 02:23:57,725
the first night,
there was a lot of terror.

2142
02:23:57,893 --> 02:23:59,519
Gentlemen, good to be with ya.

2143
02:23:59,687 --> 02:24:02,105
Hope I'm with ya all night.

2144
02:24:02,272 --> 02:24:04,691
- Have a good one, okay?
- Okay.

2145
02:24:04,858 --> 02:24:08,236
- Showtime!
- Showtime! Showtime!

2146
02:24:15,285 --> 02:24:19,163
The audience was very kind,
and they were with us.

2147
02:24:19,331 --> 02:24:23,209
And that was good,
but it was rough.

2148
02:25:01,081 --> 02:25:04,584
Even when we went onstage,
we were definitely a little tight.

2149
02:25:04,752 --> 02:25:07,754
Until, I think,
Henley forgot the words

2150
02:25:07,921 --> 02:25:10,381
to one of the new songs...

2151
02:25:21,101 --> 02:25:23,519
You want to start again?
I'll tell you what.

2152
02:25:23,687 --> 02:25:29,025
This is television, so we get
to do this till we're happy.

2153
02:25:31,111 --> 02:25:33,488
Now, I thought you didn't remember the
third verse.

2154
02:25:33,655 --> 02:25:35,198
That was only the second verse!

2155
02:25:35,365 --> 02:25:37,241
I know. I know the third verse.

2156
02:25:37,409 --> 02:25:38,659
That was sort of the icebreaker,
though.

2157
02:25:38,827 --> 02:25:40,453
That was a good thing, ultimately.

2158
02:25:40,621 --> 02:25:42,997
I feel like Tommy Smothers.
All right.

2159
02:25:48,504 --> 02:25:51,631
We didn't think getting back together
was quite as legitimate

2160
02:25:51,799 --> 02:25:53,341
unless we had some new material,

2161
02:25:53,509 --> 02:25:56,803
so we're gonna put forth several
new songs for you this evening.

2162
02:25:59,306 --> 02:26:01,974
This first one Timothy B. Schmit
is gonna sing for you.

2163
02:26:02,142 --> 02:26:04,227
This is called
"Love Will Keep Us Alive."

2164
02:26:43,475 --> 02:26:46,018
After selling
100 million records worldwide,

2165
02:26:46,186 --> 02:26:49,355
was it real pressure on you
to write the new material

2166
02:26:49,523 --> 02:26:51,524
for the "Hell Freezes Over" album?

2167
02:26:53,152 --> 02:26:56,779
We didn't really look at it
as a body of new work.

2168
02:26:56,947 --> 02:26:59,157
It was more of a retrospective
piece of material.

2169
02:26:59,324 --> 02:27:02,243
And we look forward
to writing some new material,

2170
02:27:02,411 --> 02:27:03,494
perhaps in the future.

2171
02:27:03,662 --> 02:27:06,205
We can't keep recycling
this material,

2172
02:27:06,373 --> 02:27:09,041
although it seems to be working
just fine.

2173
02:27:12,796 --> 02:27:16,883
Don and I were trying to figure out
how to write another song,

2174
02:27:17,050 --> 02:27:18,885
and, I mean, really, if we could.

2175
02:27:19,052 --> 02:27:21,971
We hadn't written anything together
since, like, '78.

2176
02:27:22,139 --> 02:27:25,391
So it was a little awkward at first,
just getting back into the groove.

2177
02:27:25,559 --> 02:27:27,226
Yeah.

2178
02:27:27,394 --> 02:27:28,603
So, we go, 1...

2179
02:27:28,770 --> 02:27:31,022
Okay, here we are starting out
at 1, 2...

2180
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:32,356
During "The Long Run" album,

2181
02:27:32,524 --> 02:27:34,442
there were a lot of sessions
with Don and I

2182
02:27:34,610 --> 02:27:35,776
where nothing got done.

2183
02:27:35,944 --> 02:27:38,487
We were both a little bit reticent
to introduce our ideas

2184
02:27:38,655 --> 02:27:40,406
for fear that they weren't
good enough.

2185
02:27:40,574 --> 02:27:43,409
So when we sat down
to do it again in '94,

2186
02:27:43,577 --> 02:27:47,914
my first worry was, "Is it gonna be
as hard as it was in 1978?"

2187
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:52,891
We were sitting around, "What are
we gonna write about?" and stuff.

2188
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:56,380
And he said, "Well, I've got
this one title, 'Get Over It."'

2189
02:27:56,548 --> 02:27:58,299
And he sort of proceeded to tell me

2190
02:27:58,467 --> 02:28:00,760
what it was
that was pissing him off...

2191
02:28:00,928 --> 02:28:02,887
all these people
going on television

2192
02:28:03,055 --> 02:28:06,224
and everything that's wrong with them
is somebody else's fault.

2193
02:28:06,391 --> 02:28:08,434
"I'm just sick of all this whining,

2194
02:28:08,602 --> 02:28:11,437
and so I'm gonna write a song
called 'Get Over It."'

2195
02:28:11,605 --> 02:28:14,815
The intro, straight Chuck Berry.

2196
02:28:14,983 --> 02:28:17,818
Never play a 7, right?

2197
02:28:19,947 --> 02:28:22,823
So, then I said, "I think maybe
a Chuck Berry riff

2198
02:28:22,991 --> 02:28:24,951
would be a good way
to tell that story."

2199
02:28:25,118 --> 02:28:26,285
Time out.

2200
02:28:26,453 --> 02:28:28,704
Do you want to play the?

2201
02:28:28,872 --> 02:28:30,248
You want to do it on slide?

2202
02:28:30,415 --> 02:28:33,125
And then Felder and I will just play
power chords low and high.

2203
02:28:33,293 --> 02:28:35,461
And those guys will play
Chuck Berry low and high.

2204
02:28:35,629 --> 02:28:38,422
And we can do "Get Over It".

2205
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:41,300
A couple little of them
slide answer licks is cool.

2206
02:28:41,468 --> 02:28:45,805
My favorite thing is when
Don and Glenn co-write stuff.

2207
02:28:45,973 --> 02:28:48,349
I like to play guitar to that.

2208
02:29:07,661 --> 02:29:10,454
You want me to sing it,
or do you want to wait?

2209
02:29:10,622 --> 02:29:12,331
It's 10 to 6.

2210
02:29:12,499 --> 02:29:15,584
You can sing it at 10 to 6
or 5 to 6.

2211
02:29:15,752 --> 02:29:18,045
- Do it again?
- Yeah, we'll do it twice.

2212
02:29:18,213 --> 02:29:20,756
Yeah, you could write it in
with the mike.

2213
02:29:21,883 --> 02:29:24,093
Captioned for hard of hearing.

2214
02:29:30,267 --> 02:29:32,476
It was really liberating.

2215
02:29:32,644 --> 02:29:34,520
We both walked out
of the session and went,

2216
02:29:34,688 --> 02:29:37,481
"God, we can still do it.
I can't believe it.

2217
02:29:37,649 --> 02:29:40,049
We just wrote a song together.
Maybe we can write some more."

2218
02:29:45,490 --> 02:29:47,742
That was a really good feeling.

2219
02:29:47,909 --> 02:29:50,995
It was a great sort of
artistic reconciliation

2220
02:29:51,163 --> 02:29:53,873
for us to have been able to sit down
and write that song together.

2221
02:30:26,365 --> 02:30:27,531
Get over it!

2222
02:30:33,121 --> 02:30:36,332
We did "Hell Freezes Over,"
and then we went out on the road.

2223
02:30:40,712 --> 02:30:42,880
That was the question
on everyone's mind...

2224
02:30:43,090 --> 02:30:45,800
what if we got back together,
and no one showed up?

2225
02:31:12,035 --> 02:31:15,079
We set it up to be
a three-month reunion.

2226
02:31:15,247 --> 02:31:18,332
I went back to my wife, and I had
two young kids at the time.

2227
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:20,793
I said, "I don't know
if you're gonna recognize me.

2228
02:31:20,961 --> 02:31:23,462
I don't know
what this is gonna do to me.

2229
02:31:23,630 --> 02:31:26,340
But I hope I don't change too much.

2230
02:31:26,508 --> 02:31:28,134
Hang in there with me."

2231
02:32:01,001 --> 02:32:03,878
I was on the side of the stage
once at one of their shows

2232
02:32:04,045 --> 02:32:05,671
when they first got back together,

2233
02:32:05,839 --> 02:32:08,591
and Jack Nicholson was euphoric

2234
02:32:08,758 --> 02:32:11,635
listening to this band play again,
you know.

2235
02:32:11,803 --> 02:32:15,890
And he said...

2236
02:32:16,057 --> 02:32:18,684
"Repertoire."

2237
02:32:18,852 --> 02:32:20,561
What do you want to hear?

2238
02:32:32,782 --> 02:32:35,423
We didn't know how many people
are gonna show up for us to reunite,

2239
02:32:35,494 --> 02:32:38,204
but people came out in droves.

2240
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,718
We were sold out everywhere.

2241
02:32:52,886 --> 02:32:55,763
Audiences were having
a fabulous time.

2242
02:32:55,931 --> 02:32:57,223
We were having a good time, too.

2243
02:33:32,259 --> 02:33:33,509
Heartache, baby!

2244
02:33:38,723 --> 02:33:41,517
I listened to the guys,
and Joe Walsh, for example,

2245
02:33:41,685 --> 02:33:43,602
is playing better and singing better

2246
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:46,250
than I've ever heard him play
in his life since I've known him.

2247
02:33:54,155 --> 02:33:58,534
I didn't have time to really
sit around and miss alcohol

2248
02:33:58,702 --> 02:34:02,746
or cold turkey from more cocaine
or anything.

2249
02:34:02,914 --> 02:34:10,462
And I had to go in front of people
and play and sing sober,

2250
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:13,591
which I hated, at first.

2251
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:14,967
Ooh, that was scary.

2252
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:51,146
When Joe first got out of rehab
and we started rehearsing,

2253
02:35:51,314 --> 02:35:52,981
he was still pretty dark.

2254
02:35:53,149 --> 02:35:55,859
But over the course
of that first year getting sober,

2255
02:35:56,027 --> 02:35:59,279
I think he found happiness again.

2256
02:35:59,447 --> 02:36:01,865
He found a way to be happy.

2257
02:36:07,580 --> 02:36:08,789
You look very pretty.

2258
02:36:08,957 --> 02:36:10,499
It's okay. Once more.

2259
02:36:10,667 --> 02:36:12,501
Oh, now, are you ready?

2260
02:36:12,669 --> 02:36:14,878
Father, daughter, take one.

2261
02:36:15,714 --> 02:36:19,091
We got that family thing
to ground us all now.

2262
02:36:19,259 --> 02:36:21,844
It's really sort of
our common thread.

2263
02:36:22,011 --> 02:36:23,262
We've all got kids.

2264
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:25,639
It changes your life

2265
02:36:25,807 --> 02:36:28,726
and your perspective
on your work, as well.

2266
02:36:40,488 --> 02:36:43,365
So, the tour was
so enormously successful

2267
02:36:43,533 --> 02:36:45,200
that we sort of didn't want
to give that up, you know?

2268
02:36:45,368 --> 02:36:49,037
It's like, "Okay, this is good.
I could do this for a while."

2269
02:37:32,207 --> 02:37:33,916
Doing a concert
is a strange combination

2270
02:37:34,083 --> 02:37:35,709
of conscious and subconscious acts.

2271
02:37:35,877 --> 02:37:38,170
You're not really thinking
about what you're doing

2272
02:37:38,338 --> 02:37:39,922
because you know it so well,
you're just doing it.

2273
02:37:40,089 --> 02:37:42,290
On the other hand, you have to put
some emotion into it.

2274
02:37:42,342 --> 02:37:44,183
When you've got a crowd
that's cheering you on,

2275
02:37:44,344 --> 02:37:46,470
it doesn't matter how many times
you've sung the song.

2276
02:37:46,638 --> 02:37:47,846
You just do it.

2277
02:38:35,311 --> 02:38:36,728
We've played all over the world,

2278
02:38:36,896 --> 02:38:38,814
and probably,
if we could write the script,

2279
02:38:38,982 --> 02:38:41,066
it was probably a genius move.

2280
02:38:41,234 --> 02:38:43,652
'Cause when we come back,
it's bigger than ever.

2281
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:47,656
How much money do you expect
to gross with this European tour?

2282
02:38:47,824 --> 02:38:49,533
Irving?

2283
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:51,660
I actually haven't added it up,
but I will tell you that...

2284
02:38:51,828 --> 02:38:53,036
Good answer.

2285
02:38:54,539 --> 02:38:56,790
One thing,

2286
02:38:56,958 --> 02:39:00,502
the cost of being a touring
rock-'n'-roll band in Europe

2287
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:03,213
are beyond our wildest imaginations,

2288
02:39:03,381 --> 02:39:05,424
but this band is here in Europe

2289
02:39:05,592 --> 02:39:07,551
because there was demand for us
to be here.

2290
02:39:07,719 --> 02:39:11,221
And it's not nearly as lucrative
as anything we've done before.

2291
02:39:13,308 --> 02:39:14,975
It isn't?

2292
02:39:21,524 --> 02:39:23,984
Offers started coming in
for us to do more shows,

2293
02:39:24,152 --> 02:39:25,235
and I just sort of said,

2294
02:39:25,403 --> 02:39:27,613
"Well, book some more.
It doesn't have to end now.

2295
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:29,072
Book some more.
Where else can we play?"

2296
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:30,198
"Well, you haven't been in Europe."

2297
02:39:30,366 --> 02:39:32,242
"Well, let's go there."

2298
02:40:15,995 --> 02:40:17,663
How's it go?

2299
02:40:42,355 --> 02:40:44,064
We had drawn a line in the sand

2300
02:40:44,232 --> 02:40:47,609
and said, "No drugs or alcohol
during any band activities."

2301
02:40:47,777 --> 02:40:49,528
And as a result,

2302
02:40:49,696 --> 02:40:51,947
we're playing and singing
pretty damn good.

2303
02:40:57,787 --> 02:41:00,107
I think the thing that brings them
together is the harmony.

2304
02:41:00,123 --> 02:41:03,375
When they start hearing that
and how seamless and how perfect,

2305
02:41:03,543 --> 02:41:05,877
they get as thrilled
as the audiences do,

2306
02:41:06,045 --> 02:41:07,421
that "We can still do this."

2307
02:41:30,236 --> 02:41:31,737
We can't really understand it.

2308
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:33,864
It's just the chemistry that works.

2309
02:41:34,032 --> 02:41:36,158
And we gave up
trying to understand it.

2310
02:41:36,325 --> 02:41:37,576
It just works.

2311
02:41:37,744 --> 02:41:39,911
We're just gonna do one verse
the "New Kid."

2312
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:41,872
- One verse the "New Kid."
- Okay.

2313
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:43,749
- Joe's singing "Smuggler's Blues."
- Okay.

2314
02:41:43,916 --> 02:41:46,084
I'll just do the beginning
of "Funk 49."

2315
02:41:46,252 --> 02:41:47,627
And then I'm gonna go pee.

2316
02:41:47,795 --> 02:41:49,755
- Yeah.
- Then I'll go pee.

2317
02:41:49,922 --> 02:41:51,506
1, 2, 3.

2318
02:43:33,067 --> 02:43:34,860
All right, boys!

2319
02:43:35,027 --> 02:43:37,237
We ended up
going all around the world

2320
02:43:37,405 --> 02:43:40,323
in about two years and nine months.

2321
02:43:58,301 --> 02:44:01,094
Thank you, Dublin!

2322
02:44:06,684 --> 02:44:09,603
We've learned not to make
career decisions

2323
02:44:09,770 --> 02:44:11,897
at the end of long tours.

2324
02:44:12,064 --> 02:44:13,523
If we break up again, though,
you won't hear about it.

2325
02:44:13,691 --> 02:44:15,400
We'll just go quietly.

2326
02:44:15,568 --> 02:44:17,319
And we'll say we're still together.

2327
02:44:17,486 --> 02:44:18,653
Yeah.

2328
02:44:20,865 --> 02:44:23,450
They've laughed, cried, fought,

2329
02:44:23,618 --> 02:44:26,620
but most of all,
they have beaten the odds

2330
02:44:26,787 --> 02:44:28,330
and are as popular today

2331
02:44:28,497 --> 02:44:32,500
as they were in that incredible
summer back in 1972.

2332
02:44:32,668 --> 02:44:35,837
It is an honor and a pleasure
to introduce the Eagles.

2333
02:44:41,427 --> 02:44:44,054
A lot has been talked about
and speculated about

2334
02:44:44,222 --> 02:44:47,766
over the last 27 years
about whether or not we got along.

2335
02:44:47,934 --> 02:44:52,395
We got along fine.
We just disagreed a lot.

2336
02:44:52,563 --> 02:44:55,941
I was not in the trenches
with this particular band,

2337
02:44:56,108 --> 02:44:58,485
so I'd like to thank
my predecessor, Randy Meisner,

2338
02:44:58,653 --> 02:44:59,903
for being there.

2339
02:45:00,071 --> 02:45:03,949
I'm glad that Randy and Bernie
got recognized.

2340
02:45:04,116 --> 02:45:05,867
I think that's appropriate.

2341
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:09,496
Hey, how you doin'?

2342
02:45:09,664 --> 02:45:11,039
It's a good feeling.

2343
02:45:11,207 --> 02:45:14,376
Looks good on my resume.

2344
02:45:17,088 --> 02:45:20,382
I'd really like to thank Don and Glenn
for writing those songs.

2345
02:45:20,549 --> 02:45:22,217
Thank you, guys.

2346
02:45:22,385 --> 02:45:23,969
It makes my job real easy.

2347
02:45:24,136 --> 02:45:26,054
Thank you!

2348
02:45:27,974 --> 02:45:30,225
Charming outfit, Joe.

2349
02:45:31,269 --> 02:45:34,062
I'd like to, again, thank
Don Henley and Glenn Frey

2350
02:45:34,230 --> 02:45:35,730
for writing an incredible
body of work

2351
02:45:35,898 --> 02:45:40,026
that's propelled this band through
20-some-odd years' worth of life.

2352
02:45:40,194 --> 02:45:41,194
Thank you, guys.

2353
02:45:41,362 --> 02:45:44,322
When a kid first picks up
a guitar or a drumstick,

2354
02:45:44,490 --> 02:45:46,116
it's not really to be famous.

2355
02:45:46,284 --> 02:45:48,618
It's because that kid wants
to fit in somewhere

2356
02:45:48,786 --> 02:45:50,412
and he wants to be accepted,

2357
02:45:50,579 --> 02:45:53,498
and he wants to be
understood, even.

2358
02:45:53,666 --> 02:45:57,711
And so, I like to think
of this award

2359
02:45:57,878 --> 02:45:59,671
as something
that is acknowledging us

2360
02:45:59,839 --> 02:46:03,425
not for being famous,
but for doing the work.

2361
02:46:03,592 --> 02:46:05,051
And I appreciate all the work

2362
02:46:05,219 --> 02:46:07,178
that all these guys behind me
have done.

2363
02:46:07,346 --> 02:46:08,847
I want to thank Irving Azoff,

2364
02:46:09,015 --> 02:46:12,017
without whom
we wouldn't be here today.

2365
02:46:13,519 --> 02:46:16,855
As I've said before, he may be
Satan, but he's our Satan.

2366
02:46:18,858 --> 02:46:21,109
We're in a dog-eat-dog business.

2367
02:46:21,277 --> 02:46:23,403
Show me anybody
that's gonna be responsible

2368
02:46:23,571 --> 02:46:26,448
for guiding or managing
an artist's career

2369
02:46:26,615 --> 02:46:27,775
that's made too many friends,

2370
02:46:27,908 --> 02:46:30,285
and I'm gonna show you somebody
that's sold out their artist

2371
02:46:30,453 --> 02:46:32,162
and done a crappy job.

2372
02:46:32,330 --> 02:46:37,125
So, I was quite proud of Henley's
reference of what he said.

2373
02:46:37,293 --> 02:46:40,837
It was more or less, for me,
a validation of a job well done.

2374
02:46:41,047 --> 02:46:45,050
A lot of my job was trying to keep
the band from breaking up.

2375
02:46:45,217 --> 02:46:46,301
In the '70s,

2376
02:46:46,469 --> 02:46:48,803
we formed a corporation
called Eagles, Limited.

2377
02:46:48,971 --> 02:46:51,806
And that was all-for-one
and one-for-all.

2378
02:46:51,974 --> 02:46:54,351
Well, it wasn't
the three musketeers.

2379
02:46:54,518 --> 02:46:56,644
As our friend J.D. Souther
used to say,

2380
02:46:56,812 --> 02:46:59,522
"Time passes, things change."

2381
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:00,940
In talking with Irving

2382
02:47:01,108 --> 02:47:03,985
about putting the Eagles
back together in 1994,

2383
02:47:04,153 --> 02:47:05,987
I said, "Irving, I'm not gonna do it

2384
02:47:06,155 --> 02:47:08,740
unless Don and I make more money
than the other guys."

2385
02:47:10,242 --> 02:47:12,744
"We're the only guys who have
done anything career-wise

2386
02:47:12,912 --> 02:47:14,537
in the last 14 years.

2387
02:47:14,705 --> 02:47:17,832
We're the guys that have kept
the Eagles' name alive on radio,

2388
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,834
television, and in concert halls."

2389
02:47:20,002 --> 02:47:21,961
So we came up with a deal

2390
02:47:22,129 --> 02:47:24,923
that I was happy with,
and Don was happy with,

2391
02:47:25,091 --> 02:47:28,009
Timothy was happy with,
Joe was happy with,

2392
02:47:28,177 --> 02:47:29,928
and Don Felder was not happy with.

2393
02:47:30,096 --> 02:47:31,930
And I called
Felder's representative.

2394
02:47:32,098 --> 02:47:34,307
And I said, "Hello, Barry.
This is Glenn Frey.

2395
02:47:34,475 --> 02:47:37,727
I'm sorry you happen to represent
the only asshole in the band,

2396
02:47:37,895 --> 02:47:39,270
but let me tell you something.

2397
02:47:39,438 --> 02:47:42,732
You either sign this agreement
before the sun goes down today,

2398
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,859
or we're replacing Don Felder.

2399
02:47:45,027 --> 02:47:46,152
That's the final deal.

2400
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:49,239
He signs by sunset,
or he's out of the fucking band."

2401
02:47:49,407 --> 02:47:51,616
Hung up.

2402
02:47:51,784 --> 02:47:56,538
So, he signed the deal,
and we started out on the tour.

2403
02:47:56,705 --> 02:47:59,958
I didn't sense a great deal
of comaraderie.

2404
02:48:00,126 --> 02:48:01,501
You hardly saw anybody

2405
02:48:01,669 --> 02:48:05,130
if it wasn't walking on the plane
or walking onto the stage.

2406
02:48:05,297 --> 02:48:07,549
Everyone thought,
"Well, if we don't get together,

2407
02:48:07,716 --> 02:48:09,300
we won't have problems."

2408
02:48:09,468 --> 02:48:11,886
And I think instead of being able
to sit down and have a beer

2409
02:48:12,054 --> 02:48:15,807
and talk about stuff and renew
a relationship with everyone,

2410
02:48:15,975 --> 02:48:18,435
that independent isolation

2411
02:48:18,602 --> 02:48:23,148
really didn't add the comfort
necessary to make it work.

2412
02:48:23,315 --> 02:48:27,652
Don Felder was
never, ever satisfied,

2413
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:29,529
never, ever happy.

2414
02:48:31,824 --> 02:48:34,659
A rock band
is not a perfect democracy.

2415
02:48:34,827 --> 02:48:36,286
It's more like a sports team.

2416
02:48:36,454 --> 02:48:38,872
No one can do anything
without the other guys,

2417
02:48:39,039 --> 02:48:42,459
but everybody doesn't get to touch
the ball all the time.

2418
02:48:43,169 --> 02:48:44,711
Time went on, and time went on,

2419
02:48:44,879 --> 02:48:47,839
and Felder became
more and more unhappy.

2420
02:48:48,007 --> 02:48:50,467
Couldn't appreciate the amount
of money he was making,

2421
02:48:50,634 --> 02:48:54,471
more concerned about
how much money I was making.

2422
02:48:59,185 --> 02:49:01,603
If Don Felder really thought
about it,

2423
02:49:01,770 --> 02:49:04,814
it really was he wanted it to be
a "band" band

2424
02:49:04,982 --> 02:49:07,025
in the purest sense of the words,

2425
02:49:07,193 --> 02:49:09,073
you know, we're all gonna get
equal songwriting,

2426
02:49:09,236 --> 02:49:10,862
singing, expression stuff,

2427
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:13,406
and this was not a hippie commune.

2428
02:49:13,574 --> 02:49:15,116
You know, and everything for them

2429
02:49:15,284 --> 02:49:17,577
really goes back
to those two words... song power.

2430
02:49:19,705 --> 02:49:22,290
We finally made the decision

2431
02:49:22,458 --> 02:49:25,084
that we won't be working
with him anymore.

2432
02:49:25,252 --> 02:49:26,628
It just broke my heart.

2433
02:49:27,546 --> 02:49:30,006
It's not just playing with Joe.

2434
02:49:30,174 --> 02:49:32,592
I missed these guys.

2435
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:36,221
But I really missed the friendship
and the music.

2436
02:49:38,974 --> 02:49:40,475
Okay.

2437
02:49:40,643 --> 02:49:41,476
Strong.

2438
02:49:41,644 --> 02:49:43,353
Good. Good, good, good.
Good shot.

2439
02:49:43,521 --> 02:49:45,813
Glenn and I, when it comes time
to make band decisions,

2440
02:49:45,981 --> 02:49:47,774
usually stick together.

2441
02:49:47,942 --> 02:49:51,819
It's difficult for four or five people
to have an equal say.

2442
02:49:51,987 --> 02:49:55,114
Here we are 40 years later,
and we're doing okay.

2443
02:49:55,324 --> 02:49:58,910
We're one of the few bands
that can say that.

2444
02:49:59,078 --> 02:50:01,538
The novelty of the Eagles
being back together

2445
02:50:01,705 --> 02:50:03,289
and those few new songs
that we had

2446
02:50:03,457 --> 02:50:05,583
on the "Hell Freezes Over" album
is one thing.

2447
02:50:05,751 --> 02:50:08,378
But we needed to make a record.

2448
02:50:10,589 --> 02:50:13,508
Considering that we haven't made
a record in so long,

2449
02:50:13,676 --> 02:50:18,763
we spent a good two and a half years
making "Long Road Out of Eden."

2450
02:50:18,931 --> 02:50:22,100
We finally figured out that
we just needed to do what we do.

2451
02:50:22,268 --> 02:50:24,519
This really goes back
to the essence of what we do best,

2452
02:50:24,687 --> 02:50:26,062
which is singing and songwriting.

2453
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:28,064
A lot of harmony singing
on this album.

2454
02:50:39,868 --> 02:50:43,538
Big tragedies like that
make you think, as a parent,

2455
02:50:43,706 --> 02:50:45,790
what kind of world is coming up?

2456
02:50:45,958 --> 02:50:47,125
What's gonna happen next?

2457
02:50:47,293 --> 02:50:49,669
What's the world gonna be like
when my kids are grown?

2458
02:50:51,839 --> 02:50:55,633
After September 11th,
our immediate visceral reaction,

2459
02:50:55,801 --> 02:50:58,720
our gut reaction,
resulted in "Hole in the World."

2460
02:51:07,104 --> 02:51:08,479
The Eagles have written and sung

2461
02:51:08,647 --> 02:51:10,356
plenty of love songs
over the years,

2462
02:51:10,524 --> 02:51:11,983
but we've also written and sung

2463
02:51:12,151 --> 02:51:15,445
songs that have to do with
what's going on in the wider world.

2464
02:51:15,613 --> 02:51:17,822
We've never shied away
from social commentary.

2465
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:19,741
We think it's part
of a rich tradition

2466
02:51:19,908 --> 02:51:21,993
that dates all the way
back to medieval times.

2467
02:51:22,161 --> 02:51:24,871
And so we still engage in it.

2468
02:51:47,519 --> 02:51:49,479
The writings and the ideas

2469
02:51:49,647 --> 02:51:52,148
of Henry David Thoreau
and Ralph Waldo Emerson

2470
02:51:52,316 --> 02:51:53,524
had a huge impact on me.

2471
02:51:53,692 --> 02:51:56,611
They got me through
some very difficult times in my life,

2472
02:51:56,779 --> 02:51:59,155
one being when my father
was stricken with heart disease,

2473
02:51:59,323 --> 02:52:03,242
and provided a lot
of spiritual support for me.

2474
02:52:03,410 --> 02:52:04,661
When I found out in 1980

2475
02:52:04,828 --> 02:52:07,330
that part of Walden
was going to be destroyed

2476
02:52:07,498 --> 02:52:08,831
by commercial development,

2477
02:52:08,999 --> 02:52:12,794
I decided that was something
I needed to help fight.

2478
02:52:12,961 --> 02:52:16,255
So I ended up founding
the Walden Woods Project.

2479
02:52:16,423 --> 02:52:20,510
And we are in our 27th year now,
and we've accomplished a great deal.

2480
02:52:20,678 --> 02:52:23,346
It's been one of the most rewarding
things that I've ever done.

2481
02:52:33,899 --> 02:52:36,401
The lyrics to that song
were originally a poem

2482
02:52:36,568 --> 02:52:39,862
written by a great American poet
named John Hollander.

2483
02:52:56,755 --> 02:52:59,674
Don had this title,
"Long Road Out of Eden."

2484
02:52:59,842 --> 02:53:02,760
Timothy goes over,
and he picks up an acoustic guitar.

2485
02:53:02,928 --> 02:53:04,128
And I go over to the keyboards

2486
02:53:04,221 --> 02:53:07,974
and Joe grabs a guitar
and Don goes on the drums.

2487
02:53:08,142 --> 02:53:11,102
And we start making up
this sort of musical story

2488
02:53:11,270 --> 02:53:13,271
called "Long Road Out of Eden,"

2489
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:16,190
a story of, really, the war in Iraq.

2490
02:53:26,618 --> 02:53:28,453
And it was, like, the last resort.

2491
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:33,040
It was another opus,
another David Lean movie.

2492
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:43,134
We finally got through,

2493
02:53:43,302 --> 02:53:45,303
and we finally made
"Long Road Out of Eden."

2494
02:53:45,471 --> 02:53:47,430
And we didn't give it
to a record company.

2495
02:53:47,598 --> 02:53:49,390
We made a deal with Walmart.

2496
02:53:49,558 --> 02:53:53,895
This was the first major artist
to do a direct-to-retail release

2497
02:53:54,062 --> 02:53:56,105
and bypass
the major record companies.

2498
02:53:56,273 --> 02:53:57,815
It was phenomenally successful.

2499
02:53:57,983 --> 02:53:59,525
The album entered at number one.

2500
02:53:59,693 --> 02:54:01,903
It gave, I think,
the whole industry hope

2501
02:54:02,070 --> 02:54:05,323
that it could find a new
and different way to reach its fans.

2502
02:54:05,491 --> 02:54:07,052
They're becoming
a much greener company,

2503
02:54:07,117 --> 02:54:08,409
and that was important to me.

2504
02:54:08,577 --> 02:54:11,329
And the other good thing was that
our fans got 20 songs for 12 bucks.

2505
02:54:11,497 --> 02:54:12,830
It was basically a double album,

2506
02:54:12,998 --> 02:54:14,916
and they weren't charged double
for it.

2507
02:54:18,170 --> 02:54:20,046
Don said,
"I got a title for a song...

2508
02:54:20,214 --> 02:54:22,006
'Busy Being Fabulous."'

2509
02:54:22,174 --> 02:54:24,258
And I thought,
"What a great title."

2510
02:54:31,683 --> 02:54:32,767
And then Don wrote,

2511
02:54:32,935 --> 02:54:35,216
"'Don't wait up for me tonight, '
that was all she wrote."

2512
02:54:41,026 --> 02:54:42,860
And then we were off on the story.

2513
02:54:54,331 --> 02:54:55,832
"Busy Being Fabulous,"

2514
02:54:55,999 --> 02:54:58,584
Don and Glenn had gotten it
to a certain state,

2515
02:54:58,752 --> 02:55:01,087
and I came up with some stuff
for the bridge

2516
02:55:01,255 --> 02:55:03,047
and tweaked what already existed.

2517
02:55:03,215 --> 02:55:05,967
I was very involved
in the "Long Road" record.

2518
02:55:06,134 --> 02:55:08,886
I've always been a lot happier
getting into the entire project,

2519
02:55:09,054 --> 02:55:11,472
arranging stuff, producing the stuff,
co-writing the stuff.

2520
02:55:12,349 --> 02:55:16,018
Like, "Waiting in the Weeds"
and "Business As Usual"

2521
02:55:16,186 --> 02:55:18,980
were co-writes with Don.

2522
02:55:19,147 --> 02:55:23,651
Getting Steuart Smith in the band
was a real shot in the arm.

2523
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:25,862
He's such a terrific musician.

2524
02:55:32,244 --> 02:55:33,411
It's a great solo.

2525
02:55:33,579 --> 02:55:35,454
It's like stepping
into a space suit.

2526
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:40,334
It is strange
to be playing that song.

2527
02:55:40,586 --> 02:55:44,714
The reaction is terrific,
and you bask in that excitement.

2528
02:55:44,882 --> 02:55:46,507
But I didn't write it.

2529
02:55:52,431 --> 02:55:55,141
I'm one part hired gun,
but also one part collaborator.

2530
02:55:55,309 --> 02:55:56,767
I'm one of the guitar players.

2531
02:55:57,644 --> 02:56:00,521
But I'm not an Eagle.

2532
02:56:00,689 --> 02:56:02,356
I don't know what it's like
to be one of those guys.

2533
02:56:02,524 --> 02:56:04,442
...3, 4.

2534
02:56:06,987 --> 02:56:09,488
My kids were looking
on the Internet,

2535
02:56:09,656 --> 02:56:13,910
and they found this show
that the Eagles had done in 1974.

2536
02:56:19,666 --> 02:56:21,292
I was in my office watching TV,

2537
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:23,836
and my kids come in and say,
"Hey, Dad, come here.

2538
02:56:24,004 --> 02:56:25,630
You got to take a look
at your hair."

2539
02:56:25,797 --> 02:56:28,090
And one of the songs
was "How Long."

2540
02:56:44,566 --> 02:56:46,651
"How Long" was
from my first solo album.

2541
02:56:46,818 --> 02:56:49,028
They found that,
'cause Cindy saw it on YouTube

2542
02:56:49,196 --> 02:56:50,655
and said, "Glenn, what's this?"

2543
02:56:50,822 --> 02:56:52,865
And he said,
"Oh, it's a song of J.D.'s."

2544
02:56:53,033 --> 02:56:55,201
She said,
"Well, you didn't cut it, did you?"

2545
02:57:07,464 --> 02:57:11,467
J.D. Wanted it on his solo album,
so we never recorded it.

2546
02:57:11,635 --> 02:57:14,136
My wife said, "Hey, that sounds
like a hit Eagles song."

2547
02:57:47,629 --> 02:57:49,338
They are the American band.

2548
02:57:49,506 --> 02:57:53,050
Yeah, they pretty much encompassed
the '70s, didn't they?

2549
02:57:53,218 --> 02:57:54,552
And took it all in.

2550
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:57,722
That's a long time to still have
a musical impact,

2551
02:57:57,889 --> 02:58:02,226
and it's due
to this incredibly crisp, tight,

2552
02:58:02,394 --> 02:58:04,562
extraordinarily good
record-making band

2553
02:58:04,730 --> 02:58:06,689
and the presence of good songs.

2554
02:58:06,857 --> 02:58:09,150
But it's also now taken on
this other thing, too,

2555
02:58:09,317 --> 02:58:13,237
where it's everybody through the band
wants to remember a '70s

2556
02:58:13,405 --> 02:58:15,239
that they may
or may not have had.

2557
02:58:40,849 --> 02:58:43,267
This band could go play stadiums
all over the country,

2558
02:58:43,435 --> 02:58:47,646
and people know these songs
so intimately.

2559
02:58:52,861 --> 02:58:54,445
They last.

2560
02:58:54,613 --> 02:58:55,988
The songs last.

2561
02:58:57,866 --> 02:59:00,451
I have one small plaque on my wall.

2562
02:59:00,619 --> 02:59:02,244
It says, "Presented to the Eagles

2563
02:59:02,412 --> 02:59:06,123
to commemorate the best-selling
album of the 20th century

2564
02:59:06,291 --> 02:59:09,418
with sales in excess
of 26 million units."

2565
02:59:09,628 --> 02:59:13,881
That century's gone,
so nobody's gonna top that.

2566
02:59:16,218 --> 02:59:18,219
What's it like to be an Eagle now?

2567
02:59:18,386 --> 02:59:19,804
It's just part of my life.

2568
02:59:19,971 --> 02:59:20,805
I do normal things.

2569
02:59:20,972 --> 02:59:22,681
I go to the market,

2570
02:59:22,849 --> 02:59:25,893
and once in a while,
somebody comes up to me.

2571
02:59:26,061 --> 02:59:28,270
I don't walk around being an Eagle.

2572
02:59:28,438 --> 02:59:31,232
I'm an Eagle when it's time
for me to be.

2573
02:59:31,441 --> 02:59:34,860
I made sure the dishes were done
before you guys came today.

2574
02:59:35,028 --> 02:59:36,862
You know?

2575
03:00:36,673 --> 03:00:39,884
I love everybody in the band
like a brother.

2576
03:00:40,051 --> 03:00:45,472
To be part of a real band,

2577
03:00:45,640 --> 03:00:46,724
a real band,

2578
03:00:46,892 --> 03:00:52,605
is something that not all musicians
get to do in their life.

2579
03:00:52,772 --> 03:00:58,819
And I'm real lucky to have
that chapter in my book.

2580
03:01:05,160 --> 03:01:07,494
Rock 'n' roll saved my life.

2581
03:01:07,662 --> 03:01:10,623
It changed my life tremendously.

2582
03:01:10,790 --> 03:01:15,878
And as Mick Jagger
so famously and eloquently said,

2583
03:01:16,046 --> 03:01:19,006
"It's only rock 'n' roll,
but I like it."

2584
03:01:19,174 --> 03:01:20,466
I think that one of the reasons

2585
03:01:20,634 --> 03:01:22,218
that Glenn and I
wanted to write songs

2586
03:01:22,385 --> 03:01:24,929
is because rock 'n' roll music
got us through junior high

2587
03:01:25,096 --> 03:01:26,017
and through high school

2588
03:01:26,223 --> 03:01:28,098
and those difficult times

2589
03:01:28,266 --> 03:01:29,516
when you're searching
for your identity

2590
03:01:29,684 --> 03:01:33,354
and wondering who the heck you are,
trying to get girls to notice you,

2591
03:01:33,521 --> 03:01:35,001
and wondering
why the football players

2592
03:01:35,106 --> 03:01:37,233
are doing so much better
than you are.

2593
03:01:37,817 --> 03:01:39,193
At the end of the day,

2594
03:01:39,361 --> 03:01:43,239
it was and still is
about the music.

2595
03:01:48,745 --> 03:01:51,622
I regret that I didn't handle
some of the adversity

2596
03:01:51,790 --> 03:01:54,541
that the Eagles faced
in the late '70s better.

2597
03:01:54,709 --> 03:01:56,085
Fortunately, for me,

2598
03:01:56,253 --> 03:01:59,046
I've had another chance
to be the leader of the Eagles,

2599
03:01:59,214 --> 03:02:02,466
another chance
to be Don's partner

2600
03:02:02,634 --> 03:02:05,844
and do this work again
and play this music.

2601
03:02:06,012 --> 03:02:09,515
And in this second run,
I think I've done a pretty good job

2602
03:02:09,683 --> 03:02:13,769
of keeping the peace
and keep the band together,

2603
03:02:13,937 --> 03:02:15,729
keep everybody happy.

2604
03:02:15,897 --> 03:02:19,692
So here we are, still doing it.

2605
03:02:36,501 --> 03:02:38,669
Thank you.

2606
03:02:44,050 --> 03:02:46,302
That's it! That's it!

2607
03:02:48,179 --> 03:02:50,139
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

2608
03:02:51,224 --> 03:02:53,475
We wanted longevity.

2609
03:02:53,643 --> 03:02:56,020
It wasn't a hobby for us.
It wasn't a game.

2610
03:02:56,187 --> 03:02:58,147
It wasn't a pleasant diversion.

2611
03:02:58,315 --> 03:03:00,232
It was a life.

2612
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:02,318
It was a calling.
It was a career.

2613
03:03:02,485 --> 03:03:03,902
It was worth it.

2614
03:03:08,074 --> 03:03:10,534
We went to China last year.

2615
03:03:10,702 --> 03:03:13,620
We're still breaking new ground
40 years later.

2616
03:03:15,290 --> 03:03:16,373
Back in the late '70s,

2617
03:03:16,541 --> 03:03:19,501
Neil Young sang a song
about the emerging punk ethic.

2618
03:03:19,669 --> 03:03:21,503
And the pivotal line
in that song was:

2619
03:03:21,671 --> 03:03:23,881
"It's better to burn out
than it is to rust."

2620
03:03:24,049 --> 03:03:26,050
And I'm not sure
that even Neil, himself,

2621
03:03:26,217 --> 03:03:27,551
subscribed to that sentiment,

2622
03:03:27,719 --> 03:03:29,470
but I don't see rust as a bad thing.

2623
03:03:29,637 --> 03:03:32,723
I have an old 1962
John Deere tractor

2624
03:03:32,891 --> 03:03:36,518
that's covered with rust,
but it runs like a top.

2625
03:03:36,686 --> 03:03:39,188
You know, the inner workings
are just fine.

2626
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:56,038
To me, that rust symbolizes
all the miles driven

2627
03:03:56,206 --> 03:04:01,001
and all the good work done
and all the experiences gained.

2628
03:04:22,107 --> 03:04:25,192
From where I sit,
the rust looks pretty good.

2629
03:05:04,232 --> 03:05:05,732
When somebody is around 40 years,

2630
03:05:05,900 --> 03:05:08,569
it means they've got something,
something that people want.

2631
03:05:08,736 --> 03:05:09,445
And the Eagles have that.

2632
03:05:09,612 --> 03:05:12,322
To me, the Eagles
really expressed a mood.

2633
03:05:12,490 --> 03:05:14,533
California was the place of dreams.

2634
03:05:14,701 --> 03:05:17,077
It was a time
of limitless possibilities.

2635
03:05:17,245 --> 03:05:20,289
I think they were a defining moment

2636
03:05:20,457 --> 03:05:22,249
in the rock-'n'-roll world
that I love.

2637
03:05:22,417 --> 03:05:24,877
You couldn't really love
the Eagles music

2638
03:05:25,044 --> 03:05:27,629
and be an Eagles fan
and actually know them

2639
03:05:27,797 --> 03:05:29,506
and not aspire
to greatness yourself.

2640
03:05:29,674 --> 03:05:31,341
I'm not really into legacies.

2641
03:05:31,509 --> 03:05:33,260
People talk to me,
"What's your legacy?"

2642
03:05:33,428 --> 03:05:34,720
I'm here now.

2643
03:05:34,888 --> 03:05:37,598
I'm doing what I want to do,

2644
03:05:37,765 --> 03:05:39,600
and I'm trying to make stuff happen.

2645
03:05:39,767 --> 03:05:41,185
I see the Eagles in the same way.

2646
03:05:41,352 --> 03:05:42,936
They're not in the '70s.

2647
03:05:43,104 --> 03:05:46,482
They're in 2012 and 2013.

2648
03:05:46,649 --> 03:05:50,110
And whatever they're doing now
artistically, that's what's important.
