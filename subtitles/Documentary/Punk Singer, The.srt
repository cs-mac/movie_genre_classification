performing a miracle.

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,940
Tin Man, please say hello to our viewers.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Dashing through the snow

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,680
In a one-horse open sleigh

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Shall we go or not?

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,380
Marry Christmas, everyone!

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,080
Merry Christmas to you, too!

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,780
For Tin Man...

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,480
who is looking for his fourth successive victory,

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,640
one of the panelists prepared a little gift for him.

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,110
As you know, Christmas is all about sharing.

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,540
So here, we have Gianna Jun of King of Mask Singer.

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,210
- He is Gianna Jun... - Officially,

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,680
- of King of Mask Singer. - he is.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,810
His hair is shinier than...

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,310
- than Gianna Jun's. - I agree.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,440

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,640
It is a Christmas gift for Tin Man.

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
(Tin Man)

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,580
(I really like you)

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,740
(Wan Kyu sang the song to Seung Woo before.)

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,910

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,510

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,640
(A 43-year-old man acts charming for the King of Mask Singer.)

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,110
- That was a nice gift. - He is cuter than Gianna Jun.

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,410
(She bursts into laughter.)

55
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,640
He is the youngest of his family.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,950
(Shy)

57
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,110
The mysterious music show, King of Mask Singer.

58
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,640
Let's begin the matches in earnest.

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,610
Who will be the King of Mask Singer...

60
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,510
for the last episode of 2016...

61
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,510
and the beginning of 2017?

62
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,110
The first step to become the 46th King of Mask Singer.

63
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,180
Let's begin...

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,280
the first match of Round One.

65
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,440
(King of Mask Singer)

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,640
The first match of Round One.

67
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,440
A voice of sharing on the street.

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,610
We Are the Salvation Army.

69
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,280
(We Are the Salvation Army)

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
(Winter is the time...)

71
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,710
(to put sharing into action.)

72
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
(I will warm your heart.)

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,340
(He is hot.)

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,510
Is he in the army? He must be a man.

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,010
I think he'll be quite old.

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,440
His opponent is...

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,410
a woman with a clear voice like white snow.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,110
Our Town Is in Snow District,

79
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,910
White City.

80
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,440
(Our Town Is in Snow District, White City)

81
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,540
(Do you want to know where our town is?)

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,780
(Any place where we have snow is our town.)

83
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,710
(Hello, everyone?)

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,240
(Joy to the world, Our Town has come!)

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,710
(We have two masked singers for the winter.)

86
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,940
(What song did they prepare for Christmas?)

87
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:19,250
("Grass Leaf Love" by Choi Sung Soo)

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,710
- Is it "Grass Leaf Love"? - That's right.

89
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,310
I told you. He's old.

90
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,010
("Grass Leaf Love" is a refreshing song released in 1980s.)

91
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,510
(What will the duet song sound like?)

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,640
(He has a fine voice.)

93
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,110
(He has a low and deep voice.)

94
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,410
(Salvation Army's voice sounds sweet and gentle.)

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,510
(Surprised)

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,280
(Our Town's voice is...)

97
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,410
(as refreshing and clear as the song.)

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,180
(Between the low-pitch voice and the high-pitch falsetto,)

99
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,580
(Our Town's voice lovably rings in people's ears.)

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,540
(Dew)

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,540
(I'm sunshine)

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
(Sunshine)

103
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,180
(Two people with different singing styles are...)

104
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,540
(making the perfect harmony.)

105
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,880
(That's so sweet.)

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,710
(You are)

107
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
(You are)

108
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,780
(My grass leaf love)

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,980
(I love you)

110
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,880
(I love you, too.)

111
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,580
(Salvation Army's deep voice and Our Town's clear voice)

112
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,410
(Who could they be?)

113
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,180
(Lively)

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,440
Her voice is so refreshing.

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,980
(Our Town's refreshing charm...)

116
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,610
(warms people's hearts like spring.)

117
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,380
(Salvation Army's unique voice...)

118
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,610
(has its own resonance.)

119
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,210
(I love you)

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,040
(Even her high-pitched voice sounds refreshing.)

121
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,210
(Great vibratos)

122
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm sure she's a singer.

123
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,480
(They all feel happy.)

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,510
(It is a sweet confession of love.)

125
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,410
(Grass leaf love)

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
(A heartwarming and refreshing melody)

127
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,640
(Their performance turned the cold winter into a warm Christmas day.)

128
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,510
(Love is in the air.)

129
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
(It is fresh.)

130
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,480
That was very refreshing.

131
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,510
(Satisfied)

132
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,280
The first match of Round One is over.

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,210
It was the first match of Round One.

134
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,740
Kai seemed to enjoy the song very much.

135
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,580
He even danced to the song.

136
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,640
(Seong Ju talks to Kai.)

137
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,940
Hello, I'm Kai.

138
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,840
The song reminded me of a scene.

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,240
They looked like a couple pounding steamed rice into cake.

140
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
(They were perfect for each other.)

141
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,280
- With a rice-cake mallet? - The husband balanced the song...

142
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,210
with his deep voice as if he was pounding steamed rice,

143
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,710
while the wife made rice cakes from the dough...

144
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,080
with her clear and beautiful voice.

145
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,940
It was a perfect harmony...

146
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,740
that reminded me of soft, pretty, and delicious rice cakes.

147
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,310
- That's how I felt. - I see.

148
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,510
I think he has a talent for music.

149
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,380
- But I don't think he is a singer. - I see.

150
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,940
- He's not a singer? - No.

151
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,080
Meanwhile, Our Town has...

152
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,310
great vocal techniques to use falsetto and chest voices freely.

153
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,980
But I think...

154
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,010
she is an actress who sings very well.

155
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,240
- An actress? - Yes.

156
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,040
- That's my guess. - Okay.

157
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,380
Then we will hear Young Seok's opinion about the duet performance.

158
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,080
Salvation Army has an attractive voice.

159
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,380
- Does he? - Yes.

160
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,780
His voice is as heavy as a piggy bank full of coins.

161
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,880
It's so full that you won't be able to hear the sound of coins jingling.

162
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,240
- If we heard him reading his lines, - Yes.

163
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
we'd have noticed his voice immediately.

164
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,610
- Do you think he is an actor? - Yes, I think he is an actor.

165
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,710
- How old do you think he is? - He's about 39 years old.

166
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,640
39 years old? That's very specific.

167
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,110
I could tell Salvation Army is...

168
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,110
in his late 30s.

169
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,780
Salvation Army is in his late 30s.

170
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,080
- Or he might be in his 40s. - He might be in his 40s.

171
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
I think both of them are singers.

172
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,440
- Both of them? - Yes.

173
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,980
- Is Salvation Army a singer? - Yes.

174
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,280
What if he loses?

175
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,240
He may be an actor slash singer...

176
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,040
or something slash singer.

177
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,180
Whatever his real job is, he may also be a singer.

178
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,580
- He has his original job. - He probably sings at night.

179
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,310
- At night? - I think...

180
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,410
he sings in nightclubs or something.

181
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,610
- In nightclubs? - Yes.

182
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,240
I saw him wagging his legs...

183
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,850
on tiptoes while singing.

184
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,010
- Like this? - That's right.

185
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,540
That's what singers in nightclubs do.

186
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,540
- Singers in nightclubs? - Yes.

187
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,310
In fact, he distorted his voice.

188
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,380
- It was not his real voice. - I agree.

189
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,740
He was afraid of being caught...

190
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,110
with his real voice.

191
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,910
He needs a lot of strength to distort his voice...

192
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,640
by making it deep.

193
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,350
His voice is very deep by nature.

194
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,810
Also, take a look at his body. He has an athletic body.

195
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,410
That means he's strong enough...

196
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,710
to sing with a different voice.

197
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,210
- Really? - Otherwise, he can't do that.

198
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,180
We have...

199
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,110
Kim Hyun Jung here.

200
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,180
(What does she think about their identities?)

201
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,980
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

202
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,410
When I heard Salvation Army sing,

203
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,040
it sounded like talking rather than singing.

204
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,040
So I thought he was more like an actor in a historical drama...

205
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,840
than a singer.

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,280
She narrowed it down to an actor in a historical drama.

207
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,610
Meanwhile I noticed something about Our Town.

208
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,680
Compared to the size of her body, the outfit she is wearing...

209
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,110
seems too big.

210
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,680
- It's very spacious for her body. - Is it?

211
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,980
Most people would attempt to look slimmer.

212
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,110
Is she an idol singer?

213
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,910
I judge her to be an idol singer who recently learned...

214
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,710
how to sing professionally,

215
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,440
judging from the nervousness in her voice.

216
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,640
The panelists have many opinions about these two masked singers.

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,340
That's why they will show us their dancing skills.

218
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
(Will they dance?)

219
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,510
The dance Our Town prepared...

220
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,580
are the highlights of Kim Hyun Jung's hit songs.

221
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,840
She will show her dance skills...

222
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,640
in front of the original singer. Music, please.

223
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,340
(Kim Hyun Jung's Hit Songs Dance)

224
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,240
("Breakup with Her")

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,580
(Stretching)

226
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,310
- She is young. - There you go.

227
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,210
She is young.

228
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,680
(She is exactly like Hyun Jung 18 years ago.)

229
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,710
- She is bringing back memories. - She's young.

230
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
(It's "Bruise".)

231
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,840
"Turn everything back."

232
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,940
(Shaking her body)

233
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,610
(Dancing)

234
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,110
(Powerful)

235
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,810
That's right.

236
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
She is doing well.

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,510
(She is good.)

238
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,680
Her dance moves are on point.

239
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,810
She didn't make a single mistake.

240
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
(Stiff)

241
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,880
- She is old. - She seems old.

242
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,540
She is in her 30s or 40s.

243
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,180
She might be in her 40s.

244
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,680
(Pointing)

245
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,540
(Cute)

246
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,640
All right. Let's end it here.

247
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,080
She danced very well.

248
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
(Analyzing)

249
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,340
The dance confirmed my initial thought.

250
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,610
- Really? - Yes.

251
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,740
- She has to be an idol singer. - You are certain.

252
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,040
Yes. She couldn't dance perfectly due to the mask she is wearing.

253
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,180
If she shows us the dance of her own song,

254
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,540
I am sure we will see that she is a great dancer.

255
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,080
Let's see what the original dance is like.

256
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,910
Please show us the original dance.

257
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,540
Music, please.

258
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,910
(Expectant)

259
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,340
"Turn everything back."

260
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,080
(This is the original dance.)

261
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,110
You need to drag out the movement.

262
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,110
(Powerful)

263
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,810
That's right.

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,310
(Swaying)

265
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,040
(Turning)

266
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
(Here it comes.)

267
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,680
(It's a body roll with 18 years of experience.)

268
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,110
(His eyes widen.)

269
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,310
(Sexy)

270
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,510
(Their dance shows different charms.)

271
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
(Pointing)

272
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
(Charismatic)

273
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,840
(This is the class of the original singer.)

274
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,980
(Kim Hyun Jung is the best.)

275
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,480
The original singer is on a different level.

276
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,540
The original singer is on a different level.

277
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,780
There was a big difference.

278
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
It was very different.

279
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,580
- There was a big difference. - Our Town must be much younger...

280
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,780
- than Hyun Jung. - Thank you.

281
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,480
Compared to Hyun Jung's, her dance looked very awkward.

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,280
Our panelists think he is a singer with a different profession...

283
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,080
who used to sing at nightclubs.

284
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,710
Salvation Army will show us his specialty.

285
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,280
He said he is very good at imitating action.

286
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,940
He will first imitate how Yoon Seok takes off his clothes at home.

287
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,480
That will be interesting.

288
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,210
Let's take a look. Show us your impression.

289
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,040
Yoon Seok arrives home. He begins to take off his clothes.

290
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,280
Yoon Seok took off his clothes.

291
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
He is taking off his clothes again.

292
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,610
(He hangs them neatly.)

293
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,080
He hung them up.

294
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Okay.

295
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680
(He takes off more clothes.)

296
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,810
He must have worn a lot of clothes.

297
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,210
He is taking off more clothes.

298
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,340
- He was wearing a lot of clothes. - I don't know why this is funny.

299
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,040
- He is good at this. - He is, right?

300
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,010
- I think he is a comedian. - A comedian?

301
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,810
He is taking off his clothes again.

302
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,810
- It's "So I went". - Heo Kyung Hwan.

303
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,480
- "So I went". - It's the same gesture.

304
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,010
"So I went".

305
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,010
- "So I went". - That's right.

306
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,240
- "So I went". - It's the same gesture.

307
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,610
- You can't fool us. - "So I went".

308
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,040
- You can't fool us. - I see.

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,480
The gestures come out.

310
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,780
- Look at that. - "So I went".

311
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,880
This time,

312
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,310
he will imitate how Gu Ra shaves.

313
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,310
It makes sense.

314
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,340
- An actor wouldn't imitate me. - He will imitate how Gu Ra shaves.

315
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,340
(Whirring)

316
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,310
He is starting at the chin. Oh, look at the chin.

317
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
(Laughing)

318
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,840
He is a comedian.

319
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,410
He is a comedian.

320
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,110
He is a comedian.

321
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,810
- It's Heo Kyung Hwan. - It has to be Heo Kyung Hwan.

322
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,680
He is very good at trifles like that.

323
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Come on, Kyung Hwan.

324
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,910
They are certain he is Heo Kyung Hwan.

325
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,110
He has a nice body, too. He must be Heo Kyung Hwan.

326
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,980
Lastly, he will imitate how Park Wan Kyu runs in a hurry...

327
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,580
after receiving a call...

328
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
while he was eating instant noodles.

329
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,510
Wan Kyu is eating instant noodles.

330
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,780
He turned on the stove.

331
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,710
He is cooking instant noodles.

332
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,080
He adds seasoning and stirs.

333
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,640
The instant noodles are done, and he begins to eat.

334
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,740
(He is putting his hair to the other side.)

335
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
He begins to eat.

336
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,040
(Laughing)

337
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,440
(My hair must be treasured.)

338
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,610
He is having trouble because of his hair.

339
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,680
He needs to eat carefully.

340
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
(Careful)

341
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,680
He is Heo Kyung Hwan.

342
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,240
He got a call. They want him to come out.

343
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,740
- He needs to hurry up. - Look at the way he is running.

344
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,480
He is Heo Kyung Hwan.

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,010
- He is Heo Kyung Hwan. - He is tying his hair.

346
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,080
He is Heo Kyung Hwan.

347
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,310
- He is tying his hair. - He is Heo Kyung Hwan.

348
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,110
- I think he is Heo Kyung Hwan. - He needs to tie his hair.

349
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,940
All right.

350
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,680
Let's end it here.

351
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,910
While Salvation Army reminds me of Heo Kyung Hwan,

352
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,110
he could be Yoo Sae Yoon.

353
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,340
(He is always cheerful and quick-witted.)

354
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,480
(He is a comedian through and through.)

355
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,980
- He could be Yoo Sae Yoon. - Yoo Sae Yoon.

356
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,880
All right. Now, I will announce...

357
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
the result of the first match of Round One.

358
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,840
You will be surprised by the result.

359
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,980
You will be surprised by the result.

360
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,040
(Surprised)

361
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,210
Don't tease Salvation Army.

362
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,910
- Why would you tease him? - Okay.

363
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,480
Salvation Army had a nice voice,

364
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,740
and Our Town had a voice that was as pure as white snow.

365
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,780
I'll now reveal the winner...

366
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,740
who will move on to Round Two.

367
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,810
(With his deep voice,)

368
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,380
(Salvation Army showed power and sentimentality.)

369
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,010
(With her clear and fresh voice,)

370
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,940
(Our Town showed purity of a dewdrop.)

371
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,580
Who is the winner who will move on to Round Two?

372
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,410
The winner is...

373
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,010
(The winner is...)

374
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,810
Salvation Army! Salvation Army!

375
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,480
Our Town!

376
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
(Will the winner be Our Town?)

377
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,440
(Who will become the winner and make an appearance in 2017?)

378
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,640
Who is the first winner...

379
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,550
who will move on to Round Two? Please show the result.

380
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,810
The winner is...

381
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,580
Our Town.

382
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,110
(Our Town moved on to Round Two.)

383
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,780
(We will see Our Town next year as well.)

384
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,680
(The panelists are divided in their reactions.)

385
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,980
What was the final score?

386
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,740
Our Town won.

387
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,580
The final score was 69 to 30.

388
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,510
You received a surprisingly large amount of votes.

389
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,910
Our Town won.

390
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,680
Please return to your waiting room and prepare for the next round.

391
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
Please give her a big hand.

392
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,780
(The shocking identity of Salvation Army will be revealed.)

393
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,380
(My goodness.)

394
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,910
My legs went weak.

395
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,880
I am so nervous.

396
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
Please look forward to my performance in Round Two.

397
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,410
It seems like Salvation Army...

398
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,840
is devastated.

399
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,010
I prepared four songs.

400
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,880
- Did you prepare four songs? - Yes.

401
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
You even prepared an encore song.

402
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,240
I will sing the two remaining songs at a different program.

403
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,510
He is greatly devastated.

404
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,240
Who could Salvation Army be?

405
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
We will reveal his identity with a solo performance...

406
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,680
prepared for Round Two. Please give him a big hand.

407
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,510
(He has natural talent in singing.)

408
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,880
(His voice is weighty like a full piggy bank.)

409
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,340
(He has a unique tone of voice.)

410
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,280
(He is a singer with an additional profession.)

411
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,580
(Is he Heo Kyung Hwan, the comedian?)

412
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,780
(Is he Yoo Sae Yoon, the comedian?)

413
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,380
(He showed an impressive sense of humor.)

414
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,780
(Who could Salvation Army be?)

415
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:30,980
("Last Promise" by Kim Jung Min)

416
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
I know this song.

417
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,840
(The intro of this hit song made people's hearts flutter in the 90s.)

418
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,440
(Salvation Army's voice sounds familiar.)

419
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:59,240
(He is no longer trying to conceal his voice.)

420
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,840
(Everyone can tell who he is.)

421
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,810
(Salvation Army's performance is different from the duet.)

422
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,610
(He has a charming baritone.)

423
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
(Come back to me)

424
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,110
(We promised to stay together forever)

425
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,410
(His emotions go well with rock ballad.)

426
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,180
(Salvation Army sings a sad love song with all his heart.)

427
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,480
Now, Salvation Army, please take off your mask...

428
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,880
and reveal your face.

429
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,580
(Screaming)

430
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,810
He is...

431
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,980
Who are you? Who is he?

432
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,580
I think it's him.

433
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,110
That's strange.

434
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,880
(Who are you?)

435
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
He is...

436
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,740
He is...

437
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,740
Heo Kyung Hwan, a comedian with 11 years of experience.

438
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,410
(It was Kyung Hwan.)

439
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,180
(We knew it.)

440
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,010
(They recognized Kyung Hwan's familiar voice.)

441
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,410
(It's good to see you, Kyung Hwan.)

442
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,480
(Kyung Hwan looks more serious than ever.)

443
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,940
(He's the best.)

444
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,280
(He has a wild but soft voice.)

445
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,910
(It makes you concentrate on his singing.)

446
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,540
(He dances frivolously.)

447
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,010
(He imitates Kim Jung Min's voice.)

448
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,440
(It's a delightful stage where...)

449
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,940
(you can hear both Jung Min and Kyung Hwan's voice.)

450
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,710
(He finishes off with motioning Wan Kyu's trademark hair tying.)

451
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,210
(Laughing)

452
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,910
("Last Promise" by Kyung Hwan was a great performance to enjoy.)

453
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,880
That was great.

454
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,810
(You're the best.)

455
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,680
When he was singing, I didn't know.

456
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,210
He changed his voice. You couldn't have known.

457
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,680
You found out who I was too soon.

458
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,010
All right. Salvation Army was the handsome comedian,

459
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,980
Heo Kyung Hwan.

460
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,510
Please say hello to the viewers.

461
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,980
Hello. I'm Heo Kyung Hwan, a singer and comedian. Good to see you.

462
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,680
(He debuted as a comedian in 2007.)

463
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,810
("This is what I'm talking about.")

464
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,310
("No, no. You can't do that.")

465
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,980
("If you want to know, give me 50 cents.")

466
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,040
If you want to know, give me 50 cents.

467
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,380
(He has so many catchphrases.)

468
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,180
(He also released many songs like "Ing" "NAMJA" and "Precious Girl".)

469
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,840
(He's a famous comedian who is also a singer.)

470
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,810
(With his witty words...)

471
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,880
I was like this.

472
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I survived. I should've collapsed.

473
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,910
(He draws a lot of attention on variety shows.)

474
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,710
Here is the bazooka.

475
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,710
(Kyung Hwan is a great entertainer.)

476
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,640
You prepared so many specialties for today,

477
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,510
but you made this hand gesture while imitating Yoon Seok.

478
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,110
I tried to hold it back,

479
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,980
but I realized that I was doing it.

480
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,340
- You went like this. - I knew I messed up.

481
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,980
He's wearing many layers.

482
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,640
- How many layers... - Look at that.

483
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,940
- Kyung Hwan does that. - It's Kyung Hwan.

484
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,680
(His hands stopped awkwardly.)

485
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,010
(I messed up.)

486
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,080
They caught it with sharp observations.

487
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,940
I'm so disappointed that you couldn't show us your specialties.

488
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,710
Can I pretend this never happened and come back next week?

489
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,210
You can't do that.

490
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,940
Kyung Hwan, you were a panelist here before.

491
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,880
Our staff repeatedly asked you to show us...

492
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,740
your singing ability here on stage, but you hesitated for a long time.

493
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,940
It's because it's not easy to perform on this stage.

494
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,840
Whenever I came here as a panelist,

495
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,210
I wasn't sure if I could sing here...

496
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,810
and touch people's hearts with my song.

497
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,580
It was very hard to decide to come and sing on this show.

498
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,440
I've been here as a panelist,

499
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,940
so I was worried that my singing would disappoint the audience.

500
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,640
It was so hard to decide,

501
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,440
but I was told I could be a panelist at the beginning of next year.

502
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,510
That's why I decided to come.

503
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,110
Is that so? All right.

504
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,110
Are you satisfied with your performance?

505
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,410
- Do you think it went well? - I've practiced for a month.

506
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,110
I think I sang like this on the first day of practice.

507
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,740
(Goodness.)

508
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,040
- Gosh, but I'm so relieved. - Why?

509
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,640
I couldn't sleep well...

510
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,980
for the past week.

511
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,710
If I had known I'd mess it up, I would've slept well.

512
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,940
(He's upset.)

513
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,210
I just couldn't sleep.

514
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,380
But you didn't mess up.

515
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,740
Seung Woo and I were talking.

516
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,580
- We think you did well. - The important thing is...

517
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
- Besides, - You were great.

518
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,980
you were even disguising your voice.

519
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,380
You're a grass leaf

520
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
- But it's... - You should've sung like that.

521
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,910
(Disappointed)

522
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,480
Today, as a comedian who loves music,

523
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,910
he touched our hearts with a heartwarming stage.

524
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,810
It was Heo Kyung Hwan. Please give him a big hand.

525
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,640
- Go, Kyung Hwan! - Thank you.

526
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,940
(Thanks to you, we had a delightful and pleasant time.)

527
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Hello.

528
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,610
I didn't do well.

529
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,910
Let's start over again.

530
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm so disappointed. I could've done better.

531
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,710
Being on King of Mask Singer was very meaningful to me.

532
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,780
Now that it has become 11 years since I debuted,

533
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,010
I no longer felt nervous or excited...

534
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,780
when I shoot TV shows or appear on events.

535
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,740
It's because I do it so often these days.

536
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,410
But in a long time, I felt nervous today.

537
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,980
I felt tense and thrilled...

538
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,480
(It made him excited and tense.)

539
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,110
I felt it in such a long time.

540
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,480
If there are celebrities who are tired of being on TV shows,

541
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,740
I'd recommend them to come to this show.

542
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,440
It'll make them feel excited again in a long time.

543
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,110
This is the result of Round One.

544
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,280
Our Town Is in Snow District, White City...

545
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,440
defeated Heo Kyung Hwan and moved on to Round Two.

546
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,340
The second match of Round One.

547
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,240
His sweet voice will save humanity.

548
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,640
Defense Corps Member, Dessert Man.

549
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,580
(Defense Corps Member, Dessert Man)

550
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,210
You'll soon hear my sweet voice.

551
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,880
(It's time for a sweet dessert.)

552
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,710
He says he has a sweet voice.

553
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,340
- Which will save humanity. - I know.

554
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,840
Let's meet his opponent.

555
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,580
His song will bring blessings and love...

556
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,240
on Christmas.

557
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,840
Tree to the World.

558
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,340
(Tree to the World)

559
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,340
Please look forward to a stage as fancy as a Christmas tree.

560
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,580
(I'm Tree in Santa's outfit.)

561
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,440
(He's handsome.)

562
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,540
It's Santa Clause.

563
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,640
He's tall.

564
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,340
Dessert Man...

565
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,710
seems too much like an idol singer.

566
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,510
- He reminds me of Seung Woo. - Yes.

567
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,580
Maybe he'll sing with a sweet voice.

568
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,680
(You must have dessert...)

569
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,480
(and a tree on Christmas.)

570
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,510
(What kind of stage did the sweet Dessert Man and manly Tree...)

571
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,110
(prepare to celebrate the Christmas night?)

572
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:24,040
("Old Love" by Lee Moon Sae)

573
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,510
He's so good.

574
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,110
(His sad voice pierces your heart.)

575
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,340
(He quietly calls...)

576
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,580
(the name of an old love.)

577
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,210
I love his voice.

578
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,410
(Tree has a beautiful voice like the sound of a Christmas bell.)

579
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,180
(This is great.)

580
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:39,780
(They sing about the pain of love in a delicate harmony.)

581
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,240
(When I long for something)

582
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,680
(I'll keep on longing for it)

583
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
(I know this voice.)

584
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,180
(It's heartwarming.)

585
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,380
(He has a voice as pure as white snow.)

586
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,910
(You can feel his heart throbbing as he thinks of for his old love.)

587
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,480
(The two men's beautiful harmony spreads...)

588
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,080
(on a silent Christmas night.)

589
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,180
(Their stage warms you up on a cold winter night.)

590
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,080
- They sound like choir singers. - They're great.

591
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,340
I love it.

592
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,810
(Tin Man's heart also warms up.)

593
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:20,110
(It sounds more sincere since he sings calmly.)

594
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,910
(If you come into my mind)

595
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,840
(I'll just leave it as it is)

596
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,940
(His lonesome voice expresses endless loneliness...)

597
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,340
(that people can't even think of loving someone.)

598
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,640
(Even when spring comes after winter days,)

599
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,410
(the one who I loved will be remembered forever.)

600
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,910
(It's amazing.)

601
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,940
I love it.

602
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,940
(Their harmony brightens up the Christmas night.)

603
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,980
(She's fascinated.)

604
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,310
(Their performance is like a long-waited Christmas present.)

605
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,180
(Warmth of the song lingers in their minds.)

606
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,410
It was excellent.

607
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,240
- It's wonderful. - Brilliant.

608
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,340
It's so lovely.

609
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,840
I love it.

610
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,710
Second match of Round One is over.

611
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,410
Let's start from Gu Ra's strategist,

612
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,210
- Seung Woo. - Strategist Yoo.

613
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,510
- Let's hear his opinion first. - He has a clue already.

614
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,280
You seemed very busy trying to guess their identities.

615
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,340
Since they both have amazing voices, it was really hard to choose one.

616
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,380
As for Tree, his singing style...

617
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,480
reminded me a lot of Shin Seung Hun.

618
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,410
- You mean Tree? - Yes. His pronunciation was...

619
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,680
very similar to that of Seung Hun.

620
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,240
- I see. - He sang like that.

621
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,880
I think he's...

622
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,210
- a big fan of Seung Hun. - Shin Seung Hun.

623
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,410
Or he could be a ballad singer...

624
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,610
of his era.

625
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,510
That's what I'm guessing.

626
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,010
- As for Dessert Man, - Yes.

627
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,780
- I'm sure he's a ballad singer. - I see.

628
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,010
If he moves on to Round 2 or Round 3,

629
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,240
I think he will be good at singing...

630
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,040
with high notes.

631
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,880
If he can manage his condition well,

632
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,180
I think he could become King of Mask Singer.

633
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,240
- You set a high value on him. - Also, he sounds like...

634
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,510
he is in his early 20s.

635
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,880
- His voice sounds young? - Right.

636
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,380
Jang Hyuk, you seemed very busy talking to Seung Woo.

637
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,080
Both of them have amazing voices.

638
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,880
As for Dessert Man,

639
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,340
his voice sounds so attractive...

640
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,410
that it makes people concentrate...

641
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,180
- so they can listen to him well. - I see.

642
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,640
He's born with that amazing voice.

643
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,610
Moreover, he almost didn't use any vibrato while singing.

644
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,780
Does that mean that...

645
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,480
he isn't that skillful at singing?

646
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
- It rather means he's confident. - No. Don't take it that way.

647
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,640
- Really? - It means he's confident.

648
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,080
He sang comfortably.

649
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,540
Without anyone knowing

650
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,950
(He sings calmly without using any vibrato.)

651
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,310
This kind of his singing style...

652
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,950
implies his confidence.

653
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,340
It means that he's good enough without any technique.

654
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,480
- His voice sounds confident. - Right.

655
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,080
- As for Tree to the World, - What do you think about him?

656
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,010
he breathes a lot while singing.

657
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,580
(He breathes out heavily.)

658
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,010
(He sings with deep breath.)

659
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,450
He breathes so deeply...

660
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,980
to express all his emotions.

661
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,680
This kind of breathing method is...

662
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,840
- used a lot by actors. - Is he an actor, then?

663
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,680
You mean someone who uses this kind of breathing technique is...

664
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,740
- more likely to be an actor, right? - Yes.

665
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,810
(Tree must be an actor.)

666
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,680
Eagle eye, Kai.

667
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,210
You're looking at them like a detective.

668
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,640
As for Dessert Man,

669
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,010
his physical appearance and voice...

670
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,240
seem very young.

671
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,910
Those young singers tend to...

672
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,680
- use many techniques while singing. - I see.

673
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,010
But he sang very calmly with all his heart,

674
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,980
and it sounded really nice. As for Tree to the World,

675
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,380
his first appearance caught my eyes...

676
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,380
because I could feel a sense of true modesty...

677
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,280
through every single gesture of his.

678
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,240
He folds his hands,

679
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,840
and he tends to...

680
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,610
- look down a lot. - Right.

681
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,110
I could feel his desperation...

682
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,610
towards this stage today.

683
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,780
It's something like a child...

684
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,210
wishing for Santa to come.

685
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,910
It's something like you're waiting for a Christmas present.

686
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,910
Yes. That kind of innocent sorrow was...

687
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,540
- expressed well through his voice. - Right.

688
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,580
I personally like him very much.

689
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,180
- He's appealing in that way. - Yes, he was amazing.

690
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,080
As for Tree, you've been folding your hands...

691
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,480
and looking down from the beginning until the end.

692
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,010
It's possible since he's the one who has experienced...

693
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,910
rumors or aroused criticisms.

694
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,780
- It's hard to fake it. - Who could he be?

695
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,210
- Who is it? - I'm afraid it's Tak Jae Hoon.

696
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,680
Tak Jae Hoon.

697
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,810
It's hard to fake it with thick clothes.

698
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,950
You mean it's hard to maintain those modest gestures.

699
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,480
- It was a minority opinion. - What an interesting view point.

700
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,010
- It's very interesting. - Someone's name has been mentioned.

701
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,840
I think he is...

702
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,910
one of the trendy singers.

703
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,340
I think a lot of viewers might know who he is.

704
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,810
As for Tree, this is what I think.

705
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,240
- There are many actors who are shy. - I see.

706
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,480
Some actors run away...

707
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
- when asked for an autograph. - Really?

708
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,210
- I think it's Park Hyuk Kwon. - Park Hyuk Kwon?

709
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,310
There is an actor called Park Hyuk Kwon.

710
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,240
(He runs away when asked for an autograph.)

711
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,380
(He's a shy actor, Park Hyuk Kwon.)

712
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,950
I feel sorry for that.

713
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,110
(He's shy.)

714
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,280
He's good at singing.

715
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,010
I saw it from "Radio Star".

716
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,680
I think I heard his real voice...

717
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,380
when he was singing.

718
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,510
I think he was a popular star among teenagers.

719
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,880
- Was he? - He's probably an actor.

720
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,240
You're guessing somebody, right?

721
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,080
- B. W. M. - B. W. M?

722
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,110
- Yes. - Who is B. W. M?

723
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,080
He told us initial letters of the star's name.

724
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,540
- Byeon Woo Min? - Right.

725
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,210
You're talking about Woo Min.

726
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,210
(He was very popular among teenage girls.)

727
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,110
(He's an actor, Byeon Woo Min who's been acting for 30 years.)

728
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,110
Right. It must be Byeon Woo Min.

729
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,180
Do you think it makes sense?

730
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,310
It does.

731
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,280
He used to be criticized and blamed a lot...

732
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,010
in many dramas.

733
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,010
He always stood like that...

734
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,740
- in those dramas. - In dramas?

735
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,540
- As for Dessert Man, - Yes.

736
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,340
he's really good at singing and his voice sounds amazing.

737
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,340
I listened carefully...

738
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,110
while he was singing in harmony.

739
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,880
He was singing freely between...

740
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,380
the 3rd and 5th chords.

741
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,410
(He sings in harmony freely.)

742
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,010
I think he's a member of a vocal group.

743
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,450
I think it's a group...

744
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,510
- which consists of 4 members. - A group of 4 members?

745
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,310
- The group's name starts with S. - Really?

746
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,380
- His name starts with S as well. - It does?

747
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,510
- In my opinion... - So You from Sistar?

748
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,450
He said So You from Sistar.

749
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,840
So You from Sistar.

750
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,110
- In my opinion... - So You from Sistar.

751
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,110
- Who is it, then? - So You from Sistar.

752
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,480
It's Sweet Sorrow.

753
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,880
- Sweet Sorrow. - Sweet Sorrow.

754
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,510
- It's Sung Jin Hwan. - Sung Jin Hwan.

755
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,680
(His specialty is singing in harmony.)

756
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,210
(It's a vocal group, Sweet Sorrow.)

757
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,810
You're guessing that he's Sung Jin Hwan from Sweet Sorrow.

758
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,950
Okay then. I'll give you a chance...

759
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,540
to hear their real voices.

760
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,950
Dessert Man is...

761
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,380
good at voice imitation.

762
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,640
First of all, he will imitate Bobby Kim's voice.

763
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,540
It's Bobby Kim's voice. Give it a go.

764
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,740
(Preparing)

765
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,710
I love you

766
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,080
I do love you

767
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,810
There's no answer

768
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,780
Stop it here.

769
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,610
You can stop whenever you want.

770
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,580
His voice imitation was pretty boring.

771
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,880
Many people tend to exaggerate when they imitate his voice.

772
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,210
- This time, - He's a very honest person.

773
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,380
- it's Lee So Ra's voice. - Lee So Ra?

774
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,680
It's a female singer Lee So Ra's voice.

775
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,480
(Remember only that)

776
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,040
(We)

777
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,510
(Keep going.)

778
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,740
We

779
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,380
Let's stop it here.

780
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,340
You can stop whenever you want.

781
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,210
Why did you laugh while you were singing?

782
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,480
- The lyrics were too sad. - He laughed since they're too sad.

783
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,980
Sorry for smirking.

784
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,110
Now,

785
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,340
it's time to see Tree's b-boying.

786
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
(Surprised)

787
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,310
- He'll be b-boying. - Byeon Woo Min is...

788
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,480
over 50 years old. Is that even possible for him?

789
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,780
He'll be b-boying. Music, please.

790
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,710
(It's Tree's b-boying.)

791
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,540
(He dances freely.)

792
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,910
Look at his restrained movements.

793
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,110
(Ready and shoot.)

794
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,640
His moves are so restrained.

795
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,740
B-boying, b-boying.

796
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,240
(He passionately makes splendid steps.)

797
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,480
Dance more lively.

798
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,810
More lively.

799
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,810
(He moves hurriedly.)

800
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,640
(He ends with a cute wave.)

801
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,110
That's enough.

802
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
- This is it. - I didn't expect that.

803
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,950
Make your own judgement based on his dance.

804
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,810
I doubt it's Byeon Woo Min.

805
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,910
- It's not Byeon Woo Min. - He does dance well.

806
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,950
- He really dances well. - Yes.

807
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,010
I'd like to ask Niel one question.

808
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,240
Are they from idol groups?

809
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,910
I don't think they are idols.

810
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,740
- What about Dessert Man? - Are you sure?

811
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,680
He's young, but he's not an idol.

812
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,180
I think he might be...

813
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,880
a solo singer-songwriter.

814
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,780
Aren't idols supposed to be funny?

815
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,110
- That's right. - Right?

816
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,450
- Of course. - Idols...

817
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,740
- try to be funny. - Yes.

818
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,910
Yes, that's right.

819
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,280
- I'll impersonate Bobby Kim. - Bobby Kim.

820
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,780
- It's the idol's impersonation. - Let's compare.

821
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,110
(He's getting ready.)

822
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,210
(I fill up today with drinks)

823
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,110
(He copies the way Bobby Kim rolls his eyes.)

824
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,510
(I can't stop thinking of you)

825
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,340
- That's how you should do it. - You should do it like that.

826
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,280
- That's how idols do it. - Right.

827
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,540
That's how you draw people's attention for your team.

828
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,240
- Yes. - You're right.

829
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,740
- You need to be funny. - Yes.

830
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,640
Now, I will announce the result...

831
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,810
of the second match of Round One.

832
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,840
Dessert Man has a sweet voice.

833
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,780
Tree to the World lightens the mood.

834
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,840
Among these two masked signers,

835
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,540
I'll now reveal the winner...

836
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,710
of this match.

837
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,640
Who is the winner?

838
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,080
(He expressed a solitude that makes our hearts ache.)

839
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,540
(Dessert Man's solitude is beautiful.)

840
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:03,010
(He expresses strong emotions.)

841
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,380
(Tree to the World showed his maturity.)

842
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,450
Who is the second winner...

843
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,310
who will move on...

844
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,040
to Round Two?

845
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,740
- The winner is... - The winner is...

846
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,710
- You never know. - Who could it be?

847
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,340
Who is it?

848
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,110
(Everyone is anxious to find out.)

849
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,580
(Both have different charms.)

850
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,950
(He fiddles with his fingers.)

851
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,450
(Her heart is pounding.)

852
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,410
Please show the result.

853
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,340
The winner is...

854
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,980
(Dessert Man won.)

855
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,580
Dessert Man.

856
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,080
(Dessert Man takes his sweet victory.)

857
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,240
(They show different responses to the result.)

858
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,110
(One's happy while the other is sad.)

859
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,110
He has a fantastic voice.

860
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,840
Tree to the World did well, too.

861
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,210
That's a pity.

862
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,710
Dessert Man is the winner.

863
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,610
With a final score of 61 to 38,

864
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,980
Dessert Man moved on to Round Two.

865
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,680
Please go back to your waiting room.

866
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,240
Please give him a big hand.

867
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,940
He moved on to Round Two.

868
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,310
Dessert Man moved on to Round Two.

869
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,810
He will compete against Our Town.

870
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,680
(He bows politely.)

871
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,540
I will do my best in Round Two. Please look forward to it.

872
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,810
Let's find out who Tree is.

873
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,980
Please give Tree a round of applause.

874
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,310
(This will be the last clue to figure out who Tree is.)

875
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,410
(He breathes a lot when he sings.)

876
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,440
(He must be an actor.)

877
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,980
(Could he be the actor Park Hyuk Kwon?)

878
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,040
(Or could he be the actor Byeon Woo Min?)

879
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,240
(Perhaps it's the singer Tak Jae Hoon.)

880
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,510
("I Love You" by Simply Sunday)

881
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,780
(Even if it's not glamorous,)

882
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,280
(his simple singing style catches people's ears.)

883
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,540
(Like the lights on a Christmas tree,)

884
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,810
(he has a soft and warm voice.)

885
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,880
(The audience is immersed in his song.)

886
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,580
(He sings from the bottom of his heart.)

887
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:24,580
(Reminiscing of an old love)

888
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,540
(Through Tree's voice, the past becomes a beautiful memory.)

889
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,310
Now, Tree, please take off your mask...

890
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,440
and reveal your face.

891
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,910
(Screaming)

892
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,780
Tree is...

893
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,910
Who are you?

894
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,880
The audience seems delighted.

895
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,010
Who is it?

896
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,510
Now, Tree, please take off your mask and reveal your face.

897
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,880
Tree is...

898
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,910
Byeon Woo Min, the actor with 30 years of experience.

899
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,480
(He's Byeon Woo Min.)

900
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,440
Byeon Woo Min. My goodness.

901
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,810
(He's Byeon Woo Min, indeed.)

902
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,740
He guessed it right.

903
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,340
How did he know?

904
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,740
(Hyun Chul was spot on.)

905
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,640
(They are happy to see his face.)

906
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,540
(It feels strange to see Byeon Woo Min singing.)

907
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,740
(He's emotional.)

908
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,940
(Perhaps it's because it's been a while since he performed.)

909
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,640
(His voice trembles.)

910
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,210
Oh, gosh. Don't cry.

911
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,480
(They can feel his sincerity.)

912
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,080
(The audience becomes teary-eyed as well.)

913
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,110
This is shocking.

914
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,980
(Good to see you, Byeon Woo Min!)

915
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,480
("I Love You" sung by Byeon Woo Min from the bottom of his heart)

916
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,710
(It was a heartwarming performance.)

917
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,880
(You're amazing.)

918
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,340
He has a heartwarming voice.

919
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,040
- He must be nervous. - I think he's emotional.

920
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
He seems happy.

921
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,580
Please say hello to the viewers.

922
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,440
Hello. It's good to see you.

923
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,780
I enjoyed spending time with you. Thank you.

924
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,910
I see.

925
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,310
(He was one of the biggest actors in the 80s and 90s.)

926
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,940
(With method acting that suited various roles,)

927
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,980
(he's been active as an actor.)

928
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,980
(In "Temptation of Wife", his wife who returned with a spot under...)

929
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,880
(her eye revenged on him. Back then, his acting career reached its peak.)

930
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,040
(After a blank, he returned.)

931
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,380
(He is a skillful actor.)

932
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,910
(Byeon Woo Min is an actor who has acted for more than 30 years.)

933
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,640
Actually, Byeon Woo Min...

934
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,540
was emotional during the rehearsal.

935
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,980
(The rehearsal was going well.)

936
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,980
(He couldn't continue singing.)

937
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,840
(He wiped his tears and dropped his head in the end.)

938
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,040
(He couldn't finish the song.)

939
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,210
It seems like you were emotional while singing.

940
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,740
Yes. I was thinking of the past.

941
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,640
After getting married and my child was born,

942
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,110
I spent all my time and effort...

943
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,610
for my kid and wife.

944
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:41,610
I didn't have time to go to a karaoke and sing like this.

945
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,040
Songs that I sang were like...

946
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,980
I like playing, so come play with me

947
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,340
(I never knew this children's song was so sorrowful.)

948
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,440
You probably know the song.

949
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,740
I didn't have time to spend...

950
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,240
even just one hour for myself to sing like this...

951
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,710
for the last seven years.

952
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,940
As he's been devoting himself to caring for his child,

953
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,680
- he felt that way, I guess. - That's right.

954
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,940
In fact, I'm very busy with the drama shooting.

955
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,780
But I didn't want to miss this chance to sing on stage.

956
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,340
- I see. - I was so excited to be here...

957
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,840
and got carried away.

958
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,640
Would your daughter recognize you on TV?

959
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,180
My daughter? I think so.

960
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,310
(Why is Gu Ra talking about his child?)

961
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,110
Your daughter might be watching you now.

962
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,040
Please say hello to your daughter.

963
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,110
Why should I do that?

964
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,980
She might recognize you on TV.

965
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,880
I just want today to be a special day for me.

966
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,810
- I see. - I won't care about anything else.

967
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,680
He doesn't want to care about anything but himself today.

968
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,110
Ha Eun, have fun...

969
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,710
with Mom today.

970
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,680
He wants some time for himself.

971
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,280
It's time for me now.

972
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,780
I know.

973
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,080
By the way, I was really startled by Hyun Chul.

974
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,340
He recognized you right away.

975
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,940
I've been a big fan of Woo Min for a long time.

976
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,380
- I see. - Wow.

977
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,840
I hope to see him more often...

978
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,580
in many dramas.

979
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,810
I'm a big fan of you.

980
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,040
Thank you.

981
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,440
- Me, too. - Thank you.

982
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,480
Thank you very much.

983
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,580
(He is an actor beloved by a lot of celebrities.)

984
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,980
Today, he forgot about being a father and came here...

985
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,610
as an actor who loves music.

986
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,280
And he showed his performances with all sincerity.

987
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,810
- Please give him a big hand. - Go, Woo Min!

988
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,910
(We look forward to your future endeavors.)

989
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,710
(He feels relieved as he leaves the stage.)

990
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,080
It feels so good.

991
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,980
Now I'm relieved.

992
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,780
It feels good.

993
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,540
You must be disappointed.

994
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,780
No, I'm not.

995
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,910
I'm so happy. I feel great.

996
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,180
It was an exciting breaking away from the daily routine.

997
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,940
This program gave me unforgettable memories.

998
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,180
I want you...

999
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,180
to try singing just for yourselves today.

1000
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,610
All of you deserve...

1001
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,440
to be happy as well.

1002
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
He happy. I love you.

1003
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,840
Merry Christmas.

1004
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,810
Defense Corps Member, Dessert Man beat Byeon Woo Min...

1005
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,240
and moved on to Round Two.

1006
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,180
Right after this show ends, the online mobile survey...

1007
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,210
on this week's masked singers by netizens will proceed.

1008
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,040
Please participate in the survey.

1009
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,480
We are having duet matches in Round One.

1010
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,340
Let's begin the third match of Round One.

1011
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,680
The third match of Round One.

1012
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,280
Her burning voice will melt permanent snow.

1013
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,380
Mrs. Kettle Has Boiled.

1014
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,540
(Mrs. Kettle Has Boiled)

1015
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,880
(A cup of tea during a busy day)

1016
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,080
(Would you care for a cup of tea?)

1017
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,280
(She looks pretty.)

1018
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,710
Look at her. She's cute.

1019
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,310
Her opponent is...

1020
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,110
like a gift set of songs...

1021
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,880
full of luck.

1022
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,680
Sock Boy Says You Reap What You Sow.

1023
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,080
(Sock Boy Says You Reap What You Sow)

1024
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,840
(This is a gift...)

1025
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,740
(for those who did good deeds this year.)

1026
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,180
(Please stuff my Christmas stocking with gifts.)

1027
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,710
He looks so dashing. I like him.

1028
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,940
(Excited)

1029
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,980
They are a good-looking couple.

1030
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,780
We usually get to see good-looking singers in Round Three.

1031
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,840
- I sang in Round Three. - Really?

1032
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,940
- You are wrong. - You are good looking.

1033
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,980
(In fact, I sang in Round Three.)

1034
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,710
- He looks a bit playful. - He does.

1035
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,740
Is he a comedian?

1036
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,640
I acted like that when I came on stage, too.

1037
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,580
He might be a great singer.

1038
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,680
(They look like a nice couple.)

1039
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,010
(As she has a very slender figure,)

1040
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,040
(they are already guessing who she is.)

1041
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,210
(The two masked singers are catching people's eyes.)

1042
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,880
(What song are they going to sing in Round Three?)

1043
00:54:53,780 --> 00:55:01,610
("I Will Become Dust" by Lee Miki)

1044
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,110
(With their delicate emotions,)

1045
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,040
(they sing about the lonely winter.)

1046
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,610
(Amazed)

1047
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,340
(Surprised)

1048
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,180
(Her husky voice sounds heartwarming.)

1049
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,840
(His clear voice sounds like a little boy.)

1050
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,880
(Amazed)

1051
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,410
(Sock Boy's sweet voice...)

1052
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,840
(and Mrs. Kettle's gentle voice...)

1053
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,080
(make everyone sing along to the song.)

1054
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,810
(His clear voice touches people's hearts.)

1055
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,580
(The two great singers are...)

1056
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,080
(making a beautiful harmony.)

1057
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,510
(He's sure that they are singers,)

1058
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,280
(but he doesn't know who they are.)

1059
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,110
(She's making unique gestures,)

1060
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,480
(but they have no idea who she is.)

1061
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,980
I love her voice. It is beautiful.

1062
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,380
Her voice reminds me of Okdal.

1063
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,780
(She raises her clear voice gradually.)

1064
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,740
(Sock Boy is just as good as her.)

1065
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,780
(Moved with admiration)

1066
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,110
(They sing "I Will Become Dust" together powerfully.)

1067
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,580
(With their warm hearts and cool high-pitched voices,)

1068
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,440
(they captivate people's hearts.)

1069
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,780
(Who on earth are they?)

1070
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,610
(They remade the old classic song into a new version.)

1071
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,540
(Is he a rocker?)

1072
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,210
(The more he shows his talent, the more it makes people confused.)

1073
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,510
(They are two mysterious singers.)

1074
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,910
(It was a beautiful harmony of two sentimental singers.)

1075
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,410
(They are so good.)

1076
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,210
(It was a heart-warming song.)

1077
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,780
I love the harmony of a man and a woman.

1078
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,540
The song sounds different as a man and a woman sing it together.

1079
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,780
(Who are they?)

1080
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,440
I guess they are singers.

1081
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,810
I know. But I have no idea who they are.

1082
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,940
(I don't want to say anything.)

1083
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,880
The third match of Round One is over.

1084
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,810
I saw him concentrate hard on watching their performance.

1085
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,080
Let's hear Wan Kyu's opinion first.

1086
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,110
How did you like it?

1087
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,480
It is really difficult to say.

1088
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,980
- What's so difficult? - While they sang,

1089
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,810
the panelists were in a bit of a panic.

1090
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,580
We didn't even know what was going on.

1091
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,280
It is so hard to tell who they are.

1092
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,110
When Sock Boy...

1093
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,040
came on stage,

1094
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,680
he looked very playful.

1095
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,280
I was pretty sure he was a comedian.

1096
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,940
But now I think he is a singer.

1097
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,410
(Acting silly)

1098
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,880
Or maybe not.

1099
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,240
He's very suspicious.

1100
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,880
Wan Kyu, just tell us what you think.

1101
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,340
Don't be deceived by what he does.

1102
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,210
- Mrs. Kettle seems... - Mrs. Kettle?

1103
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,340
like a vocalist of a band.

1104
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,510
I felt that way because...

1105
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,080
a band's vocalist usually has a powerful voice.

1106
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,540
And she sounded like a rocker.

1107
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,310
- Maybe she's in a rock band. - If she was a rocker,

1108
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,540
you'd have noticed her voice, right?

1109
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,040
- I know. - Who would have...

1110
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,380
such a voice?

1111
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,010
Seung Woo, you seemed to enjoy their performance pretty much.

1112
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,640
Yes. In fact, I like...

1113
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,110
voices like Mrs. Kettle's.

1114
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,680
She sounds like Marketa Irglova from the movie, "Once".

1115
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,780
She sounds like a woman with a story to tell.

1116
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,440
He's right.

1117
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,010
A woman with a story to tell.

1118
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,640
She sounds like a woman with a story to tell.

1119
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,940
- Yes. So... - Look at that.

1120
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,740
She looks very happy.

1121
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,840
- She sang the song in high notes. - She's very excited.

1122
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,810
But I think she can touch people's hearts...

1123
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,810
even without the high notes.

1124
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,240
That's why I think she is a singer...

1125
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,680
in the indie music scene.

1126
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,110
As for Sock Boy,

1127
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:10,810
I think he is an idol singer...

1128
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,940
who debuted many years ago.

1129
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,440
I think he is in a second generation idol group...

1130
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,410
such as Super Junior.

1131
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,610
(Super Junior debuted 12 years ago.)

1132
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,710
(The group has a variety of voices.)

1133
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,080
I think he is an idol singer in a group such as Super Junior.

1134
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:32,380
When Seung Woo said that Sock Boy is an idol singer,

1135
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,040
Na Ra of Hellovenus...

1136
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,240
- nodded enthusiastically. - Really?

1137
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,910
- Yes, I did. - Do you agree with him?

1138
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,240
- I think he is an idol singer. - Sock Boy.

1139
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,610
- Yes. - You are certain.

1140
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,940
When he entered the stage,

1141
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,440
his steps and composure were full of swag.

1142
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,710
I think he is an idol singer.

1143
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,640
- I think Mrs. Kettle has... - Mrs. Kettle.

1144
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,080
a beautiful body.

1145
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,040
She is falling for the compliment again.

1146
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,710
She loves compliments.

1147
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,240
- Seriously. - She isn't an idol singer.

1148
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,710
I don't think she is an idol singer. I think she is a solo artist...

1149
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:08,180
who has a nice body and amazing singing skills.

1150
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,410
- A solo artist. - Yes.

1151
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,580
Here is what I noticed.

1152
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,280
These days,

1153
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,740
people don't cover their mouths when they laugh.

1154
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,640
People in the older generations cover their mouths for two reasons.

1155
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
It could be that their parents taught them to laugh that way.

1156
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,180
It also could be that they cover their mouths...

1157
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,980
- to hide their unruly teeth. - That's right.

1158
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,280
I think she is from a generation before braces became popular.

1159
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,340
She is on the older side.

1160
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,840
She loves receiving compliments.

1161
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,510
She shows signs of menopause.

1162
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,480
- You saw signs of menopause. - Yes.

1163
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,680
Those are the clues I got.

1164
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,610
Kai seems to be confused.

1165
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,780
- It's very difficult. - It's difficult.

1166
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,980
- Everyone is confused. - I can't figure her out.

1167
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,710
I focused on one thing about Mrs. Kettle.

1168
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,440
She constantly used gestures.

1169
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,810
She constantly shook her hand.

1170
01:02:58,810 --> 01:02:59,840
That's right.

1171
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,940
(It's not a common gesture.)

1172
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,910
Artists on the older side don't use such gestures.

1173
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,080
The gesture tells me...

1174
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,410
she could be an idol singer or a rapper.

1175
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,780
- That's right. - They use such gestures.

1176
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,040
Old people turn plates to regain their sense of balance.

1177
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,980
- They do that. - A sense of balance?

1178
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,680
- Is she old? - Perhaps she feels dizzy.

1179
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,110
Old people do that.

1180
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,310
The gesture she used...

1181
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:28,510
seems like a hint but also confusing...

1182
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,080
- at the same time. - I see.

1183
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,310
Now, look at the way Sock Boy is standing.

1184
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,410
- His legs are wide apart. - That's right.

1185
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,410
- That's right. - He is a rocker.

1186
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:40,480
- That's right. - Most people don't stand like this.

1187
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,710
- His legs weren't that wide apart. - He sang in that position.

1188
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,240
Most people don't stand like this.

1189
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,840
He maintained that position when he sang.

1190
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,540
I believe he is a singer...

1191
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,210
with a know-how who feels comfortable on stage.

1192
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,540
- That's right. - I believe Sock Boy's life...

1193
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,580
is closely connected to rock.

1194
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,540
Rock maniacs would love...

1195
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,310
his L.A. style.

1196
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,410
- You think he is from L.A. - It seems like it.

1197
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,680
Is he Korean American?

1198
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,610
(It's a secret.)

1199
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,310
I am sure he is from the 90s.

1200
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:15,080
He has amazing talent in singing.

1201
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,240
- However... - However...

1202
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,940
- Give us a name. - I have no idea.

1203
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,940
- I have no idea. - This is frustrating.

1204
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,810
- They should reflect on themselves. - Why do you say that?

1205
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,440
Even though they sang passionately,

1206
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,610
no one can figure out who they are.

1207
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,880
Perhaps they have been away from the industry for a long time.

1208
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,240
Do you have a sideline career?

1209
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,340
We always say that voices are like fingerprints.

1210
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,480
It's strange that no one knows who they are.

1211
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,040
Now that we are talking about their identities,

1212
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,110
Mrs. Kettle will show us her specialty.

1213
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,640
It's Swing Dance. Music, please.

1214
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,610
(Is she a rocker, rapper, or solo artist?)

1215
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,010
It's Sistar's dance.

1216
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,840
(Her dance is spot-on.)

1217
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,110
My goodness.

1218
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,580
I think she is a talented dancer.

1219
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,580
(She does her best.)

1220
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,110
She has a nice sense of rhythm.

1221
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,880
"Shake It"!

1222
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,580
(I am not an old woman.)

1223
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,010
She has a nice sense of rhythm.

1224
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,780
There you go.

1225
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,840
(The next dance move is...)

1226
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,010
(She shakes her bottom.)

1227
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,880
My goodness, she didn't hold back.

1228
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,680
Let's end it here. Let's end it at "Shake it."

1229
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,010
Even though she has dancing skills, she is old.

1230
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,840
You still think she is old.

1231
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Yes, she is old.

1232
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,580
- She was probably a delinquent. - Delinquent?

1233
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:34,240
She is a part of Generation X.

1234
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,610
- She entered college in 1992. - She is a part of Generation X.

1235
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:39,080
- She was probably a delinquent. - That means she is in her mid 40s.

1236
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,180
She could be in her mid 40s.

1237
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,580
You think she could be in her mid 40s.

1238
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,110
This time,

1239
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,940
you will hear Sock Boy's real voice.

1240
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,340
He will imitate Yoo Hyun Sang of Baekdoosan.

1241
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,640
- I told you he is a rocker. - Please say hello.

1242
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,040
Please say hello in Yoo Hyun Sang's voice.

1243
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,780
Do you know who we are?

1244
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:01,580
We are Baekdoosan.

1245
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,940
Let's end it here.

1246
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,980
(It was similar, but funny.)

1247
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,080
- That was cute. - Their specialties aren't special.

1248
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,110
We still don't know who they are.

1249
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,340
Would you use the same voice...

1250
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,910
to sing "One and Only You" by Shim Shin?

1251
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,810
Wait a minute. Why does it have to be Yoo Hyun Sang's voice?

1252
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,910
Can't he imitate other voices?

1253
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,810
Imitating Yoo Hyun Sang's voice conceals his true voice.

1254
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,680
Let's hear "One and Only You".

1255
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,640
Please sing "One and Only You".

1256
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,110
Don't leave when I still miss you

1257
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,510
When I am by myself, I feel lonely

1258
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,740
I feel lonely!

1259
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,110
You don't know who he is, do you?

1260
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,410
You don't!

1261
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,410
(Wow)

1262
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,180
(The MC is even more excited.)

1263
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,910
Gu Ra should know who he is.

1264
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,180
- This time... - Don't listen to him.

1265
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,780
He is saying that to throw us off. I have been fooled too many times.

1266
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,340
Why should I know who he is?

1267
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,910
Why should I know?

1268
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,240
He will be disheartened.

1269
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,610
I am completely certain that Sock Boy is...

1270
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,880
a member of a rock band.

1271
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,340
I see characteristics of a band.

1272
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,080
- As for Mrs. Kettle, - Mrs. Kettle.

1273
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,510
I think she was active at the same time as Hyun Jung.

1274
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:17,280
Even though Hyun Jung has a voice...

1275
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,710
of a rock vocalist,

1276
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,210
she specialized in dance music. I think...

1277
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,040
she is a dance singer...

1278
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,410
with a voice of a rock vocalist.

1279
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,780
That's my conclusion. Am I wrong?

1280
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,180
Why are you laughing?

1281
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,010
- Why are you laughing? - You have everything but the names.

1282
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,310
- Did we get everything else right? - Yes, you did.

1283
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,980
You have everything but the names.

1284
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,510
Now, I will announce the result...

1285
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,380
of the third match of Round One.

1286
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,940
What will be the fate...

1287
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,910
of these two masked singers?

1288
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,610
I'll now reveal...

1289
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,180
the winner of this match.

1290
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,980
(She has a unique voice that is clear and husky.)

1291
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,210
(Mrs. Kettle sings in a straightforward way.)

1292
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:09,240
(He has a delicate voice of a boy.)

1293
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,840
(Sock Boy has a sexy voice with irresistible charms.)

1294
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,880
Let's find out who will move on to Round Two.

1295
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:22,040
The winner is...

1296
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,980
The winner is...

1297
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,840
- I don't know who will win. - I have no clue.

1298
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,110
Who is the third winner who will move on to Round Two?

1299
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,010
Will it be Mrs. Kettle or Sock Boy?

1300
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,410
Please show the result.

1301
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,880
The winner is...

1302
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,580
Mrs. Kettle won.

1303
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,780
(I am glad Mrs. Kettle won.)

1304
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,940
(Mrs. Kettle received a Christmas present.)

1305
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,080
(Congratulations.)

1306
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,580
(Those who rooted for Sock Boy are devastated.)

1307
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,480
(Panelists show mixed reactions.)

1308
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,280
Mrs. Kettle beat Sock Boy...

1309
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,440
- with a score of 57 to 42. - It was a close match.

1310
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:03,840
She won with a difference of 15 votes.

1311
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,640
Mrs. Kettle, please go back to your waiting room.

1312
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,480
Please give her a big hand.

1313
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:10,380
She will compete in Round Two.

1314
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,880
(Careful)

1315
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,580
(Laughing)

1316
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,810
I am happy.

1317
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,080
No one figured out my identity.

1318
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,280
So that my identity stays a mystery in Round Two,

1319
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,410
I will sing harder. Please look forward to it.

1320
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,580
From a first generation idol singer,

1321
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,080
there were many guesses on his identity.

1322
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,910
Who could Sock Boy be?

1323
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,440
We will reveal his identity...

1324
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,310
with a solo performance prepared for Round Two.

1325
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,540
Please give him a big hand.

1326
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,680
(His identity will be revealed with a solo performance.)

1327
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,880
(Is he an experienced singer?)

1328
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,810
(Is he an idol singer? Is he a member of Super Junior?)

1329
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,310
(Has he returned to the stage after a long break?)

1330
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,640
(Is his life connected to rock?)

1331
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,480
(Is he a member of a rock band?)

1332
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:09,640
("Honey" by Park Jin Young)

1333
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,580
(His rock spirit booms from the start.)

1334
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,480
All right. Here we go.

1335
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:24,910
(He has a sharp voice that pierces our hearts.)

1336
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,110
(His voice has changed from the duet performance.)

1337
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,440
(He transformed into a rocker.)

1338
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,210
(The cheerful rock and roll rhythm...)

1339
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,480
(is brought to the next level with his energy.)

1340
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,940
(Hey, you)

1341
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,710
(His sexy voice that catches your ears...)

1342
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:12,440
(will even make Santa Clause fall in love with him.)

1343
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,340
(Sock Boy has charms like a black hole.)

1344
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,840
(Everyone is fascinated by his stage.)

1345
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:50,580
Now, Sock Boy, please take off your mask...

1346
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:53,250
and reveal your face.

1347
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,750
(Unbelievable)

1348
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,580
(I love him.)

1349
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,540
He is...

1350
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,750
(Who are you, Sock Boy?)

1351
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,840
Who is he? He's a rocker.

1352
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,940
He is...

1353
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,610
Kim Se Heon, the main vocalist of Eve with 21 years of experience.

1354
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,110
- He's from Eve. - Oh, my.

1355
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,640
(They get to see Eve on Christmas.)

1356
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,710
(This is shocking.)

1357
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,480
Yes! Go, Eve!

1358
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:31,180
(He's still dashing after all these years.)

1359
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,680
(He's handsome.)

1360
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,510
(He can't hide his charms.)

1361
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,040
(Now I recognize his voice.)

1362
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:48,110
(He rules the stage with his rock spirit.)

1363
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,210
(What is he doing?)

1364
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:12,940
(It's his signature charismatic shouting.)

1365
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:28,080
Scream!

1366
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:37,480
(His energy turns the set into a concert hall in an instant.)

1367
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,410
(Eve's rock vocalist has made an intense comeback stage.)

1368
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:53,910
(It was "Honey" by Kim Se Heon, a stage full of his rock spirit.)

1369
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,340
(You're so great.)

1370
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,250
He's the king of rock and roll.

1371
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,510
(Wow)

1372
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,250
He looks so young.

1373
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,610
Please say hello to the viewers.

1374
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,340
Hello. It's good to see you.

1375
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,110
I'm Kim Se Heon of Eve.

1376
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,840
(He debuted in 1995 as a member of Girl.)

1377
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,750
(Girl, a band of handsome men, made modern rock popular.)

1378
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:22,110
(Se Heon became popular with his good looks and charming voice.)

1379
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,810
(He formed Eve in 1998.)

1380
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,750
(They made people go wild with glam rock.)

1381
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:37,510
(As they made big hits with their songs,)

1382
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:42,750
(Eve was one of the most influential rock bands in the 1990s.)

1383
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,110
(Eve has been re-formed after 15 years.)

1384
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,540
(Kim Se Heon of Eve has come to our show on Christmas.)

1385
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,780
He hasn't been on TV shows in 10 years.

1386
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:57,880
I want to know why you decided to be on our show instead of others.

1387
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,680
Actually, most of my friends told me that people would...

1388
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,880
recognize my voice immediately.

1389
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,580
I wondered if they would really recognize my voice.

1390
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,250
I got curious.

1391
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,880
That's why I decided to come to this show.

1392
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,640
I see. Actually, many people remember...

1393
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,410
- your red hair. - Yes.

1394
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,340
You wore quite thick makeup.

1395
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,110
How is your real personality?

1396
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:24,440
I'm easy-going and playful.

1397
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,180
I'm just an ordinary person.

1398
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,580
When my hair used to be red,

1399
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,380
people were scared of me.

1400
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,380
He's a really nice person.

1401
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,010
- Se Heon. - Do you know him well?

1402
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:37,510
Wan Kyu is younger than Se Heon.

1403
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,940
- Is that right? - Yes.

1404
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,080
I even had drinks with him a couple of times.

1405
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,510
Did you? But Wan Kyu said someone else's name.

1406
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,440
I said he may be an idol singer...

1407
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,580
because people called him the idol of rock music...

1408
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,980
when he was in Girl and Eve.

1409
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,980
- That's right. - Yes.

1410
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,180
That's why other rock musicians were jealous of him.

1411
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,510
Eve was a visual style rock band.

1412
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,340
Not every rock musician can try their looks.

1413
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,010
Do you think Yoo Hyun Sang can try their looks?

1414
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,480
It wasn't an easy thing to do.

1415
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,510
- Eve tried glam rock... - That's right.

1416
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,250
for the first time.

1417
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,480
Their music and appearance were ahead of its time.

1418
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,410
He's such an amazing singer.

1419
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:16,310
He's also incredibly stylish.

1420
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:19,280
That's right. It's been over 20 years, but he's still in style.

1421
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,410
Yes. Our band, Eve, came back...

1422
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,610
- with the original members... - That's right.

1423
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:28,110
- and released an album. - Yes. Your band has been re-formed.

1424
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,580
We came back in a very long time, so we prepared many things.

1425
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:35,580
We released our album yesterday, so you'll be hearing our songs soon.

1426
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,580
I see. It was so good to see you.

1427
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:42,280
He ruled the stage with his unchanging charisma as a rocker.

1428
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,640
It was Kim Se Heon of Eve. Please give him...

1429
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,110
a big supportive round of applause.

1430
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,750
Thank you. Thank you.

1431
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,710
(We'll look forward to Eve's active performance.)

1432
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,780
Thank you.

1433
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,510
When I told the other members I have to dance and do voice imitations,

1434
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,750
they were depressed.

1435
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,210
They didn't want me to do things like that.

1436
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,410
They didn't want me to do it.

1437
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,910
But I think rock musicians shouldn't always be serious.

1438
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,750
I think we should show our friendly side sometimes.

1439
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:13,250
It's actually been three years since I got married.

1440
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,380
We're going to have a baby soon.

1441
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,750
I'm going to be a father next year.

1442
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,410
I wanted to leave something for the baby.

1443
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,680
It was fun. It was only possible here on King of Mask Singer.

1444
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,840
Mrs. Kettle Has Boiled defeated Kim Se Heon of Eve...

1445
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,580
and moved on to Round Two.

1446
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,780
The last match of Round One.

1447
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,310
Her beautiful heavenly voice spreads out to the whole world.

1448
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:39,880
Mysticist Baby Angel.

1449
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,010
(Mysticist Baby Angel)

1450
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,410
(A baby angel has come down to the world.)

1451
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,510
Tin Man. Do you want to know who I am?

1452
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,440
Curiosity killed the cat.

1453
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,180
(Hello)

1454
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,680
(He's cute.)

1455
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:55,940
(Wow)

1456
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,540
He has wings.

1457
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,750
They're pretty.

1458
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:02,110
I think he's going to be amazing.

1459
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,480
Let's meet his opponent.

1460
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:08,610
Ring-ding-dong. She has a beautiful and blessed voice.

1461
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,940
Please Jingle Bells.

1462
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,750
(Ring the bells.)

1463
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:20,280
If you don't vote for me...

1464
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,510
That's mean, that's mean

1465
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:24,410
(Jingling)

1466
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,040
(It's a clear sound.)

1467
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,380
Tofu sellers used to have that bell.

1468
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,280
Tofu sellers had that.

1469
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,710
How cute.

1470
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,210
Both of them are quite short.

1471
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:38,080
I think they'll be great.

1472
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,610
Show us what you got.

1473
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,980
(On Christmas evening,)

1474
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,480
(their song will spread all over the world.)

1475
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,810
(What kind of harmony...)

1476
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,910
(will the cute Baby Angel...)

1477
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,250
(and adorable Bells show us?)

1478
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:09,250
("All For You" by Cool)

1479
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,380
Is this "All For You"?

1480
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,380
(I like this song.)

1481
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,780
It's Cool's song.

1482
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,250
(It's a clear and beautiful voice.)

1483
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,610
- She's so cute. - How adorable.

1484
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:43,340
(Bells sings as if she's whispering quietly.)

1485
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,540
(He sings with a clear voice and smooth vibrato.)

1486
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,080
(A mellow voice comes out of his small build.)

1487
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,310
(Baby Angel's sophisticated voice...)

1488
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,880
(and Bells' pure voice...)

1489
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:33,640
(make a sweet love serenade together.)

1490
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,840
(I want to be a person who is only for you.)

1491
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,080
(It's so sweet.)

1492
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,680
Bells sounds like a baby.

1493
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,110
Maybe she's a child actress.

1494
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:58,680
(He loves their stage.)

1495
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,840
(Baby Angel's voice is soft and sweet,)

1496
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:16,780
(so it warms people's hearts.)

1497
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,310
(With a clear and vivid tone,)

1498
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,110
(they add a spoonful of love.)

1499
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,710
(They're cute.)

1500
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:07,610
(They're adorable.)

1501
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,940
(Wow)

1502
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,680
(For you)

1503
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:29,940
(They promise eternal love with one voice.)

1504
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,210
(It's a sweet eternal whisper of love.)

1505
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,410
(They're adorable.)

1506
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:11,940
(They console the panelists with their pureness.)

1507
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,780
It was such a pure performance.

1508
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,440
They're like babies.

1509
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,880
They're so cute.

1510
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,380
Final match of Duet Song in Round One is over.

1511
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,340
Number one is Baby Angel.

1512
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:27,810
Number two is Bells.

1513
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:31,780
Please press the button to cast a vote.

1514
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,480
All votes are in.

1515
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,840
I was surprised...

1516
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,540
how the panelists stood up...

1517
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,680
as soon as Baby Angel starts singing.

1518
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,210
(Cute Baby Angel.)

1519
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,310
(In fact, he's a man?)

1520
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,680
- Is he a man? - What?

1521
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,510
When he came out,

1522
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,410
I saw he had narrow shoulders,

1523
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,110
and he was very skinny.

1524
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,680
Everyone thought of him as a woman.

1525
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,940
We really did.

1526
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,280
I was surprised to hear his beautiful voice.

1527
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,010
Alright. It seems like you were shocked too, Jang Hyuk.

1528
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,540
I really was.

1529
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,810
Anyway, when I listened to him singing,

1530
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,940
I noticed that he was brilliant at controlling his voice volume.

1531
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:17,380
He harmonized very well with Bells' clear and pure voice.

1532
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,110
He's such a great technician.

1533
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,480
Listening to Bells' song...

1534
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,440
made me feel so great.

1535
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,780
Her singing style reflects her life.

1536
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,940
Her voice was very pure and clear...

1537
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,640
that it was so good to hear it and many people were smiling...

1538
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,780
while listening to her song.

1539
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,680
I was even more amazed.

1540
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,210
I wish I could hear that once more.

1541
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,610
I'm sorry to say this to Baby Angel,

1542
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,780
but when I heard your song right after her song,

1543
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,180
it felt like a fraud.

1544
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,380
(Is Baby Angel's song a fraud?)

1545
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,410
Really?

1546
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,380
He used so many singing techniques.

1547
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,480
Bells was too pure.

1548
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,080
It felt as if...

1549
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,010
he was showing off his muscle...

1550
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:57,540
to a pure girl.

1551
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,040
He overused techniques.

1552
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,610
He was too good.

1553
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,910
I talked about this with Bong Sun.

1554
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,980
As for Please Jingle Bells,

1555
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,810
she's so tiny, cute. She's like a baby.

1556
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:12,680
So we're guessing that she's a child actress.

1557
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,980
I was thinking the same thing earlier.

1558
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,710
I think she was nervous and had a stomachache...

1559
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,410
because she kept rubbing her belly.

1560
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,840
- Are you talking about Bells? - Yes.

1561
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:24,210
(In fact, as soon as she finished her first part...)

1562
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:28,110
(Rubbing)

1563
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:29,110
(Did her stomachache really hurt?)

1564
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,780
Children don't have stomachaches that often.

1565
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,610
Even though they get extra nervous,

1566
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,580
children don't usually get stomachaches.

1567
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:41,410
She could have an acute gastric ulcer.

1568
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,210
I don't see her as a child.

1569
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,310
Why did you do that?

1570
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,750
(Is Bells a child or an adult?)

1571
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,410
I was feeling too nervous.

1572
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,410
- You were nervous. - See?

1573
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:53,110
Children don't get stomachaches for that.

1574
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,510
I think she's an adult actress with a small figure.

1575
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:59,480
As for Baby Angel...

1576
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,040
There are contestants in the past who were too good to leave.

1577
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,340
It feels as if one of them...

1578
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:06,480
came back to the show as an angel.

1579
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,280
I felt that way.

1580
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,540
Did he come back to life?

1581
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,210
- That's it. - Okay.

1582
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:12,640
Kai, what did you think about their performance?

1583
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,750
When we were young, we used to go to church...

1584
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:17,880
and little children would be all dressed up.

1585
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,180
Then they'd sing together. Watching that would make you feel delighted,

1586
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,940
which makes it so precious and beautiful.

1587
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:22,980
Yes, indeed.

1588
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,780
That's exactly how I felt when I saw these two singing today.

1589
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,780
Just by listening to them sing, we were able to enjoy ourselves...

1590
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,280
and clap all together as one.

1591
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,680
I think that warmed up everyone's hearts.

1592
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,710
- As for Jingle Bells, - It's Bells.

1593
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,010
I thought it could be Moon Geun Young.

1594
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,110
She sang an original sound track for a movie.

1595
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:44,680
Since her voice sounds like a little girl,

1596
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,110
she's loved by everyone with an image of younger sister.

1597
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,210
I think she could be an actress.

1598
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,340
- You think she's an actress? - Yes. She's someone widely known.

1599
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,250
Isn't she Im Ye Jin?

1600
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,340
Im Ye Jin?

1601
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,680
You mean the nation's younger sister, Im Ye Jin?

1602
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,480
Yes, her.

1603
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,040
(She'll forever be the nation's younger sister.)

1604
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,880
When she started singing,

1605
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,110
someone came up in my mind straight away.

1606
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,250
- She sang a song for a movie. - Who is she?

1607
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,110
- Even though she's an actress? - It's an actress called...

1608
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,780
Shim Eun Kyung.

1609
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,980
(Will Shim Eun Kyung with a pure voice...)

1610
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,680
(turn out to be Bells?)

1611
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,010
What do you think, Wan Kyu?

1612
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,610
As soon as I heard Bells' voice,

1613
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,340
it reminded of Moon Geun Young.

1614
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:29,540
She's was very confident on stage.

1615
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,910
That made me think of her as an experienced actress.

1616
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,240
Once she takes off her mask,

1617
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,640
I feel like everybody will get shocked.

1618
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,480
As for Baby Angel,

1619
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,080
he's definitely a professional.

1620
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,880
I'm sure he's not a solo artist.

1621
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,780
When they were singing together,

1622
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,380
he showed that cared about his partner by altering his voice.

1623
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,910
He was able to control his voice.

1624
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:55,110
He could be the main singer of a vocal group.

1625
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,410
All right. We will now see...

1626
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:00,310
Bells dancing.

1627
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:03,540
The title of the dance is Popping Dance.

1628
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:07,080
Let's see how much she's good at dancing.

1629
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,080
It's Popping Dance. Music, please.

1630
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,480
(She pops lightly in the beginning.)

1631
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,080
(Popping)

1632
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,280
(She pops her pelvis.)

1633
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,980
(It's a must to open your legs wide.)

1634
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,280
My goodness. Look at her popping.

1635
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,110
(Where did the pureness go?)

1636
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,310
I thought she was pure.

1637
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,740
(It's a fatal temptation.)

1638
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,280
My goodness. What's going on?

1639
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,440
(She attracts men.)

1640
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,340
She seems well experienced.

1641
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,310
Her moves are exceptional.

1642
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:33,310
She's popping.

1643
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,880
(She attracts people.)

1644
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,040
Let's stop here.

1645
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,080
Her dance completely broke prejudices against her.

1646
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:43,940
Who said that she's Moon Geun Young?

1647
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,710
It's Park Na Rae.

1648
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,410
I don't think she's a comedian.

1649
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:52,380
Comedians won't get nervous here.

1650
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,380
I think she's an actress.

1651
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,040
Do you still have a stomachache? It's fine now, isn't it?

1652
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:58,910
I'm still feeling nervous.

1653
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,210
- She's still feeling nervous. - What did you have for lunch?

1654
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,340
(He asks a daily question to make her feel more comfortable.)

1655
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,740
I had a lunchbox that costs 14 dollars.

1656
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,240
She's a top-class actress. Eating a 14 dollar lunchbox means...

1657
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,410
she the top in her agency.

1658
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,910
A 14 dollar lunchbox. She must be the...

1659
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,640
most famous actress in the agency.

1660
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,380
- That's true. - It's expensive.

1661
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,710
How much does your lunchbox cost, Bong Sun?

1662
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,110
- It costs three dollars. - What are you talking about?

1663
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,710
She pays her own lunchbox.

1664
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:28,010
Now, this time around, we will see Baby Angel dancing.

1665
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,910
The title of this dance is Angel Dance.

1666
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:34,080
It's just like how he's dressed. Music, please.

1667
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,740
It's Angle Dance.

1668
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:38,010
(He seems sulky.)

1669
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,910
(He still seems embarrassed.)

1670
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,880
(Should I start flapping my wings?)

1671
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,280
He's being very shy.

1672
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,580
He's touching his wings.

1673
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,510
(He shoots his love to people.)

1674
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,740
He's about to begin his dance.

1675
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,510
He's being cute.

1676
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,510
(I'm the cutest in this area.)

1677
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,940
Like an angel.

1678
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,080
(He spreads his cuteness.)

1679
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,040
This is it.

1680
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,340
He's good at dancing.

1681
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,810
His body is totally like a girl.

1682
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,240
- Niel. - Yes?

1683
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,410
What do you think about his dance?

1684
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:14,380
Is it good...

1685
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,610
or bad?

1686
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,940
I think he's really good at dancing.

1687
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,780
- Baby Angel? - Yes. If he dances seriously,

1688
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,310
I think he will be really good.

1689
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:24,780
I saw that possibility through his moves.

1690
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:28,580
(He couldn't hide his dance moves even if he was shy.)

1691
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:30,780
(Wow)

1692
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,340
What do you think about her?

1693
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,040
How do you evaluate Bells' dance?

1694
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,840
I also thought she was a child actress at first.

1695
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,040
But her dance was a bit too lascivious...

1696
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,910
- for a child actress. - Was it?

1697
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:45,910
Yes.

1698
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,410
(She seemed shy at first.)

1699
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,580
(She bounced her pelvis without a hitch unlike a child actress.)

1700
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,610
My goodness, she was innocent.

1701
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:54,510
(She's fatal.)

1702
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,280
(I can't believe what I'm watching.)

1703
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,740
If children see her dance...

1704
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,080
- They might be pretty frightened. - That's right.

1705
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:02,340
I thought she was a child in a church choir,

1706
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,380
but it turns out she was a deaconess.

1707
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,710
(It turns out she was a deaconess.)

1708
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:07,780
That's what it feels like.

1709
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:11,380
- She looks relatively old. - That's right.

1710
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:12,610
I see.

1711
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:15,680
She has another surprising specialty for you.

1712
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,340
Bells can..

1713
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,980
lift up Baby Angel or me...

1714
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,110
- quite easily. - She can?

1715
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,810
(Can she really do that?)

1716
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,310
No way.

1717
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,740
I'm heavier than Baby Angel.

1718
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,880
I want to lift Baby Angel.

1719
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,110
She wants to lift Baby Angel.

1720
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,440
Baby Angel.

1721
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,340
(Go ahead.)

1722
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,910
He welcomes her with open arms.

1723
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,640
Can she really lift up Baby Angel?

1724
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,280
You won't believe your eyes.

1725
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,680
She is...

1726
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,280
lifting Baby Angel.

1727
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,880
(She easily lifts him up.)

1728
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,910
Lift Baby Angel.

1729
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,380
(Energetic)

1730
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,310
She must be Ki Bo Bae.

1731
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,540
(Baby Angel is just excited.)

1732
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:01,340
That's enough. Stop it.

1733
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:04,340
She's so strong.

1734
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,810
Bells, can you lift me up?

1735
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,510
I'm pretty heavy.

1736
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:11,310
Are you sure? Will you be okay?

1737
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:13,580
Can I throw myself into your arms?

1738
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,640
You should be careful though. Please don't throw me down.

1739
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,680
I have three children.

1740
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,710
(He keeps saying that.)

1741
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:20,940
I'm the breadwinner.

1742
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,840
In 1, 2, 3.

1743
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,080
(He's floating in the air.)

1744
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,110
(Startled)

1745
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,380
Gosh. That's enough.

1746
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,410
(She is unbelievably strong for her figure.)

1747
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:33,810
I'm sure she is an athlete.

1748
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:36,810
I guess she is Jang Hye Jin, the archer who recently won a gold.

1749
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:38,180
- Jang Hye Jin? - Yes.

1750
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:39,410
- A gold medal winner? - Yes.

1751
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:40,640
- She might be Park Se Ri. - Park Se Ri?

1752
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,280
- The golfer who recently retired? - I don't think so.

1753
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,780
Yoon Seok, what do you think?

1754
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,780
She has a beautiful voice...

1755
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,780
and a monstrous power.

1756
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:53,080
I'm sure she's an athlete.

1757
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,580
And it is Christmas season.

1758
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:58,110
So they must've invited a very special guest.

1759
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,680
- Who would that be? - Gwok Chae Yi, the inline skater.

1760
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,440
- Gwok Chae Yi? - Gwok Chae Yi!

1761
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,280
He doesn't think she is an actress.

1762
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:10,240
Now, I will announce the result...

1763
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,940
of the fourth match of Round One.

1764
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,410
We have two masked singers here.

1765
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:19,640
I'll now reveal the winner of this match.

1766
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:25,340
(Her voice echoes so clearly.)

1767
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,910
(Her voice glittered like precious stones.)

1768
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:36,510
(Bells captivated the audience with her pure and clear voice.)

1769
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,680
(He sang with his sweet and warm voice.)

1770
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,510
(His gentle voice will melt the winter cold.)

1771
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,780
(With his plain voice,)

1772
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:55,440
(Baby Angel refreshed people's minds.)

1773
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:59,740
Baby Angel or Bells?

1774
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:03,010
Who is the last winner...

1775
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,110
who will move on to Round Two?

1776
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:08,210
The winner is...

1777
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:10,410
The winner is...

1778
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:11,510
(Please show the result.)

1779
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:13,980
(Nervous)

1780
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,840
(Who will be singing...)

1781
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,310
(once again in Round Two?)

1782
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,310
Who is the winner?

1783
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:23,880
(The winner is...)

1784
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,510
Who will move on to Round Two?

1785
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,410
The winner is...

1786
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:31,469
Who will move on to Round Two?

1787
01:34:31,669 --> 01:34:34,899
Baby Angel or Bells?

1788
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,139
Who will be the winner?

1789
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:40,299
The winner is...

1790
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:41,699
The winner is...

1791
01:34:41,969 --> 01:34:43,239
Baby Angel.

1792
01:34:44,069 --> 01:34:45,169
(Letting out a sigh)

1793
01:34:45,799 --> 01:34:46,869
(Baby Angel wins!)

1794
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:48,469
Baby Angel.

1795
01:34:49,799 --> 01:34:50,939
(Disappointed)

1796
01:34:51,739 --> 01:34:52,969
(She accepts the result.)

1797
01:34:53,969 --> 01:34:56,269
Baby Angel is the winner.

1798
01:34:56,669 --> 01:35:00,069
With a final score of 70 to 29, Baby Angel moved on to...

1799
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:02,299
Round Two.

1800
01:35:02,299 --> 01:35:05,339
Please go back to your waiting room. Please give him a big hand.

1801
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:09,169
Baby Angel moved on to Round Two.

1802
01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:12,539
I will make sure...

1803
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,699
to spread my wings wider in Round Two.

1804
01:35:17,099 --> 01:35:19,139
(He flies to Round Two.)

1805
01:35:20,669 --> 01:35:23,739
Is she really an athlete?

1806
01:35:24,299 --> 01:35:26,899
We will reveal her identity with her solo performance.

1807
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:28,739
Please give her a round of applause.

1808
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:32,399
(Is she a child actress with a clear voice?)

1809
01:35:33,099 --> 01:35:34,799
(They thought she was an actress.)

1810
01:35:35,769 --> 01:35:36,799
(But she showed off her monstrous power.)

1811
01:35:37,299 --> 01:35:39,469
(Is she Jang Hye Jin or Gwok Chae Yi?)

1812
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:41,269
(Who on earth is Bells?)

1813
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:50,569
("Look Out the Window")

1814
01:35:50,569 --> 01:35:51,569
She's singing a carol.

1815
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:52,939
("Look Out the Window")

1816
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:04,599
(It is a special gift to celebrate the Christmas night.)

1817
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:08,839
She's so cute.

1818
01:36:13,099 --> 01:36:16,699
(Her voice lights up people's hearts.)

1819
01:36:22,969 --> 01:36:26,499
(It is a clear and flawless voice.)

1820
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:31,769
(What a heart-warming song!)

1821
01:36:38,299 --> 01:36:40,239
(Let's dance together.)

1822
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,369
(Let's enjoy Christmas together.)

1823
01:37:03,469 --> 01:37:06,599
(Her snow-white voice will melt the winter cold.)

1824
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,869
Now, Bells,

1825
01:37:11,169 --> 01:37:14,339
please take off your mask and reveal your face.

1826
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:20,069
(Unbelievable)

1827
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:21,339
Who is she?

1828
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,599
I'm so curious.

1829
01:37:24,169 --> 01:37:25,439
I can't wait to see her face.

1830
01:37:26,069 --> 01:37:27,999
Reveal your face.

1831
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:32,099
She is...

1832
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:35,399
the first Korean female national soccer player...

1833
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:38,869
to get into the European league, Ji So Yun.

1834
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:41,369
She's Ji So Yun!

1835
01:37:41,799 --> 01:37:43,169
That's Ji So Yun.

1836
01:37:43,169 --> 01:37:44,739
(It is unbelievable.)

1837
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:46,969
- She's Ji So Yun. - She's like Lionel Messi.

1838
01:37:47,169 --> 01:37:48,669
She is like the Lionel Messi of Korea.

1839
01:37:49,099 --> 01:37:50,469
(She's standing right in front of me.)

1840
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:53,439
(She was picked for the national soccer team at the age of 16.)

1841
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:55,969
(Ji So Yun currently plays for Chelsea Ladies F.C in the U.K.)

1842
01:37:57,899 --> 01:37:59,599
(With her winning score in the 2015 FA Cup,)

1843
01:38:00,669 --> 01:38:01,839
(she rapidly rose as the ace player of Chelsea Ladies.)

1844
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:03,169
(The whole world is crazy about her.)

1845
01:38:03,799 --> 01:38:07,169
(Ji So Yun gets picked as the PFA Women's Play of the Year.)

1846
01:38:07,669 --> 01:38:09,639
(She won the Player of the Year Award by the PFA in 2015.)

1847
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:11,799
(She is so-called the Messi of Korea.)

1848
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:14,769
(Shy)

1849
01:38:17,539 --> 01:38:21,439
(I've come a long way from the U.K. to meet you for Christmas.)

1850
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:33,969
(Her voice rings out clearly like the sound of bells.)

1851
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:41,869
(She's cute.)

1852
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:47,639
(Right now, she doesn't look like a soccer player at all.)

1853
01:38:50,569 --> 01:38:54,469
(No one expected her to have such a beautiful voice.)

1854
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:09,369
(So Yun looks just like a little girl today.)

1855
01:39:18,569 --> 01:39:22,369
(It is a beautiful Christmas gift from the great soccer player.)

1856
01:39:22,369 --> 01:39:23,639
(Shy)

1857
01:39:26,139 --> 01:39:28,169
(That was very cute.)

1858
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:30,999
(She looks like a little girl.)

1859
01:39:31,839 --> 01:39:33,169
(It's nice to see you.)

1860
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:34,439
You are so pretty.

1861
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:37,439
This is amazing. Isn't she cute?

1862
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:38,739
She's so cute.

1863
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:40,099
(They are mesmerized by her charm.)

1864
01:39:40,669 --> 01:39:43,399
She is the ace of our national soccer team.

1865
01:39:43,499 --> 01:39:44,839
It's Ji So Yun.

1866
01:39:45,169 --> 01:39:49,569
Hello. I'm Ji So Yun, a national soccer player. Nice to meet you.

1867
01:39:49,969 --> 01:39:52,439
(It's nice to meet you, too!)

1868
01:39:53,269 --> 01:39:54,269
(Excited)

1869
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:56,439
- Were you nervous? - Yes.

1870
01:39:56,439 --> 01:39:58,999
I practiced singing very hard, but it didn't go well.

1871
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:00,139
(Bashful)

1872
01:40:00,499 --> 01:40:03,369
Her voice was very lovely.

1873
01:40:03,369 --> 01:40:04,799
It was so clear.

1874
01:40:04,799 --> 01:40:07,939
I know. If you didn't show off your strength,

1875
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:10,399
no one would have known you were an athlete.

1876
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:13,069
She has such a youthful voice.

1877
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:15,599
How do you appeal to the referee with such a sweet voice?

1878
01:40:15,839 --> 01:40:18,869
I'm a tough woman on the field.

1879
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:21,669
So do you appeal to the referee...

1880
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:23,569
with such a youthful voice?

1881
01:40:23,569 --> 01:40:25,769
I can talk in a rough manner...

1882
01:40:26,139 --> 01:40:28,769
- just like you, Gu Ra. - Like how?

1883
01:40:29,169 --> 01:40:30,769
- Show us. - It's not a foul.

1884
01:40:31,299 --> 01:40:33,739
(He smiles like her dad.)

1885
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:35,769
(It sounds more like she's whining.)

1886
01:40:36,069 --> 01:40:38,899
- She's very lovely. - I know.

1887
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:42,439
I'm told that I look like you.

1888
01:40:42,899 --> 01:40:43,939
Really?

1889
01:40:43,939 --> 01:40:45,239
- I am sorry. - Did it feel nice?

1890
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,039
I felt good, but are you okay with that?

1891
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:49,069
I feel great.

1892
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:50,069
I feel good too.

1893
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:51,799
(I found my sister.)

1894
01:40:52,269 --> 01:40:56,769
There is one thing that will surprise you.

1895
01:40:57,339 --> 01:41:00,169
She wore a skirt for the first time in her life today.

1896
01:41:00,569 --> 01:41:01,669
- Really? - Is that true?

1897
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:03,069
- Yes. - Yes.

1898
01:41:03,339 --> 01:41:05,339
How do you feel?

1899
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,639
It's uncomfortable. I can't spread my legs.

1900
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:09,599
- I can't stand comfortably. - I see.

1901
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:12,069
- I wanted to wear a training suit. - Okay.

1902
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:15,969
But the crew suggested that I wear something girly.

1903
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:17,369
It was the writers' idea.

1904
01:41:18,369 --> 01:41:19,369
Thank you.

1905
01:41:19,969 --> 01:41:20,969
(She's so charming.)

1906
01:41:20,969 --> 01:41:22,969
It's lovely.

1907
01:41:22,969 --> 01:41:26,699
There's a phrase that So Yun...

1908
01:41:27,099 --> 01:41:30,839
wants you to write on the banners that are made to cheer her on.

1909
01:41:30,939 --> 01:41:32,399
I heard you wanted to ask your fans for a favor.

1910
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:36,139
- There are pretty athletes. - Okay.

1911
01:41:36,469 --> 01:41:38,369
The fans write "princess" or...

1912
01:41:38,369 --> 01:41:40,569
"cute" on those athletes' banners.

1913
01:41:41,069 --> 01:41:44,739
But for me, they write "Ji Messi, you are the best."

1914
01:41:45,139 --> 01:41:46,769
Isn't it nice that they think you're the best?

1915
01:41:46,769 --> 01:41:50,469
It feels good, but I'm a girl too. So I want to be cute too.

1916
01:41:50,469 --> 01:41:52,639
- What do you want then? - What do you want them to write?

1917
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,039
"Princess So Yun".

1918
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:56,169
That's not hard at all.

1919
01:41:56,169 --> 01:41:57,899
- "Princess So Yun". - "Beautiful So Yun".

1920
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:00,069
- Yes. - "Cute So Yun".

1921
01:42:00,069 --> 01:42:01,069
- Yes. - Yes.

1922
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:03,799
- Seung Woo is a big fan. - Is that right?

1923
01:42:03,799 --> 01:42:05,269
Seung Woo, do you like soccer?

1924
01:42:05,539 --> 01:42:07,769
- I am a soccer maniac. - Are you?

1925
01:42:07,769 --> 01:42:10,269
She plays for the world's best team.

1926
01:42:10,269 --> 01:42:11,269
That's right.

1927
01:42:11,269 --> 01:42:13,139
She's Princess So Yun.

1928
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:15,499
(He calls her a princess.)

1929
01:42:15,499 --> 01:42:19,169
You have to keep your promise.

1930
01:42:19,169 --> 01:42:20,939
You said you will reveal...

1931
01:42:20,939 --> 01:42:25,499
your million-dollar heart calves after you reveal your face.

1932
01:42:25,499 --> 01:42:27,639
You said you want to show it to everyone as a national athlete.

1933
01:42:27,639 --> 01:42:30,339
All right. Our national athlete, So Yun, will reveal...

1934
01:42:30,339 --> 01:42:34,869
the traces of her hard work.

1935
01:42:34,869 --> 01:42:36,939
You can't see them when she's just standing.

1936
01:42:37,169 --> 01:42:40,069
All right. Her calves are already muscular.

1937
01:42:40,069 --> 01:42:41,069
Look at her calves.

1938
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:43,299
So that is it.

1939
01:42:43,569 --> 01:42:45,099
We can see it.

1940
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:49,339
She's amazing. We are all very proud of her.

1941
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:52,869
She left the soccer field and...

1942
01:42:52,869 --> 01:42:57,769
showed her lovely charms on her heart-beating stage.

1943
01:42:57,769 --> 01:43:01,399
Princess So Yun. Please give it up for So Yun.

1944
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:03,299
- Please give it up for her. - Thank you.

1945
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:05,399
She's a cutie.

1946
01:43:05,839 --> 01:43:06,899
She's a cutie.

1947
01:43:08,799 --> 01:43:10,139
I didn't do well.

1948
01:43:10,169 --> 01:43:11,839
(She's still quite nervous.)

1949
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:13,269
Thank you.

1950
01:43:14,169 --> 01:43:15,699
I got too nervous.

1951
01:43:16,069 --> 01:43:17,369
I was off-tune and off-beat.

1952
01:43:18,339 --> 01:43:19,739
I practiced really hard.

1953
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:22,739
I am still nervous.

1954
01:43:23,369 --> 01:43:25,769
Bye. It was really fun.
