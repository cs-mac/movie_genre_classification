1
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,655
Do you remember 

2
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:18,555
the time we were in Canada? 

3
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,122
We thought that no one will be able to 

4
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:27,589
find us, but the house caught on fire. 

5
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,922
That's why. 

6
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:08,888
I can't let you die because I love you. 

7
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:11,922
Can you trust this PI? 

8
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:14,590
No. He's a bad guy. 

9
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,856
That's why I gave him the job. 

10
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:20,388
It won't matter if he gets hurt or 

11
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,155
dies because of me. 

12
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,156
Detective Yun! 

13
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,423
He got away! He's too fast! 

14
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,623
What? Again? 

15
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,323
- Oh, no! / - What happened? 

16
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:25,156
Find me a route in the city! 

17
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,156
Hurry! 

18
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,490
Hurry! It's an emergency! 

19
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,389
Hurry! 

20
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:35,322
Keiko called again. 

21
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:38,590
Wish her a happy birthday and send her flowers. 

22
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:40,055
Are you done yet? 

23
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:41,123
Are you done yet? 

24
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,989
- In a minute. / - Hurry! 

25
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,823
Go 60m, turn left, then turn right, 

26
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:48,723
go straight, left, left, right, left, 

27
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:51,189
then right after 4 stops, then left. 

28
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:53,757
Okay! 

29
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,189
That jerk! 

30
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:03,288
Jiwoo! Stop! 

31
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,289
Run! Run! 

32
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,490
Turn right! Turn right! 

33
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:15,355
Good! Stay calm! Turn left! 

34
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,455
I can get him. I can get him. 

35
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,255
You were supposed to turn left! 

36
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,955
Get in! Come on! Get in the car! 

37
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,288
Taxi! 

38
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,922
Where did he go? Have you seen him? 

39
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,956
Oh, him? 

40
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:12,056
He gave me $10 and told me to go straight. 

41
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,455
When I turned around... 

42
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,088
He was gone. 

43
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,656
You mean... 

44
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,156
Do you want me to tell you again? 

45
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:46,857
You let a cuffed man get away! 

46
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:47,956
How many black belts do you have, Detective Kim? 

47
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,857
I have a 2nd degree black belt in Judo 

48
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,790
and a 4th degree black belt in Hapkido. 

49
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,790
And you, Detective Lee? 

50
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,256
A 3rd degree black belt in Taekwondo 

51
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,988
and a black belt in Kung Fu. 

52
00:07:56,822 --> 00:08:00,455
I don't have a black belt because I was a boxer. 

53
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:04,921
What are you doing? 

54
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:07,988
What? 

55
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,456
What? 

56
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,189
The insurance won't cover the damage. 

57
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:16,856
Use the department's credit card. 

58
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,989
It'll go over the credit limit. 

59
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,822
There's no credit limit during investigation. 

60
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,689
Get Jiwoo on the hold-departure list 

61
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,423
and get a list of all the PIs in Japan. 

62
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,423
Yes, Sir. 

63
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,056
Detective Park, analyze the international 

64
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,189
calls between PIs. 

65
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,988
Yes, Sir. 

66
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,456
What about me? 

67
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,056
Drive. 

68
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,423
Okay. 

69
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,322
Okay, Dosoo. 

70
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,589
Access denied. 

71
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:21,556
Let me try. 

72
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,188
Access denied. 

73
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:36,122
Don't our eyes look alike? 

74
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,556
Your eyes look like stars, 

75
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:44,690
but his eyes look like a technician's eyes. 

76
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:35,423
I can't believe him, but I want to. 

77
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,856
If he really found him, he'll come for me. 

78
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:43,155
I owe him money, and he'll have questions. 

79
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,623
It's possible, 

80
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,989
if he knew about it beforehand. 

81
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:00,889
He turned my parents' death into a suicide. 

82
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,056
Long time no see, Jiwoo. 

83
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,823
How have you been? 

84
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:16,255
Cut it out. That's tacky. 

85
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:19,655
How have you been, beautiful? 

86
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,856
I missed you, Jiwoo. 

87
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,623
Your Korean improved a lot. 

88
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:27,523
Mr. Nakamura Hwang taught me well. 

89
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:29,623
I'll give you a private lesson. 

90
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,123
Really? 

91
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,790
Anytime is good for me. 

92
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:37,789
Stop being ridiculous. 

93
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,223
He has a girlfriend. 

94
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,856
Really? 

95
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:45,222
I don't have a girlfriend. 

96
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:48,022
Can you trust this PI? 

97
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,956
No. He's a bad guy. 

98
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:54,423
That's why I gave him the job. 

99
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,188
It won't matter if he gets hurt or 

100
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,522
dies because of me. 

101
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:04,189
Jini, every death matters. 

102
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,256
I'm sorry. 

103
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:14,822
I don't want to be like this, but I can't help it. 

104
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:18,022
It makes me mad that I have to live 

105
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:20,123
this way, but I can't get mad. 

106
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:24,022
I have to get mad at him in order to find 

107
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:26,757
who killed my family. 

108
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,355
You know what? 

109
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:42,656
I heard that men hug like this when they can't 

110
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,355
find the right words to say. 

111
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,623
Am I being delusional? 

112
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,021
You're not like most women. 

113
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,156
Where's the hotel? Is it far from here? 

114
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:27,355
Why don't you just stay here? 

115
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,156
This is an expensive house. 

116
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:32,255
I don't want it to catch on fire. 

117
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:28,823
It's me. 

118
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:34,856
I think Jini came to Japan with the PI. 

119
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,088
Really? 

120
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,456
He didn't come here. Kai... 

121
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:45,389
Kai isn't showing any signs. 

122
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,089
I'll tell you when they meet. 

123
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,022
Sowol. 

124
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,323
Yes? 

125
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:58,122
I have many people, 

126
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:03,156
but you're the person I trust the most. 

127
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,423
I know. 

128
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,255
Bye. 

129
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:22,656
Let me use your computer. 

130
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,689
Uh... Go ahead... 

131
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,623
Did you do it? What about Jini? 

132
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,989
Your password? 

133
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,555
It's password protected. 

134
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:01,556
It's me. Wire $1,000 to Nakamura's office. 

135
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:07,322
Why are you spending $100,000 for a password. 

136
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:09,523
We're not like that. 

137
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:12,790
Give me the password. 

138
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:16,155
Why do you have so many questions? 

139
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,355
They're going to send the money. 

140
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:22,689
You're always talking about money. 

141
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:29,490
You don't have the human touch. 

142
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,656
Sir, $1,000 has been wired from Korea. 

143
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:39,556
It's "Hurray for Nakamura." 

144
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,757
I cracked the password. 

145
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:55,255
Thanks. Can you leave me alone for a minute? 

146
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:48,623
It seems like you got into a rough fight. 

147
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:51,722
My father told me that 

148
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,021
a bad friend could ruin 10 years, 

149
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,490
and a bad girl could ruin your life. 

150
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,323
Still, we need to keep appearances 

151
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:07,323
in order to get work. 

152
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,355
We should go and get you a new suit. 

153
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,822
The car key? 

154
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:13,423
What? 

155
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,823
I'll drive. 

156
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:23,022
You've gotten polite ever since 

157
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:24,556
you got back from Korea. 

158
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,490
It's like telling a cancer patient 

159
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,690
not to catch a cold. 

160
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:04,256
He said that Melchidec is in Japan. 

161
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,388
There are 70,000 people in the world who 

162
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:14,255
use the ID Melchidec, with 4,000 in Asia. 

163
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,790
There are 600 of them in Japan. 

164
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,722
If you take out the 89 inactive accounts 

165
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:22,021
and the minors, there are 13. 

166
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,556
9 of them are men. 4 are women. 

167
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:30,056
Is that so? 

168
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,955
But there's a very peculiar guy in that list. 

169
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,789
He committed 4 crimes, but got out 

170
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,490
all 4 times for insufficient evidence. 

171
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:45,655
Aren't you curious? 

172
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,556
Why did you come to Japan? 

173
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,355
To buy clothes! Clothes! 

174
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:57,423
You've come a long way to buy clothes. 

175
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:03,288
I think he organizes his data well. 

176
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,423
You look great. 

177
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:36,589
You look great in a suit. 

178
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,888
Why don't you get a few more? 

179
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,622
I think you're overspending. 

180
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,922
I'm not the one who is paying. 

181
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:47,123
I thought you were buying this for me. 

182
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,456
Me? For you? Why? 

183
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,523
Okay, then maybe I'll get shoes too. 

184
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:58,555
Go ahead. 

185
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,423
Thanks. 

186
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:10,322
The computer logged in. 

187
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,123
Who is it? 

188
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,389
I'll send the location. 

189
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:16,888
Is it your girlfriend? 

190
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:18,888
I love you. 

191
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,655
It's my girlfriend. 

192
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:40,021
Who is this guy? 

193
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,757
Does this look passionate to you? 

194
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:57,256
Do you watch this stuff too? 

195
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,456
Me? 

196
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,623
This is my first time. 

197
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,590
He's well-organized. 

198
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,389
I'm hungry. 

199
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,988
Let's eat. 

200
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:23,857
Something's not right. Can you get me that hat? 

201
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,323
That one? 

202
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,922
The second one from the bottom. 

203
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:29,155
That thing? 

204
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:31,922
At our age, it's stylish to be unbalanced. 

205
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:35,922
That's how a thug dresses. 

206
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:45,689
How can you think this is cute? 

207
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,956
Whoa, it's expensive. 

208
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:49,155
This looks like a trekking hat... 

209
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:08,155
Sir, you didn't pay yet. 

210
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,921
That bastard! 

211
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,690
Can I put it on the tab? 

212
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:46,123
It's me. Where is he going? 

213
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:50,123
He's passing the Tokyo Provincial Office. 

214
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:54,523
I see. Track him well. 

215
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,722
How big is this case, anyway? 

216
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:05,490
I have to make him share. 

217
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,723
The air is fresh. 

218
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:23,656
This place should go into development soon. 

219
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:30,088
If you buy 150,000 acres over there... 

220
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:31,856
Put the cigarette out. 

221
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,655
I guess you don't smoke. 

222
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:39,856
Take your sunglasses off. 

223
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:48,123
Stand up straight. 

224
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,690
Attention! At ease! Attention! 

225
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,189
Do you know why I dragged you here? 

226
00:24:58,189 --> 00:24:59,989
Maybe it's because of the development. 

227
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:01,389
Or maybe not... 

228
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,655
Take your pick. 

229
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,589
Either get buried in that coal heap 

230
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,423
or fall down from here. 

231
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,757
I'll let you pick how you want to die 

232
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,989
for old time's sake. 

233
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:18,423
I'll pay you back! 

234
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:22,690
No, that won't be necessary. 

235
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,056
Your death will put everything to an end. 

236
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:30,288
Pick where you want to die. 

237
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:34,189
You're taking too long. It'll be over after you die. 

238
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:39,922
I'm a busy man. Think fast. 

239
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:45,323
I have a business partner named Jiwoo. 

240
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:48,323
He lived in the US for a long time. 

241
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:51,989
Unless he's going to pay off your debt, shut up. 

242
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,989
Do you know who his girlfriend is? 

243
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:07,623
She's Kieko, a top singer in Japan. 

244
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,589
Who? 

245
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:12,322
I don't know her that well either. 

246
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:13,490
What is he saying? 

247
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,789
She makes over $10 million a year. 

248
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,690
She has a lot of stalkers too. 

249
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,556
My partner is working on a case to catch 

250
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:23,189
her longtime stalker. 

251
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,556
Wasn't today awesome? 

252
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,456
It was very energetic. 

253
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,555
Thanks. 

254
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,088
So... 

255
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,455
I don't want you to get on stage anymore. 

256
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:36,722
Huh? Why? 

257
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,756
I want you to myself. 

258
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:53,088
Jiwoo always said that betray comes 

259
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:56,756
from your back. 

260
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:24,490
I've been waiting for a long time. 

261
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,988
You can't call this love. 

262
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,655
Who do you think you are? 

263
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:40,623
Why are you getting in the way of my love? 

264
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:42,256
Guess who I am? 

265
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,088
I'm a PI. 

266
00:27:55,888 --> 00:28:00,122
Who are you? 

267
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:01,956
Your guardian angel. 

268
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:08,956
He made money and found love. 

269
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,222
So? 

270
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:14,288
We're taking on a great case! 

271
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:20,123
Guess how much it pays? It pays a lot! 

272
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:22,389
So you want me to wait? 

273
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,355
Join me! 

274
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:26,722
Are you trying to haggle with me? 

275
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,355
Like the old saying goes, 

276
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,722
you have nothing to lose. 

277
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:33,388
Yeah, right. 

278
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,822
There's a guy named Melchidec. 

279
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:38,423
1 out of 6 people in this world is Chinese. 

280
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:39,856
I'm sure he's in here. 

281
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,922
And with a gang like yours, 

282
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,256
I'm sure we can find him in no time. 

283
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,790
If you add up the reward, interest, and more... 

284
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:50,288
You'll have enough money to give bonuses 

285
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:53,522
to your men and buy them a car each! 

286
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,455
So I'll know in a week... 

287
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:10,355
Whether I get to kill you or my boys will. 

288
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:14,888
Or you can thank me for helping you. 

289
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:20,722
I hope we find out soon. 

290
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:35,822
I can't come up with that money in a week! 

291
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:38,256
What am I going to do? 

292
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:41,389
Oh, man... 

293
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:47,655
Sir! Can you pay me in advance 

294
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,155
for the Melchidec case? 

295
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:55,388
I'm going to die! 

296
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:58,623
I'm going to die! 

297
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:00,256
Who was behind you when you were 

298
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,857
stabbed in Hong Kong? 

299
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:04,222
Jang Shifu, I'm Hong. 

300
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:07,322
Ms. Hong! Why did you answer the phone? 

301
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:09,790
Mr. Jiwoo got a new number. 

302
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:10,522
Again? 

303
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,655
I'll tell him that you called. 

304
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:18,690
Tell him right away! Right now! 

305
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:30,355
You must've made a lot of money. 

306
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,722
Nice... 

307
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,088
A bugging device. 

308
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:59,523
What's going on? 

309
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,088
Do you think the department 

310
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:08,856
credit card is a joke? 

311
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:11,088
Do you think you can spend as much 

312
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,955
money as you want with it? 

313
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:18,355
Do you want to get a gold card? 

314
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,456
Okay, fine. 

315
00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:26,222
I'll get you one. You don't think I can? 

316
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,888
Hello? Is this the credit card company? 

317
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,689
I'd like the ABCD card... 

318
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,888
I'll correct it, chief. 

319
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,856
Leave the corrections 

320
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,288
to the department of corrections, 

321
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:43,789
and the state affairs to the 

322
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,822
department of state affairs. 

323
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:51,889
Then what do you think the police should do? 

324
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:56,456
I'm not sure, but... I'll jump on it. 

325
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:59,055
Yes! Jump! Run! 

326
00:31:59,056 --> 00:32:02,757
Don't go to Japan and drive an uninsurable car! 

327
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,757
My boss yelled at me 

328
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,155
because of the repair costs! 

329
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:12,757
Do you want an imported car? 

330
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:15,423
Okay, I'll get you one. 

331
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:17,888
Why? You don't think I can? 

332
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:21,322
Hello? Do you sell imported cars? 

333
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:23,389
I'd like a German... 

334
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:25,556
I'll go, chief. 

335
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:29,590
I'll go to Japan and take care of this. 

336
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:38,455
I didn't promote you to work well. 

337
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:42,256
I promoted you so you can work on my side. 

338
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:46,857
Yes, my father told me. 

339
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:49,455
I'm always on your side, chief. 

340
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,088
Don't ever make me come here again! 

341
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,222
Wait, wait... 

342
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,556
My arthritis is getting worse. 

343
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:57,889
My ear... 

344
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,355
This is driving me nuts! 

345
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:18,155
Hello, Sir! 

346
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,789
Where's Dosoo? 

347
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,522
Is he in the restroom? 

348
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:23,955
Does he have constipation? 

349
00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:26,955
He's with you, right? 

350
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:27,955
Yes! 

351
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:29,021
- What do you think? / - Add the salt! 

352
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,856
What? No! 

353
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,989
We don't know either. 

354
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:37,757
You're always screwing me over. 

355
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:40,556
Whose side are you on? 

356
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:44,956
You know that I'm always on your side. 

357
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,756
I'm going to Japan right now. 

358
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,922
Don't do anything. Just wait for me, okay? 

359
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:51,288
Yes, Sir. 

360
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,623
I respect you, Sir. 

361
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:58,523
This is driving me nuts. Where's Mr. Dosoo? 

362
00:33:58,522 --> 00:34:01,822
He's probably somewhere, acting lonely. 

363
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:04,256
Detective Yun! Do you know where he is? 

364
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,323
I heard that you two have something going on. 

365
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:08,823
Not all lovers know everything about each other. 

366
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:10,522
Are you two really lovers? 

367
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:11,856
Why? 

368
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:14,822
Are you jealous? 

369
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:15,955
You can get arrested for sexual 

370
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:16,889
harassment for doing that. 

371
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,021
Let's get to work. 

372
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,355
There are 2,000 registered PIs in Japan, 

373
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,490
and we need their phone records. 

374
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,655
Okay, fine. 

375
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:26,056
This is hard labor. 

376
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,789
I knew this was going to happen. 

377
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:32,021
You always say that. 

378
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:35,556
Where is Mr. Dosoo? 

379
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:03,123
$6.80. 

380
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,590
Receipt, please. 

381
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,823
Receipt, please. 

382
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:08,888
Are you Korean? 

383
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,922
Yes, I'm from Korea. 

384
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:12,889
No discount. 

385
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,655
Dosoo! Where are you? 

386
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,056
How do you say ‘receipt' in Japanese? 

387
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:25,356
Are you eating without us? 

388
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,922
It's an emergency. Tell me. 

389
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:30,155
"Ryoshusho." 

390
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:31,623
Okay, bye. 

391
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:32,722
"Ryoshusho." 

392
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:35,123
Oh, a receipt. 

393
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,655
Ramen restaurants don't have receipts. 

394
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:41,123
We don't have receipts. 

395
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:42,523
"Ryoshusho." 

396
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:13,956
I know that you contacted 

397
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:17,922
the FBI for the Las Vegas incident. 

398
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:24,123
But they said it was a suicide too, 

399
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:26,456
just like that PI. 

400
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,288
I can't trust the Korean prosecutors either. 

401
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,389
At least they're more trustworthy than that PI. 

402
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:39,757
There's Kevin. 

403
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:48,088
He'll do this in order to 

404
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:52,857
get to that bottom of that case. 

405
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:01,289
Bingo. 

406
00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:10,623
Here's your room key. 

407
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,523
Thanks. 

408
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:21,256
Aren't you going inside? 

409
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,222
I'll go inside by myself. 

410
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,422
Let me stay for a little while. 

411
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:29,955
No, I think we should draw the line. 

412
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:36,088
If we go inside together, I won't want you to go. 

413
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:42,722
Okay, I'll go home for today. 

414
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,356
Good night. 

415
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:28,456
You have a very dirty hobby. 

416
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:32,789
There was a dance that the aristocrats of 

417
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,655
Argentina called dirty in the 19th century. 

418
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,489
Pope Benedict XV called it an indecent 

419
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,188
dance that destroys homes and the society. 

420
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:42,757
Guess what the dance was? 

421
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,757
Tango. 

422
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,989
The intellectuals of the time slashed 

423
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,757
a culture, based on what they think. 

424
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,322
Still, it's forbidden... 

425
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,255
"No forbidding allowed." 

426
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:02,757
It was one of the May 1968 slogans in France. 

427
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:10,722
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 

428
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:16,623
I deleted them. 

429
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,322
What? 

430
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:20,322
Where's Melchidec? 

431
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:23,355
You deleted them all? 

432
00:40:23,356 --> 00:40:24,857
What about Laura and Kelly? 

433
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,655
It was my lifelong collection! 

434
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:31,655
I deleted them all. 

435
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:35,921
I'll give you the information first. 

436
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:39,556
Kevin didn't go to China. 

437
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:43,590
His destination was Korea from the beginning. 

438
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,655
Why did Kevin go to Korea without telling you? 

439
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:54,323
Do you still trust Kevin? 

440
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:59,088
Do you still think that he was your friend? 

441
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:02,088
What does that mean? 

442
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,589
Let's take turns. Where's Melchidec? 

443
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:11,722
Let's go and get Melchidec tomorrow. 

444
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:13,922
Is that all? 

445
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:21,757
Then do you want to take this 

446
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:23,956
conversation to the bedroom? 

447
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:26,423
Beat it. 

448
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:27,888
Lady first. 

449
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,089
Happy birthday. 

450
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:50,323
I got the message from your staff. 

451
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:52,455
I got the flowers too. 

452
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,690
I love you. 

453
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:59,389
I heard that from your staff too. 

454
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:30,189
Detective Yun! Thank you very much! 

455
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:51,189
How long are you going to stay in Korea? 

456
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:54,021
Just a little longer. 

457
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:56,690
I have an unfinished case. 

458
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,989
I'm going to America soon. 

459
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:03,356
My dad and I met the producers there too. 

460
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:05,656
Do you want to come with me? 

461
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:08,690
Your father doesn't like me. 

462
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,789
He's just being stubborn. 

463
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:12,956
He doesn't want me to have a boyfriend 

464
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:16,323
or a scandal before I make it in America. 

465
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:18,722
It is okay to have a scandal 

466
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,088
after you become a world star? 

467
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:24,523
When that day comes, I'll go public. 

468
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:27,623
Are you coming to tomorrow's concert? 

469
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,222
I have a song for you. 

470
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:31,556
Okay, I'll go. 

471
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:32,590
Really? 

472
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:38,222
I never broke my promise intentionally. 

473
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:40,889
If you come... 

474
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:43,189
If you really come, 

475
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:47,188
I might ask you to the stage. 

476
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:49,523
I want to get on the stage with you and 

477
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,356
tell everyone that you're my boyfriend. 

478
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:06,422
Dad! Right now? 

479
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:11,222
No, I was practicing. 

480
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:13,722
Okay. 

481
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:19,623
Sorry. I have to go. 

482
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:23,590
I love you. 

483
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,623
I love you. 

484
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:35,822
I love you. I love you. 

485
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:39,389
Snap out of it, you two. 

486
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:42,690
People get cheated by love and cry over money. 

487
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,356
That's life. 

488
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:22,523
I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking. 

489
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,889
Detective Yun. 

490
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,856
Just call me Soran. 

491
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:38,123
Why do you think Jiwoo came to Japan? 

492
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,088
Why did he board a ship instead of a plane? 

493
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:43,056
Who is the woman who disappeared 

494
00:46:43,056 --> 00:46:43,757
from the ship? 

495
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,690
I don't know. 

496
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:49,989
Did you even think about it 

497
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:50,590
before you answered? 

498
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,989
Yes. 

499
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:01,155
Okay. Get back to work. 

500
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:13,956
Have you been shot by a gun? 

501
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,123
No. 

502
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,322
I've been shot twice. 

503
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:22,222
By the same man. 

504
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:29,889
I heard that the PI is in Japan. 

505
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,021
He's not an easy man to persuade. 

506
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:37,222
Why did he come to Japan? 

507
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,489
I think he came to find me. 

508
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,188
Chairman Yang was too greedy. 

509
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:46,623
He kept all that gold 

510
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:49,523
and silver for himself during the war. 

511
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:53,922
It's about time it backfired on him. 

512
00:47:53,922 --> 00:47:55,856
Aren't you the one who dealt 

513
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,989
with the gold and silver? 

514
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:01,322
I believe that you got to 

515
00:48:01,322 --> 00:48:04,155
where you are today thanks to that. 

516
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:05,456
Mijin. 

517
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:12,123
Are you blackmailing me? 

518
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,623
I'm asking you for a favor. 

519
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,722
Now that he found out about me, it'll be 

520
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:19,456
a matter of time before he finds you. 

521
00:48:19,456 --> 00:48:22,456
You should take care of your own problem. 

522
00:48:22,456 --> 00:48:24,356
Go home for today. 

523
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:29,122
If you want... 

524
00:48:29,123 --> 00:48:32,356
I'll stay over tonight. 

525
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:39,921
You've turned quite 

526
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:42,155
provocative over the time. 

527
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:46,856
You've been very nice to me. 

528
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:50,088
Dad! 

529
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:53,722
I think my daughter is here. 

530
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:57,456
Do whatever you want. 

531
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:35,822
Wake up. 

532
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:41,956
Wake up! 

533
00:49:44,556 --> 00:49:45,922
Take a look. 

534
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,456
He's one of the few PIs in 

535
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:51,623
Japan who regularly call Korea. 

536
00:49:51,623 --> 00:49:52,623
Do you see his call records? 

537
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:53,889
Yes. 

538
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,956
Nakamura Hwang? 

539
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:59,088
A lot of calls overlap. 

540
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:02,389
When we were after Jiwoo in Thailand and 

541
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:04,655
Hong Kong, he called Thailand and Hong Kong. 

542
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:07,389
Find Nakamura Hwang. 

543
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,822
Do you want to have breakfast before we go? 

544
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:18,021
Tell me where we're going first. 

545
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:19,456
To get Melchidec. 

546
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:21,322
Are you sure it's him? 

547
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,455
Almost. 

548
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:26,423
Let's have breakfast at lunchtime. 

549
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:29,823
I wanted to have lunch. 

550
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,456
You're early. 

551
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:44,021
How did you know? 

552
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,422
Let's save that for later. 

553
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:34,988
I have to go somewhere. 

554
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:37,857
No. 

555
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:40,556
Let's go. 

556
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,556
Sure thing. 

557
00:52:01,922 --> 00:52:03,989
Where's Nakamura Hwang right now? 

558
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:05,722
Who are you? 

559
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:10,322
Do you have a warrant? 

560
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,088
"She wants a warrant." 

561
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:17,021
What? 

562
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:19,088
Oh, she wants a warrant. 

563
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,056
He's passing by Shibuya right now. 

564
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:37,988
Here's the tracking device. 

565
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:45,056
Detective Park, take over. 

566
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:46,523
Yes, Sir. 

567
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:17,956
Melchidec? 

568
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:24,590
Who is Melchidec? 

569
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:28,188
If you really want to pretend, you should've asked 

570
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:31,955
"What is Melchidec?" instead of who. 

571
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,956
Let me ask you bluntly. 

572
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:39,922
Why are you trying to kill me? 

573
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:44,789
Because you're with her. 

574
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,757
Did you kill my family? 

575
00:53:49,757 --> 00:53:53,356
No, you were my assignment. 

576
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:57,822
He was added because of you. 

577
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:06,823
Are you Melchidec? 

578
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:09,956
Do you want to know? 

579
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:12,156
Let's go to Osaka. 

580
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,255
Why? Is there a trap? 

581
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:15,123
Why do you think that? 

582
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:17,789
Because you confessed too easily. 

583
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:21,255
You'll see when you get there. 

584
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,789
Where is Nakamura? 

585
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,422
Nakamura's car is coming this way. 

586
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:54,921
What? 

587
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,222
Nakamura? Where? 

588
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:09,956
Jiwoo! 

589
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:16,655
- Jiwoo! Jiwoo! / - Where? Go after him! 

590
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:21,956
Mr. Dosoo! 

591
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:30,922
Will you look at that! 

592
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:48,690
I haven't done this in a long time! 

593
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:09,523
He's a racer! 

594
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:10,789
What's going on? 

595
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:13,389
Something that happens all the time. 

596
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:15,823
It's okay. This isn't my car. 

597
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:41,255
Geez! 

598
00:56:59,422 --> 00:57:00,921
Mr. Dosoo! 

599
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:13,323
Oh, my... 

600
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:35,388
What the? Why, I ought to... 

601
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:44,021
Darn! And I was so close! 

602
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:49,690
Move! 

603
00:58:51,056 --> 00:58:52,456
Move! 

604
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:55,189
Oh, my gosh! 

605
00:58:58,123 --> 00:58:59,690
Detective Yun! Are you okay? 

606
00:59:07,655 --> 00:59:09,989
Detective Kim! Are you okay? 

607
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:13,456
You idiot! 

608
00:59:13,456 --> 00:59:15,922
Detective Yun, tell him. 

609
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:16,856
We're the police. 

610
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:18,155
Thank you for your cooperation. 

611
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,655
Do you think this is America or something? 

612
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:22,856
This doesn't work in Japan. 

613
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:25,288
You're Korean! Move! 

614
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:29,456
I'm a member of Chongryon! 

615
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:31,490
You're still our people! 

616
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:34,355
Move! Detective Lee! Take over! 

617
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:38,757
I'm sorry. 

618
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:47,155
Hey! 

619
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:49,088
That idiot! 

620
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:56,088
You're good. 

621
00:59:56,088 --> 00:59:58,655
It's part of my job. 

622
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:04,856
Would you like to work for me? 

623
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:10,989
Sure, if you pay me a lot. 

624
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:17,690
Did the person here kill my family? 

625
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,722
Don't think about who killed them. 

626
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:22,956
Think about why. 

627
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:41,489
Can we just go in like this? 

628
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:45,789
Hey, this is all part of the plan. 

629
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:03,122
You're annoying me. 

630
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:05,556
I already told you. 

631
01:01:05,556 --> 01:01:10,021
If they find me, they'll end up here. 

632
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:13,956
You won't be safe either. 

633
01:01:13,956 --> 01:01:17,289
You should take care of them first. 

634
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:20,989
We can put our differences aside later. 

635
01:01:22,255 --> 01:01:26,021
Are you that PI? 

636
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:28,489
Are you Melchidec? 

637
01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:34,255
You should change the way you talk. 

638
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,856
Answer me. 

639
01:01:36,856 --> 01:01:40,355
Did you kill my family? 

640
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:45,888
I'm not the one who killed your family. 

641
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:50,356
But you were supposed to be gone too. 

642
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:59,856
Who killed my family? 

643
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:02,255
That's an air gun. 

644
01:02:04,456 --> 01:02:05,757
You said that it was a real gun. 

645
01:02:05,757 --> 01:02:07,822
It's a real air gun. 

646
01:02:10,222 --> 01:02:11,623
Get them! 

647
01:02:22,856 --> 01:02:24,255
You said that this is all part of the plan. 

648
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,589
Of course. 

649
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,623
Don't you have any other plans? 

650
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:28,956
Yes, there's a plan B. 

651
01:02:28,956 --> 01:02:29,655
What is it? 

652
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:31,222
Go through them. 

653
01:02:32,956 --> 01:02:34,155
There are a lot of people on the left side, 

654
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:35,288
so let's take that side. 

655
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:36,790
But there are only two of us! 

656
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:39,389
No, it's every man for himself. 

657
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,757
Let's run forward on the count of three. 

658
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:46,922
1, 2, 3! 

659
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:54,655
Sorry! 

660
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:53,356
I'm here to save you. 

661
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:53,889
What? 

662
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,722
Let's put our hands up. 

663
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:56,889
He has a gun. 

664
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:59,189
He's a wanted murder in Korea. 

665
01:04:59,188 --> 01:05:01,021
I'm not a murderer. 

666
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:03,088
Let's not stab each other in the back. 

667
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:04,556
I was going to say that first. 

668
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:09,156
What kind of a VIP service is this? 

669
01:05:12,222 --> 01:05:15,690
They know who Melchidec is for sure. 

670
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,822
I don't think Jini and the PI know anything yet. 

671
01:05:18,822 --> 01:05:20,522
Let's get to the bottom of this. 

672
01:05:20,523 --> 01:05:22,123
You'll soon hear from her. 

673
01:05:22,123 --> 01:05:26,255
Kai is the only person she can rely on. 

674
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:30,022
Jiwoo sent a message to Jang Shifu to meet him. 

675
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:33,556
We have to go to China to find Melchidec. 

676
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:37,156
I'm scared.
