Cinema is an illusion that does not come from fiction or reality, but from the work's own reality.
In this film, the close ups of the girl's body have been performed by a body double.
We cannot see the actress, but the fictional construction of the girl's character.

5
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,602
Why did you do that?

6
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,426
Because I'm a woman.

7
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:37,540
I don't understand.

8
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,577
You understand perfectly well.

9
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,309
Thank you.

10
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:02,272
Why did you come back down to the toilets?

11
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,186
People like you don't look at women.

12
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:10,128
It's because you touched me on the stairs,
it was you wasn't it?

13
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,083
Yes.

14
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:13,992
So what?

15
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,753
It touched me.

16
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,872
I wasn't paying attention then, but just afterwards.

17
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,123
I was scared.

18
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,550
I was sure of what you came to do.

19
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,756
I was also sure of what you came to do.

20
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:36,155
I know why you went to the bogs.

21
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,854
To get sucked, like all men.

22
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,778
Bitch!

23
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:55,944
That's what they all do.

24
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,277
I can't escape.

25
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:51,188
What do you want to do now?

26
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:24,881
I'll pay you.

27
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,580
What do you hope for?

28
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,417
Knowledge.

29
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,618
Because as you don't like women, you can look at me in an unbiased manner.

30
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,113
I mean, impartially.

31
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,779
What's this about?

32
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,864
About what I just said.

33
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,612
To watch me when I'm unwatchable.

34
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:50,168
We wouldn't need to touch.

35
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:54,078
You looking will be enough.

36
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,684
It'll be expensive.

37
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,508
I'll pay you.

38
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,189
<i>And that's how the deal was made.</i>

39
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,898
<i>First night...</i>

40
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,659
Excuse me.

41
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:43,244
You came early, so I didn't have time to undress.

42
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,663
I'm paid to observe.

43
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,020
You can't ask for anything else.

44
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,173
Yes, you're right.

45
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,862
But I can't stop hoping for other things.

46
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,169
You didn't tell me how far away the house was.

47
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,867
So I had to take a train then a taxi.

48
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,500
You'll have to take that into account.

49
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,776
I'll pay for everything.

50
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:25,454
<i>And so he'd been tricked into this meeting.</i>

51
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,440
<i>It sickens him to be there.</i>

52
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,067
<i>As if it's something new and unexpected.</i>

53
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,834
<i>He knows it will be.</i>

54
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,113
Finally, it's about time.

55
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,907
Why do you display yourself like that?

56
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,157
The delicacy of female flesh

57
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,279
inspires disgust and cruelty.

58
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,815
So you're dependent on one or the other.

59
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,618
What should we fear more?

60
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,112
Nothingness.

61
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,165
Or brutality.

62
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:11,116
There's a big difference between the offer and the demand.

63
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,980
Between the offer and when it's taken up.

64
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:20,745
That's what we call the first deception.

65
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,468
After that nothing's the same.

66
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,404
Everything goes wrong.

67
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,594
Then with a recovery,

68
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,716
that's fake,

69
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,806
the disease stays as

70
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:41,928
an active cruelty.

71
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,274
You speak too much.

72
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,486
Your speech was full of clumsy insults.

73
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,789
Should I maybe have shaved my armpits?

74
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,235
It's still visible.

75
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,729
Shave as much as you want.

76
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,968
You could even shave your butt crack,

77
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:42,430
but it would never rid you of your natural obscenity.

78
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,568
On the other hand,

79
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,174
as the skin stays lumpy,

80
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:49,855
like the neck of a plucked chicken.

81
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,125
From each dirty, dry pore,

82
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,067
with the swelling irritated by the hair being ripped away,

83
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,444
like mountains of

84
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:59,087
microscopic sexual beings.

85
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:04,644
So we can't do anything about it?

86
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:06,915
No.

87
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:08,888
Nothing.

88
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,772
It's the depth of this obscenity.

89
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,671
The feminine depth.

90
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:20,697
That you long for the boys who don't want you.

91
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,568
And hate the boys who like you.

92
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,460
That's not what we see.

93
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,145
When you spread your legs,

94
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,523
we're revolted,

95
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,157
by the overly bright colour,

96
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,040
of your hidden, shapeless lips.

97
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:56,687
And the delicacy of this skin,

98
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,463
although, here and there,

99
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,051
is lumpy,

100
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,819
it's a skin that sweats

101
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:08,854
and oozes.

102
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:12,099
It's a toxic skin.

103
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,526
Like frog skin,

104
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,905
but they at least,

105
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:20,036
have the decency of being green.

106
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,004
And their thighs,

107
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,804
symbolically,

108
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,851
have the same enormity

109
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,303
as yours.

110
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,976
That's not what we see.

111
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:49,023
It's you who deny

112
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,555
this most terrifying obscenity.

113
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,987
Keep going.

114
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:08,336
<i>And so I ask myself for the first time what put me off women.</i>

115
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:14,553
<i>It isn't this deep violence that they bring from their stagnant depths.</i>

116
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,798
<i>Until then I was honest.</i>

117
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:24,829
<i>But you must wonder what I was thinking of,</i>

118
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,732
<i>as thoughts can wonder.</i>

119
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,565
<i>And you can't keep them attached to a course that's not theirs.</i>

120
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:39,154
<i>And you can't deny what you think of this shining, putrid black bush.</i>

121
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,946
<i>You think of a baby bird.</i>

122
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,808
<i>Still wet from the egg.</i>

123
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:48,014
<i>And that becomes so touching in its newborn weakness.</i>

124
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,320
<i>And up until now, the child</i>

125
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:38,162
<i>who would become all men,</i>

126
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:42,187
<i>still remembered the horror of this sight that mocked him.</i>

127
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:47,052
Do you understand?

128
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:03,350
<i>I believe that he was telling me what I knew, but refused to hear.</i>

129
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,502
<i>That a woman's body calls for mutilation.</i>

130
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,614
<i>And for you there's nothing.</i>

131
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,370
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

132
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,665
<i>This male anger against something visible.</i>

133
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:51,381
You've been here a while and you still don't know anything about a woman.

134
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:03,332
Why did you go and sit down?

135
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:06,273
Come here and look.

136
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,219
Isn't that what I'm paying for?

137
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:19,278
Do you know why people usually drink?

138
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,214
As soon as they're together?

139
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:25,235
It's because they have nothing to say.

140
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,888
They hope that the intimacy of the bedroom makes things better.

141
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,240
But it's worse.

142
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,249
We drink because

143
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,594
we have no thoughts for one another.

144
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:38,972
Nothing.

145
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,761
Are you speaking about me?
About everyone.

146
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,362
Male or female,

147
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:49,994
there's no difference.

148
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,457
When you offer all of

149
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:53,983
your fragile flesh,

150
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,185
when a flesh opening is promised,

151
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:01,988
I have no more thoughts or words.

152
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:16,209
I need alcohol.

153
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:32,068
I need to forget this depravity.

154
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,353
This loneliness.

155
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:05,507
Aren't you afraid then?

156
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:08,634
No. I control my impatience.

157
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:11,463
As waiting's not become part of my pleasure.

158
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,222
Waiting's what I ask for.

159
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,201
Do you see what I mean?

160
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,687
<i>This reminds me of the exact time</i>

161
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:27,592
<i>where I was still young and far from thinking about sex.</i>

162
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:32,841
<i>Some silly boys from the neighbourhood who already acted like a gang</i>

163
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,484
<i>knocked through to our garden</i>

164
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:38,350
<i>like a group of partridges in the shooting season.</i>

165
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:47,772
<i>After a short time of fighting,</i>

166
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,818
<i>as I was the only enemy and it was dishonourable to beat me,</i>

167
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:54,573
<i>we agreed to be nice.</i>

168
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:58,458
<i>And in order to make peace, we played doctor.</i>

169
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,075
<i>I was the patient of course.</i>

170
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,036
<i>A girl is a man's sickness.</i>

171
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:29,267
<i>So maybe now all these new young doctors</i>

172
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:35,199
<i>were at one point repulsed forever by the growth of young virgin girls.</i>

173
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:39,361
I bless the day I was born immune to you

174
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,111
and all of your type.

175
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:48,456
The elasticity of a boy's anus

176
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:49,635
doesn't lie.

177
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,762
From the tightness.

178
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,258
of the lower intestine.

179
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,396
The deception of women's delicacy is odious.

180
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:07,011
This detrimental worthlessness

181
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:10,995
that makes them a trap.

182
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,563
The dream of nothing

183
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,008
is the enduring everything.

184
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:19,688
I'm sick of your dawdling.

185
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,455
You haven't even looked at me.

186
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,551
You need to look at me when I don't see myself.

187
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,391
You need to look at me when I don't see myself.

188
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,898
<i><i>Despite its misleading masculine image,</i></i>

189
00:30:57,018 --> 00:31:00,708
<i>the ocean rolled through the darkness like a bitch on heat.</i>

190
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,874
<i>Because just like a woman, it was empty</i>

191
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,984
<i>and could open itself up</i>

192
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:08,180
<i>and engulf you entirely.</i>

193
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:16,493
<i>I feel trapped by a type of witchcraft</i>

194
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:20,104
<i>of the obscene signs and sounds of nature.</i>

195
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:23,008
<i>Surrounded by the begging pleas of the weak,</i>

196
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,650
<i>only I was strong</i>

197
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,715
<i>and destitute</i>

198
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,159
<i>against the whole world.</i>

199
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:36,276
It doesn't matter.

200
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,305
It doesn't matter.

201
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:41,685
It's fine, it's the first night.

202
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,987
It's the first night.

203
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:27,571
<i>Second night...</i>

204
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,082
Did you want to kill me last night?

205
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,113
You resisted that urge for a long time.

206
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,414
How do you know?

207
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:08,109
It's what men want to do.

208
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:10,399
It's just the way it is.

209
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:14,146
That's why they lie with us.

210
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:18,153
And these veils that they ritually place upon us

211
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:20,132
foreshadow our misery.

212
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:24,174
But you're not part of this?

213
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:28,918
Are you oblivious to all this?

214
00:49:30,686 --> 00:49:33,086
You don't know the evil that you're capable of.

215
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:55,012
Third night...

216
00:50:43,183 --> 00:50:45,078
Anyone could've come in.

217
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,941
Or anything...

218
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,499
That's what men can stand.

219
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:06,047
They've always wanted to lock women away

220
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,699
in all times, places and latitudes.

221
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:12,769
To protect them from themselves.

222
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:16,474
To ward off a woman's true destiny.

223
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,295
In reality,

224
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:32,390
they're scared that women don't belong to them.

225
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:42,218
They don't believe in sensual freedom.

226
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,163
They threaten us with their belts.

227
00:51:47,797 --> 00:51:49,594
It's absolutely horrid.

228
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:52,232
They want us to embrace chastity.

229
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,071
Their morals

230
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:55,952
are insensitive.

231
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,101
Because they always need to be assured.

232
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:03,452
Yet they know they can't ask for proof.

233
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:09,459
Otherwise there'd be no point in love.

234
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:26,701
I put it there to keep the blood off the sheets in your absence.

235
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:29,877
But now that you're here...

236
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:32,291
Pull.

237
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:35,961
Come on, pull.

238
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,676
Pull, it comes out easily.

239
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,727
You see everything here.

240
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:12,603
Because of this blood, they say we're impure.

241
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:16,140
Sometimes they won't shake our hands.

242
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:20,020
They don't want to have sex with us

243
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,203
during this period they call our periods.

244
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:26,035
In reality,

245
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:30,589
they're scared of this blood that flows from us without any wound.

246
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:38,697
What they call impurity.

247
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:40,936
I...

248
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:44,711
on the other hand,

249
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,705
I put it into a glass of water, like old people do with their false teeth.

250
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:03,959
And I watch the blooming of red blood

251
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,573
flowing through the water.

252
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,044
Shouldn't we drink the blood of our enemies?

253
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,879
Aren't that what women are to men?

254
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:28,715
Here, drink.

255
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:29,744
We make a big deal about it,

256
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:34,558
You see the space it takes up and we don't feel anything.

257
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:37,821
It's the size of most human penises.

258
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:39,932
The proof

259
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,500
that we don't have sex for the act itself,

260
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,721
but its meaning.

261
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:48,861
I can push it in just like during sex,

262
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:51,976
as deep as possible.

263
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,707
There's nothing to feel.

264
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:01,981
And there's no sense of pleasure at all:

265
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,355
like an ordinary gesture.

266
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:13,370
Look!

267
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,791
There's a whole device to make it look complicated.

268
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,486
So you can put it in place

269
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,884
without touching yourself.

270
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:31,863
So you can keep your virginity intact.

271
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,334
Without exploring your genitals.

272
00:56:40,471 --> 00:56:42,380
You insert the tip of the cardboard.

273
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:45,380
Then you push it in like a syringe,

274
00:56:46,222 --> 00:56:48,264
to inject yourself like

275
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:51,878
you're shooting up into your veins,

276
00:56:51,998 --> 00:56:54,320
to feel the hygiene

277
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,184
of the absorbent cotton,

278
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:58,836
as if to heal a wound

279
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:02,966
that's painful and extremely sensitive.

280
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:06,728
I don't feel anything!

281
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:09,268
Not a thing.

282
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:20,311
Don't you think this is laughable?

283
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:29,386
I'd laugh, but it seems to foreshadow something terrible.

284
00:57:31,236 --> 00:57:34,232
For something terrible rests in the brain of

285
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:36,825
the person who branded this with his signature.

286
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,061
It's so subserviently used.

287
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:40,931
This infamous thing!

288
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:44,565
You can be sure that the creator's a man.

289
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:48,793
A man who thinks he's superior and a protector,

290
00:57:50,026 --> 00:57:51,620
and who doesn't like us.

291
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:02,146
However,

292
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:04,802
he's never understood what we've been through.

293
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:07,203
They're scared of us,

294
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:09,328
like children are scared of the dark.

295
00:58:29,164 --> 00:58:30,418
Tell me,

296
00:58:31,671 --> 00:58:35,475
did I lose my dignity by acting like this in front of you?

297
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:38,811
Tell me.

298
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:54,335
<i>Fourth night...</i>

299
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:07,600
Do you see anything?

300
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,383
You don't see anything, do you?

301
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:24,183
See, I can hide it inside me as long as I like.

302
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,645
And I can make it come out.

303
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:31,849
When I want to.

304
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:45,169
What confuses you is that women sigh at men's desires.

305
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:46,906
No...no.

306
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:48,911
Yes.

307
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:51,011
You know.

308
00:59:52,953 --> 00:59:54,981
We're everything you see there...nothing.

309
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:56,238
Nothing exists.

310
00:59:56,823 --> 00:59:59,111
Perhaps apart from what gives me pleasure:

311
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:01,090
The movement of your hand,

312
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:05,230
as you put this stone dildo inside me.

313
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:10,255
As you see,

314
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,304
you can see.

315
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:47,494
It's beautiful. It looks like you're bleeding.

316
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,941
You're scared, as you think you're bleeding.

317
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,990
Even though you know you're not.

318
01:02:56,183 --> 01:02:59,243
And this hemorrhage is from the fertile blood of women.

319
01:03:02,568 --> 01:03:04,758
You're wondering if I've cursed you

320
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:06,961
and ruined your penis forever.

321
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:08,491
Yes I am.

322
01:03:10,195 --> 01:03:11,865
When you thrust into a man's anus,

323
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:15,093
it worries you that sometimes you come out with your penis soiled.

324
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:18,514
And you're not angry with them, nor sad, nor scared.

325
01:03:20,651 --> 01:03:22,209
That happens sometimes.

326
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:25,044
But fecal matter

327
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:26,195
is inert.

328
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,016
It's finished the life cycle.

329
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:34,350
It's part of a human nature.

330
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:41,996
A man can't give life.

331
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,308
He takes it.

332
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:50,628
He gives love,

333
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,847
and hence, eternal life.

334
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:28,088
<i>Whilst leaving, she slipped me the money that I'd earnt.</i>

335
01:04:29,043 --> 01:04:32,551
<i>By keeping the money, I lost the sense of illusion. I lost her.</i>

336
01:04:33,694 --> 01:04:35,280
<i>I knew it at once.</i>

337
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,915
<i>But I actually felt intimidated.</i>

338
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,984
<i>And I had taken the money,</i>

339
01:04:41,104 --> 01:04:43,027
<i>although I actually wanted to refuse it.</i>

340
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,025
Here,

341
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:49,158
same again, please.

342
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:59,129
Two! One more for him.

343
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:06,052
Stop thinking about it.

344
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,024
Stop thinking about it; she was a bitch,

345
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,606
a whore,

346
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,796
just like the others.

347
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,049
Yes,

348
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:24,983
but the queen of whores.

349
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:32,702
I tore her pussy apart so badly, that nobody else will want her.

350
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,337
You're right.

351
01:05:40,264 --> 01:05:41,765
You shag them like goats.

352
01:05:42,074 --> 01:05:43,169
Just like goats.

353
01:05:43,289 --> 01:05:45,218
As many as you can.

354
01:05:46,687 --> 01:05:47,894
It's so that...

355
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:50,407
you're immune to them all.

356
01:05:52,526 --> 01:05:54,729
Because if you let one get under your skin,

357
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,439
You're screwed.

358
01:05:57,559 --> 01:05:58,688
You're fucked.

359
01:05:58,808 --> 01:06:00,176
But she's ruined me.

360
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:02,491
You see? She's ruined me.

361
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:04,990
But there's booze and she can't take that.

362
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,175
They can't take that.

363
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,252
They cannot, you see?

364
01:06:21,428 --> 01:06:23,351
I made her crap her shit

365
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:25,147
and lie in her piss.

366
01:06:26,185 --> 01:06:27,216
The bitch.

367
01:06:27,624 --> 01:06:29,715
She was ruined once I left her.

368
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:33,841
No human being would let me use her the way I did.

369
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:40,779
But she wanted it.

370
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:42,267
She wanted more!

371
01:06:43,025 --> 01:06:44,625
She still wanted more!

372
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:51,598
She would've wanted me to rip her guts out and made her eat them.

373
01:06:52,327 --> 01:06:53,745
Yeah, you're right.

374
01:06:59,267 --> 01:07:00,011
Yeah.

375
01:07:12,139 --> 01:07:14,413
I didn't even bother to find out her name.

376
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:19,717
I knew her.

377
01:07:23,198 --> 01:07:25,303
I knew her in a very intimate way.

378
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:30,221
And I didn't even give a shit about her name.

379
01:07:47,127 --> 01:07:48,264
I don't need it.

380
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,845
Neither do I.

381
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:33,941
<i>I refused to believe that was she gave was now mine.</i>

382
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:37,211
<i>And I could draw my existence from it.</i>

383
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:41,112
<i>I so badly wanted to start over again from the beginning.</i>

384
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:44,199
<i>But this time knowing what I was doing.</i>

385
01:09:45,596 --> 01:09:48,220
<i>I didn't want to admit that life was not like this.</i>

386
01:09:48,924 --> 01:09:52,082
<i>Because nothing can ever exactly start again.</i>

387
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:35,119
