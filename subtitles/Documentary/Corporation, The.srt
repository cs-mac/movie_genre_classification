1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,740
150 years ago

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,825
the business corporation

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,850
was a relatively
insignificant institution.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,620
Today it is all pervasive.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,745
Like the church

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,850
the monarchy
and the communist party

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,770
in other times and places

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,460
the corporation is today's
dominant institution.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,740
This documentary
examines the nature,

10
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:31,220
evolution, impacts and
possible futures

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,690
of the modern
business corporation.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,220
Initially given a narrow
legal mandate

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,540
what has allowed today's
corporation to achieve

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,760
such extraordinary power
and influence over our lives?

15
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,860
We begin our inquiry as
scandals threaten to trigger

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,620
a wide debate about the lack
of public control

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,850
over big corporations.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:00,020
I think there is an overhang
over the market, of distrust.

19
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:02,170
listen, 95 percent
or some percent

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,330
huge percentage

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,140
of the business
community are honest

22
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,570
and uh, reveal
all their assets

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,890
got compensation
programs that are balanced.

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,980
But there are
some bad apples...

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,930
the media debate about
the basic operating principles

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,090
of the corporate world
was quickly reduced

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,985
to a game of
follow the leader.

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,340
I still happen to think
the United States

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,780
is the greatest place
in the world to invest.

30
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:25,740
We have some shake ups
that are going on

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,010
because of a few
bad apples.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,580
Some people call me
a bad apple

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,060
but I may be bruised
but I still taste sweet.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,380
Some people call me
a bad apple

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,860
but I may be the sweetest
apple on the tree.

36
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,450
These are not just
a bunch of bad apples.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,290
This is just
a few bad apples.

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,025
This is not just
a few bad apples.

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,890
You've gotta get rid
of the bad apples

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,100
You can start
with Tyco

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,345
Bad apples

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,780
We know all
about WorldCom.

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,225
Bad apples

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,300
Xerox Corporation.

45
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,020
Bad apples

46
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,930
Arthur Anderson.

47
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,940
Bad apples

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,660
Enron obviously

49
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:10,220
bad apples.

50
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,610
K-mart Corporation

51
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,425
Bad apples

52
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,940
the fruit cart is
getting a little more full.

53
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,220
I don’t think it's just a
few apples unfortunately.

54
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,050
I think this is the worst
crisis of confidence

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,820
in business.

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong
with this picture?

57
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,940
Can we not pick
a better metaphor

58
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,580
to describe the dominant
institution of our time?

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,780
Through the voices of CEOs
whistle blowers

60
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:35,620
brokers gurus and spies

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,570
insiders and outsiders

62
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,320
we present the corporation
as a paradox

63
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:42,580
an institution which
creates great wealth

64
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,460
but causes enormous
and often hidden harms.

65
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,730
I see the corporation
as part of a jigsaw

66
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,140
in society as a whole

67
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,880
which if you remove it

68
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,540
the picture’s incomplete.

69
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,460
But equally if it's
the only part

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,090
it's not going to work.

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,265
A sports team.

72
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,340
Some of us are
blocking and tackling.

73
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,620
Some of us
are running the ball

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,620
some of us are
throwing the ball.

75
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,260
But we all have
a common purpose

76
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,890
which is to succeed
as an organization.

77
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,460
A corporations
like a family unit.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,660
People in a corporation work
together for a common end

79
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,450
Like the telephone system

80
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,980
it reaches almost
everywhere.

81
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,140
It's extraordinarily powerful
it's pretty hard to avoid.

82
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,940
And it transforms
the lives of people

83
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,460
I think on balance

84
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,620
for the better.

85
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,810
The eagle

86
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,940
soaring clear eyed
competitive

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,425
prepared to strike
but not a vulture.

88
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,010
Noble visionary majestic
that people can believe in

89
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,420
and be inspired by

90
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,930
that creates such
a lift that it soars.

91
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,820
I can see that being
a good logo

92
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,620
for the principled
company.

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,980
Okay guys
enough bullshit.

94
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,300
Corporations are
artificial creations.

95
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,100
You might say
they’re monsters

96
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,500
trying to devour as much
profit as possible

97
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,380
at anyone's expense.

98
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,850
I think of a whale.

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,385
A gentle big fish

100
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,210
which could swallow you
in an instant.

101
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:56,460
Dr. Frankenstein's creation

102
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,755
has overwhelmed and
overpowered him.

103
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,610
As the corporate form
has done with us.

104
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,300
The word corporate gets
attached in almost

105
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:19,740
you know in a
pejorative sense to

106
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,185
and gets married
with the word agenda.

107
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,530
And one hears a lot about
the corporate agenda

108
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,140
as though it is evil

109
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,140
as though it is an agenda

110
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,490
which is trying
to take over the world.

111
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,500
Personally I don't
use the word "corporation "

112
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,700
I use the word business.

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,220
I will use the word
use the word company.

114
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,020
I will use the words
business community

115
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,340
cause I think that is a much
fairer representation

116
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,210
than zeroing in on just
this word corporation.

117
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,130
It's funny that I've taught
in a business school

118
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,210
for as long as I have

119
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,780
without ever having
been asked so pointedly

120
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,090
to say what I think
a corporation is.

121
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,220
...it is one form of
business ownership.

122
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,650
It's a group of individuals
working together to serve

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,690
a variety of objectives.

124
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,090
The principal one
of which is earning large

125
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,570
growing sustained
legal returns

126
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,730
for the people who
own the business.

127
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,890
The modern corporation has
grown out of the industrial age.

128
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,745
The industrial age
began in 1712

129
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,380
with an Englishman named
Thomas Newcomen

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,785
invented a steam driven
pump to pump water

131
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,580
out of the English coalmine
so the English coalminers

132
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,340
could get more
coal to mine

133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,300
rather than hauling
buckets of water

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,425
out of the mine

135
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,500
It was all about productivity
more coal per man hour.

136
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,370
That was the dawn of
the industrial age.

137
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,260
And then it became more
steel per man hour

138
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,810
more textiles
per man hour

139
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,025
more automobiles
per man hour

140
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,180
and today it's more
chips per man hour

141
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,580
more gizmos per man hour.

142
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,485
The system is basically
the same system

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,180
producing more
sophisticated products today.

144
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,945
The dominant role of
corporations in our lives

145
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,660
is essentially a product of
roughly the past century.

146
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,340
Corporations were originally
associations of people

147
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,820
who were chartered
by a state

148
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,140
to perform some
particular function.

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,275
Like a group of people
want to build abridge

150
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,050
over the Charles River
or something like that.

151
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,140
There were very few
chartered corporations

152
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,210
in early United
States history.

153
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,570
And the ones that existed
had clear stipulations

154
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,480
in their state
issued charters

155
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,220
how long they
could operate

156
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,465
the amount of
capitalization

157
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,570
what they made or did
or maintained

158
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,450
a turnpike whatever was
in their charter

159
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,690
and they didn't
do anything else.

160
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,330
They didn't own or couldn't
own another corporation.

161
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,580
Their shareholders
were liable.

162
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,370
And so on.

163
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,820
In both law and the culture
the corporation was considered

164
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,220
a subordinate entity that was
a gift from the people

165
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,250
in order to serve
the public good.

166
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,745
So you have that history

167
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,930
and we shouldn't
be misled by it

168
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,940
it's not as if these
were the halcyon days

169
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,490
when all corporations
served the public trust

170
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,170
but there's a lot
to learn from that.

171
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,580
The Civil War and the
Industrial Revolution

172
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,420
created enormous growth
in corporations.

173
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:51,180
And so there was an explosion
of railroads

174
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,540
who got large federal
subsidies of land.

175
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,090
Banking heavily
manufacturing

176
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,900
And corporate lawyers
a century and a half ago

177
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,275
realized that they needed
more power to operate

178
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,530
And wanted to remove some
of the constraints

179
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,780
that had historically been
placed on the corporate form.

180
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,880
The 14th amendment
was passed

181
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:15,700
at the end of the Civil War

182
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,500
to give equal rights
to black people.

183
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,010
And therefore it said

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,330
No state can deprive
any person of life

185
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,135
liberty or property
without due process of law.

186
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,730
And that was intended
to prevent the states

187
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,210
from taking away life
liberty or property

188
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,930
from black people
as they had done

189
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,980
for so much of
our history.

190
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,100
And what happens is the
corporations come into court

191
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,130
and corporation lawyers
are very clever.

192
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,450
And they say

193
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,700
Oh you cant deprive
a person of life

194
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:47,770
liberty or property.

195
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,210
We are a person.

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,905
A corporation is a person.

197
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,660
And so supreme court
goes along with that.

198
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,010
And what was particularly
grotesque about this was

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,100
that the 14th amendment
was passed

200
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:04,060
to protect newly
freed slaves.

201
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,185
So for instance
between 1890 and 1910

202
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,500
there were 307 cases brought
before the court

203
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,900
under the 14th amendment.

204
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,380
288 of these brought
by corporations

205
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:20,460
19 by African Americans.

206
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,220
600000 people were killed
to get rights for people

207
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,440
and then with strokes of
the pen over the next 30years

208
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:40,300
judges applied those rights
to capital and property

209
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,980
while stripping them
from people.

210
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,380
Everybody makes a mistake
once in a while

211
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,770
but I just cant be
personally responsible.

212
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,050
That's one of the weaknesses
of a partnership

213
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,570
isn't it Sid?

214
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,770
Well maybe you’d better
incorporate the store.

215
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,970
Incorporate?!

216
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,140
Yes

217
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,380
Incorporating would give you
the big advantage of

218
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:18,820
what you want right now
limited liability.

219
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,940
You start with a
group of people

220
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,900
who wanna invest their
money in accompany.

221
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,730
Then these people apply for
a charter as a corporation.

222
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,370
This government issues a
charter to that corporation.

223
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,450
Now that corporation operates
legally as an individual person

224
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:39,980
it is not a group of people

225
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,060
it is under the law
a legal person.

226
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,810
Imperial Steel Incorporated
has many of the legal rights

227
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,500
of a person.

228
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,180
It can buy and
sell property...

229
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,345
It can borrow money.

230
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,180
It can sue in court
and be sued.

231
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,020
It can carry
on a business.

232
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,370
Imperial Steel

233
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,380
along with thousands
of other legal persons

234
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,100
is a part of our
daily living.

235
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,700
It is a member
of our society.

236
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,650
Having acquired the legal rights
and protections of a person

237
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,450
the question arises

238
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,140
What kind of person
is the corporation?

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,770
Corporations were given
the rights of immortal persons.

240
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,770
But then special
kinds of persons

241
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,500
persons who had no
moral conscience.

242
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,460
These are a special
kind of persons

243
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,620
which are designed by law
to be concerned

244
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:40,140
only for their
stockholders.

245
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,650
And not say what
are sometimes

246
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,050
called their stakeholders

247
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,540
like the community or the
work force or whatever.

248
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,370
The great problems of having
corporate citizens

249
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,820
is that they aren’t
like the rest of us.

250
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,660
As Baron Thurlow in England
is supposed to have said

251
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,740
They have no soul to save

252
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,660
and they have no body
to incarcerate.

253
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,530
I believe the mistake that
a lot of people make

254
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,930
when they think
about corporations

255
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,505
is they think you know
corporations are like us.

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,930
General Electric is a kind
old man with lots of stories.

257
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,980
Nike young energetic.

258
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,250
Microsoft aggressive

259
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,380
McDonald's young
outgoing enthusiastic

260
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:29,580
Monsanto immaculately dressed

261
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,260
Disney goofy.

262
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,980
The Body Shop
um deceptive

263
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,380
very lovely.

264
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,410
Do you know what the
body shop is?

265
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,425
Nope.

266
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,530
They have feelings
they have politics

267
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,265
they have belief systems

268
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,970
they really only
have one thing

269
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,500
the bottom line

270
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,020
How to make as much
money as they can

271
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,260
in any given quarter.

272
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,380
That's it.

273
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,290
Of course they
make a profit

274
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,785
and it's a good thing.

275
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,580
That's the incentive that
makes capitalism work.

276
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,420
To give us more
of the things that we need.

277
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,580
That’s the incentive that
other economic systems lack.

278
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,300
People accuse
us of only paying attention

279
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,660
to the economic leg

280
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:10,825
because they think

281
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,820
that’s what a business
persons mind set is

282
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,820
it's just money.

283
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,380
And it's not so

284
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,010
because we as
business people

285
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,940
know that wanted to certainly
address the environment

286
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,460
but also we need to be seen as

287
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,860
constructive members
of society.

288
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,770
There are companies that do
good for the communities.

289
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,650
They produce
services and goods

290
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,160
that are of value to all of us

291
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:40,500
that make our
lives better

292
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,210
and that's a good thing.

293
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,410
The problem comes in
the profit motivation here

294
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:48,570
because these people

295
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,755
there’s no such
thing as enough.

296
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,730
And I always
counter point out

297
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,380
there’s no organization
on this planet

298
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,340
that can neglect
its economic foundation.

299
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,460
Even someone living under
a banyan tree is dependent

300
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,060
on support from someone.

301
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,890
Economic leg has to be
addressed by everyone.

302
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,625
It's not just
a business issue.

303
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,500
But unlike someone
under a banyan tree

304
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,380
all publicly
traded corporations

305
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,450
has been structured

306
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,650
through a series
of legal decisions

307
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,780
to have a peculiar and
disturbing characteristic.

308
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,865
They are required
by law

309
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,500
to place the financial
interests of their owners

310
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,540
above competing interests.

311
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,985
In fact the corporation
is legally bound

312
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,820
to put its bottom line
ahead of everything else

313
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,980
even the public good.

314
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,290
That’s not
a law of nature

315
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,130
that's a very
specific decision.

316
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,610
In fact
a judicial decision.

317
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,675
So they’re concerned only
for the short term profit

318
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,570
of their stockholders who are
very highly concentrated.

319
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,020
To whom do these
companies owe loyalty?

320
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,720
What does loyalty mean?

321
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,300
Well it turns
out that

322
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,650
that was a rather
naive concept anyways

323
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,225
as corporations are
always owed obligation

324
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,980
to themselves to get large
and to get profitable.

325
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,340
In doing this

326
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,535
it tends to be more
profitable to the extent

327
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,490
it can make other
people pay the bills

328
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,465
for its impact
on society.

329
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,780
There's a terrible word that
economists use for this

330
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,540
called externalities.

331
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,610
An externality is the effect
of a transaction

332
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,780
between two individuals.

333
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,610
Third party who
has not consented to

334
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,540
or played any role
in the carrying out

335
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,945
of that transaction

336
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,730
And there are real
problems in that area.

337
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,705
There’s no
doubt about it.

338
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,620
Running a business is
a tough proposition.

339
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,220
There are costs to be
minimized at every turn

340
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,855
and at some point
the corporation says

341
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,290
you know let somebody
else deal with that.

342
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,690
Let's let somebody else
supply the military power

343
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,340
to the middle east to protect
the oil at its source.

344
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,090
Let's let somebody else build
the roads that we can drive

345
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,900
these automobiles on.

346
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,700
Let's let somebody
else have those problems

347
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:23,220
And that is where
externalities come from

348
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,660
that notion of let somebody
else deal with that.

349
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,105
I got all I can
handle myself.

350
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,530
A corporation is an
externalizing machine

351
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,010
in the same way that a shark
is a killing machine.

352
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,220
Each one is designed
in a very efficient way

353
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,740
to accomplish
particular objectives.

354
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,930
In the achievement
of those objectives

355
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,300
there isn’t any question
of malevolence or of will.

356
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,250
The enterprise
has within it

357
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,850
and the shark
has within it

358
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,490
those characteristics that
enable it to do that

359
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,540
for which it was designed.

360
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,770
The pressure is
on the corporation

361
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,130
to deliver results now

362
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,105
and to externalize
any cost

363
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,340
that this unwary
or uncaring public

364
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,500
will allow it
to eternalize.

365
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,540
To determine the kind
of personality

366
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:22,820
that drives the corporation

367
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,210
to behave like
an externalizing machine

368
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,370
we can analyze it

369
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,460
like a psychiatrist
would a patient.

370
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,410
We can even formulate
a diagnosis

371
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,970
on the basis of typical
case histories of harm

372
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,130
that is inflicted
on others

373
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,420
selected from a universe
of corporate activity.

374
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,780
Well this is the office

375
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,145
of the national
labour committee

376
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,300
here in the garment area
of New York City.

377
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,065
It's a little
bit dishevelled.

378
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,700
These are all from
different campaigns.

379
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,010
To make this stuff
concrete as possible

380
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,770
we purchased all of
the products from the factories

381
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,105
that we're talking about.

382
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,610
This shirt sells
for $14.99.

383
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,170
And the women who made
this shirt got paid $0.03.

384
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,210
Liz Claiborne jackets
made in El Salvador

385
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,540
The jackets are $178

386
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,770
and the workers were
paid $0.74

387
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,530
for every jacket they made.

388
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,980
Alpine car stereos
$0.31 an hour.

389
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,155
It's not just sneakers.

390
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,210
It's not just apparel.

391
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,380
It's everything.

392
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,530
We were in Honduras

393
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,300
and some workers they knew
what kind of work we did

394
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,620
and they approached
us and said

395
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,020
conditions in our
factory are horrible.

396
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,730
Will you please
meet with us.

397
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,860
And we said we would.

398
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,140
But you cant meet in
the developing world

399
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,570
you cant walk up in
a factory with your notebook

400
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,490
and workers come
up and interview them.

401
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,810
I mean there's
goons there’s spies

402
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:06,290
the military police

403
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,220
so you do everything
in a clandestine manner.

404
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,300
We are about
to start the meeting

405
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,140
and in walk three guys

406
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,060
very tough looking guys.

407
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,220
The company had found
out about our meeting

408
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,300
and sent these spies.

409
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,370
Obviously we didn’t
have the meeting.

410
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,260
But these young girls
were really bright

411
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:23,010
And as they
were leaving

412
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,105
away from the eyesight
of the spies

413
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,340
they started to put their hands
underneath the table.

414
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,900
And I put my hand
under there

415
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,770
and they put into my hand
their pay stubs.

416
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,740
So we'd know
who they were

417
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,100
what they were paid

418
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,980
and the labels that
they made in the factory

419
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,985
so wed know who
they worked for.

420
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,740
So I took my hand
after everyone had left.

421
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,180
And in the palm
of my hand

422
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,970
was the face was of
Kathy Lee Gifford

423
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,105
And on the bottom
of it was

424
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,740
A portion of the proceeds
from the sale of this garment

425
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,980
would be donated to various
children’s charities.

426
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,130
Very touching
gets you right here.

427
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,210
Wal-Mart is telling you
if you purchase these pants

428
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,100
and Kathy Lee
is telling you

429
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,115
if you purchase
these pants

430
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,090
you will be
helping children.

431
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,860
The problem was

432
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,570
the people that
handed us this label

433
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,740
were 13 years of age.

434
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,610
Do many people
in your family work here?

435
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,465
Just me.

436
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,820
How many people
do you support?

437
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,540
Eight people?

438
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,970
And how do you do it with
that salary is it enough?

439
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:18,210
No.

440
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,660
Let's look at it from
a different point of view

441
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,580
Let's look at it
from a point of view

442
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,650
of the people in Bangladesh
who are starving to death.

443
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,050
The people in China
who are starving to death

444
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,620
and the only thing that they
have to offer to anybody

445
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,140
that is worth anything

446
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,500
is their low
cost labour.

447
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,620
And in effect what
they’re saying to the world

448
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,010
is they have this big
flag that says

449
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,105
Come over and hire us.

450
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,940
We will work
for $0.10 an hour.

451
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,220
Because $0.10 an hour
will buy us the rice

452
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,220
that's wanted not
to starve.

453
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,380
And come and rescue us
from our circumstance.

454
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,945
And so when Nike comes in

455
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,370
they are regarded by
everybody in the community

456
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,940
as an enormous godsend.

457
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,890
Hey wait!

458
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,820
You are not
permitted to be here!

459
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:23,450
The door was wide open.

460
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,410
No no no no no.

461
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,460
That’s my clothes.

462
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:26,300
Those are my clothes.

463
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,180
This is not your clothes.

464
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,745
Why your camera!?

465
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,930
Don’t touch the woman.

466
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:31,780
Why!?

467
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,970
This is a private company.

468
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,060
Without permission
how can you come here?

469
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,660
Yes well the door
was wide open

470
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,060
The doors
for employees

471
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,610
not for you.

472
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,180
We went through
the garbage dump

473
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,250
in the Dominican
Republic.

474
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,260
We always do this
kind of stuff

475
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:50,660
we dig around.

476
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,460
One day we found
a big pile

477
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,860
of Nikes internal
pricing documents.

478
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,500
Nike assigns a time
frame to each operation.

479
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,610
They don’t talk
about minutes.

480
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,460
They break the timeframe into
ten thousandths of a second.

481
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,885
You get to the bottom
of all 22 operations;

482
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,300
they give the workers 6.6
minutes to make the shirt.

483
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,330
It's $0.70 an hour
in the Dominican Republic.

484
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,860
That’s 6.6 minutes
equals $0.08.

485
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,905
These are Nikes documents.

486
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,060
That means the wages come to
three tenths of one percent

487
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,860
of the retail price.

488
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:21,380
This is the reality.

489
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,340
It's the science
of exploitation.

490
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,420
What happens in the areas
where these corporations

491
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,770
go in and are successful?

492
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,010
They soon find that they cant
do any more in that country

493
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,540
because the wages
are too high now.

494
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,820
And what’s that another
way of saying

495
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:49,985
well the people are
no longer desperate.

496
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,620
So okay we’ve used up
all the desperate people there

497
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,700
they’re all plump and
healthy and wealthy.

498
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,660
Let’s move on to the next
desperate lot and employ them

499
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:00,940
and raise their level up.

500
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,530
Well the whole idea of
the export processing zone

501
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,700
is that it will be the
first step towards

502
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,905
this wonderful
new development

503
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,540
through the investment that’s
attracted to these countries

504
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,260
there will be
a trickle down effect

505
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,460
into the communities.

506
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,820
But because so many countries
are now in the game

507
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,420
of creating these
free trade enclaves

508
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,300
they have to keep providing
more and more incentives

509
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,380
for companies to come to their
little denationalized pocket.

510
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:42,185
And the tax holidays
get longer.

511
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,290
So the workers rarely
make enough money

512
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,025
to buy
three meals a days

513
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,180
let alone feed
their local economy.

514
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,580
Something happened in 1940

515
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,145
which marked the beginning
of a new era.

516
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:29,780
The era of the ability
to synthesize and create.

517
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,785
On an unlimited scale

518
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,420
new chemicals that had
never existed before

519
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,820
in the world.

520
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,025
And using the
magic of research

521
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,420
oil companies compete
with each other

522
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,220
in taking the petroleum
molecule apart

523
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,890
and rearranging it into
well you name it...

524
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,460
So suddenly it became possible

525
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,740
to produce any new chemical

526
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,140
synthetic chemicals

527
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,260
the likes of which had never
existed before in the world

528
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:59,060
for any purpose and
at virtually no cost.

529
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,740
Fabrics toot brushes
tires insecticides

530
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,730
cosmetics weed killers.

531
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,340
A whole galaxy of things to
make a better life on earth.

532
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,690
For instance if you wanted
to go to a chemist and say

533
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:19,020
look I want to have
a chemical say a pesticide

534
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,385
which will persist
throughout the food chain

535
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,570
and I don’t want to have
to renew it very very often

536
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,980
Id like it to be
relatively non-destructible

537
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,010
and then he’d put two
benzene molecules

538
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,810
on the blackboard and
add a chlorine here

539
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:35,940
and a chlorine there

540
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,340
that was DDT!

541
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,420
When the eighth army needed
Jap civilians to help them out

542
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,865
in our occupation

543
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,500
they called on native
doctors to administer DDT

544
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,580
under the supervision
of our men

545
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,060
to stand a potential
typhus epidemic.

546
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,980
Dusting like this goes a long
way in checking disease

547
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:54,970
and the laughs on them.

548
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,660
"Pardon our dust"

549
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,340
As the petrochemical
era grew and grew

550
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,220
warning signs emerged that
some of these chemicals

551
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,650
could pose hazards.

552
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,100
The data initially were
trivial anecdotal

553
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,105
but gradually a body of data
started accumulating

554
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,770
to the extent that we now know
that the synthetic chemicals

555
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,540
which have permeated
our workplace

556
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,260
our consumer products

557
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,050
our air our water

558
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,100
produced cancer
and also birth defects

559
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,610
and some other
toxic effects.

560
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Furthermore industry
has known about this

561
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,370
at least most industries
have known about this

562
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,980
and have attempted
to trivialize these risks.

563
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,330
If I take a gun and shoot
you that’s criminal.

564
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,860
If I expose you
to some chemicals

565
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:34,180
which knowingly are
going to kill you

566
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,780
what difference is there?

567
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,140
The difference is that it
takes longer to kill you.

568
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,330
We are now in the midst
of a major cancer epidemic

569
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:46,370
and I have no doubt

570
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,530
and I have documented
the basis for this

571
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,380
that industry is
largely responsible

572
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,580
for this overwhelming
epidemic of cancer

573
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,620
in which one in every two men
get cancer in their lifetimes

574
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:04,890
and one in every three
women get cancer.

575
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,260
Towards the end
of 1989

576
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,340
a great box of documents
arrived at my office

577
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,140
without any indication
where they came from.

578
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,820
And I opened them

579
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,140
and found in it a complete
set of Monsanto files

580
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:41,260
dealing with toxicological
testing of cows

581
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:42,820
who’d been given RBGH.

582
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,140
BST trade name Posilac is
being used in more than

583
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,820
a quarter of the dairy herds
in the United States

584
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,265
according to Monsanto.

585
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,610
The milk is being drunk
by a large portion

586
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,290
of the American population

587
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,500
since the food and drug
administration declared it safe

588
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,425
for both cows and humans...

589
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,370
And at that the
Monsanto was saying

590
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,610
There’s no
evidence whatsoever

591
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,020
of any adverse affects

592
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,900
We don’t use antibiotics.

593
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,810
And this clearly showed
that they had lied

594
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:10,420
through their teeth.

595
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,140
The files described areas
of chronic inflammation

596
00:30:19,175 --> 00:30:20,850
in the heart lungs
kidneys spleen

597
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,850
also reproductive effects

598
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,140
also a whole series
of other problems.

599
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,340
...the most comprehensive
independent assessment of the drug

600
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,980
"concludes that BST
results in unnecessary pain

601
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,585
suffering and
distress for the cows.

602
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,220
This is not acceptable
for a drug designed simply

603
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,540
to increase milk production...

604
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,745
It is a silly product.

605
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,380
We have the industrial
world is awash in milk.

606
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,980
We're over producing milk.

607
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,010
We actually have governments
around the world

608
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,865
who pay farmers not
to produce milk.

609
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,130
So the first product
Monsanto comes up with

610
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,450
is a product that produces
more of what we don’t need.

611
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,940
Of course you’ll want to inject
Posilac in every eligible cow

612
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,420
as each cow is not treated
is a lost income opportunity.

613
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,745
But the problem was

614
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,740
that use of
the artificial hormone

615
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,020
caused all sorts of
problems for the cows.

616
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,945
It caused something
called mastitis

617
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,500
which is a very painful
infection of the udders.

618
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,700
When you milk the cow

619
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,820
if the cow
has bad mastitis

620
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:24,340
some of the

621
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
and I don’t know how to
say this in a you know

622
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,300
I hope people aren’t
watching at dinnertime

623
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:30,660
but the pus from the
infection of the udders

624
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,940
ends up in the milk.

625
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,140
And the somatic cell
count they call it

626
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,505
the bacteria count

627
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,300
inside your
milk goes up.

628
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,980
There’s a cost to the cows.

629
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,650
The cows get sicker when
they’re injected with RBGH.

630
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:47,820
They’re injected
with antibiotics.

631
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,290
We know that people are
consuming antibiotics

632
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,570
through their food

633
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,420
and we know that
that’s contributing

634
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,500
to antibiotic resistant
bacteria and diseases.

635
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,380
And we know we're at a
crisis when somebody can go

636
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,810
into a hospital and
get a staff infection

637
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,050
and it cant be
cured and they die.

638
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,860
That’s a crisis.

639
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:07,420
Bad for the cow

640
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,410
Bad for the farmer

641
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,650
Bad potentially
for the consumer

642
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,905
The jury is out

643
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,820
we see a lot of
conflicting evidence

644
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,895
about potential
health risk.

645
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,450
And of course
as a consumer

646
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,980
my belief is why
should I take any risk?

647
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,370
Factory farm cows have not
been the only victims

648
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,060
of Monsanto products.

649
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,810
Large areas of Vietnam were
deforested by the us military

650
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,260
using Monsanto’s agent orange.

651
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,460
The toxic herbicide
reportedly caused

652
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,105
over 50,000 birth defects

653
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,290
and hundreds of thousands of cancers
in Vietnamese civilians and soldiers

654
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,060
and in former American troops
serving in South East Asia.

655
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,145
Unlike the Vietnamese victims

656
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,900
U.S. Vietnam war veterans
exposed to Agent Orange

657
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,370
were able to sue Monsanto
for causing their illnesses.

658
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,570
Monsanto settled
out of court

659
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,655
paying $80 million
in damages.

660
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,570
But it never
admitted guilt

661
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,610
Sleeping in a motel
in Brewer Maine one night

662
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,980
I woke up with
terrible hay fever

663
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,540
and my eyes were burning.

664
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,140
And I looked out
at the river

665
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,050
and there were great
mounds of white foam

666
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,825
going right
down the river.

667
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,090
And the next morning
I got up and I said

668
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,740
My God what was
that happening last night

669
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,940
He said "Oh that’s
just the river".

670
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,945
And I said
"what do you mean?"

671
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,500
He said "Well look every
night the paper company sends

672
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,785
the stuff down the river."

673
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,140
And I said "What are
you talking about?"

674
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,580
And he said "Don’t
you understand?"

675
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,930
"That show we get rid of the
effluent from the paper mills."

676
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,970
Well I knew at that time
I had been in the business.

677
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,850
I had sold oil
to the paper mills.

678
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,820
I knew all the owners.

679
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:06,745
I had been in politics.

680
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,850
I knew the people
in the towns.

681
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,340
I knew not one constituent
of the paper mills

682
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,490
wanted to have
the river polluted.

683
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,865
And yet here the river
was being polluted.

684
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,500
And it was more or less as
if we created a doom machine.

685
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,700
In our search for wealth
and for prosperity

686
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,660
we created something that’s
going to destroy us.

687
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,700
The traders who are
involved in the market

688
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,170
are not guys
who are

689
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,105
whose moral fibre

690
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,940
when it comes to
environmental conditions

691
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,100
are going to be
rattled at all

692
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,780
They’re seeing dollars
and they’re making money.

693
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,860
Brokers don’t stay away
from copper

694
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,300
because it violates
their religious beliefs

695
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,140
or your environmental
policies.

696
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,580
No.

697
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,060
There are times
when you think about it

698
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,505
but it's fleeting.

699
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,280
It really is
a fleeting moment.

700
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,020
It's like yeah
oh yeah yeah

701
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,580
well a town is being
polluted down there in Peru

702
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,420
but hey this guy
needs to buy some copper.

703
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,985
I’m getting paid
a commission too.

704
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,930
Our information that we receive
does not include anything

705
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,305
about the environmental
conditions

706
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,300
because until
the environmental conditions

707
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,540
become a commodity
themselves or are being traded

708
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,020
then obviously we will not
have anything to do with that.

709
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,010
It doesn’t come into
our psyche at all.

710
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,740
It's so far away and
it's you hardly hear

711
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,945
anything about it.

712
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,730
I mean keep in mind there are
things going on right in our

713
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,050
backyards for god sake.

714
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,665
We trade live hogs.

715
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,980
I mean there are so many pigs
in the state of Carolina

716
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,690
and they’re
polluting the rivers

717
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,250
but how often do you
find out about that?

718
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,640
At Multinational Monitor
we’ve put together a list

719
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:56,610
of the top corporate
criminals of the 1990s.

720
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,260
We went back and looked at
all the criminal fines that

721
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:03,100
corporations had
paid in the decade.

722
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,815
Exxon pled guilty in connection
to federal criminal charges

723
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,130
with the Valdez spill and paid
$125 million in criminal fines.

724
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,020
General Electric

725
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,580
was guilty of defrauding
the federal government

726
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:18,220
and paid $9.5 million
in criminal fines.

727
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,020
Chevron was guilty of
environmental violations

728
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,090
and paid $6.5 million
in fines.

729
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,380
Mitsubishi was guilty
of anti-trust violations

730
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,505
and paid $1.8 million in fines.

731
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,260
IBM was guilty of
illegal exports and paid.

732
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,500
Eastman Kodak was guilty of
environmental violations.

733
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:34,140
Pfizer the drug manufacturer

734
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,570
was guilty of
antitrust violations.

735
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,140
Odwalla was guilty of food and
drug regulatory violations.

736
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:42,370
Sears was guilty of...

737
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,770
Damon Clinical Laboratories
was guilty of...

738
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,340
Blue Cross Blue
Shield was guilty of

739
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,020
Again and again we have
the problem

740
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,690
that whether you obey
the law or not

741
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,220
is a matter whether
its cost effective.

742
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,500
If the chance
of getting caught

743
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,060
and the penalties are less
than it costs to comply

744
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,780
people think of it as
just a business decision.

745
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,260
Drawing the metaphor of
the early attempts to fly.

746
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,900
Theban going off of a very
high cliff in his airplane

747
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:39,060
with the wings flapping

748
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,020
and the guys
flapping the wings

749
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,945
and the wind
is in his face

750
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,020
and this poor fool
thinks he’s flying

751
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,495
but in fact
he’s in freefall

752
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,610
and he just doesn’t
know it yet

753
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,820
because the ground
is so far away

754
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,090
but of course the craft
is doomed to crash.

755
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,700
That’s the way our
civilization is

756
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,890
the very high cliff

757
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,380
represents the virtually
unlimited resources

758
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:08,660
we seem to have when
we began this journey.

759
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,290
The craft isn’t flying

760
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,060
because it's not built according
to the laws of aerodynamics

761
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,420
and is subject
to the law of gravity.

762
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,865
Civilization is not flying

763
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,780
because it's not built according
to the laws of aerodynamics

764
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,585
for civilizations
that would fly.

765
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,340
And of course the ground
is still a long way away

766
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,050
but some people have seen
that ground rushing up

767
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,170
sooner than
the rest of us have.

768
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,700
The visionaries have seen it
and have told us its coming.

769
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,345
There’s not a
single scientific

770
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,220
peer reviewed paper published
in the last 25 years

771
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:53,330
that would contradict
this scenario

772
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,460
Every living system
of earth

773
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,425
is in decline

774
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,380
every life support system
of earth is in decline

775
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,625
and these together
constitute the biosphere

776
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,200
the biosphere that supports
and nurtures all of life

777
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:11,740
not just our life but perhaps
30 million other species

778
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,050
that share
this planet with us.

779
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,580
The typical company
of the 20th century

780
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,810
extractive wasteful
abusive linear

781
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:27,530
in all of its processes

782
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,260
taking from the earth

783
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,025
making wasting
sending its products

784
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,370
back to the biosphere
waste to a landfill...

785
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,580
I myself was amazed to learn
just how much stuff

786
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,060
the earth has to produce
through our extraction process

787
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,300
to produce a dollar of
revenue for our company.

788
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:51,900
When I learnt
I was flabbergasted.

789
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,460
We are leaving a terrible
legacy of poison

790
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:08,677
and diminishment
of the environment

791
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:12,860
for our grandchildren’s
grandchildren

792
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,180
generations not yet born.

793
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,060
Some people have called that
intergeneration tyranny

794
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,780
a form of taxation
without representation

795
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:26,460
levied by us
on generations yet to be.

796
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,940
It's the wrong
thing to do.

797
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,210
One of the questions
that comes up periodically

798
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,580
is to what extent could
corporation be considered

799
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,380
to be psychopathic.

800
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,260
And if we look at a corporation
as a legal person

801
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,780
that it may not be that
difficult to actually draw

802
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,140
the transition between
psychopathy in the individual

803
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,860
to psychopathy
in a corporation.

804
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,505
We could go through
the characteristics

805
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,340
that define this particular
disorder one by one

806
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,330
and see how they might
apply to corporations.

807
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,700
They would have all
the characteristics

808
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,730
and in fact
in many respects

809
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,540
the corporation
of that sort

810
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,100
is the proto typical
of a psychopath.

811
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,500
If the dominant institution
of our time has been created

812
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,570
in the image of
a psychopath

813
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,620
who bears moral responsibility
for its actions?

814
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,700
Can a building have
moral opinions?

815
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,940
Can a building have
social responsibility?

816
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,420
If a building cant have
social responsibility

817
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,825
what does it mean to
say a corporation can?

818
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,730
A corporation is simply
an artificial legal structure

819
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,730
but the people
who are engaged in it

820
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,540
whether the stockholder

821
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,810
whether the
executives in it

822
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:57,460
whether the employees

823
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,490
they all have
moral responsibilities.

824
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,700
It's a fair assumption
that every human being

825
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,675
real human beings

826
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,610
flesh and
blood ones

827
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,940
not corporations

828
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,250
but every flesh and blood
human being is a moral person.

829
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,370
You know we've
got the same genes

830
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,900
we're more or less
the same

831
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,250
but our nature

832
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,465
the nature of humans

833
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,090
allows all kinds
of behaviour.

834
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,355
I mean every one of us
under some circumstances

835
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,290
could be a gas chamber
attendant and a saint.

836
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,500
No job in my experience
with Goodyear

837
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,260
has been as frustrating
as the CEO job.

838
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,065
Because even though
the perception is

839
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,700
that you have absolute power
to do whatever you want

840
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:49,420
the reality is
you don’t have that power

841
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,640
sometimes if you had a
really free hand

842
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:55,300
if you really did what
you wanted to do

843
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:58,780
that suits your
personal thoughts

844
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,780
and your personal priorities
you’d act differently.

845
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:04,460
But as a CEO
you cannot do that

846
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,555
Layoffs have become
so wide-spread

847
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,330
that people
tend to believe that

848
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,610
CEOs make these decisions

849
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,060
without any consideration
to the human implications

850
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,100
of their decisions

851
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,610
It is never a decision
that any CEO makes lightly.

852
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,345
It is a tough decision.

853
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,940
But it is the consequence
of modern capitalism

854
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,460
When you look
at a corporation

855
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,610
just like when
you look at a slave owner

856
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,810
you want to distinguish
between the institution

857
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,570
and the individual.

858
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,130
So slavery for example
or other forms of tyranny

859
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,450
are inherently monstrous

860
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,530
but the individuals
participating in them

861
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,060
may be the nicest guys
you could imagine

862
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,490
benevolent friendly
nice to their children

863
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,570
even nice to their slaves
caring about other people.

864
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:04,210
I mean as individuals
they may be anything.

865
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,410
In their institutional
role they're monsters

866
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,860
because the institution
is monstrous.

867
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,540
Then the same is true here.

868
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,900
My wife and I some years
ago had at our home

869
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,995
a demonstration.

870
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,730
25 people arrived

871
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,530
they hung a big banner
on the top of our house

872
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:24,020
saying murderers

873
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,730
they danced around outside
with gasmasks and so on.

874
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,440
As a public demonstration
it wasn’t very effective

875
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:07,860
due to the fact that this
is a very rural area

876
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:08,460
two people and a dog

877
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,060
and it's not
a very big house

878
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,860
which I think rather
surprised them

879
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,130
but then we sat down
and talked to them

880
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:16,425
for a couple of hours

881
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,610
and we gave them
tea and coffee

882
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,540
and they had
lunch on our lawn.

883
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,490
After about 20
minutes they said

884
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,100
Well the problem is
not you. It's Shell.

885
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,980
And I said now wait a
minute lets talk about

886
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,540
what is Shell?

887
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,025
It's made up
of people like me.

888
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,420
In the end what we
found in that discussion

889
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,340
were all the things
they we're worried about

890
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,900
I was worried about as well

891
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,530
climate oppressive
regimes human rights

892
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,985
the big difference
between us was

893
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,900
I feel that I can actually
make a contributions to this

894
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:03,340
these people
were frustrated

895
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,540
because they felt that
they had no nothing to do.

896
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,540
So an individual
CEO lets say

897
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,300
may really care
about the environment

898
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:12,940
and in fact

899
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,305
since they have such
extraordinary resources

900
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,780
they can even devote some of
their resources to that

901
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,650
without violating
their responsibility

902
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,490
to be totally inhuman

903
00:46:24,525 --> 00:46:25,370
which is why

904
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,020
as the Moody-Stuarts
serve tea to protestors

905
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,090
Shell Nigeria can flare
unrivalled amounts of gas

906
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,260
making it of the worlds single
worst sources of pollution.

907
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,640
And all the professed concerns
about the environment

908
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,940
do not spare Ken Saro Wiwa
and eight other activists

909
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,740
from being hung for opposing
Shells environment practices

910
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:47,940
in the Niger Delta.

911
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,740
The corporation
is not a person

912
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,820
it doesn’t think.

913
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:00,740
People in it think

914
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,340
and for them it is legitimate
to create terminator technology.

915
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,940
So that farmers are not
able to save their seeds.

916
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,380
Seeds that will
destroy themselves

917
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,650
through a suicide gene.

918
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,940
Seeds that are designed to only
produce crop in one season.

919
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,425
You really need to
have a brutal mind.

920
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,770
It's a war against evolution
to even think in those terms.

921
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,010
But quite clearly profits are
so much higher in their minds

922
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,425
The profit motive
which drove Klutzy

923
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,060
to accomplish so much
may bring out the evil

924
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,740
as well as the good...

925
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:45,180
Hellooo?

926
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,625
My work spans
all industry sectors

927
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,180
I mean I virtually have
worked for like Id say

928
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,060
25 percent
of the fortune 500.

929
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,610
I’ve posed as
an investment banker.

930
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,930
I’ve posed as a
venture capitalist.

931
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,050
I’ve set up
front companies

932
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,010
that are executive
recruiting firms.

933
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,820
Essentially I’m a spy.

934
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,620
I'll locate
your employees

935
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,770
and I will tell them
that I’m calling

936
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,500
from Acme
Recruiting Agency

937
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,010
and that I’ve got a
job that pays them

938
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,250
considerably more than
what they’re paying.

939
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,620
Would they mind meeting
me for an interview?

940
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,180
And when the executive
shows up

941
00:48:30,215 --> 00:48:31,500
what he doesn’t
realize is

942
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,450
I’m actually debriefing him
on behalf of a competitor.

943
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,730
That there is no job
and that the office

944
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:39,220
that he’s at
has been rented

945
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,020
and the picture on my desk
of my family is a phoney

946
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,360
and it's all just a big
elaborate ruse

947
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:52,500
to glean competitive
information from him.

948
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,180
I don’t feel any guilt.

949
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,450
It's you know what I mean
you have to expect

950
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,770
that guys like me
are out there.

951
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,780
We're predators.

952
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,500
It's about competition
it's about market share

953
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,825
it's about
being aggressive

954
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,020
and it's about
shareholder value.

955
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:21,170
What is your
stock at today?

956
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,460
If you’re a CEO

957
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,860
I mean do you think your
shareholders really care

958
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:31,460
whether you’re Billie
Buttercup or not?

959
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:33,010
Do you think that
they really

960
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,820
they would prefer you
to be a nice guy?

961
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,020
Over having money
in their pocket?

962
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:40,500
I don’t think so.

963
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,180
I think people want money.

964
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,100
That’s the bottom line.

965
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,580
The fact that most of these
companies are run

966
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,450
by white men
white rich men

967
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,660
means that they
are out of touch

968
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,660
with what the majority
of the world is.

969
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,692
Because the majority
of this planet

970
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:56,690
are not a bunch
of rich white guys.

971
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,580
They are people
of other colours

972
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,000
they are the majority.

973
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:01,380
Women are the majority

974
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,540
the poor
and working poor

975
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,180
make up the majority
of this planet.

976
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,665
So the decisions
they make

977
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:14,620
come from not the reality
that exists in the world.

978
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,970
How much is enough?

979
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,380
How much is enough?

980
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,340
If you are a billionaire

981
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,940
would it be okay just
to be a half a billionaire?

982
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,780
Wouldn’t it be okay
for your company

983
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,140
to make a little
less money...

984
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,610
When I bought those
two airplane tickets

985
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,850
for Phil Knight and myself
to fly to Indonesia

986
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,620
I was prepared for him
to say okay lets go.

987
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,340
Oh no not a chance

988
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,180
Not a chance.

989
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:38,010
No?

990
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,860
They’re transferable.

991
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,090
I can change it
to another day.

992
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,315
And call me on it.

993
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,170
Call my bluff.

994
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,305
He’s a smart guy.

995
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,660
I mean he’s not
he’s not stupid.

996
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,530
And so I thought okay
get ready for this.

997
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,460
Especially because you know
I bought first-class tickets.

998
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,500
So you know it would be a
comfortable ride at least

999
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:55,420
you know and of course he
tells me then on camera.

1000
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,050
I’ve never been to Indonesia.

1001
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,130
And I’m like taken
aback by this.

1002
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:00,860
I cant believe it.

1003
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,220
The guys the head
of the company

1004
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,690
he’s never walked through
his own factories.

1005
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,785
Oh you’ve got to go.

1006
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,420
I cant go right now and
the rest of this year.

1007
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,780
When we were done
filming he calls me up

1008
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:12,850
a couple of weeks
later and he goes

1009
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,050
I may have a chance to go
there with you to the factories.

1010
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:24,100
I’m going to the Australian
Open to watch some tennis.

1011
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,770
and uh you know
maybe I can get up there

1012
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,865
or at least
you can go there.

1013
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,820
Would you like to go
to the Australian open?

1014
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:37,930
For 21years

1015
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,820
I never gave a thought
to what we were taking

1016
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,090
from the earth or
doing to the earth

1017
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,170
in the making
of our products.

1018
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,505
And then
in the summer of 1994

1019
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,660
we began to hear questions
from our customers

1020
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,260
we had never
heard before

1021
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,340
What’s your company doing
for the environment?

1022
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,660
And we didn’t have answers.

1023
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,490
The real answer
was not very much.

1024
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,220
And it really disturbed
many of our people

1025
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,505
not me so
much as them

1026
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,500
and a group in our
research department

1027
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,170
decided to convene
a taskforce

1028
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,020
and bring people from our
businesses around the world

1029
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,505
to come together
to assess

1030
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,140
our company’s world wide
environment position

1031
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,265
to begin to frame answers
for those customers.

1032
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,100
They asked me if I would come
and speak to that group

1033
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,065
and give them
a kick off speech

1034
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,570
and launch this new task force
with an environmental vision

1035
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,650
and I didn’t have
an environmental vision

1036
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,980
and I did not want
to make that speech.

1037
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,660
And at sort of
the propitious moment

1038
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,900
this book
landed on my desk.

1039
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,180
It was Paul Hawkins book
The Ecology of Commerce

1040
00:52:45,215 --> 00:52:48,420
and I began to read The
Ecology of Commerce,

1041
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,890
really desperate
for inspiration

1042
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,820
and very quickly
into that book

1043
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,265
I found the phrase
The death of birth.

1044
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,090
It was E. O. Wilson’s expression
for species extinction

1045
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,145
The death of birth

1046
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,810
and it was a point
of a spear into my chest

1047
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,375
and I read on and
the spear went deeper

1048
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,730
and it became an
epiphanal experience

1049
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,770
a total change
of mindset for myself

1050
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:18,460
and a change of paradigm.

1051
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,300
Can any product be
made sustainably?

1052
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,220
Well not any
and every product.

1053
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,060
Can you make
landmines sustainably?

1054
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,665
Well I don’t think so.

1055
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,850
There’s a more fundamental
question than that

1056
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,380
about landmines.

1057
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,460
Some products ought
not to be made at all.

1058
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,625
Unless we can make carpets
sustainably you know

1059
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,500
perhaps we don’t have a place
in a sustainable world

1060
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:53,500
but neither does anybody else
making products unsustainably.

1061
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:58,420
One day early in this journey
it dawned on me that

1062
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,900
the way Id been
running interface

1063
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,530
is the way
of the plunderer

1064
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,185
plundering something
that’s not mine

1065
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,300
something that belongs
to every creature on earth

1066
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,940
and I said to myself

1067
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,385
my goodness

1068
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,810
the day must come
when this is illegal

1069
00:54:16,845 --> 00:54:19,620
when plundering
is not allowed

1070
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,065
it must come.

1071
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,300
So I said to
myself my goodness

1072
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,580
some day people like
me will end up in jail.

1073
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,300
I’ve got to be
honest with you.

1074
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,300
When the September 11th
situation happened

1075
00:54:41,335 --> 00:54:44,370
I didn’t know that
the and I must say

1076
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,380
and I want to say
this because its

1077
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,580
I don’t want
to take it lightly

1078
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,300
it's not a light
situation.

1079
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,175
It's a devastating act.

1080
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,770
It was really a bad thing

1081
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,265
it's one of
the worse things

1082
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,690
I’ve seen in my
lifetime you know.

1083
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,010
But I will tell you and every
trader will tell you

1084
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,250
who was not in
that building

1085
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,860
and who was buying gold
and who owned gold and silver

1086
00:55:09,895 --> 00:55:11,580
that when it happened

1087
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,690
the first thing
you thought about was

1088
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,300
well how much is gold up?

1089
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,880
The first thing
that came to mind was

1090
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,170
my god gold must
be exploding.

1091
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,930
Fortunately for us all
our clients were in gold.

1092
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,500
So when it went up they
all doubled their money.

1093
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,935
They’ve all doubled
their money.

1094
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,290
It was a blessing
in disguise.

1095
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:38,580
Devastating you know
crushing heart shattering

1096
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,505
but on the
financial sense

1097
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,180
for my clients that
were in the market

1098
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,865
they all made money.

1099
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,890
Now I wasn’t looking
for this type of help

1100
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,585
but it happened.

1101
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:55,460
When the US bombed
Iraq back in 1991

1102
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,220
the price of oil went
from $13 to $40 a barrel

1103
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:02,580
for Christ sake!

1104
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,180
Now we couldn’t wait
for the bombs

1105
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,210
to start raining down
on Saddam Hussein.

1106
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,700
We were all excited.

1107
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,780
We wanted Saddam to
really create problems

1108
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:16,940
Do whatever you
have to do

1109
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,500
set fire to some
more oil wells

1110
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,170
because the price is
going to go higher.

1111
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:21,900
Every broker was
chanting that

1112
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,700
there was not a broker
that I know of

1113
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,290
that wasn’t
excited about that.

1114
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,465
This was a disaster.

1115
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,540
This was something
that was you know

1116
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,040
catastrophe happening.

1117
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:33,130
Bombing wars

1118
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,020
In devastation there
is opportunity.

1119
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,050
The pursuit of profit
is an old story

1120
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,660
but there was a time when
many things were regarded

1121
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,460
either as too sacred or too
essential for the public good

1122
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,100
to be considered business
opportunities.

1123
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,020
They were protected
by tradition

1124
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:57,250
and public regulation.

1125
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,530
We can really begin to take
a look at the emergence

1126
00:57:08,565 --> 00:57:10,730
of the modern age with
the enclosure movements

1127
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,020
of the great European
commons in the fourteenth

1128
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,100
fifteenth and
sixteenth century.

1129
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,530
Medieval life uh was
a collectively lived life

1130
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,810
It was a brutish
nasty affair.

1131
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,210
But there was a collective
responsibility

1132
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,945
People belonged to the land;

1133
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,570
the land did not belong
to the people.

1134
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,890
And in this
European world

1135
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,420
people farmed the land
in a collective way

1136
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,100
because they saw
it as a commons.

1137
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:34,180
It belonged to God.

1138
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,300
And then it was
administered by the church

1139
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:38,580
the aristocracy

1140
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,130
and then the local manors
as stewards of gods creation.

1141
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:44,500
Beginning with Tudor England

1142
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,385
we began to see
a phenomenon emerge

1143
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,300
and that is the enclosure
of the great commons

1144
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:50,490
by Parliamentary
Acts in England

1145
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,625
and then in Europe.

1146
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,380
And so first we began to
take the great landmasses

1147
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,290
of the world

1148
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,905
which were
commons and shared

1149
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,010
and we reduced those
to private property.

1150
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,940
Then we went after the oceans
the great oceanic commons

1151
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,580
and we created laws
and regulations

1152
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,545
that would allow countries

1153
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,100
to claim a certain amount
of water outside

1154
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,615
their coastal limits
for exploitation.

1155
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,770
In this century we
went after the air

1156
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,420
and we divided it
into air corridors

1157
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,980
that could be bought
and sold

1158
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,400
for commercial traffic
for airplanes.

1159
00:58:18,435 --> 00:58:20,340
And then of course
the rest is history.

1160
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,500
With deregulation
privatization free trade

1161
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:40,290
what we're seeing is
yet another enclosure

1162
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:45,010
and if you like private
taking of the commons.

1163
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,420
One of the things I find
very interesting

1164
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,420
in our current debates

1165
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,465
is this concept
of who creates wealth.

1166
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,020
That wealth is only created
when it's owned privately.

1167
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,100
What would you call
clean water fresh air

1168
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,580
a safe environment?

1169
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,690
Are they not
a form of wealth?

1170
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,330
And why does it only become
wealth when some entity

1171
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,090
puts a fence around it and
declares it private property?

1172
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,340
Well you know that’s
not wealth creation.

1173
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,500
That’s wealth usurpation.

1174
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,780
Over the centuries

1175
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,460
we have put more and more
things in that public realm

1176
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,140
and lately just lately

1177
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,170
in the last

1178
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,260
lets say in the last
three or four decades

1179
00:59:23,295 --> 00:59:24,660
started pulling
them out again.

1180
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,850
So fire-fighters
for instance.

1181
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,970
Fire-fighters started
as private companies

1182
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,100
and if you didn’t
have the medallion

1183
00:59:40,135 --> 00:59:42,210
of a given
fire-fighter brigade

1184
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,290
on your house and
it was on fire

1185
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,980
those fire-fighters
would just ride on by

1186
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,380
because you didn’t
have a deal.

1187
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,265
Well it gradually
evolved a public trust

1188
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,660
for the provision of safety
on that very specific level.

1189
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,780
This is important.

1190
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,345
We should not go back
from that and start saying

1191
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,420
well you know why don’t we
put that back in the market

1192
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,660
and see what that does?

1193
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,610
Maybe it will make
it more efficient

1194
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,140
Privatization does not mean
you take a public institution

1195
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:24,540
and give it
to some nice person.

1196
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,210
It means you take a public
institution and give it

1197
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,260
to an unaccountable tyranny.

1198
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,080
Public institutions
have many side benefits

1199
01:00:37,115 --> 01:00:40,140
For one thing they may
purposely run at a loss.

1200
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,300
They're not
out for profit.

1201
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,410
They may purposely
run at a loss

1202
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,300
because of the
side benefits.

1203
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,420
So for example if a public
steel industry runs at a loss

1204
01:00:50,455 --> 01:00:53,250
it's providing cheap
steel to other industries

1205
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,770
maybe that’s a good thing.

1206
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,020
Public institutions can have
a counter cyclic property

1207
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,570
So that means that they can
maintain employment

1208
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:05,260
in periods of recession

1209
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,905
which increases demand

1210
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,250
which helps you
get out of recession.

1211
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,650
Private companies cant
do that in a recession

1212
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,530
throw out the work force cause
that’s the way you make money.

1213
01:01:15,565 --> 01:01:17,660
There are those who intend
that one day everything

1214
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,860
will be owned by somebody

1215
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,505
and we're not just
talking goods here.

1216
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,610
We're talking human
rights human services

1217
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,785
essential services for life.

1218
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,730
Education public health
social assistance

1219
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,060
pensions housing.

1220
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:40,220
We're also talking about
the survival of the planet.

1221
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,980
The areas that we believe
must be maintained

1222
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,065
in the commons

1223
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,460
or under common control
or we will collectively die

1224
01:01:48,495 --> 01:01:51,140
Water and air.

1225
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,650
Even in the case of air
there’s been some progress

1226
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,140
and that is the trading
of pollution permits.

1227
01:01:58,175 --> 01:01:59,420
And here the idea
is to say

1228
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,570
look we cant avoid
the dumping of carbon dioxide.

1229
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,500
We cant avoid the dumping
of sulphur oxides

1230
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,500
at least we cant at the moment
afford to stopping it

1231
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,010
so we're dumping a certain
amount of stuff

1232
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,740
into the environment.

1233
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,050
So we're going to say
with the current tonnage

1234
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,140
of sulphur oxides
for example

1235
01:02:17,175 --> 01:02:19,940
we will say
that is the limit.

1236
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,700
And well create
permits for that amount

1237
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,700
and give them to the people
who’ve been doing the polluting

1238
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,980
and now we will permit
them to be traded.

1239
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:31,340
And so now there’s
a price attached

1240
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,945
to polluting the environment.

1241
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,730
Now wouldn’t it be marvellous
if we have one of those prices

1242
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,620
for everything?

1243
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,660
It sounds like you’re
advocating private ownership

1244
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,370
of every square
inch of the planet.

1245
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,420
Absolutely.

1246
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,580
Every cubic foot
of air water.

1247
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:50,580
It sounds outlandish to say

1248
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,570
we want to have the
whole universe

1249
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,100
the whole of
the earth owned.

1250
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,780
That doesn’t mean I
want to have Joe Bloggs

1251
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,860
owning this square foot.

1252
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,010
But it means the interests that
are involved in that stream

1253
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:07,010
are owned by some group

1254
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,740
or by some people who have
an interest in maintaining it.

1255
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,385
And that you know that
is not such a loony idea.

1256
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,820
It's in fact the solution
to a lot of these problems.

1257
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,250
Imagine a world in
which one of the things

1258
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,540
owned by a corporation was
the song happy birthday.

1259
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,625
In fact

1260
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,180
an AOL/Time Warner subsidiary
holds the copyright.

1261
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,450
In the past

1262
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,425
it has demanded
over $10000

1263
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,770
to allow you to hear anyone
sing this popular song

1264
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,820
in a film.

1265
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,890
We didn’t pay.

1266
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,660
We preferred to use the money
to fly our crew to Boston

1267
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,580
and Los Angeles to bring
you the following story

1268
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,690
Comparing the marketing
of yesteryear

1269
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:17,450
to the marketing of today

1270
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,660
is like comparing
a BB Gun to a smart bomb.

1271
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,820
It's not the same
as when I was a kid

1272
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,545
or even when the people

1273
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,780
who are young adults
today were kids.

1274
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,260
It's much more sophisticated
and it's much more pervasive.

1275
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:43,140
It's not that products
themselves are bad or good.

1276
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,850
It's the notion of
manipulating children

1277
01:04:46,885 --> 01:04:49,570
into buying the products.

1278
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,060
In 1998 Western
International Media

1279
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,220
Century City and Lieberman
Research Worldwide

1280
01:04:57,255 --> 01:05:00,930
conducted a study on nagging.

1281
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,580
We asked parents to keep
a diary for three weeks

1282
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,130
and to record every time

1283
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,305
you could imagine

1284
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:10,300
every time their child nagged
them for a product

1285
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,130
we asked them to record
when where and why.

1286
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:24,250
This study was not to
help parents cope with nagging.

1287
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,050
It was to help corporations
help children nag

1288
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:31,020
for their products
more effectively.

1289
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,050
Anywhere form 20 percent
to 40 percent of purchases

1290
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,585
would not have occurred

1291
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,610
unless the child had
nagged their parents.

1292
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,330
That is we
found for example

1293
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,785
a quarter of all visits
to theme parks

1294
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,780
wouldn’t have occurred unless
a child nagged their parents.

1295
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,570
Four out of ten visits
to places like Chuck E. Cheese

1296
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,410
would not have occurred.

1297
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,410
And any parent would
understand that

1298
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,820
you know when I
think of Chuck E. Cheese

1299
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
oh my goodness
its noise.

1300
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,610
And there’s
so many kids.

1301
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,890
Why would I want to
spend two hours there?

1302
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,940
But if the child nags
enough you 're going to go

1303
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,820
We saw the same thing with
movies with home video

1304
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,500
with fast food...

1305
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,180
We do have to break
through this barrier

1306
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,370
where they do tell us
or they say

1307
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,180
they don’t like it
when their kids nag.

1308
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,660
Well that’s just a general
attitude that they possess.

1309
01:06:20,695 --> 01:06:24,220
It doesn’t mean that they
necessarily act upon it

1310
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,780
a 100 percent of the time.

1311
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,940
You can manipulate
consumers into wanting

1312
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,660
and therefore buying
your products.

1313
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,420
It's a game.

1314
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,255
Children are
not little adults;

1315
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,970
their minds
aren’t developed.

1316
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,100
And what’s happening is that
the marketers are playing

1317
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,580
to their developmental
vulnerabilities.

1318
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,620
The advertising that
children are exposed to today

1319
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:56,420
is honed by psychologists;

1320
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,625
it's enhanced by
media technology

1321
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,810
that nobody ever
thought was possible.

1322
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:05,260
The more insight you have
about the consumer

1323
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,930
the more creative you’ll be in
your communication strategies.

1324
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,770
So if that takes
a psychologist

1325
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,090
yeah we want one
of those on staff.

1326
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,740
I’m not saying it's wrong
to make things for children.

1327
01:07:18,775 --> 01:07:20,460
I also think its
important to distinguish

1328
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,970
between psychologists who
work on products for children

1329
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:28,420
to help you know toy
corporations make toys

1330
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:29,780
that are developmentally
appropriate.

1331
01:07:29,815 --> 01:07:30,740
I think that’s great

1332
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,890
that’s different
from selling the toys

1333
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,540
directly to the children.

1334
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:36,020
Initiative is huge.

1335
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,780
I think in
the U.S. we place

1336
01:07:38,815 --> 01:07:41,140
about $12 billion
of media time.

1337
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,500
So well put it on TV
well put it in print

1338
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,770
well put it up in outdoor
well buy radio time;

1339
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,940
so we're the biggest buyers of
advertising time and space

1340
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:53,970
in the U.S.
and in the world.

1341
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,730
One family cannot combat
an industry that spends

1342
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,890
$12 billion a year trying
to get their children.

1343
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,010
They cant do it.

1344
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,465
They are tomorrows
adult consumers

1345
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,700
To start talking with them now
build that relationship

1346
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:09,785
when they’re younger...

1347
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,890
And you’ve got
them as an adult.

1348
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,220
Somebody asked me you
know Lucy is that ethical?

1349
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,810
You know you’re essentially
manipulating these children.

1350
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,730
Well yeah
is it ethical?

1351
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,570
I don’t know.

1352
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,900
But our role at initiative
is to move products

1353
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,895
And if we know
you move products

1354
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,690
with a certain
creative execution

1355
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,170
placed in a certain
type of media vehicle

1356
01:08:33,205 --> 01:08:34,450
then we’ve
done our job.

1357
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,930
Every institution
provides the people

1358
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,860
who are members of it

1359
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,900
with a social
role to occupy

1360
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,400
And typically institutions
that are vibrant

1361
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:52,780
and have a lot of power
will specify that role

1362
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,235
in some sense as
a list of virtues.

1363
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,250
It's true for churches
for schools

1364
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,610
for any institution that
has power over people

1365
01:09:02,645 --> 01:09:04,900
and shapes them.

1366
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,345
The corporation likewise.

1367
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,850
It provides us
with a list of virtues

1368
01:09:08,885 --> 01:09:09,820
a kind of social role

1369
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,290
which is
the good consumer.

1370
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,420
Like the waters
of the mighty ocean

1371
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,345
people also represent
tremendous force

1372
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,100
the understanding of which
is the greatest importance

1373
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,540
to the American
way of life.

1374
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,740
This force is known
as consumer power.

1375
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,490
The goal for the corporations
is to maximize profit

1376
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,530
and market share.

1377
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,220
And they also have a goal
for their target

1378
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,580
namely the population.

1379
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,970
They have to be turned into
completely mindless consumers

1380
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,905
of goods that
they do not want.

1381
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,460
You have to develop what
are called created wants

1382
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,170
So you have
to create wants.

1383
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,770
You have to pose
on people what's called

1384
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,090
a philosophy of futility.

1385
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,530
You have to focus them

1386
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,060
on the insignificant
things of life

1387
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:03,330
like fashionable consumption.

1388
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,530
I’m just basically quoting
business literature.

1389
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,490
And it makes
perfect sense.

1390
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,625
The ideal is to have
individuals

1391
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,570
who are totally disassociated
from one another.

1392
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:21,250
Who’s conception of
themselves the sense of value

1393
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,970
is just how many created
wants can I satisfy?

1394
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,570
These people are customers

1395
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,660
because they are willing
to trade money for widgets.

1396
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:37,540
And all the customers
take the widgets home

1397
01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:40,660
to all parts
of the country.

1398
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,890
Look at all the money
the widget builder has

1399
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,585
taken in from the sale
of his widgets.

1400
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,850
We have huge industries
public relations industry

1401
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,300
monstrous industry

1402
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,300
advertising and so on
which are designed

1403
01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:57,690
from infancy to try
to mould people

1404
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,250
into this desired pattern.

1405
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,460
We saw
Tiger Woods on TV

1406
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,060
with a hat
with a Nike logo on it

1407
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,740
and we figured you know
he probably gets

1408
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:11,140
like millions of dollars

1409
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,945
just to wear the hat
on a press conference.

1410
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,340
And therefore we figured we
can do that for someone else.

1411
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,940
And hopefully get money in
time so we can go to school.

1412
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:22,020
And that show we came up with
being corporately sponsored.

1413
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,330
We made our sponsor
announcement

1414
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,060
on the Today Show
on June 18

1415
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,060
...were thrilled to be
sponsored by First U.S.A...

1416
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,300
We're thrilled to be working with
first U.S.A as our corporate

1417
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,780
sponsor and they’re covering
our college tuition...

1418
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,140
...we found First U.S.A as our
sponsor and we're proud

1419
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:34,970
to be working with them...

1420
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,170
...our sponsor if First U.S.A

1421
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,220
we're really thrilled
to announce First U.S.A

1422
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,180
as our sponsor...

1423
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,860
...we're thrilled to be
working with First U.S.A...

1424
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,180
and so we give First U.S.A

1425
01:11:45,215 --> 01:11:46,345
a good name in the media

1426
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,820
and include them
in our news stories

1427
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,210
and through there

1428
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:52,380
they get as much advertising
as we can give them.

1429
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,545
They’ll be conforming

1430
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,780
not to the wishes of
demanding parents

1431
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,305
but to the wishes of an image
conscious corporation...

1432
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,300
They’re not just out there for
the money and they’re just...

1433
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:03,500
I mean they want
to work with us

1434
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,380
and be our friends and let
us help them help us

1435
01:12:06,415 --> 01:12:07,180
and vice versa.

1436
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,380
And we became
walking billboards

1437
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,860
to pay for our
college tuition.

1438
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,380
Cool Site of the day
picked us as a cool site

1439
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,050
and Yahoo picked us and
we were in U.S.A Today.

1440
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,820
When we did our photo
shoot for people magazine

1441
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:24,950
This is where we
stood up on top.

1442
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,800
We stood up here
and we smiled.

1443
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,365
We smiled and
took the picture.

1444
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,200
Our parents had war stories
and stuff to tell us.

1445
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,720
We have our corporate
sponsor story.

1446
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:35,360
Exactly.

1447
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,040
I have a lot of faith
in the corporate world

1448
01:12:39,075 --> 01:12:40,230
because it's always
going to be there

1449
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,640
so you may as well
have faith in it

1450
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,480
because if you don’t
then it's just not good.

1451
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,235
Some of the best
creative minds

1452
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,590
are employed to
assure our faith

1453
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,750
in the corporate
worldview.

1454
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,960
They seduce us with corporate
beguiling illusions.

1455
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,920
Designed to divert
our minds

1456
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,000
and manufacture
our consent.

1457
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,520
Corporations don’t advertise
products particularly;

1458
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,790
they’re advertising
a way of life.

1459
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:10,960
A way of thinking.

1460
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,880
A story of who we are as people
and how we got here and

1461
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,720
you know what’s the source
of our so called liberty

1462
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,070
and so called freedom.

1463
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,920
You know so you have decades
and decades and decades

1464
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,790
of propaganda and
education

1465
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,840
teaching us to think
in a certain way.

1466
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,965
When applied to
the large corporation

1467
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,470
it's that the corporation
is was inevitable

1468
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,120
that it's indispensable

1469
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,830
that it is somehow
remarkably efficient

1470
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,710
and that it is responsible
for the sort of

1471
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,750
for progress and
the good life.

1472
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,480
Perception management is a
very interesting concept

1473
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:56,680
It's basically a methodology

1474
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,640
which helps us when
we work with our clients

1475
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,200
to go through a very systematic
thoughtful process

1476
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:06,640
in order to be able to
help our clients identify

1477
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,080
what the resources are
that they have.

1478
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,840
What the barriers to their
success are

1479
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,525
and how we can use
communications

1480
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,320
to help them accomplish
their objectives.

1481
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,200
If Michael or Angelica came
to me and said

1482
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,190
Dad what do you do
and why is it important?

1483
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,400
My answer to that question
is basically

1484
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,910
that I help corporations
have a voice.

1485
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,280
And I help corporations
share the point of view

1486
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:49,520
about how they
feel about things.

1487
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:54,790
They’re selling
themselves

1488
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,040
they’re selling
their domination

1489
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,470
they’re selling
their rule

1490
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,240
and they’re creating
an image for themselves

1491
01:15:00,275 --> 01:15:01,870
as just regular folks
down the block.

1492
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,000
Hi how
y'all doing today?

1493
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,925
Good to see you.

1494
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,760
How are you doing today?

1495
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,920
Hi how you
doing today?

1496
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,560
We're from Pfizer.

1497
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,560
We're your neighbours.

1498
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,000
You're in the new houses?

1499
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,070
Are you in the new houses?

1500
01:15:18,105 --> 01:15:19,070
Ohhhhhh!

1501
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,240
These are some neighbours.

1502
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,270
Can we say hello?

1503
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,000
Can we say hello
just for a minute?

1504
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,230
So what do you think
of the neighbourhood now?

1505
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,280
It's all right
it's good.

1506
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,630
Yeah I think it’s been
getting better

1507
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,440
over the last 20 years
that I’ve been coming here.

1508
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:35,165
Yeah

1509
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,840
So I think together you
know working with you

1510
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,350
and Pfizer and our
other partnership

1511
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,240
well make this
a better place.

1512
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,350
Okay.

1513
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,760
Okay nice to see
you Miss Fraser bye.

1514
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,070
There used to be a lot
of crime at this subway.

1515
01:15:50,105 --> 01:15:52,520
One night as I was going
home I got caught

1516
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,000
and was almost mugged.

1517
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,470
So we decided
to make a change

1518
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,240
to make
this community better.

1519
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,920
We're looking
at turnstiles

1520
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,350
that prevent fare beating.

1521
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,285
It used to be you could
just hop right over.

1522
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,840
So Pfizer in collaboration
with the transit authority

1523
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,040
actually purchased
these machines.

1524
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,840
This is a talkback box
that allows us to speak

1525
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,405
to the Pfizer guard

1526
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,070
which is approximately
500 yards from here.

1527
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,920
Now I haven’t seen
the Pfizer guard today

1528
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,560
but I’m going to see
if I can call him.

1529
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,870
If he’s not I'll have
to go wake him up.

1530
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:40,790
Hello.

1531
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,880
Hello.

1532
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,950
Tom Kline speaking.

1533
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,550
So I'm sure

1534
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,920
before we're through
hell call back.

1535
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,565
But particularly
on the off-hours

1536
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,560
this allows a passenger
to call directly

1537
01:16:54,595 --> 01:16:56,880
to the Pfizer
desk for assistance.

1538
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,060
And then the Pfizer guard
calls the transit police

1539
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:04,800
and the transit police respond
to any crime situation.

1540
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,600
As a result of all this
crime is down in that station.

1541
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:09,840
It's much safer for
our community partners.

1542
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,190
Thank you.

1543
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,200
I'll press the other button
just to be sure...

1544
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,390
Well go over and
talk to him personally.

1545
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,830
It's tough you know
they’re putting

1546
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,040
some taxpayer shareholder
money into helping

1547
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,150
and who can say?

1548
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,960
But that money should be
going to the taxpayers

1549
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,840
to decide what to do.

1550
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,350
And while they’re doing
those sorts of nice things

1551
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,270
they’re also playing a role in
lowering taxes for corporations

1552
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,150
and lowering taxes
for wealthy people

1553
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,000
and reconfiguring
public policy.

1554
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,190
And what we don’t see is all
that reconfiguring going on;

1555
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,620
we don’t see all that
vacuuming up of money

1556
01:18:01,655 --> 01:18:03,800
vacuuming out the insides
of public processes

1557
01:18:03,835 --> 01:18:05,720
but we do see
the nice façade.

1558
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,725
When I was researching
the takeover of public space

1559
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,910
when I started off I thought
okay this is just advertising.

1560
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,835
We’ve always had advertising.

1561
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,550
It's just more advertising.

1562
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,190
But what I started
to understand

1563
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,325
and what I
understand now

1564
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,560
is that branding if not
advertising its production.

1565
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,880
The very
successful corporations

1566
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,960
the corporations of the future
do not produce products.

1567
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,040
They produced
brand meaning.

1568
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,560
The dissemination of
the idea of themselves

1569
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,165
is their act of production.

1570
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,190
And the dissemination of
the idea of themselves

1571
01:19:04,225 --> 01:19:08,560
is an enormously
invasive project

1572
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,280
so how do you
make a brand idea?

1573
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,920
Well a good place to
start is by building

1574
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,880
a three dimensional
manifestation of your brand.

1575
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,200
For a company like Disney

1576
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,280
it goes even further

1577
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,360
where it's actually building
a town Celebration Florida.

1578
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:25,120
Currently there are
about 5000 residents

1579
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,120
who call Celebration home.

1580
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,585
And there are about 1300
single-family homes

1581
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,670
a town centre that’s a place
where people gather.

1582
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,030
It has about four
or five restaurants

1583
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,310
and about a dozen
other shops.

1584
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,400
Their inspiration
their brand image

1585
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,285
is the all American family.

1586
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,520
And the sort of
bygone American town.

1587
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,190
Their brand driver is family
magic and everything

1588
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:16,190
that the company does is in
and around those two words.

1589
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:18,160
If you take that

1590
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,590
a branded environment
such as a Disney World

1591
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,190
or a Disneyland is a logical
extension of that brand.

1592
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:28,492
Film animated film
family oriented film;

1593
01:20:28,527 --> 01:20:31,760
it's a very logical
extension of that.

1594
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,160
As a business though

1595
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,920
they also know that
if they want to get

1596
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,590
into other forms of
entertainment

1597
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,200
that does not fit
family magic

1598
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,940
they do not brand
it Disney.

1599
01:20:43,975 --> 01:20:46,400
If they want to get
into adult

1600
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,645
more serious type fare

1601
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,960
when it comes to film
they brand it Touchstone.

1602
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,400
Disney brand
speaks of reassurance

1603
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,560
it speaks of tradition
it speaks of quality.

1604
01:20:57,595 --> 01:20:58,910
And you can see that here

1605
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,085
in this community
that we’ve built.

1606
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,240
And that’s where you
see the truly imperialist

1607
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,910
aspirations of branding
which is about building

1608
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,590
these privatized
branded cocoons.

1609
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,230
Which maybe you start
by shopping in

1610
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,755
and then you continue
by holidaying in

1611
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:19,110
but eventually why
not just move in.

1612
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,000
What happens if we
wake up one day

1613
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,320
and we find out that virtually
all of our relationships

1614
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,990
that are mediated between
us and our fellow human beings

1615
01:21:30,025 --> 01:21:31,685
are commercial?

1616
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,760
We find out that virtually
every relationship we have

1617
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,040
is a commercially
arbitrated relationship

1618
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,165
with our fellow human being?

1619
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,510
Can civilization survive on
that narrow a definition

1620
01:21:42,545 --> 01:21:44,920
of how we interact
with each other?

1621
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,350
Wow what a dream...

1622
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,230
I can give you the day
in the life of a person

1623
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,670
who might be the target
of undercover marketing.

1624
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,960
And I will
tell you this

1625
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,430
that some of these things
are happening right now

1626
01:22:02,465 --> 01:22:03,240
around you.

1627
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,280
So you walk out of your
building in the morning

1628
01:22:05,315 --> 01:22:06,070
in some city

1629
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,670
and you walk by
the doorman and say

1630
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:08,550
hey good morning!

1631
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,520
And you notice there’s a
bunch of boxes at his feet

1632
01:22:11,555 --> 01:22:14,040
from some on line
or mail order retailer.

1633
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,270
And there’s a bunch of boxes
there with of course

1634
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,830
big brand message on it.

1635
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,440
You walk out
and wonder

1636
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,230
a lot of people must be
ordering from that company.

1637
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,870
Well what you don’t know is
that we paid the doorman

1638
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:24,630
to keep those
empty boxes there.

1639
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,565
You walk out
into the street

1640
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,590
and you hear some people
having kind of a loud conversation

1641
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,325
about a musical act

1642
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,920
and they are passing
headphones back and forth

1643
01:22:33,955 --> 01:22:35,200
and going
this is great!

1644
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:40,440
Hey do you know that I heard
this CD is really hard to find

1645
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:45,760
but I heard they
sell it at store X.

1646
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,600
You hear that and
you register it

1647
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,160
and you might kind
of pick up on that

1648
01:22:49,195 --> 01:22:50,600
and may be later
on you’ll think

1649
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,030
hey I wonder what the
hot act is bang

1650
01:22:52,065 --> 01:22:53,232
that might be in your head.

1651
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:54,400
Now you get
into your office

1652
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,400
and there’s a certain brand
of water in the refrigerator.

1653
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,565
What is that?

1654
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,510
You take it out you drink
you slug it down it's there

1655
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,510
not really
thinking about it.

1656
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,365
Wow!

1657
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,120
That’s pretty good water.

1658
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,640
Who knows?

1659
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,080
Maybe someone placed
the water there

1660
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,125
You kind of go out
for your lunch break

1661
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,760
you’re sitting in the park and
people are kind of out there

1662
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,150
talking in the
park and bang

1663
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,590
all of a sudden you
hear another message.

1664
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,400
By the time you go to bed
you've probably received

1665
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,990
eight or nine different
undercover messages.

1666
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,000
People are always thinking

1667
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,360
well oh I know
product placement.

1668
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,080
That’s when they
put stuff in movies!

1669
01:23:30,115 --> 01:23:31,360
Well yes kind of.

1670
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,230
I mean that’s definitely
traditional product placement.

1671
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,440
But real life product
placement is just that:

1672
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,270
Placing stuff in movies but
the movie’s actually your life

1673
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,950
Well take a group
of attainable

1674
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,790
but still
inspirational people

1675
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,830
they are not supermodels

1676
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,080
they are kind of
people just like you

1677
01:23:46,115 --> 01:23:47,560
they’re doing
something for us

1678
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,870
whether they are having
a certain kind of drink

1679
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,200
or they are using
a certain laundry detergent

1680
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,640
whatever it may be.

1681
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,840
They are kind of the
roach motel if you will

1682
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,600
People are going
to come over to them

1683
01:23:58,635 --> 01:23:59,892
and they are
going to give them

1684
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:01,150
this little piece
of brand bait.

1685
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,990
It could be a sound bite
of knowledge or a ritual.

1686
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,920
Consumers will get that
piece of roach bait

1687
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:06,840
then they
would take it.

1688
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:07,925
Oh pretty cool!

1689
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,560
Then they go out and
spread it to their friends.

1690
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,680
If you want to be critical

1691
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,880
if you want to go through
your life like that

1692
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,000
sure be critical
of every single person

1693
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,190
that walks up to you.

1694
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,720
But if they are showing
you something that fits

1695
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,910
and something that works

1696
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,640
and something that makes
your life better in some way

1697
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:22,040
well then who cares.

1698
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,720
We again
just say thanks!

1699
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,280
Today the job of building
this nation geographically

1700
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,965
is completed.

1701
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,550
There are no new frontiers
within our borders.

1702
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,550
So to what new horizons
can we look now?

1703
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,960
Where are tomorrows
opportunities?

1704
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,885
What's ahead for you
for your children?

1705
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,310
The frontiers of the
future are not on any map.

1706
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,960
They’re in the test
tubes and laboratories

1707
01:25:08,995 --> 01:25:10,510
of the great industries.

1708
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,040
The Chakrabarty case is one of
the great judicial moments

1709
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,605
in world history.

1710
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,280
And the public
was totally unaware

1711
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,600
it was actually happening as
a process was being engaged.

1712
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:28,800
General Electric
and Professor Chakrabarty

1713
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,360
went to the patent office
with a little microbe

1714
01:25:31,395 --> 01:25:32,645
that eats up oil spills.

1715
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,910
They said they had modified
this microbe in the laboratory

1716
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,440
and therefore it
was an invention.

1717
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,800
The patent office and
the U.S. Government

1718
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,360
took a look at this
quote invention;

1719
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,685
they said no way.

1720
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,630
The patent statures don’t
cover living things.

1721
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,000
This is not an invention.

1722
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,320
Turned down.

1723
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,760
Then General Electric and
Doctor Chakrabarty

1724
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,725
appealed to the U.S. Customs
Court of Appeal.

1725
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,600
And to everyone’s surprise
by a three to two decision

1726
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,630
they overrode
the patent office.

1727
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,200
They said this
microbe looks more

1728
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,020
like a detergent
or a reagent

1729
01:26:07,055 --> 01:26:08,720
than a horse or a honeybee.

1730
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,160
I laugh because they didn’t
understand basic biology;

1731
01:26:12,195 --> 01:26:13,360
it looked like a
chemical to them.

1732
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,480
Had it had an antenna or
eyes or wings or legs

1733
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,800
it would never have crossed
their table and been patented.

1734
01:26:20,835 --> 01:26:22,600
Then the patent
office appealed.

1735
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,555
And what the public
should realize now

1736
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,070
is the patent office
was very clear

1737
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,390
that you cant
patent life.

1738
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,350
My organization provided
the main amicus curiae brief

1739
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,035
if you allow the patent on
this microbe we argued

1740
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:38,550
it means that without any
congressional guidance

1741
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,520
or public discussion

1742
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,800
corporations will own
the blueprints of life.

1743
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,320
When they made the decision
we lost by five to four

1744
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,350
and Chief Justice
Warren said

1745
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,510
sure some of these
are big issues

1746
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,645
but we think this
is a small decision.

1747
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,960
Seven years later
the U.S. Patent office issued

1748
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,990
a one sentence decree

1749
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,910
you can patent anything
in the world that’s alive

1750
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,640
except a full birth
human being.

1751
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,960
We’ve all been hearing
about the announcement

1752
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:35,710
that we have mapped
the human genome.

1753
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,750
But what the public
doesn’t know

1754
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,920
is now there’s this great
race by genomic companies

1755
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,360
and biotech companies
and life science companies

1756
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,680
to find the treasure
in the map.

1757
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,630
The treasure are
the individual genes

1758
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,880
that make up the blueprint
of the human race.

1759
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,680
Every time they capture
agene and isolate it

1760
01:28:52,715 --> 01:28:53,710
these biotech companies

1761
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,800
they claim it as
intellectual property.

1762
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,220
The breast cancer gene

1763
01:28:57,255 --> 01:28:58,520
the cystic fibrosis gene

1764
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,600
it goes on and
on and on.

1765
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,320
If this goes unchallenged in
the world community

1766
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,670
within less than 10 years

1767
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,360
a handful of global
companies will own

1768
01:29:07,395 --> 01:29:09,640
directly or through license

1769
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,440
the actual genes that make up
the evolution of our species.

1770
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,670
And they’re now beginning
to patent the genomes

1771
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,520
of every other creature
on this planet.

1772
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,675
In the age of biology the
politics is going to sort out

1773
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:24,070
between those who believe life
first has intrinsic value

1774
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,720
and therefore we should
choose technologies

1775
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,560
and commercial venues

1776
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,685
that honour
the intrinsic value...

1777
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,600
And then we're going
to have people who believe

1778
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,470
look life is
a simple utility.

1779
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,925
It's commercial fare

1780
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,080
and they will line up
with the idea

1781
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,760
to let the marketplace be
the ultimate arbiter

1782
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,520
of all of the age
of biology.

1783
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,680
In a world economy where
information is filtered

1784
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,950
by global media corporations

1785
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,800
keenly attuned to their
powerful advertisers

1786
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,310
who will defend
the publics right to know?

1787
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,080
And what price must be
paid to preserve our ability

1788
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,760
to make informed choices?

1789
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,720
What Fox Television told us
was that we were just the people

1790
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,440
to be the investigators.

1791
01:30:15,475 --> 01:30:16,845
Do any stories you want

1792
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,840
ask tough questions
and get answers.

1793
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,205
So we thought

1794
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,470
this is great
this is a dream job.

1795
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,800
Fantastic.

1796
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,480
The very first
thing they had us do

1797
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,485
was not to research stories

1798
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,190
but to shoot this
promo which was...

1799
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,670
The Investigators.

1800
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,030
Uncovering the truth

1801
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,960
getting results
protecting you.

1802
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,430
and they had a film
crew a smoke machine

1803
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,640
were silhouetted...

1804
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,720
One of the first stories
that Jane came up with

1805
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,520
was the revelation
that most of the milk

1806
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:45,230
in the state of Florida

1807
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,160
and throughout much of the
country was adulterated

1808
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,205
with the effects of bovine
growth hormone

1809
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:55,000
with Monsanto I didn’t realize
how effectively a corporation

1810
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,820
could work to get something
on the marketplace.

1811
01:30:57,855 --> 01:31:00,080
The levels of coordination
they had to have.

1812
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,830
They had to get university
professors into the fold.

1813
01:31:02,865 --> 01:31:04,830
They had to get
experts into the fold.

1814
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,040
They had to get
reporters into the fold

1815
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,910
They had to get
the public into the fold

1816
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,835
and of course the FDA
lets not leave them out.

1817
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,670
They had to get the federal
regulators convinced

1818
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,280
that this was
a fine and safe product

1819
01:31:15,315 --> 01:31:16,440
to get it onto the
marketplace.

1820
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,590
And they did that;

1821
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,160
they did that
very very well.

1822
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,790
Posilac is a single most
tested product in history

1823
01:31:23,825 --> 01:31:26,150
and is now available
to you specifically.

1824
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,840
so you can increase
your profit potential.

1825
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,400
The federal government
basically rubber stamped it

1826
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:33,430
before they put it
on the marketplace.

1827
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,960
The longest test they
did for human toxicity

1828
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,390
was 90 days on thirty rats.

1829
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,350
And then either Monsanto
misreported the results

1830
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,325
to the FDA

1831
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,400
or the FDA didn’t bother
to look in depth

1832
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,040
at Monsanto’s own studies.

1833
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,840
The scientists within Health
Canada looked very carefully

1834
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:51,840
at bovine growth hormone

1835
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,440
and came to very
different conclusions

1836
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,855
than the Food and Drug
Administration in the U.S. did.

1837
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:59,790
Monsanto's engineered
growth hormone did not comply

1838
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,565
with safety requirements.

1839
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,510
it could be absorbed
by the body

1840
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,240
and therefore did have
implications for human health.

1841
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,920
Mysteriously that
conclusion was deleted

1842
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,590
from the final published
version of their report...

1843
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,390
I personally
was very concerned

1844
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,440
that there’s a very serious
problem of secrecy

1845
01:32:18,475 --> 01:32:20,200
conspiracy and things
of that nature.

1846
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,120
We have been pressured
and coerced

1847
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,840
to pass drugs of
questionable safety

1848
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,500
including RBST.

1849
01:32:27,535 --> 01:32:28,960
We wrote the story.

1850
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,350
We had it ready a
week beforehand.

1851
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:32,640
They bought ads

1852
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,680
...farmers in the milk
industry say it's safe

1853
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:36,840
but studies suggest
a link to cancer.

1854
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,680
Don’t miss this special report
from The Investigators...

1855
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,950
That Friday night before the
Monday the series was to begin

1856
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,485
the fax machine
spit out a letter

1857
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,200
from this very high priced
lawyer in New York

1858
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,190
that Monsanto had hired.

1859
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,110
It contained a lot of
things that were just

1860
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,310
off-the-wall false

1861
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,005
Just demonstrably false

1862
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,680
but if you didn’t
know the story

1863
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,140
and you didn’t know how
we'd gone about producing

1864
01:32:59,175 --> 01:33:01,320
it would have scared
you as a broadcaster

1865
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,480
or as a manager.

1866
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,480
And they decided that they
would pull the story

1867
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,280
and they would just check
it one more time.

1868
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,600
But the bottom line was that
there was no factual errors

1869
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,725
in that story.

1870
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,160
Both sides had been
heard from

1871
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,960
both sides had had an
opportunity to speak.

1872
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,005
One week later

1873
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,790
Monsanto sent
the second letter

1874
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,080
and this was even
more strongly worded.

1875
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,880
And it said there will be dire
consequences for Fox News

1876
01:33:24,915 --> 01:33:28,000
if the story airs
in Florida.

1877
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,000
And this time
they freaked.

1878
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,635
They were afraid
of being sued

1879
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:34,830
and losing
advertising dollars.

1880
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,935
And all of the stations
owned by Rupert Murdoch.

1881
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,630
And he owned more television
stations than any

1882
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,400
other group in America.

1883
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,845
That’s 22
television stations.

1884
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,400
That’s a lot of
advertising dollars.

1885
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,440
For Round Up Aspartame
Nutra Sweet

1886
01:33:48,475 --> 01:33:49,760
and other products.

1887
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,750
So we got into
a battle.

1888
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,550
And uh the first deal was
the new general manager

1889
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,320
his name's Dave and
Dave is a salesman.

1890
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,270
And you know
he’d pump your hand

1891
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,485
how ya doin
how ya doin?

1892
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,195
Called us upstairs to
his office and he said

1893
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:04,870
what would you say if
I killed this piece?

1894
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,165
what if it never ran?

1895
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,790
And we said
well you know

1896
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,710
we wouldn’t be very
happy about that.

1897
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,320
And he said well I
could kill it you know

1898
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:13,680
and we said yes of
course you’re the manager

1899
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,240
you could kill it
it would never air.

1900
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:18,000
And he hemming
and he showing.

1901
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:19,160
He’s back
and he’s forth.

1902
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,760
And we couldn’t figure out
what is this all about

1903
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,040
and finally
he blurted out

1904
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,400
look would
you tell anybody?

1905
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,950
You know I said I’m
not going to lie for you.

1906
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,870
And about a week later he
calls us back to the office

1907
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,480
and says okay wed like you
to make these changes.

1908
01:34:32,515 --> 01:34:35,000
In fact you will
make these changes.

1909
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,870
We said well look let us
show you the research

1910
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,640
that we have that
shows that this information

1911
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:41,190
you want us to
broadcast isn’t true.

1912
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,240
To which he replies.

1913
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,280
I don’t care about that.

1914
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,680
I said pardon me?

1915
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,590
And he said well that’s
what I have lawyers for

1916
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,320
just write it the way the
lawyers want it written.

1917
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,040
I said you know
this is news

1918
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,325
this is important.

1919
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,400
This is stuff
people wanted to know.

1920
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,670
And I’ll never forget he
didn’t pause a beat

1921
01:34:57,705 --> 01:34:58,600
and he said

1922
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,740
we just paid three
billion dollars

1923
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:02,560
for these
television stations

1924
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,520
Well tell you what
the news is.

1925
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,320
The news is what
we say it is.

1926
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,880
I said I’m not
doing that.

1927
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,120
and and he said

1928
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,160
Well he said if you refuse
to present this story

1929
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,395
the way we think it
should be presented

1930
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:17,510
you’ll be fired
for insubordination.

1931
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,320
I said I will go to the Federal
Communications Commissions

1932
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,710
and I will report that
I was fired from my job by you

1933
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,685
the licensee of these
public airwaves

1934
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,480
because I refused to lie
to people on the air.

1935
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,040
And it's thank you very much
you’ll hear from us right away.

1936
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,590
Well 24 hours came and went
and we didn’t hear a thing.

1937
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,550
And about a week later
he calls us back

1938
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,390
and now we’ve
changed strategies.

1939
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,520
How about if we
pay you some money

1940
01:35:43,555 --> 01:35:46,640
and you just go away?

1941
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,205
And I said
how much money?

1942
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,040
because when somebody
offers to bribe you like that

1943
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,120
I always want to know if
it might be worth it.

1944
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,240
He was going to offer us the
rest of our years salary

1945
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:04,680
if we agreed not to talk about
what Monsanto had done

1946
01:36:04,715 --> 01:36:08,070
To not talk about the Fox
corporate response

1947
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,765
in suppressing the story.

1948
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,030
And to not talk
about the story.

1949
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,840
Not talk about B G H
again anywhere.

1950
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,600
Not take this story to
another new organization.

1951
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,070
Zip up.

1952
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,310
I said you mean if I want to go
to my daughter's PTA meetings

1953
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,420
and explain what’s
in the school milk

1954
01:36:26,455 --> 01:36:28,280
at the school lunch
program I cant?

1955
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,870
No you can never speak
about this anywhere.

1956
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,120
Steve says
okay write it up.

1957
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,550
And I’m like what are you
talking about write it up?

1958
01:36:37,585 --> 01:36:39,720
And I didn’t say anything.

1959
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,520
And Dave he wrote it
up and he FedExed it to us

1960
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,470
a couple of days later.

1961
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,485
And he said
are you going to sign?

1962
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,590
And we said nah Dave
we're not going to sign that.

1963
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,040
And he said well
send it back okay?

1964
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,360
We said no Dave were
not going to send that back.

1965
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:00,520
It was okay we
cant buy you out

1966
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,925
we cant shut you up

1967
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,160
lets get the story on the air
in a way that we can all agree

1968
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,310
it will go on the air.

1969
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,800
And we started rewriting and
editing with their lawyers.

1970
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,325
During this eight month
re-review process

1971
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,670
I say jokingly they did things
like for example they wanted

1972
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,240
to take out
the word cancer.

1973
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,800
You don’t have to identify
what the potential problem is

1974
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,270
just say human
health implications.

1975
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,920
Any criticism
of Monsanto or its product

1976
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,840
they either removed
it or minimized it.

1977
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,680
And it was very very
clear I would say

1978
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,360
almost every edit
they made to the piece

1979
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,790
that was the aim.

1980
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,880
And we changed this
and this and this.

1981
01:37:39,915 --> 01:37:41,040
And then that
wasn’t good enough

1982
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,320
okay now change
this and this.

1983
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,110
Now change this and this.

1984
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,120
Version after version
after version.

1985
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,760
83 times.

1986
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,880
83 times is unheard
of it doesn’t happen

1987
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,955
you shouldn’t have to
rewrite something 83 times

1988
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:58,280
Obviously they didn’t want
to put the thing on the air

1989
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,950
and they were trying to drive us
crazy and get us to quit

1990
01:38:00,985 --> 01:38:03,080
or wait until the first
window in our contract

1991
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,920
so that they
could fire us.

1992
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,640
They in effect announced that
they were going to fire us

1993
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,230
for no cause.

1994
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,645
Well this was
a little much.

1995
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,440
And Steve wrote a letter
to the lawyer in Atlanta

1996
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,550
whose name is Caroline Forest
the Fox corporate lawyer.

1997
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,440
And I said you know this isn’t
about being fired for no cause.

1998
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,820
You're firing us because we
refused to put on the air

1999
01:38:25,855 --> 01:38:28,920
something that we knew and
demonstrated to be false

2000
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,080
and misleading.

2001
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,600
That’s what
this is about.

2002
01:38:31,635 --> 01:38:32,800
And because we
put up a fight

2003
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,800
because we stood up
to this big corporation

2004
01:38:34,835 --> 01:38:36,040
and we stood up
to your editors

2005
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,310
and we stood up
to your lawyers.

2006
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,525
And we said to you

2007
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,120
look there ought
to be a principle higher

2008
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,405
than just making money.

2009
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,845
And she wrote a
letter back and said

2010
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,630
you are right that’s
exactly what it was.

2011
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,630
You stood up
to us on this story

2012
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,000
and that’s why
we're letting you go.

2013
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:51,360
Big mistake

2014
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,200
That says retaliation.

2015
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,420
You cant retaliate
against employees

2016
01:38:56,455 --> 01:38:58,600
if they’re standing
up for something

2017
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,445
that they believe is illegal

2018
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,470
that they don’t want
to participate in.

2019
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,280
So that gave us

2020
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,470
the whistleblower
status that we needed

2021
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,320
in the state of Florida to
file a whistleblower claim

2022
01:39:09,355 --> 01:39:10,400
against our employer.

2023
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,720
Two or three years
later we got the trial.

2024
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,790
Five weeks of testimony led
to a jury verdict of $425,000

2025
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,400
in which the jury determined

2026
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,430
that the story they
pressured us to broadcast

2027
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,200
the story we resisted
telling was in fact false

2028
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,910
distorted or slanted.

2029
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,800
Fox News
appealed the verdict.

2030
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,470
Five major news media
corporations filed briefs

2031
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,040
with the court in support
of Fox's appeal.

2032
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,320
You may recall that Jane Akre
a former reporter here

2033
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,400
sued Fox 13 in
a whistleblower lawsuit

2034
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,565
claiming that
she was fired

2035
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,965
for refusing
to distort her report;

2036
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,960
the Appeals Court today
threw that case out

2037
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,600
saying Ms. Akre had
no whistleblower claim

2038
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,645
against the station
based on news distortion.

2039
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,560
Fox 13 vice-president and
general manager Bob Linger

2040
01:40:03,595 --> 01:40:05,790
says the station
has been completely

2041
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,365
vindicated by the ruling...

2042
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,310
What Fox neglected
to report is this

2043
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,280
Jane sued Fox under Florida’s
whistleblower statute

2044
01:40:13,315 --> 01:40:15,790
which protects those who try
to prevent others

2045
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,870
from breaking the law.

2046
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,120
Buther Appeal Court judges
found that falsifying news

2047
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,645
isn’t actually
against the law.

2048
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,360
So they denied Jane her
whistleblower status

2049
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,920
overturned the case and
withdrew her $425,000 award.

2050
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:38,240
Canada and Europe have
upheld the ban on RBGH.

2051
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,280
But it remains hidden
in the milk supply

2052
01:40:41,315 --> 01:40:42,360
of the United States

2053
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,760
The prospect that two thirds
of the worlds population

2054
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,560
will have no access to fresh
drinking water by 2025

2055
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,550
has provoked
the initial confrontations

2056
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,040
in a world wide battle

2057
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:03,030
for control over the planets
most basic resource.

2058
01:41:03,065 --> 01:41:04,840
When Bolivia sought
to refinance

2059
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,480
the public water services
of its third largest city

2060
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:12,550
the World Bank
required privatization

2061
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,280
which is how the Bechtel
Corporation of San Francisco

2062
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:19,040
gained control over all
of Cochabamba's water

2063
01:41:19,075 --> 01:41:20,160
even that which
fell from the sky.

2064
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,100
The price this
beleaguered country paid

2065
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,400
for World Bank loans

2066
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,285
was the privatization
of the state oil industry

2067
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:38,110
and its airline, railroad,
electric and phone companies.

2068
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,710
But the government failed
to convince Bolivians

2069
01:42:40,745 --> 01:42:43,000
that water is
a commodity like any other.

2070
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,805
Bolivia was determined

2071
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,070
to defend
the corporations right

2072
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,365
to charge families
living on $2 a day

2073
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,840
as much as one quarter
of their income for water.

2074
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:30,880
The greater the popular
resistance

2075
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,900
to the water
privatization scheme

2076
01:43:32,935 --> 01:43:34,880
the more violent
became the standoff.

2077
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,360
Transnational corporations
have a long and dark history

2078
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,550
of condoning tyrannical
governments.

2079
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,000
Is it narcissism that compels
them to seek their reflection

2080
01:44:31,035 --> 01:44:33,400
in the regimented structures
of fascist regimes?

2081
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,800
There was
an interesting connection

2082
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,685
between the rise
of fascism in Europe

2083
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:01,510
and the consciousness
of politically radical people

2084
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,480
about corporate power.

2085
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,140
Because there was are cognition

2086
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:09,600
that fascism rose
in Europe

2087
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,560
with the help of
enormous corporations.

2088
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,710
Mussolini was greatly admired
all across the spectrum

2089
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,200
business loved him
investment shot up.

2090
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,965
Incidentally when
Hitler came in

2091
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,560
in Germany the same
thing happened there

2092
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,005
investment shot
up in Germany.

2093
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,150
He had the work
force under control.

2094
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:30,360
He was getting rid of dangerous
left wing elements.

2095
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,430
Investment opportunities
were improving.

2096
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,750
There was no problems.

2097
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,110
These are
wonderful countries.

2098
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,190
I think one of the greatest
untold stories

2099
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,585
of the twentieth century

2100
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:43,000
is the collusion
between corporations

2101
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,845
especially in America
and Nazi Germany.

2102
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,320
First in terms of how the
corporations from America

2103
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,360
helped to essentially
rebuild Germany

2104
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:56,000
and support the early
Nazi regime.

2105
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,870
And then when
the war broke out

2106
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,640
figured out a way to
keep everything going.

2107
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,640
So General Motors was
able to keep Opal going

2108
01:46:04,675 --> 01:46:07,840
Ford was able to keep
their thing going

2109
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,230
and companies like Coca Cola
they couldn’t keep

2110
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,720
the Coca Cola going

2111
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,440
so what they did was
they invented Fanta Orange

2112
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,125
for the Germans

2113
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:19,070
and that show Coke was
able to keep

2114
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,440
their profits coming in

2115
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,960
to Coca Cola.

2116
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,990
So when you drink
Fanta Orange

2117
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,510
that’s the Nazi drink

2118
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,550
that was created so that Coke
could continue making money

2119
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,040
while millions of people died.

2120
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,160
When Hitler came
to power in 1933

2121
01:46:35,195 --> 01:46:36,760
his goal was to dismantle

2122
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,560
and destroy the
Jewish community.

2123
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:41,005
This was an enterprise
so vast

2124
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,640
that it required the resources
of a computer.

2125
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,520
But in 1933 there
was no computer

2126
01:46:46,555 --> 01:46:47,640
What there was

2127
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,720
was the IBM
punch card system

2128
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,440
which controlled
and stored information

2129
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,640
based upon the holes
that were punched

2130
01:46:55,675 --> 01:46:58,320
in various rows
and columns.

2131
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,760
Naturally there was
no off the shelf software

2132
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,400
as there is today.

2133
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:05,430
Each applicant was custom
designed and an engineer

2134
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,680
had to personally
configure it.

2135
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,760
Millions of people of
all religions nationalities

2136
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,995
and characteristics
went through

2137
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:18,110
the concentration
camp system.

2138
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:21,080
That’s an extraordinary
traffic management program

2139
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,140
that required
an IBM system

2140
01:47:24,175 --> 01:47:26,720
in every railroad
direction

2141
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:30,040
and an IBM system in every
concentration camp.

2142
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,400
Now this is a typical
prisoner card.

2143
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,680
There are little boxes

2144
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,660
where all the information
is to be punched in.

2145
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:45,400
We compare this information
to the code sheet

2146
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,160
for concentration camps.

2147
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,680
And here you see
Auschwitz is one

2148
01:47:48,715 --> 01:47:50,000
Buchenwald is two

2149
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,805
and Dachau is three.

2150
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,040
Now what kinds of
prisoners were they?

2151
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,520
They could be a Jehovah’s
witness for two

2152
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,110
a homosexual for three
a communist for six

2153
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,190
or a Jew for eight.

2154
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,725
Now what was their stats?

2155
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,960
One was released
two was transferred

2156
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,880
four was executed

2157
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,420
five was suicide

2158
01:48:11,455 --> 01:48:13,440
and six.
Code six

2159
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,630
Sonderbahandlung

2160
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,230
special treatment

2161
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:21,320
meant the gas chamber
or sometimes a bullet.

2162
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,990
They would punch
that number in

2163
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,160
the material was tabulated

2164
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,965
and the machines were set.

2165
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,710
And of course the
punch cards by the millions

2166
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,440
had to be printed.

2167
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,280
And they were printed
exclusively by IBM

2168
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,590
and the profits were
recovered just after the war

2169
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,880
I really do believe that
particular accusation

2170
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:46,470
has been fairly discredited
as a serious accusation.

2171
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,605
They used equipment

2172
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:54,670
that is a fact
but how they got it

2173
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,920
how much co operation
they got

2174
01:48:56,955 --> 01:48:58,205
and any kind
of collusion

2175
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,280
trying to connect dots
that are not connected

2176
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,840
I think that’s the part
that is discredited.

2177
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:09,150
Generally you sell computers

2178
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,950
and they are used
in a variety of ways

2179
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,030
and you always
hope they are

2180
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,640
using the more
positive ways possible.

2181
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,990
If you ever found out
they’re used in ways

2182
01:49:18,025 --> 01:49:19,990
that are not positive

2183
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:24,080
then you would hope you
would stop supporting that

2184
01:49:24,115 --> 01:49:26,280
but you know do
you always know?

2185
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,640
Can you always tell?

2186
01:49:27,675 --> 01:49:28,800
Can you always find out?

2187
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,870
IBM would
of course say

2188
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,470
they had no control over
its German subsidiaries.

2189
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,160
But here on
October 9th 1941

2190
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,030
a letter is being
written directly

2191
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,280
to Thomas J. Watson
with all sorts of detail

2192
01:49:44,315 --> 01:49:47,280
of the activity of
the German subsidiary

2193
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,750
none of these
machines were sold

2194
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,590
they were all
leased by IBM.

2195
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,855
They had to be serviced
on site once a month

2196
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,870
even if that was
at a concentration camp.

2197
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:02,160
This is a typical contract
with IBM and the Third Reich.

2198
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:05,205
Which was instituted in 1942.

2199
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,760
It's not with the Dutch
subsidiary

2200
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,815
it's not with the German
subsidiary.

2201
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:12,470
It is with IBM
corporation in New York.

2202
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:18,910
You know as it happens
I know that story.

2203
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,760
I discussed it more than once
with old Mr. Watson

2204
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,365
and I was around
at the time.

2205
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,600
I’m not saying that Watson
didn’t know

2206
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,680
that the German government
used punch cards.

2207
01:50:30,715 --> 01:50:32,800
He probably did know

2208
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,600
after all he had
very few customers.

2209
01:50:35,635 --> 01:50:37,325
Watson didn’t want
to do it.

2210
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,400
It was not because he thought
it was immoral or not

2211
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,080
but because Watson

2212
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,360
with a very keen sense
of public relations

2213
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,870
thought it was risky.

2214
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,695
It should not surprise us that
corporate allegiance

2215
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:52,430
to profits will trump their
allegiance to any flag.

2216
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,860
A recent U.S. Treasury
Department report

2217
01:50:54,895 --> 01:50:57,000
revealed in one
week alone

2218
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,405
57 U.S. corporations
were fined

2219
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,830
for trading with official
enemies of the United States

2220
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:06,960
including terrorists tyrants
and despotic regimes.

2221
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,240
...you can roughly locate any
community somewhere along

2222
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:21,200
a scale running all the way
from democracy to despotism.

2223
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,720
This man makes it his job
to study these things...

2224
01:51:28,755 --> 01:51:30,280
Well for one thing

2225
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,525
avoid the comfortable idea

2226
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,160
that the mere form of
government can of itself

2227
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,040
safeguard a nation
against despotism.

2228
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:44,840
For big business despotism
was often a useful tool

2229
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:48,165
for securing foreign markets
and pursuing profits.

2230
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,400
One of the U.S. Marine corps
most highly decorated generals

2231
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:54,550
Smedley Darlington Butler
by his own account

2232
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,230
helped pacify Mexico
for American oil companies

2233
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:01,040
Haiti and Cuba
for National City Bank

2234
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,800
Nicaragua for the Brown
Brothers brokerage

2235
01:52:03,835 --> 01:52:06,440
the Dominican Republic
for sugar interests

2236
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,520
Honduras for U.S.
Fruit companies

2237
01:52:09,555 --> 01:52:11,600
and China
for standard oil.

2238
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,320
General Butlers services
were also in demand

2239
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,125
in the United States
in the 1930s

2240
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,310
as president
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

2241
01:52:21,345 --> 01:52:22,640
sought to relieve
the misery

2242
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,365
of the depression through
public enterprise

2243
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,600
and to offer regulation
on corporate exploitation

2244
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,520
and misdeeds.

2245
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,240
more power to you
President Roosevelt

2246
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,240
The entire country’s
behind you.

2247
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,400
thrilled with hope
and patriotism...

2248
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,560
But the country
was not entirely

2249
01:52:39,595 --> 01:52:40,965
behind
the populist president.

2250
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,560
Large parts of
the corporate elite

2251
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,120
despised what Roosevelt’s
new deal stood for.

2252
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,670
And so in 1934

2253
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,480
a group of conspirators
sought to involve

2254
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,830
General Butler in
a treasonous plan.

2255
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:56,975
.. The plan as outlined to me
was to form an organization

2256
01:52:57,010 --> 01:52:59,510
of veterans to use as a bluff
or as a club at least

2257
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,870
to intimidate
the government...

2258
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,560
but the corporate cabal
had picked the wrong man.

2259
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,880
Butler was fed up
being what he called

2260
01:53:06,915 --> 01:53:08,670
a gangster for capitalism.

2261
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,720
...I appeared before
the Congressional Committee

2262
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,680
the highest representation
of the American people

2263
01:53:19,715 --> 01:53:22,560
under subpoena to tell what
I knew of activities

2264
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,510
which I believed might lead
to an attempt to set up

2265
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:27,830
a fascist dictatorship.

2266
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:31,360
The upshot of the whole
thing was that I was supposed

2267
01:53:31,395 --> 01:53:34,445
to lead an organization of
500000 men which would

2268
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,520
be able to take over
the functions of government...

2269
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,310
A Congressional Committee
ultimately found evidence

2270
01:53:40,345 --> 01:53:43,150
of a plot to overthrow
Roosevelt.

2271
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,965
According to Butler
the conspiracy included

2272
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,200
representatives of some
of Americas top corporations

2273
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:52,960
including J. P. Morgan
Dupont and Goodyear tire.

2274
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,200
As today's chairman
of Goodyear knows

2275
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,630
for corporations
to dominate government

2276
01:54:02,665 --> 01:54:04,790
a coup is no
longer necessary.

2277
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:09,840
Corporations have gone
global and by going global

2278
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:14,710
the governments have lost
some control over corporations

2279
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,430
regardless of whether
the corporation can be trusted

2280
01:54:17,465 --> 01:54:19,240
or can not be trusted

2281
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,430
governments
today do not have

2282
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:25,160
over the corporations
the power that they had

2283
01:54:25,195 --> 01:54:28,640
and the leverage they
had 50 or 60 years ago.

2284
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,365
And that’s a major change.

2285
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,040
So governments have
become powerless

2286
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,125
compared to what
they were before.

2287
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:39,710
Capitalism today commands
the towering heights

2288
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,910
and has displaced
politics and politicians

2289
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,400
as the new high priests

2290
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:47,045
and reigning
oligarchs of our system.

2291
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:51,280
So capitalism and its principle
protagonists and players

2292
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,880
corporate CEOs

2293
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,480
have been accorded unusual
power and access.

2294
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,480
This is not to deny the
significance of government

2295
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,480
and politicians

2296
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,710
but these are
the new high priests.

2297
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,635
I was invited to
Washington D.C. to attend

2298
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:11,110
this meeting that
was being put together

2299
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,700
by the National
Security Agency called

2300
01:55:13,735 --> 01:55:15,720
the Critical
Thinking Consortium.

2301
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,880
I remember standing
there in this room

2302
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,990
and looking over
on one side of the room

2303
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:25,640
and we had
the CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI

2304
01:55:25,675 --> 01:55:29,360
Customs, Secret Service

2305
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,430
and then on the other
side of the room we had

2306
01:55:31,465 --> 01:55:36,200
Coca Cola, Mobile Oil,
GTE and Kodak.

2307
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,000
And I remember thinking

2308
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,390
I am in the epicentre

2309
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,635
of the intelligence
industry right now.

2310
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,790
I mean the line
is not just blurring

2311
01:55:44,825 --> 01:55:47,910
it just not
there any more.

2312
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,030
And tome it

2313
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:50,885
it spoke volumes
as to how

2314
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,790
industry and government were
consulting with each other

2315
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,030
and working
with each other.

2316
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,190
As 34 nations of the western
hemisphere gathered

2317
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,390
to draft a far reaching
trade agreement

2318
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,640
one that would lay
the groundwork

2319
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,030
to privatize every resource
and service imaginable

2320
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,120
thousands of people

2321
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,310
from hundreds
of grassroots organizations

2322
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,840
joined to oppose it.

2323
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,085
Canada’s top
business lobbyists

2324
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,000
and its chief trade
representative

2325
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,880
discount the dissent
in the streets.

2326
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:36,040
For them the Americas
800 million citizens

2327
01:56:36,075 --> 01:56:37,470
speak with one voice.

2328
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,350
I’m inside and
this is all outside.

2329
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:07,120
That’s the way it is.

2330
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,510
What do you think when
you look at this?

2331
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,310
Well I mean I think
that it's too bad

2332
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,720
that this has
this has erupted.

2333
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,400
Does the ranted to be some
measure of accountability?

2334
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,510
Yes

2335
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,800
And I think the business
community recognizes that.

2336
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,230
But that accountability
is in the marketplace

2337
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,040
it's with
their shareholders.

2338
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:12,440
It's with the public perception
and the public image

2339
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,285
that they are projecting.

2340
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:19,320
If companies don’t do what
they should be doing

2341
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:21,160
they’re going to be
punished in the marketplace

2342
01:59:21,195 --> 01:59:22,880
and that’s not what
any company wants.

2343
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,280
There’s a new market.

2344
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,725
These guys and
gals aren’t out there

2345
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:31,800
because governments
putting gun to their head.

2346
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:34,840
Or because they’ve
suddenly read a book

2347
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,040
about transcendental meditation
and global morality.

2348
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,430
My inner voice says
honour my inner child

2349
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:44,200
Mine says love everyone

2350
01:59:44,235 --> 01:59:45,720
My inner voice says

2351
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,220
Id like a Wendy’s
Bacon mushroom melt

2352
01:59:48,255 --> 01:59:50,400
They’re there because
they understand.

2353
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:52,990
The market requires
them to be there.

2354
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:55,710
That’s their competitive
advantage to be there.

2355
01:59:55,745 --> 01:59:57,310
I’m listening
to your concerns.

2356
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,920
I worry about climate.

2357
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,405
I worry about pollution.

2358
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,320
I do not have all
the answers to this

2359
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:05,600
but we are prepared to work
with you with society

2360
02:00:05,635 --> 02:00:08,840
with NGOs with
governments to address it.

2361
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:12,840
So you’re build the trust
so that you come back to

2362
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,165
a new kind of trust

2363
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:18,000
and then the ultimate
goal is then

2364
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,800
to become
the corporation of choice.

2365
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:23,560
He believes that almost half
our energy can one day come

2366
02:00:23,595 --> 02:00:25,510
from renewable sources.

2367
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:29,310
He’s been called
a dreamer and a crank.

2368
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,200
and I’ve been
called a hippie.

2369
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:38,200
and more recently
a project manager for Shell.

2370
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,710
I ask myself
often times why

2371
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,040
so many companies
subscribe to

2372
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:48,310
corporate social responsibility.

2373
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:51,940
I’m not sure it's because
they necessarily

2374
02:00:51,975 --> 02:00:55,400
want to be responsible
in an ultimate way

2375
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,390
but because
they want to be

2376
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:01,760
identified and seen
to be responsible.

2377
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:04,000
But who am I to judge?

2378
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,030
Who am I to judge?

2379
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:08,840
It's better that they
belong than they not belong.

2380
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,360
It's better that they make
some public profession

2381
02:01:12,395 --> 02:01:15,430
than the opposite.

2382
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:18,630
Social responsibility
isn’t a deep shift

2383
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:23,880
because its
a voluntary tactic.

2384
02:01:23,915 --> 02:01:24,790
A tactic

2385
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:31,045
a reaction to a certain
market at this point.

2386
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:34,520
And as the corporation reads
the market differently

2387
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,325
it can go back.

2388
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:37,765
One day you
see Bambi

2389
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,920
next day
you see Godzilla.

2390
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,390
How do you define
socially responsible?

2391
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,550
What business is it
of the corporation to decide

2392
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,270
what’s socially responsible.

2393
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,760
That isn’t
their expertise

2394
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:54,110
that isn’t what their
stockholders ask them to do.

2395
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:57,030
So I think they’re going
out of their range

2396
02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:00,680
and its certainly
is not democratic.

2397
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,430
I don’t really care

2398
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,960
what the chairman
of General Motors thinks

2399
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,045
is an appropriate
level of emissions

2400
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:10,840
to come out the tailpipe
of General Motors automobiles.

2401
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,320
He may have a lot
of scientists

2402
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,920
he may be
a very good person

2403
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:16,035
but I didn’t elect
him to do anything.

2404
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:17,790
He doesn’t have any
power to speak for me.

2405
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,800
These are decisions that must
be made by government

2406
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,830
and not by corporations.

2407
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:25,005
You take this to its
logical conclusion.

2408
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:29,750
One would have an image
that we are in fact at this

2409
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,750
the end of the world
this nigh.

2410
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,200
And we are all
completely brainwashed

2411
02:02:35,235 --> 02:02:37,720
and there is
no space left.

2412
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,990
And I don’t believe
we're there yet.

2413
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,990
And I think it's
really important

2414
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,240
that we don’t
overstate the case

2415
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:47,590
and that we admit that
there are cracks

2416
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:49,800
and fissures in all of these
corporate structures.

2417
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:52,640
And sometimes when
a corporation is concentrating

2418
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,125
on one particular project
they look the other way

2419
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,310
and all kinds of interesting
things happen in the corner.

2420
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:02,520
It is the case in every period
of history where injustice

2421
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:05,640
based on falsehoods

2422
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:09,640
based on taking away the right
and freedoms of people

2423
02:03:09,675 --> 02:03:11,710
to live and survive
with dignity

2424
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:14,720
that eventually when you call
a bluff the tables turn.

2425
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:34,120
Ultimately capital puts
its foot down somewhere.

2426
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:36,600
And anywhere
it puts its foot down

2427
02:03:36,635 --> 02:03:39,440
it can be held
accountable.

2428
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,390
Originally Wal-Mart and
Kathy Lee Gifford had said

2429
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:47,640
why should we believe you that
children work in this factory?

2430
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,600
What we didn’t tell them
was that Wendy Dias

2431
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,120
in the centre of the
picture was on a plane

2432
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,160
to the United States.

2433
02:03:53,195 --> 02:03:54,085
This is Wendy Dias.

2434
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,320
She comes
to the United States.

2435
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,925
She’s unstoppable.

2436
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:59,190
Congress heard testimony
today from children who

2437
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,800
testified they were exploited
by sweatshops overseas.

2438
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,900
Kathy Lee Gifford
apologized to Wendy Dias

2439
02:04:04,935 --> 02:04:06,600
It was the most
amazing thing Id seen.

2440
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,160
This powerful celebrity
leans over and says

2441
02:04:10,195 --> 02:04:12,280
Wendy please believe me

2442
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:15,160
I didn’t know these
conditions existed.

2443
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,660
And now that I do I’m
going to work with you.

2444
02:04:16,695 --> 02:04:18,120
I’m going to work
with these other people

2445
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,965
and it'll never
happen again.

2446
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,590
And that night we signed
an agreement

2447
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,750
with Kathy Lee Gifford.

2448
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,560
I thought it would be
a relatively easy process

2449
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,160
and it isn’t.

2450
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,320
As for every question
I have there seem to be

2451
02:04:29,355 --> 02:04:31,270
five questions that
come back tome.

2452
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,560
As far as Wal-Mart
goes and Kathy Lee

2453
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,200
pretty much everything returned
to sweatshop conditions

2454
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:40,200
but because this was fought out
on television for weeks

2455
02:04:40,235 --> 02:04:41,720
this incident with Kathy Lee
Gifford actually

2456
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,230
took the sweatshop issue

2457
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,320
took every single part
of the country.

2458
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,760
And so frankly
after that

2459
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,320
there’s hardly a single
person in this country

2460
02:04:48,355 --> 02:04:49,520
who doesn’t know
about child labour

2461
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,430
or sweatshops or
starvation wages.

2462
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,910
So what wanted to do is
to look at the very roots

2463
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:20,680
of the legal form that
created this beast

2464
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:24,030
and wanted to think who
can hold them accountable.

2465
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:27,160
They’re not
graven in stone.

2466
02:05:27,195 --> 02:05:28,350
They can be dismantled.

2467
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:31,405
And in fact most
states have laws

2468
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,120
which require that
they be dismantled.

2469
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,600
For too long now

2470
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,525
giant corporations
have been allowed

2471
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:42,000
to undermine democracy here
in the United States

2472
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:43,760
and all over the world.

2473
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:45,320
But today the Inn National
Lawyer's Guild

2474
02:05:45,355 --> 02:05:46,990
and 29 other groups
and individuals

2475
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,605
are fighting back.

2476
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,710
We are calling upon State
Attorney General Dan Lungren

2477
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,800
to comply
with California law

2478
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,910
and to revoke
the corporate charter

2479
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:00,320
of the Union Oil
Company of California

2480
02:06:00,355 --> 02:06:03,360
for its repeated
and grievous offences.

2481
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,400
This is the statute
that is well-known.

2482
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:06,510
It has been used.

2483
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:07,685
It can be used.

2484
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,950
What this will mean
is the dissolution

2485
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:12,640
of the Union Oil Company
of California

2486
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,755
the sale of its assets
under careful court orders

2487
02:06:15,790 --> 02:06:18,510
to others who will carry
on in the public interest.

2488
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,525
This is nothing more
than a smear campaign.

2489
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:26,400
This company has been part
of California’s economy

2490
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:29,230
for over 100 years...
thousands of jobs.

2491
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,910
Doesn’t mean it's never
made any mistakes

2492
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,830
paid for those mistakes

2493
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,605
but this demonizing
of a company

2494
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,160
I think I am in a time
warp or something

2495
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:37,920
that I fell asleep
and woke up 50 years ago

2496
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,365
and we heard that
kind of rhetoric.

2497
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:42,550
Well we have a very very
broad set of people angry

2498
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:44,550
very angry at
this corporation

2499
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:45,790
well people from
the left of the spectrum

2500
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,230
who don’t produce anything
except hot air.

2501
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,790
From its complicity
in unspeakable

2502
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,470
human rights
violations overseas

2503
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:56,480
against women, gays, labourers
and indigenous peoples

2504
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,200
to its efforts to subvert
U.S. foreign policy

2505
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,670
and deceive the courts

2506
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,375
the public and
its own stockholders

2507
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:05,870
Unocal is emblematic
of corporate abuse

2508
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,120
and corporate power
run amok

2509
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:15,045
...is immoral.

2510
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:18,520
Unocal cannot
do business in Burma

2511
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:22,040
without supporting
that hopeless regime...

2512
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:36,590
The curse for me has been
the fact that in making these

2513
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:38,590
you know documentary films

2514
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:41,840
I’ve seen that they
actually can impact change

2515
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:44,760
so I’m just compelled
to just keep making them.

2516
02:07:44,795 --> 02:07:47,280
Yep that’s me
doing what I do

2517
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:49,925
All year long I give big
companies a hard time

2518
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:53,000
but at Christmas time I like
to set aside my differences

2519
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:57,160
and reach out to big business
like cigarette companies.

2520
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,910
Deck the Halls with
boughs of holly...

2521
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,430
fa la la la la
la la la

2522
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,165
I went to Littleton
Colorado

2523
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:13,560
where the Columbine
shooting took place

2524
02:08:13,595 --> 02:08:14,760
and I didn’t
know this

2525
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,040
but when I arrived I learned
what the primary job is

2526
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:22,280
of the parents of the kids who
go to Columbine High School.

2527
02:08:22,315 --> 02:08:24,400
The number one job
in Littleton Colorado

2528
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:26,400
They work
for Lockheed Martin

2529
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,755
building weapons
of mass destruction.

2530
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:30,990
But they don’t
see the connect

2531
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:34,000
between what
they do for a living

2532
02:08:34,035 --> 02:08:36,680
and what their
kids do at school

2533
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:39,470
or did at school

2534
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:42,470
And so I’m kind of you
know up on my high horse

2535
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:45,750
thinking about this
and I thought you know

2536
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,480
I said to my wife

2537
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:50,950
we both are sons and
daughters of auto workers

2538
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,405
in Flint Michigan.

2539
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:55,240
There isn’t a single one of
us back in Flint

2540
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:57,630
any of us including us

2541
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,710
who ever
stopped to think

2542
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:01,980
this thing we do
for a living

2543
02:09:02,015 --> 02:09:03,840
the building
of automobiles

2544
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,080
is probably
the single biggest reason

2545
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,270
why the polar ice caps
are going to melt

2546
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:12,150
and end civilization
as we know it.

2547
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,720
There’s no connect between

2548
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,880
I’m just an assembler on an
assembly line building a car

2549
02:09:17,915 --> 02:09:19,550
which is good
for people and society

2550
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:20,950
and it moves
them around.

2551
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:24,080
But never stop to think
about the larger picture

2552
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:27,320
and the larger responsibility
of what were doing.

2553
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:30,200
Ultimately we have to
as individuals

2554
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:33,205
accept responsibility
for our collective action

2555
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:39,760
and the larger harm that it
causes you know in our world.

2556
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:42,560
Today the first of two
historic town hall meetings

2557
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:45,360
will get underway
in Arcata California

2558
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,880
61 percent of Arcatans
voted in favour

2559
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,590
of publicly discussing

2560
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,800
whether democracy is even
possible with large corporations

2561
02:09:52,835 --> 02:09:54,720
...so much wealth
and power under law.

2562
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:56,485
They also voted
to form a committee

2563
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:59,640
to ensure democratic control
over corporations in Arcata.

2564
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:02,680
Corporations are
not accountable

2565
02:10:02,715 --> 02:10:03,750
to the democratic
process.

2566
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,190
That is what
this is about.

2567
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:07,280
I don’t want
to make decisions

2568
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,880
about everything that goes
on in their corporation.

2569
02:10:08,915 --> 02:10:11,480
But I do have a
strong belief

2570
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:13,560
that they don't need to be
held accountable to us.

2571
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,245
If we don’t like
certain products

2572
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:19,720
if we don’t like
Pepsi-Cola Bank of America

2573
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:21,960
well if you don’t
like what they do

2574
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,310
don’t use them.

2575
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,360
That’s the way I see
the peoples power is.

2576
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,750
You have a lot
more money than me

2577
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,205
You have more
votes than I do

2578
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:34,000
If we use the model of boycott
and voting with your dollars

2579
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,950
that’s an
undemocratic situation.

2580
02:10:36,985 --> 02:10:38,240
What are we afraid of?

2581
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,910
I mean are all the businesses
going to leave Arcata?

2582
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,800
I don’t think so.

2583
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,125
And if they did

2584
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:43,800
wed deal with it or
wed figure it out

2585
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:45,070
or wed do
something different.

2586
02:10:45,105 --> 02:10:46,440
We're creative people.

2587
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:49,470
I just don’t see
why we are afraid.

2588
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,070
If you think it's tough
making a decision

2589
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:52,205
where to buy your
stuff today

2590
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:53,640
how tough do you think
it is when there’s only

2591
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:56,590
one provider
and it's the state.

2592
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:57,950
And by the way

2593
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,150
you don’t get to have
this little democracy forum

2594
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,805
in those
communities either.

2595
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,280
People that say that they
fear their govern meant

2596
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,405
I really hope
that they understand

2597
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:08,910
that they’re allowed to
participate in their government

2598
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,150
they’re not allowed to
participate in anything

2599
02:11:11,185 --> 02:11:12,350
the corporations do.

2600
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,840
So don’t fear
the government.

2601
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,640
Help it be the government
that you wont fear.

2602
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:18,960
If this many people around
the country would do this

2603
02:11:18,995 --> 02:11:20,400
instead of watching
Super bowl Sunday

2604
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:22,510
our nation would be
controlled by the people

2605
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:24,080
not by the corporations.

2606
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,790
...no more chain restaurants
in Arcata after

2607
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,470
a long awaited decision...

2608
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,160
Over the past decade

2609
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:51,240
we have been
gaining ground.

2610
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:52,310
And when I say we

2611
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,215
I mean ordinary
people committed

2612
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:57,670
to the welfare
of all humanity.

2613
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,240
All people irrespective
of gender and class

2614
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:02,155
and race
and religion.

2615
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:03,870
All species
on the planet.

2616
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:07,125
We managed to take
the biggest government

2617
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:10,230
and one of the largest
chemical companies to court

2618
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:15,280
on the case of Neemand
win a case against them.

2619
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:18,400
W. R. Grace and the U.S.
governments patent on Neem

2620
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,925
was revoked by a case
we brought

2621
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:22,270
along with the greens
of European parliament

2622
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:25,640
and the international
organic agriculture movement.

2623
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:27,520
We won because we
worked together.

2624
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:34,720
We have overturned
nearly 99 percent

2625
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:37,005
of the basmati patent
of Ricetek.

2626
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:40,510
Again because we worked
as a world wide coalition

2627
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:44,160
old women in Texas
scientists in India

2628
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:46,550
activists sitting
in Vancouver

2629
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:49,485
a little basmati
action group.

2630
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,590
We stopped the third world
being viewed as the pirate

2631
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,630
and we showed the corporations
were the pirate.

2632
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:05,045
Look how little
it took for Gandhi

2633
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:07,430
to work against the salt
laws of the British

2634
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,925
where the British decided

2635
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,710
the way they would
make their armies

2636
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:12,200
and police forces bigger

2637
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:13,920
is just
tax the salt.

2638
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,590
And all that Gandhi did
was walk to the beach

2639
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,590
pick up
the salt and say

2640
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:19,925
nature gives it
for free.

2641
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,440
Wanted it.
We’ve always made it.

2642
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:23,200
We will violate
your laws.

2643
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:25,480
We will continue
to make salt.

2644
02:13:25,515 --> 02:13:27,640
We’ve had a similar
commitment for

2645
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:28,565
the last decade in India.

2646
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:31,990
That any law that makes
it illegal to save seed

2647
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:35,765
is a law not
worth following.

2648
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:38,760
We will violate it because
saving seed is a duty

2649
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:43,310
to the earth and
to future generations.

2650
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,320
We thought it would
really be symbolic

2651
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:47,285
It is more than symbolic.

2652
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:50,550
It is becoming
a survival option.

2653
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,560
Farmers who grow
their own seeds

2654
02:13:53,595 --> 02:13:54,550
save their own seeds

2655
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:55,925
don’t buy pesticides

2656
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:57,790
have threefold
more incomes

2657
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:00,480
than farmers who are locked
into the chemical treadmill

2658
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:03,750
depending on
Monsanto and Cargill

2659
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,230
We have managed
to create alternatives

2660
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,285
that work for people.

2661
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:12,200
There are many tools
for bringing back community.

2662
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,040
But the importance is
not the tools

2663
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,880
I mean there’s litigation
there’s legislation

2664
02:14:16,915 --> 02:14:19,680
there’s direct action
there’s education boycotts

2665
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:20,990
social investment...

2666
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:25,880
There’s many many ways
to address issues

2667
02:14:25,915 --> 02:14:27,000
of corporate power.

2668
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:28,905
But in the final analysis

2669
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,360
what’s really important
is the vision.

2670
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,230
You have to have
abetter story

2671
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:36,790
Do I know you well enough to
call you fellow plunderers?

2672
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:41,160
There is not an industrial
company on earth

2673
02:14:41,195 --> 02:14:43,870
not an institution
of any kind

2674
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:47,520
not mine not yours
not anyone’s

2675
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:51,485
that is sustainable.

2676
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,640
I stand convicted by
me myself alone

2677
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:54,845
not by anyone else

2678
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:57,080
as a plunderer
of the earth

2679
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,640
but not by our
civilizations definition.

2680
02:15:00,675 --> 02:15:02,120
By our civilization’s
definition

2681
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,390
I'm a captain
of industry.

2682
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,950
In the eyes of many
a kind of modern-day hero.

2683
02:15:06,985 --> 02:15:09,725
But really really

2684
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:13,880
the first industrial
revolution is flawed

2685
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,990
it is not working.

2686
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,840
It is unsustainable.

2687
02:15:18,875 --> 02:15:21,600
It is the mistake

2688
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:25,230
and we must
move on to another

2689
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,400
and better
industrial revolution

2690
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:30,075
and get it right
this time.

2691
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:32,710
When I think
of what could be

2692
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:37,510
I visualize an
organization of people

2693
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,990
committed to a purpose

2694
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:45,920
and the purpose
is doing no harm.

2695
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,405
I see accompany

2696
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:50,430
that has severed the
umbilical cord to earth

2697
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,205
for its raw materials

2698
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:56,080
taking raw materials that
have already been extracted

2699
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,790
and using them over
and over again

2700
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:01,350
driving that process
with renewable energy.

2701
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,030
It is our plan

2702
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:09,030
it remains our plan
to climb Mount Sustainability

2703
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,680
that mountain that is
higher than Everest

2704
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:13,830
infinitely higher
than Everest

2705
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,120
far more
difficult to scale.

2706
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:21,270
That point at the top
symbolizing zero footprint...

2707
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:33,240
So we’ve got
to undo a lot of things

2708
02:16:33,275 --> 02:16:34,400
in order to be smart enough

2709
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:38,400
to do this really dangerous
and risky and difficult work

2710
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,560
you know the best way
that we possibly can.

2711
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:44,040
And that means people coming
together and learning

2712
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:46,800
a whole lot of stuff that
we just don’t know

2713
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:48,365
that has been driven
out of the culture

2714
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:50,360
driven out of the society
driven out of our minds.

2715
02:16:50,395 --> 02:16:52,070
That tome is the
most exciting thing.

2716
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:53,165
That is happening

2717
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,760
it's happening all
over the world now.

2718
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:15,230
Sometimes it surprises me how
effective you can actually be.

2719
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,205
After we beat the Gap

2720
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:17,470
I walked past these
Gap stores

2721
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,560
and I looked at them
and I think

2722
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,900
my God there’s like 2000 of
these stores across the country.

2723
02:19:20,935 --> 02:19:22,805
Look at all that concrete
look at the glass

2724
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,760
look at all the staff people
look at all the clothing.

2725
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,085
Look at that power

2726
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,510
You can still reach
these companies.

2727
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,670
You can still
have an effect.

2728
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,720
We can change
the government.

2729
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,390
That’s the only way were
going tore design re think

2730
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:10,760
re-constitute what capital
and property can do

2731
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:14,910
Fifteen corporations would like
to control the conditions

2732
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:16,400
of our life

2733
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,830
and millions of people
are saying not only do

2734
02:20:18,865 --> 02:20:19,950
we not need you

2735
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:21,080
we can do it better.

2736
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:24,600
We are going to create systems
that nourish the earth

2737
02:20:24,635 --> 02:20:25,925
and nourish human beings.

2738
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,950
And these are not
marginal experiments

2739
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:31,430
they are the mainstay
of large numbers of

2740
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,760
communities across the world.

2741
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:35,040
That is where
the future lies.

2742
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,085
You know I've always thought
it's very ironic

2743
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,960
that I’m able to do all this
and yet what am I on?

2744
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:40,325
I’m on networks.

2745
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:41,760
I’m distributed by studios

2746
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,950
that are owned by large
corporate entities.

2747
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:48,320
Now why would they put me
out there when I am opposed

2748
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:50,880
to everything that
they stand for?

2749
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:54,200
And I spend my time
on their dime opposing

2750
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:56,560
what they believe in.

2751
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:57,640
Okay?

2752
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:59,525
Well it's because they
don’t believe in anything.

2753
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:01,920
They put me on there because
they know that there’s millions

2754
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:04,840
of people that want to see
my film or watch the TV show

2755
02:21:04,875 --> 02:21:06,990
and so they’re
going to make money.

2756
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:08,990
And I’ve been able to get
my stuff out there

2757
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,995
because I’m driving
my truck through

2758
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,830
this incredible
flaw in capitalism

2759
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,520
the greed flaw.

2760
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:17,520
The thing that says the rich
man will sell you the rope

2761
02:21:17,555 --> 02:21:18,280
to hand himself with

2762
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,430
if he think she can
make a buck off it

2763
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:21,480
well I’m the rope.

2764
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:22,470
I hope.

2765
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,400
I’m part of the rope.

2766
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,120
And they also believe that
when people watch my stuff

2767
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:29,230
or maybe watch this film
or whatever

2768
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:31,205
they think that
you know

2769
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:32,600
well you know
well you know what

2770
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:34,400
they’ll watch this and
they wont do anything

2771
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,350
because we’ve done such
a good job of numbing

2772
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:38,270
their minds and
dumbing them down

2773
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,845
you know they’ll
never affect...

2774
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:41,280
People aren’t going
to leave the church

2775
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:42,990
and go and do
something political.

2776
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,960
They’re convinced of that.

2777
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:46,800
I’m convinced
of the opposite.

2778
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:48,005
I’m convinced
that a few people

2779
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:50,000
are going to leave
this movie theatre

2780
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,880
or get up off the couch

2781
02:21:51,915 --> 02:21:53,320
and go and do something

2782
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:57,240
anything and get this
world back in our hands.
