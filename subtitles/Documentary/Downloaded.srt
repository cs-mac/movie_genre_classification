1
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,052
I released an early beta version.

2
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,188
During the summer
and it spread quickly.

3
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,555
By word of mouth.

4
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,160
Napster users
can download musical selections.

5
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,229
In - in mp3 format.

6
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,467
Mp3 is what's called a variable
loss compression algorithm.

7
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,468
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

8
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,175
Napster and
downloading distribution.

9
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,410
Is the biggest excitement.

10
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,312
Since disco,
rap and the Beatles.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,047
Its like new radio.

12
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,685
The majority of usage
of the mp3 format, um,

13
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,285
is for unauthorized.

14
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,621
Yeah, I would like a cd player,

15
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,190
but I can't spend $16 on a cd.

16
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,893
Napster is an evil, evil,
evil, evil place to go.

17
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,928
Standing by live in San mateo
with more details on this story.

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
This last fall semester wore on.

19
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,100
<i>Hundreds quickly
turned to millions.</i>

20
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,268
<i>With the program spreading.</i>

21
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,569
<i>Across college campuses
like wildfire.</i>

22
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,707
I have never seen the industry.

23
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,308
Under siege like this.

24
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,310
In the 30 years
I've been in this business.

25
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,379
It's very important
that the Internet.

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,982
Go the legitimate route
instead of becoming.

27
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,617
A haven for pirates.

28
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,898
You don't think
this is stealing?

29
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,287
Not at all.

30
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,456
'Cause you're just getting
a few songs.

31
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,924
That you find interesting.

32
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,626
The "n" word you know, appeared.

33
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,261
And we had to defend ourselves.

34
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,230
Whether we like it or not,

35
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,931
napster has changed everything.

36
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,700
And the record companies
are sadly behind the curve.

37
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,470
At it's peak,

38
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,072
nearly 60 million people
used the site.

39
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,708
To swap music files
from each other's computers.

40
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,743
For free.

41
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,845
The whole Internet
could be re-architected.

42
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,013
By napster-like technology.

43
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,849
Now sure
is the tip of the iceberg.

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,617
I think you're talking about
the proverbial finger.

45
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,652
In the dyke.

46
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,119
Fuck napster!

47
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,356
30 years ago,
the San Francisco symphony.

48
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,926
Released it's music on ips.

49
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,793
Then came cassettes.

50
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,230
And now of course, cds.

51
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,665
But in the very near future,

52
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,733
you may be able
to download their music.

53
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,335
From the Internet.

54
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,003
We met over the Internet
and we knew each other.

55
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,105
For like three or four years
or something.

56
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,507
Before we ever met in person.

57
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,808
Mm-hmm. We met the first time
as a result of napster.

58
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,677
Shawn flew down
from Boston to Virginia.

59
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,578
To meet with some investors.

60
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,078
That I set up
a meeting with.

61
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,647
The doorbell rang, I was
nervous for a brief second.

62
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,718
Kind of like going on a,
like a first date.

63
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,086
Uh, with someone
you're starting a company with.

64
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,323
And uh, and the door opened,
it was fanning.

65
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,390
He looked at me
and he said,

66
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,657
'you look exactly
like I thought you'd look'.

67
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,527
And I said, 'you look exactly.

68
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,460
Like I thought you'd look'.

69
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,262
And he said, 'okay great,

70
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,503
let's go over the presentation.

71
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,931
So we jumped into the power-point.

72
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,233
And went through all the slides,

73
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,468
and then got in
my parents' minivan.

74
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,503
And my dad drove us
to our first investor pitch.

75
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,308
I take issue
with people who say,

76
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,643
'ah, the moment I saw it,

77
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,078
I knew it was gonna be
fucking huge.

78
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,446
And take over the universe'.

79
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,114
They're all lying.
There's no possible way.

80
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,616
No one had that
conceptualization.

81
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,617
In the beginning.

82
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,898
I don't even believe
fanning did.

83
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,988
You're saying that people.

84
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,356
Are gonna download a client,

85
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,090
put a client on their computers.

86
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:23,128
And they're going to
allow stuff on their hard drive.

87
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,699
To be shared.

88
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,001
Most of the development
of the web,

89
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,102
up until napster,

90
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,170
was basically about.

91
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,405
Information storage
and information retrieval.

92
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,276
It wasn't about connecting
people to people.

93
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,710
We're gonna, like,
download stuff.

94
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,745
From each other?

95
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,747
Like, I was like,

96
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,283
nobody's gonna open up
their hard drive like that.

97
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,551
Nobody's gonna allow.

98
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,185
Their bandwidth to be used.

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,788
This sort of comes
onto my radar.

100
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,857
And it's really interesting.

101
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,859
No one is going to share an mp3.

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,560
That, that was my quote.

103
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,927
No one's gonna share an mp3.

104
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,531
And...
Boy was I wrong.

105
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,633
I was so wrong.

106
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,841
<i>Our system has been bilked,</i>

107
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,978
<i>this time sharing system
for, for about.</i>

108
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,048
<i>Six months now. Its been
working and in that time,</i>

109
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,683
<i>we've gone from
getting one console.</i>

110
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,217
<i>To getting about
six working now.</i>

111
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,819
<i>With six more due
the rest of spring.</i>

112
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,155
<i>What is Internet anyway?</i>

113
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,291
<i>Internet is uh,</i>

114
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,060
<i>that massive computer network.</i>

115
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,461
<i>The one that's becoming
really big now.</i>

116
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,198
<i>It's a
giant computer network.</i>

117
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,567
<i>Made up, made up of uh,
started it from...</i>

118
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,735
Oh I thought
you were gonna tell us.

119
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,869
What this was?

120
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,171
It's like a computer billboard.

121
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,605
<i>It's not, it's not a,</i>

122
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,773
<i>it's, it's
a computer billboard,</i>

123
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,176
<i>but it's nation-wide
and it's it's several uh,</i>

124
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,111
<i>universities and everything
all joined together...</i>

125
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,612
And others can access it?

126
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,047
<i>And it's
getting bigger and bigger.</i>

127
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,015
All the time.

128
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,683
I wrote a piece back in 1990,

129
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,053
that, that it would
shortly be the case that, that.

130
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,788
Everybody under 20,

131
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,591
at that point, would become
native to a place.

132
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,526
Where everybody over 20
at that point,

133
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,687
would always be an immigrant.

134
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,964
So I was a young teenager
and I ran,

135
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,700
I was running a uh,
running a bbs,

136
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,605
which was um, somewhat
sophomorically titled,

137
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,272
'realm of darkness'.

138
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,543
But online in the bbs era, meant.

139
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,312
Connected to potentially one,

140
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,113
maybe a hundred other people.

141
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,547
Maximum.

142
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,751
And that, that's what was
so profoundly different.

143
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,320
About the explosion
of the Internet.

144
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,787
Was that it was one network.

145
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,190
So suddenly,
you could be connected.

146
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,457
To everyone.

147
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,595
There are now,
a very large number of people.

148
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,629
That are online,
that are young.

149
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,434
And you know, they have
a completely different sense.

150
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,835
Of how the world works.

151
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,337
And what power is and what,

152
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,938
what authority ought to be.

153
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,340
I mean it's a profound shift.

154
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,842
It's the difference between
vertical authority, you know,

155
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,613
God-given physically
enforceable authority.

156
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,882
And horizontal authority.

157
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,617
I've joked in the past,
and fanning and I would be like,

158
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,818
where did you guys meet?

159
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,653
And we were,
we were part of the, you know,

160
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,756
fanning and I were part
of the same underground network.

161
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,490
Of elite cyber criminals.

162
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,128
And it, it's basically true.

163
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,530
We met through irc,

164
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,698
um, as we both got drawn
into irc,

165
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,267
we became more and more
addicted to it.

166
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,768
And more and more
fascinated by it.

167
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,937
Which made us fight much harder.

168
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,640
To retain access to it and then,

169
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,175
you know, over time,

170
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,075
it became our lives.
It took over our lives.

171
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,015
You're talking about
revolutionizing.

172
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,783
The way we use computers.

173
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,051
And how we use the Internet.

174
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,856
Oh absolutely. Absolute...
I mean it, this is, this is the,

175
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,257
what's most interesting
about it,

176
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,592
is you're interacting
with peers.

177
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,594
You're exchanging information
with you know,

178
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,728
the person down the street.

179
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,896
And we're just beginning?

180
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,031
Oh, absolutely.

181
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,365
Sean fanning's one of
the smartest people

182
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,599
I've ever met.

183
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,902
He was teaching himself
how to program.

184
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,510
And he saw this really simple
way to find music.

185
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,214
That he could listen to
on the Internet.

186
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,349
Here was a guy with no clout,
no connections,

187
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,420
19 years old and he really changed
the way we think about the Internet.

188
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,056
It's hard to explain
where things were at back then.

189
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,691
I mean I was 18,
I didn't really,

190
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,392
I hadn't really seen
much of the world.

191
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,427
You know, I didn't really...

192
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,698
Um, I think it was,
I mean the best way to say it.

193
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,599
Is it kind of came from
a very pure place.

194
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,203
I was excited
'cause he was my first.

195
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,438
So I thought, you know,

196
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,707
I really did think
he was gonna conquer the world.

197
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,388
Everybody does
with their first kid, right?

198
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,112
I was born in brockton and uh...

199
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,881
Didn't have
the most stable family.

200
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,716
Uh, you know,
they made their best effort,

201
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,518
but I grew up with a step-dad.

202
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,952
And we ended up
in foster care a couple times.

203
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,422
Brockton was just a, uh,
brockton was just no good.

204
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,960
But uh, huh, yeah.

205
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,895
I mean, I don't want to,

206
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,030
I don't want to
talk to much about like.

207
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,365
Money situation,
but like you know,

208
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,266
we, we grew up.

209
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,600
Like, not too well off you know.

210
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,536
And my mom and dad,
there's five kids.

211
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,404
And my dad was
a delivery driver, you know.

212
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,966
And they did the best
they could, but...

213
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,808
That's when, he got into sports
when we moved down to the cape.

214
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,111
Being into sports,
I think it got his mind.

215
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,948
Um, so that life
was a little easier for him.

216
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,618
I think music helped him too,
like sports.

217
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,053
Every time he was
on the computer,

218
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,154
he had the radio there.

219
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,790
See what I mean, like he was
always listening to music.

220
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,894
So uh, there's really no
surprise there.

221
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,130
That he-he-he ended up,

222
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,798
in, you know,
thinking of something.

223
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,333
That made sense to him.

224
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,135
As far as um,

225
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,835
the music and
the computer combined.

226
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,638
I was fortunate to have an Uncle.

227
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,073
Who was into technology.

228
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,407
And gave me my first computer.

229
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,776
There's a,
there's a lot of insecurity.

230
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:37,809
That comes around being.

231
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,179
Uh, dependent on others.

232
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,349
You know, to get by
and so as a kid,

233
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,151
it sort of influenced.

234
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,852
My social uh,
confidence at school.

235
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,421
We moved around a lot.

236
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,058
Um, there was also kind of a,

237
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,460
I didn't feel as connected
to my family, intellectually.

238
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,395
And so, um, I didn't really have.

239
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,864
Many others at school either
on that front.

240
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,802
So I was sort of,
feeling a little bit uh, lost.

241
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,302
And displaced at times.

242
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,705
Going online and finding people.

243
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,074
Who had the same interests.

244
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,543
Or I could learn from
and where there was no,

245
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,478
your reputation
was your own.

246
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,580
It was not about like,
you know the,

247
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,514
how well off
your family was,

248
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,415
or how well
you dressed.

249
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,185
Um, or how well you spoke
or body language.

250
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,720
It was about the merit
of what you were saying.

251
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,287
And I think that...

252
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,422
For me, was just intoxicating.

253
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,663
In the early days of the web,
you know.

254
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,264
The first time I ever saw music.

255
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,233
That was down-loadable.

256
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,669
Was a song that I put up
on my homepage.

257
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,970
On campus Internet.
It was an mp2 file.

258
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,507
I guess that would
have been '93,

259
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,641
around that time.

260
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,877
And there were very few
people out there.

261
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,747
Because you're changing
it into another file format.

262
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,314
Or have a special card
to play it.

263
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,450
For anyone who had been
downloading stuff.

264
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,286
It was such
a colossal pain in the ass.

265
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,354
It's not funny.

266
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,722
Uh, even for technical people,

267
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,691
it was uh, a process.

268
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,825
And, and a constant,

269
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,927
like trying to get
bits and pieces of files.

270
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,262
And reconnect them all together.

271
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,963
And that was kind of
a pain in the ass.

272
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,202
You know, 1998,
was when it really felt like.

273
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,437
Okay, this is real.

274
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,471
This is the way I'm going
to listen to music.

275
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,975
It became clear
that the computer.

276
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:16,942
Was going to be the place.

277
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,476
That we would store our music.

278
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,782
Then you started looking
for tools to get the music.

279
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,817
Into the computer,
tools to play it back,

280
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,052
tools to manage it.

281
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,089
I remember the first mp3
I ever downloaded.

282
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,993
I remember the first time
I ever, you know...

283
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,562
Basically, ever played
a track from the Internet.

284
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,430
And I remember just thinking,

285
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,998
even though
it's just information.

286
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,234
It's just audio, there's such
a crazy amount of emotion.

287
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,369
The fact that you could.

288
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,004
Kind of share emotion
over the Internet,

289
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,339
was so, it was really wild
to think that...

290
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,508
Something so important to you,

291
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,644
you could just trade so freely.

292
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,446
So I think it was um...

293
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,114
You know, it's,
it's hard to quantify.

294
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,414
How important it was.

295
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,785
I was a freshman.

296
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,553
At northeastern university
in Boston.

297
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,988
One of my roommates
was into mp3s.

298
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,025
Yeah, he would skip class
and sit home.

299
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,360
And download music
and he was always complaining.

300
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,662
About how unreliable
the technology was.

301
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,398
Where was his,
what were his favorite bands?

302
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,967
I don't know. He listened to
a lot of really weird stuff.

303
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,702
I had very incompatible
tastes with him.

304
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,104
But, um...

305
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,438
Like every roommate in college.

306
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,107
Yeah, which, it, that's why
it was a struggle.

307
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,208
I didn't want to make it
any easier.

308
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,708
For him to find that music.

309
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,812
But no and he, you know,
he was complaining a lot.

310
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,947
And that sort of signaled
me that.

311
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,282
There was a potential uh,
there's a problem.

312
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,151
That could be solved
and I just looked into it.

313
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,220
And um, came up
with the solution,

314
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,221
which ultimately.

315
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,322
Became napster.

316
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,624
It felt like, you know,
this way of sharing media.

317
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,859
Between people.

318
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,221
Could be used
for sharing anything.

319
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,661
We started with music,
but it made sense.

320
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,130
That it could work
for anything else.

321
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,430
It also felt like...

322
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,566
This whole model for
sharing media.

323
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,135
Was superior to like,

324
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,535
going and buying an album.

325
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,141
Being able to uh, both... um...

326
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,509
Buy tracks as singles.

327
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,477
Or share them with your friends.

328
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,578
And find stuff
your friends like,

329
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,314
uh, and then being able to uh,
you know...

330
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,985
Basically, to have access
to the entire universe.

331
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,252
Of recorded music.

332
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,221
Where independent creators.

333
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,656
Could publish directly.

334
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,825
It just seemed from every,
in every way,

335
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,793
it seemed like a better system.

336
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,331
So, I would spend
a weekend working on it.

337
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,667
You know, every time
I had to go back to school,

338
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,102
I'd kind of drag myself back.

339
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,370
Two days would become
three days.

340
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,571
I'd miss a day of classes,

341
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,905
I'd miss two days of classes.

342
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,641
It was just becoming
more and more difficult.

343
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,576
For me to get myself
back to school.

344
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,843
With any enthusiasm.

345
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,315
My cousin was actually
driving me back to school.

346
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,217
And when I got there,
I thought about it.

347
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,285
And finally realized.

348
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,452
Just what a sense
of relief I had.

349
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,687
When I thought about the idea of
just, just leaving.

350
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,058
And that was the last time
I really ever came close.

351
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,426
To the campus.
Didn't pick up any of my stuff.

352
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,628
Didn't tell my, my roommates.

353
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,931
Just, just went back
and I remember just feeling.

354
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,132
So excited.

355
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,034
He came in and he was just like,

356
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,035
I need to talk to you guys,
it's really important.

357
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,038
And I go, okay,
Shawn and so he came in.

358
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,339
And uh, he says, uh...

359
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,174
You're not going to be
happy about this.

360
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,877
And he was looking at me
and I'm like what?

361
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,445
And he was like, '
I'm gonna drop out of school'.

362
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,979
And I said, 'oh no!'

363
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,480
why would you do that?

364
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,283
And he's, you don't understand.

365
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,553
I have this idea,
I have to go with it now.

366
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,622
I have to do it now.
It's now or never.

367
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,957
I feel like this is
the time for me to do it.

368
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,759
And I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

369
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,602
I actually spent time working.

370
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:33,405
In hole, Massachusetts,
which is about 45 minutes

371
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,773
South of Boston.

372
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,476
Um, just, this
converted restaurant.

373
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,677
Like three desks in the place.

374
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,846
I just sat there
and worked on it.

375
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,180
Ummm...

376
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,283
For a few months
until it was actually.

377
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,684
Building a user base.

378
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,152
I remember I got to go up
and hang out with him.

379
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,088
And he'd be like pizza
was everywhere, and...

380
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,123
He was just jamming out
to led zeppelin.

381
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,992
He'd like sleep at the office,
on the floor.

382
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,927
He'd like, he never
left his computer, you know.

383
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,895
Its not hyperbole,
it was an actual closet.

384
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,831
I think he might have some pride.

385
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,166
Or just want something more,
but for me,

386
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,035
it was, I was having so much fun
building it,

387
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,235
I just didn't care.

388
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,671
You know, I get occasionally.

389
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,306
A little bit uncomfortable
when people would show up.

390
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,141
And you'd be crawling out of,
you know,

391
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:09,909
your sleeping bag.

392
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,144
So fanning had written
his version one.

393
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,679
And being not
professionally trained,

394
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,214
uh, not trained at all...

395
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,851
Uh, and just, just having
his ideas and ah,

396
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,886
here's a computer
and this wonder for learning.

397
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,221
And for for absorbing, uh,

398
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,989
we'll just go and try
and make it work.

399
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,559
And it didn't work. Like every,
everyone's first hello world program.

400
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,762
His was file sharing stuff.

401
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,729
Didn't work,
so listen to the group for help.

402
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,831
And I was there.

403
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,834
At the start was
pretty much myself.

404
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,070
And a lot of people online
that were helping out.

405
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,371
Just to make it work.

406
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,307
Helping fix problems,
stuff like that.

407
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,641
He sort of asked, hey, how,

408
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,843
this thing keeps crashing.
What do you think?

409
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,112
But unlike anyone else,

410
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,148
he wouldn't let us
see the source code.

411
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,082
I was like, oh really?

412
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,951
Well that sounds
like it's probably.

413
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,420
A... a buffer overrun or an
unchecked battery condition.

414
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,587
Or something like that.

415
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,589
And show, show us the code
and we'll fix it for you.

416
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,190
And he was like, no.

417
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,227
Okay. This was kind of cool
because.

418
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,395
It came out as a challenge.

419
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,763
It's like,
I'm not going to tell you,

420
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,432
but I'm going to keep soliciting
for help.

421
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,366
So, we're all hackers.
This is what we do.

422
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,202
We, you know,

423
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,037
establish commercial vendor x.

424
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,206
Does not want to share
anything with us.

425
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,841
Yet, we are going
to find a way in.

426
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,876
Just the idea that
we were gonna build.

427
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,412
The first decentralized
file system.

428
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,982
I think the patent, actually,
the napster patent.

429
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,249
Uses this terminology.

430
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,551
You talk about a
distributed file system.

431
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,153
Since 1998.

432
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,955
We've been discussing it
with various different people.

433
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,057
In our community
and we've been told.

434
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,160
By a lot of, you know,
pretty experienced.

435
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,161
Technical minds.

436
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,597
That the technical challenge
associated.

437
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,333
With a decentralized file system.

438
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,034
Was actually too difficult.

439
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,237
It was believed
that this wouldn't scale.

440
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,149
He would load up this app
and it would basically.

441
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,817
Connect to one of our servers.

442
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,287
And ask for a napster server.

443
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,123
That would be accessible.

444
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,624
In like the lowest
possible load.

445
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,427
Allowing you to search the uh...

446
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,864
File names to find,
you know, what, whatever.

447
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,969
You know, noncommercial
uh, legal, legal music...

448
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,605
Uh, was available.

449
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,807
But you would basically
have a, a chance.

450
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,976
To kind of search all,
some of all those files.

451
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,711
That were out there, that once
you've decided you wanted one,

452
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,680
it would actually, um,
facilitate the connection,

453
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,550
would happen directly to that,
'that um, that source.

454
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,187
It's funny that a lot of the
file sharing technologies.

455
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,889
Are stressed when people
talk about napster.

456
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,525
But as I said, I mean
Sean and I met through irc,

457
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,626
which is like a chat community,
you know,

458
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,862
a chat based community.
And that's a huge part.

459
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,164
Of like why
we created it as well.

460
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,198
You know,
just wanted to create a way.

461
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,833
To meet people through music.

462
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,835
Sometimes that's overlooked
and yeah,

463
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,336
I think that you know,
what we're providing.

464
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,638
Is just a way
for people to share.

465
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,506
Their personal material
and meet people.

466
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,074
With similar interests
and communicate with them.

467
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,043
That's exactly how people
discover music.

468
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,278
In the first place. You know,

469
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,646
you find out about music
from your friends.

470
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,548
Who maybe listen.

471
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,816
To something similar
to what you listen to.

472
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,717
And they turn you on to
something completely new.

473
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,919
You go out and buy the cd.

474
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,054
That's how people
experience music.

475
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,621
And that's a big part
of the experience.

476
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,158
But this was the first time
I know of,

477
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,593
in mainstream history,

478
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,528
where people had a social life
online.

479
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,597
And then after napster went down
a few years later,

480
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,931
started hearing
about friendster.

481
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,569
MySpace and then of course,
Facebook and all that.

482
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,003
But, but um, everyone
just thinks of it.

483
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,706
As being the file sharing
technology,

484
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,374
but I really think
that it was the seed.

485
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,476
Of that stuff too.

486
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,311
We were basically, you know,

487
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,245
trying to create a platform.

488
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,814
That would allow music
to be shared.

489
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,748
More widely uh,

490
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,850
on a larger scale
than ever before.

491
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,451
That would um...

492
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,188
That would galvanize
enormous excitement.

493
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,958
Would, it would re-energize,

494
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,260
re-energize the conversation
about music.

495
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,462
And, and ultimately
that would lead.

496
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,730
To a golden age of music.

497
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,132
We knew it was a long way off.

498
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,167
From all the music
being available digitally.

499
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,705
I mean you opened up napster
and there it was.

500
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,273
Its difficult to
describe to people.

501
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,975
Who weren't experiencing
at that time,

502
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,545
how much material
was suddenly available.

503
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,946
I mean there has
never been a time.

504
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,749
Before or since that you could,
you could get.

505
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,251
As many different things online.

506
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,952
And experiences,
many different kinds of music.

507
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,922
And of course,
what people forget is,

508
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,057
what was interesting was not
that they could get.

509
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,826
The latest Madonna album
for free.

510
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,995
It's that they could get
all different versions.

511
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,430
Of recordings of
particular music.

512
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,833
From all the way back
to the beginning of recording.

513
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,469
Available in
this library-like forum.

514
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,070
The vast majority of which,

515
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,940
was not accessible
commercially at all.

516
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,109
And you know,
I just felt like this was,

517
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,610
this was one of the
great moments.

518
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,444
In human history.

519
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,179
And I still do.

520
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,082
But of course, uh, great moments
in human history.

521
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,286
Usually have uh...

522
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,755
An opposition.

523
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,191
And it is exactly
uh, proportional.

524
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,891
To their greatness.

525
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,464
So it was in LA,
it was the four seasons hotel.

526
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,699
It was all of the
top label heads.

527
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,636
And a lot of them knew
that we'd filed a lawsuit.

528
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,838
Against this kind of
rogue website,

529
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,807
but not too many of them
were paying attention.

530
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:09,875
To what it was.

531
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,110
So I set up a computer
and I said,

532
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,646
'okay, you know,
Tommy what's your, you know,

533
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,381
give me your latest single,
or Michelle,

534
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,216
what's your latest single,
you know.

535
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,652
Richard, give me
your latest single.

536
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,022
Literally, it, we played
like stump the napster.

537
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,991
And it was,

538
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,159
it was quite a sight.

539
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,060
All the heads
of all these record labels.

540
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,128
Freaking out.

541
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,297
That a lot of pre-releases even,

542
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,832
were, were on there.

543
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,967
Um, I would say,

544
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,034
that was a pretty big
aha moment.

545
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,738
We saw the clicks of the numbers.

546
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,039
And that's what they
were downloading.

547
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,306
At that particular time.

548
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,875
That was shocking.

549
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,779
Not that it wasn't
happening before,

550
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,648
and not that we were naive.

551
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,315
But we actually saw it.

552
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,652
And that was startling.

553
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,573
For all of us that were
at that meeting that day.

554
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,022
If some day soon
you can store.

555
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,056
Your whole music collection.

556
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,125
On your hard drive,
instead of your shelves,

557
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,493
what's going to happen
to record stores?

558
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,864
<i>I thought that the way
that people got music.</i>

559
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,632
<i>For the last 50 years worked.</i>

560
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,469
<i>You went to the record shop,
you bought a record,</i>

561
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,204
<i>you took it home
and you played it.</i>

562
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,471
You loved it.

563
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,107
You went and seen the guys live,

564
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,469
everybody lived
happily ever after.

565
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,477
There are no record stores
anymore.

566
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,145
Or hardly any, you know.

567
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,281
Amoeba on the west coast.

568
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,815
And there's a few,
a few in england.

569
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,150
But it's gone.

570
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,320
I mean I, I never thought
I'd live to see that.

571
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,692
Great stores like tower music
are gone.

572
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,563
This business seems
like it survives.

573
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,767
On a lot of older albums
and reselling of that,

574
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,102
so, this one, we definitely saw.

575
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,738
New cds and new albums not
being bought as much,

576
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,274
but the bigger stores,
it totally destroyed them.

577
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,978
'Cause no one wanted to go
to the store anymore.

578
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,513
They can just get it
on their computer.

579
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,081
Or punch in whatever
thing they want.

580
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,582
I mean even iTunes now.

581
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,583
Is destroying
the music industry.

582
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,953
'Cause of that, people can buy
the song they want.

583
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,089
And listen to it for one time
and that's it.

584
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,795
<i>It is now the number one record
in America...</i>

585
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,769
The fifties
was a singles business.

586
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,440
The sixties, mid-sixties
is when the albums really.

587
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,207
Started to be important.

588
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,842
And before that...

589
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,847
A, a hit single, to an artist
was free promotion.

590
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,050
They did, it wasn't, it wasn't.

591
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:32,918
A source of revenue.

592
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,153
The source of revenue
came from the fact that.

593
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,488
If they had a hit, the could get.

594
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,255
A couple of thousand dollars
a night, more.

595
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,960
Good morning, this is Ron Lundy,

596
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,528
how you doing
on a Friday morning.

597
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,563
In the greatest city
in the world.

598
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,467
Little manischewitz.

599
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,169
From my perspective, uh,

600
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,173
I believe that the point
of labels is to,

601
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,141
in a sense,

602
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,775
act as a filter.

603
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,848
In that regard, if Blue note
had signed an artist,

604
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,016
you would feel,
well that was an artist.

605
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,785
Worth listening to.

606
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,053
Because it was on Blue note.

607
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,620
And they made great records.

608
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,460
All these major labels,

609
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,331
the ones that existed
and the ones that still exist,

610
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,899
were started as
phonograph companies.

611
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,635
Rca Victor was.

612
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,838
The Victor talking machine
company.

613
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,674
Emi was the gramophone company.

614
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,077
Columbia was
the Columbia phonograph company.

615
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,780
And then when rock-n-roll
and ips.

616
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:38,417
Spurred the sales of vinyl,
they figured.

617
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,886
They didn't need
to make furniture anymore.

618
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,555
Which was what they referred
to it as.

619
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,223
Technology's been
very beneficial.

620
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,224
To the record companies.

621
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,626
Before.

622
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:51,296
78s, when 78s
became 33 and a thirds,

623
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,330
you could sell
all your music again.

624
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,066
When they became cds,

625
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,002
you could sell all
your music again.

626
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,637
When the cd was first initiated,

627
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,771
it was a true boom
at that particular point.

628
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,475
The eighties were
a very, very fertile period.

629
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,277
For giant music sales.

630
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,414
Not as much as when
we got to the nineties,

631
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,982
which it was commonplace.

632
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,717
To sell 10 or
15 or 20 million albums.

633
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,756
You know, the record companies,
in the '80s.

634
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:21,125
Had sort of uh, eliminated
their technology departments.

635
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,596
Their engineers,
and pretty much seeded it.

636
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,996
To the electronics industry.

637
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,435
All of a sudden, technology.

638
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,604
And how music was
gonna be recorded.

639
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,804
Went somewhere else.

640
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,442
It was sorta,
kinda the beginning.

641
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,078
Of the corporatization
more of America.

642
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,248
A&m was getting acquired,
island was getting acquired.

643
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,017
A lot of the great labels.

644
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,754
That were independently owned
were falling away.

645
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,624
And getting put
into the landscape.

646
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,325
Of the corporations.

647
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,362
Once you had cds came out,

648
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,331
where then in a digital world.

649
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,700
Where the copy is as good
as the master.

650
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,468
And it's amazing.

651
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,036
That they didn't recognize.

652
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,204
That there was going to be
a huge change.

653
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,274
I think it came back
and hit them with a,

654
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,509
with a wallop, you know.

655
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,843
Um, with the Internet.

656
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,115
The mp3, digital music
for the quick download.

657
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,484
Is probably the
most substantive change.

658
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:23,355
In music since maybe
the advent of digitalized music.

659
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,325
Or the compact disc,
or maybe even the ip.

660
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,226
It has changed everything.

661
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,996
Music is nothing but.

662
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,664
Algorithmic processes right now.

663
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,132
Every time you encode it,

664
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,233
you put it through an algorithm,

665
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,801
you put an envelope around it,

666
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,470
you zip it up, and that's it.

667
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,905
This is the first time
technology.

668
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,807
Actually attacked
the existing system.

669
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,575
And started to take it away.

670
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,745
The music industry
was fairly constrained.

671
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,047
For you know, 75 to, you know,

672
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,348
maybe even 100 years
in terms of like,

673
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,817
how music was
found, sourced, developed,

674
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,487
created, distributed,
marketed, promoted.

675
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,156
Uh, and it was a fairly
locked you know,

676
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,927
paradigm and uh,
napster created an Avenue.

677
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:04,229
For consumers to step
out of that.

678
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,731
Which was superior
in almost every way.

679
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,500
Um, you know, it offered,
you know,

680
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,068
greater convenience, obviously.

681
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,371
A much improved price,
choice, you know.

682
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,074
All of these things really
conspired to you know uh,

683
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,143
produce an amazing
consumer experience.

684
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,185
<i>Welcome to valley
of the dollars.</i>

685
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,489
The valley and
the entire bay area, in fact,

686
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,425
are at the center
of a revolution...

687
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,327
This was the you know, uh,
height of the bubble.

688
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,463
Uh, in the valley, you know,

689
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,666
uh, in, in the bay area
and in San Francisco,

690
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,536
um, there was a euphoric amount
of optimism.

691
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,243
Anywhere that you went,
um, people were happy.

692
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,311
Because everybody thought.

693
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,347
That they were
gonna be filthy rich.

694
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,948
Whether they were
involved in a startup.

695
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,485
Or not, um, it, there was,
it was a magical time.

696
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,920
You thought
you would be filthy rich.

697
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,222
I actually never did.

698
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,523
Oh come on.

699
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,525
Uh, I actually never did,
but anyway...

700
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,686
Okay, sorry. It's your story.

701
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,529
So basically, you, you know...

702
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,665
You would, you would uh,

703
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,634
that really wrecked everything.

704
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,835
Sorry.

705
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:17,702
You can start over.

706
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:18,736
Yeah, let me start over.

707
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,771
So uh...

708
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:23,341
Did you pass around fliers
at, on campus, or...?

709
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,976
No, it was completely
word of mouth, it was...

710
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,978
I think we spread it initially
through irc,

711
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,213
which is Internet relay chat.

712
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,648
Its basically
a network of people.

713
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,949
Who just sort of congregate.

714
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,050
Around different ideas and.

715
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,518
We started
a little napster community.

716
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,786
And they just
sort of spread the idea.

717
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,887
It started spreading
through you know,

718
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,188
college, you know,
universities and,

719
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,991
the first point at which
it started to really take.

720
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,861
Was, there was
a, an article published.

721
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,729
It was one of these
Internet news sites,

722
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,829
it might have been zd net.

723
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,666
And you know they touched.

724
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,701
On the legal issues,
but we weren't sued at the time,

725
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,136
we were still
working in Massachusetts.

726
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,772
And uh,
that spurred a huge response.

727
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,939
Of downloads.

728
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,242
Before that, it was, getting
a good response.

729
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,443
And it was spreading somewhat,

730
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,712
but um, that kind of
kicked off the whole.

731
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,945
You know, period of insanity.

732
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,315
With the,
the business side of it,

733
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,183
we eventually took money.

734
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,418
From John fanning's friend,
yosiamo.

735
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,220
Sean Parker and I moved out
to northern California.

736
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,691
You know, we uh,
hired some people.

737
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:13,824
And it became a company.

738
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,860
At the beginning,

739
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,662
it was just like
Parker and Shawn.

740
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,497
And he surrounded himself.

741
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,498
With a bunch of friends
from cape.

742
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,400
And they were
all good at computers.

743
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,902
And they're just all you know,
it was just like.

744
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,437
Basically having
a bunch of teenagers.

745
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:26,371
In one place.

746
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,338
It was pretty cool.

747
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,575
The first time that I typed
a search term into napster.

748
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,743
And saw the results came back,

749
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,578
I think it was
the rolling stones.

750
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,581
Uh, and I kind of pushed back
from the desk.

751
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:40,018
And I was just like, whoa,
like what just happened?

752
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,854
Back in '99, over dial up,

753
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,589
shitty browsers,

754
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,859
web pages taking
seconds to load,

755
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,861
here was
a fucking fast ap.

756
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,965
That's what took me
from typing to submit,

757
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:54,766
to phhht!

758
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,900
What happened after that?

759
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,769
Web pages were not doing
that at that time.

760
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,407
And you talk about
my attraction to it and,

761
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,709
and moving from Chicago
to the bay area,

762
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,211
kind of on a dime
because you know,

763
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,612
of what I saw in the technology,

764
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,247
I think you could probably,
to a man,

765
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,116
go through the early people
that were there.

766
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,118
And they were drawn to it,

767
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,619
almost like a tractor being...

768
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,722
Because it was
this emotionally true thing.

769
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,657
So distracted, you had to leave.

770
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,292
Right, whatever you
were doing right there,

771
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,162
you just left. I mean a
lot of early employees were,

772
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,164
it's like, you did, undid
what and what and what?

773
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,085
And changed all these things,
in your life and...

774
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,468
We lived together in San mateo
in a small apartment at first.

775
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,637
Like I said, he was bringing.

776
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,140
When they first got out there,
they didn't have like.

777
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:37,008
Apartment stuff, so
it was just kind of like.

778
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,243
An Irish flop house,
you know.

779
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,612
Like a bunch of people
sleeping on, you know,

780
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,280
blow up mattresses
and things like that.

781
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,680
And you know.

782
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,683
Fanning and Parker
were both trying.

783
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,752
To explain to me
what napster was.

784
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,587
I never used it,
never downloaded.

785
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,688
And at the time,

786
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:51,656
there were about

787
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,424
30 to 40 thousand
registered users,

788
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,591
so it wasn't that big.

789
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,295
After asking
a million questions,

790
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,263
and, and hearing
from both of them...

791
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,698
Music will be ubiquitous.

792
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,001
You know, you'll be able
to get it on your cell phone,

793
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:03,935
you'll be able to get
it on your stereo,

794
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,136
you'll be able to get it on.

795
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,603
Whatever the device
of the future is.

796
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,340
And you'll be able to,

797
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,442
I think people are willing
to pay for convenience.

798
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,510
I had the 'aha' moment.

799
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,581
And I knew
at that moment, that...

800
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,921
It was gonna be.
It was gonna be huge.

801
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,555
There was no doubt in my mind.

802
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,024
And it was a matter of...

803
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,028
Could we...

804
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,596
And-and-and then I started.

805
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,897
To change the language
I was using.

806
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,799
Could we, keep the servers up?

807
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,867
Could, could we
make this thing scale?

808
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,638
The area where we were
in desperate need of help,

809
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:41,973
which was making
the servers scale,

810
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,309
to support all the people
who wanted to use it.

811
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,244
Was his weak spot
as well,

812
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,145
so he and Jordan worked
pretty closely together.

813
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,282
What I remember most
about that time.

814
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,650
Is sleeping under our desks.

815
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,886
The loud music.

816
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:01,426
It was all about making small,
incremental wins.

817
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,194
With the code and
with the technology.

818
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,629
It was...

819
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,297
It was a rocky few months.

820
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,132
But every time
we had a little win,

821
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,499
it was a big party.

822
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,537
The night Ali and I figured out.

823
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,939
Some seriously awesome stuff,

824
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,709
uh, one of the capacity
limits we had.

825
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,977
Was the ability to index.

826
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:21,278
More than a million files
per server.

827
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,314
So four to eight thousand users.

828
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,315
Could go on the server,

829
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,484
uh, before the operating system,

830
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,518
which was linux, at the time,

831
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,386
would drop to it's knees.

832
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,723
It was an amazing night
because we got it working.

833
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,659
It was probably on the tail end.

834
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,761
Of one of our
two to three day stints.

835
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:40,131
Our, our binges,
and maybe, it was,

836
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,165
it must have been
after midnight.

837
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,602
And Ali and I
were just thrilled.

838
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,772
We put on shades,
he put on his hat backwards.

839
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,707
And, and I was,
I got up on the table.

840
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,210
And I'm like ooh-ooh-ooh
and he was like.

841
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,379
This is this amazing
celebratory moment.

842
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,713
And there was one picture
in particular,

843
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:58,649
where we labeled it
one million files!

844
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,353
Yeah, we had those kinds
of moments all the time.

845
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,192
By, I would say,
by December of '99,

846
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:11,129
we, we kind of nailed it.

847
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,065
By then there was a bunch of
really technical stuff.

848
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:18,336
That we did, that caused it to
be able to scale.

849
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,972
And it was just a matter
of adding as many machines.

850
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,607
As we could at that point.

851
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,943
Just in terms of
the amount of awareness.

852
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,312
And exposure that the work.

853
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:31,282
We were associated with um,
gained was meteoric.

854
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,984
So in like a
four or five month span,

855
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,320
it went from
30,000 registered users.

856
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,521
To over 20 million.

857
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,056
Total users count now,

858
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,977
I think we just recently
passed 20 million users.

859
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,459
Aol has 23 million.

860
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,264
Even as it really blew up,
I know on the,

861
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,265
on the engineering side.

862
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,033
We're watching
these numbers go up,

863
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,802
the simultaneous users
go up and up and up.

864
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,337
And then there's more and more
press coverage.

865
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,639
But it's still a small company.

866
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,476
In a bank building and uh,
I think some people.

867
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,211
Had a better
understanding of kind of,

868
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,146
the significance of what
was going on than others,

869
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,548
but day to day it was very hard
to comprehend.

870
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,352
It was one of the first times
in history.

871
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:11,922
Where you had this sort of
pure youth revolution.

872
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,761
Young, inexperienced, relatively
unsophisticated, but smart kids.

873
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:21,365
Could create something
entirely out of nowhere.

874
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,069
And revolutionize
an industry that they frankly,

875
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,203
knew nothing about.

876
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,205
And had
no relationships in.

877
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,174
And this all happened,
this you know,

878
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,177
I, I think probably
six months passed,

879
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,246
uh, before we ever.

880
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,181
Had a conversation.

881
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,216
With anyone.

882
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,351
In the, from the music industry.

883
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,053
And it wasn't, it wasn't
because we didn't want.

884
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,354
To have a conversation
with anyone.

885
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,523
In the music industry,
we just didn't know anyone.

886
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,325
In the music industry.

887
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:50,161
That there are so many wins
with digital distribution.

888
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,829
That ultimately, you know,
once we have.

889
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,398
The opportunity
to work with artists.

890
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,665
And work with the labels.

891
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,401
To discuss, you know,
what models are viable.

892
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,735
And what are not,
we can come to a conclusion.

893
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,236
And find a good model
that works.

894
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,639
There was this,
this moment in time.

895
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,508
When you had someone
like Shawn fanning.

896
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,879
Who had the idea,
um, was smart enough.

897
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,782
To build it, but didn't know
enough about the industry.

898
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,317
To know that it was
just an impossibility.

899
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,485
Right, just not something
that was ever gonna fly.

900
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,823
Um, but then at a time
when you could get.

901
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,526
Tens of millions of dollars
in venture capital,

902
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,694
to back something
which is clearly.

903
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,996
Copyright infringement.

904
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,031
Right? That was
the amazing thing.

905
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,067
You know, I remember
being in irc with Shawn.

906
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,536
Once upon a time and
him telling me, you know,

907
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,371
we're raising
70 million dollars.

908
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,572
And my response to him,

909
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,606
I couldn't type it fast enough,

910
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,741
was don't take the money.

911
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,544
You don't have a business.

912
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,879
You know, this is,
you cannot build a business.

913
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,146
On copyright infringement.

914
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,615
Napster was operating
in a legal gray area.

915
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,520
And this very
important law, the dmca,

916
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,956
which was an amendment
to the copyright act,

917
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,625
set up a series of safe harbors.

918
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,562
For uh, different technology
providers and.

919
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,596
Telecommunication providers.

920
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,132
To immunize them
against lawsuits.

921
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,399
From the content industry.

922
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,068
I believed pretty firmly,

923
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,970
and still believe to this day,

924
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,841
had it, had, had napster
been fully legislated.

925
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:13,811
At that moment,
that we would have qualified.

926
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,879
For I think it was safe harbor,

927
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,749
I want to sway
it was safe harbor d,

928
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,886
which provided protection
for indexes.

929
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,120
Like yahoo and alta vista.

930
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,290
From the very beginning uh,

931
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,326
like anyone who
looked at napster,

932
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,327
you were concerned
about the rights issues.

933
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,431
And I knew Jeff berg at icm.

934
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:37,001
Which at the time
was one of the biggest agencies.

935
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,135
In Hollywood.

936
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,141
And I called up and said,
hey Jeff,

937
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,976
there's an awesome company
up here,

938
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,611
it's quite disruptive.

939
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,778
Can you go gather up.

940
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,179
Some of the music lawyers?

941
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,016
So we went down
and had this meeting.

942
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,154
I remember mo ostin was there,
or mo ostin's lawyer.

943
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,089
And a couple of other people.

944
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,759
So we ran in there
and said, hey,

945
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,127
we need to come
to an agreement here.

946
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,929
It should be easy because.

947
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,164
You're not going
to stop technology.

948
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,701
Um, and tell us
what you want us to do.

949
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,070
We want to cooperate.

950
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,272
And um, and guess what?

951
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:19,177
Nobody really cooperated.
And it never got resolved.

952
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,346
It's still not resolved,
it's 12 years later.

953
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,847
And that's pretty pathetic.

954
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,917
Ultimately, we were gonna
have to figure out.

955
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:26,784
A revenue model.

956
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,120
And when, by the time
we started talking.

957
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,988
To the labels,
we were more than happy.

958
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,789
To turn the whole thing over
to the labels.

959
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,194
And basically,
become their digital music.

960
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,694
Distribution service.

961
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,196
We always wanted that.

962
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,866
I recall we contacted them.

963
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,135
And started having conversations.

964
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,736
And we had serious conversations.

965
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,937
In about September.

966
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,040
Of 1999.

967
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,076
Explaining that there
was a problem here.

968
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,812
And they needed licenses,
but it would, it would be.

969
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,647
Great for them to be talking
with the companies.

970
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,416
About licenses
and so on and so forth.

971
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,620
And when it became clear
that they were just.

972
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,222
Stringing us along
and they really had no.

973
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,991
Intention of actually
negotiating licenses,

974
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,592
we filed a lawsuit in December.

975
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,228
We're being charged
with con-con...

976
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,495
Contributory...

977
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,130
Contributory and vicarious
infringement,

978
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,252
or something to that effect.

979
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,400
Basically saying that
since you know about it,

980
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,902
you guys should be held liable.

981
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,036
They're claiming that we did,

982
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,870
but we can't really
discuss anything...

983
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,174
And yeah, did we know?
Yeah, we knew.

984
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,976
But...

985
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,545
We also knew that...

986
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,781
This thing called
the Internet existed.

987
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,450
And it was new.

988
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,118
And as it evolved,

989
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,153
these things were
going to start to happen.

990
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,521
And things were gonna
have to change.

991
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,557
And the way in which
the world worked.

992
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,325
Was gonna have to change.

993
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,160
And we were just
the catalysts in that.

994
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,804
When Indiana university
banned napster,

995
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:57,275
student Chad paulsen
put up a website in protest.

996
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,377
Within weeks, over
13,000 students.

997
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,280
Had joined paulsen
in his effort to free napster.

998
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,348
It's not really necessarily
napster itself,

999
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,918
it's the software and the
ideals behind the program.

1000
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,954
It's like going to a rock
concert, you know, just.

1001
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,022
Listen to a new bands,

1002
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,990
listen to up and coming music.

1003
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,293
And Indiana university
is just shutting it down.

1004
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,495
I u and many universities
nation-wide,

1005
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,096
maintain that they
banned napster.

1006
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,498
Because it put an
enormous strain.

1007
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,932
On their Internet connection.

1008
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,201
What's up man,
I'm with mtv news.

1009
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,871
I was wondering if you had
any mp3s on your computer?

1010
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,573
So uh, how many mp3s
do you have on your computer?

1011
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,908
About 600.

1012
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,476
Maybe like a hundred
or something.

1013
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,511
Uh, six or seven thousand.

1014
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:35,780
Come again?

1015
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,648
Six or seven thousand.

1016
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,216
- For real?
- Yeah.

1017
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,852
How many mp3s
you have on your computer?

1018
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,187
Uh, probably like 300.

1019
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,689
For real,
where'd you get them from?

1020
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,224
Uh, truthfully, most of them
from napster.

1021
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,458
Are you a pirate?

1022
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,029
Well, I don't know.
My roommate does the whole.

1023
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,065
Computer thing.
Margaret are you a pirate?

1024
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,967
What we had was basically
a nuts and bolts capacity issue.

1025
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,504
Our Internet connection
to the outside world.

1026
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:04,475
Was being taken up nearly 61%
by users of napsters.

1027
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,344
On, napster on campus.

1028
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:10,247
So, we had to
decrease that significantly,

1029
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,448
or we had to ban it.

1030
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,321
It very much felt like
now everyone was coming.

1031
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,557
To grips with the fact
that this is something that.

1032
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,058
They're going to
have to deal with.

1033
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,793
I think at first,
they were trying to...

1034
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,063
You know, they were really
trying to be like no.

1035
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,797
This is just not
going to happen.

1036
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,633
But now it's obviously so big,
it's out of their control.

1037
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,076
For the first time,
the audience has gotten.

1038
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:41,244
To the technology
before the industry.

1039
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,746
Before the music business.

1040
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,748
Why are
the record companies afraid?

1041
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,384
The record companies are afraid.

1042
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,784
Because they'll be
forced to share.

1043
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,357
File sharing and this
whole new notion of people.

1044
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,593
Getting music through the
Internet, the downloadable.

1045
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,795
Distribution, to me,
I look at it as the new radio.

1046
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,066
I mean we care very much
about artists.

1047
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:06,103
And so we think that there
is a solution to there's,

1048
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,005
you know, a way that the
technology can be adapted.

1049
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,875
To-to-to benefit you know,
all of the, the parties.

1050
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,510
Involved. The artists,
the industry and the users.

1051
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,913
We think right now,
it's definitely a viable system.

1052
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,415
For all three and we think it,
you know, it can be.

1053
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,117
Modified and can be improved
to be, you know,

1054
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,317
even more valuable.

1055
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,722
You know, there were these,
these iconic artists.

1056
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,258
Who we'd grown up idolizing.

1057
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,593
Some of whom wanted to kill us.

1058
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,795
And some of whom,
thought we were the, the answer.

1059
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,631
I'm all for technology.

1060
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,900
And it's interesting,
the exchange of music,

1061
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,068
but the way that it's set up.

1062
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,570
Right now,
it's theft,

1063
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,905
basically. Pure and simple.

1064
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,239
I'm bootleg proof, you dig.

1065
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I, I got people that you know,
go around the world.

1066
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,043
You know,
smashing on stuff like that.

1067
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,612
You heard about
the I love you virus?

1068
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,914
My peoples have something
to do with that.

1069
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,849
I mean I can just do that to them
if I have to maybe.

1070
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,719
I think this aspect
of technology.

1071
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,356
Is really gonna bring uh,
a lot of different angles of.

1072
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,726
Life and commerciality
out of to the corporate world.

1073
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,088
And give it back
to the individual.

1074
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,996
Just give the fans the music.

1075
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,163
You know what I'm saying?

1076
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,033
Uh, the Internet is
just a way for you to just...

1077
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,169
Go right into it and
you give it to the fans.

1078
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,437
It's great, isn't it?

1079
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,005
Isn't that good? Isn't it?

1080
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,608
Napster is, is bull.

1081
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,909
Is that that Internet site?

1082
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,013
That's where there's the, the...

1083
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,149
Trading of music.

1084
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,086
We don't, we don't really know
enough about that,

1085
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:32,456
so we can't really,
not really into computers.

1086
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,457
It's bringing true democracy.

1087
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,024
Back into the music business.

1088
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,728
And it's changed,
it's forcing the artists.

1089
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,531
To change the way
that we relate to the consumer.

1090
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,199
A musician goes out there
and works hard.

1091
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,701
And pays their dues.
Why would you expect them.

1092
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:44,868
To work for free.

1093
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,171
There's no doubt, uh, in my mind.

1094
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,205
That the, the future
of music is free.

1095
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,710
To stop fans from
trading music on the Internet.

1096
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,512
Even if it's not through
a company or a website,

1097
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,347
fans are gonna trade
music on their own.

1098
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,547
There's no stopping it.

1099
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,683
You know, that,
this revolution is,

1100
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,950
is already taking place.

1101
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:04,554
It's now, this is now
and we accept it and we get it.

1102
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,191
And we're gonna grow with it.

1103
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,327
And it's just another
addition to technology.

1104
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,095
And I'm a technology freak.

1105
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,697
What do you say
to the artists that are so,

1106
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,433
you know, just so loving
it the, the new guy,

1107
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,035
the, like
the Fred dursts of the world,

1108
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,138
who just they think it's
the greatest thing for music?

1109
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,606
Um, well
he's a moron to start with.

1110
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,241
Okay, alright.

1111
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,441
What more needs to be said
about that?

1112
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,277
Nothing else, I guess.

1113
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,948
We get a lot of bands who,
who send us email.

1114
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,650
And say, you know,
we've been, we put our music.

1115
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,952
Up on napster, we,
we started sharing it and now.

1116
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,720
You know, we, we see a hundred
other people that.

1117
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,456
Have it, they're listening to it
and eventually.

1118
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,358
That translates into more people
at their shows,

1119
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,859
selling more cds.

1120
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,562
There were so many
success stories,

1121
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,463
dispatch was a great one
because they were,

1122
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,499
you know, a band and
they were touring.

1123
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,035
And their cds weren't for sale.

1124
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,770
And some of these places
they were playing.

1125
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,103
For the first time.

1126
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,851
I think the first time I
ever yeah, the name napster.

1127
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,853
Was backstage
after a college gig.

1128
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,156
Where we'd played
Boston and New York

1129
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,024
I bet for five or six years.

1130
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,558
Just over and
over and over again.

1131
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,429
Had finally built up
our fan base.

1132
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,097
To like 500 people a night.

1133
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,801
Or 700 people a night
and then we flew a red eye.

1134
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,669
To play a college gig
in California.

1135
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,371
Halloween gig, or something.

1136
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,504
Had never been west, ever.

1137
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,841
And then there were
more fans there.

1138
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:31,976
And they knew all the lyrics.

1139
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,176
- It was...
- Yeah.

1140
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,713
And there was no, no radio.

1141
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:41,551
And no press and no one knew
except everyone.

1142
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:46,290
Yeah, it's kind of like uh,
instant distribution.

1143
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,493
You know, without the,
without the big wigs on top.

1144
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,528
Figuring out it's like this.

1145
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,230
But it's not like
we don't like big wigs,

1146
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,531
'cause I've seen
you wear big wigs.

1147
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,965
I'm wearing
a big wig at the moment.

1148
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,367
Its a huge wig.

1149
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,736
So for an independent band,

1150
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:01,472
with no uh, ties to any
label.

1151
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,508
To get to that scale just by
free sharing,

1152
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,644
it was pretty clear
that it was um,

1153
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,346
pretty powerful and they
were really open about.

1154
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,580
The gratitude for that.

1155
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,920
Napster was absolutely the,
the most well known.

1156
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,757
And most chatted-about
company.

1157
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,125
In the tech world by far.

1158
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,361
It was pretty cool
working at napster.

1159
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:27,531
Like if you showed up, you were
kind of the star of the party.

1160
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,199
All you need was a napster
you know, sticker.

1161
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,101
And you were probably
gonna either get.

1162
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,137
A free drink or, or get laid.

1163
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,406
Uh, one of the two,
so it was actually.

1164
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:36,973
A pretty awesome time
to be associated

1165
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,510
Ron has a party
on a Friday night.

1166
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,879
We learned that day.

1167
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,746
That hummer winblad
had invested.

1168
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,417
We had a large gathering.

1169
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,452
For our limited partners in.

1170
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,186
The angel investor ip funds.

1171
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,223
You had Warren buffet,
Dana carvey,

1172
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,892
mark andriessen,

1173
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,727
schwarzenneger's,
schwarzenneger's hummer.

1174
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:57,927
Schwarzenneger's hummer.

1175
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,898
You had Shawn fanning,
Sean Parker

1176
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:04,068
Larry and sergey of Google fame.

1177
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,668
Not then, but now, Google fame.

1178
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:10,040
And uh, I can remember
you know, how, how taken.

1179
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,077
The Google guys were
by the napster guys,

1180
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,812
so to speak.
And I can remember thinking.

1181
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17,548
You know, good luck
with that search engine thing.

1182
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:18,749
I hope that works out for you.

1183
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,951
They actually said
at one point like uh,

1184
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:24,688
something to the effect of
how they were envious of.

1185
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,824
The napster brand
and how it's so cool.

1186
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,659
And I'm like, but you guys
are you know, doing great.

1187
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,661
And they said, 'no,
but it's nothing like napster.

1188
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,262
And I'm thinking,
in my head like uh,

1189
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,529
you have no idea.

1190
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,231
You have no idea.

1191
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,480
We actually didn't imagine that,
that what they would.

1192
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:50,848
Do was total shutdown.

1193
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,517
We figured, like we as naive
technology guys.

1194
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,786
Went this is really cool.

1195
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,154
So the music business.

1196
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,189
Is gonna try to find some sort
of business model.

1197
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,257
Around this, right?

1198
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,391
<i>Wow, downloading music
for free is awesome!</i>

1199
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:05,829
What the hell is that?

1200
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,911
I don't know, let me check.

1201
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,432
Freeze, f-b-I!

1202
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,168
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

1203
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,273
Hands, let me see those hands!

1204
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,876
My initial resistance
to the new services.

1205
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,011
Created on line was based
on the debate.

1206
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,112
Having been framed
in terms of piracy.

1207
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,216
Being labeled as such
by the record companies,

1208
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,886
it understandably sent
a ripple effect of panic.

1209
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,353
Throughout the
artistic community.

1210
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,357
They thought we just
had some big hard drive.

1211
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,558
Full of music.

1212
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,194
And we were just you know,
pirating everything.

1213
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,595
Like as if we'd gone and

1214
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,596
as if we'd sat there
and put cds and.

1215
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,334
Ripped them for months and months
and months and months and then.

1216
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:47,171
Lo and behold,
we had the entire library of all.

1217
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,072
Recorded music and
we were giving it away.

1218
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:52,376
Our users are exchanging
content um, and we.

1219
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:54,578
We at napster
never come in contact.

1220
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,580
With any of the music
that people are, are,

1221
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,615
are distributing.
So...

1222
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,417
And not only that,
but we're also fully compliant.

1223
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,653
The digital millennium
copyright act,

1224
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,988
which requires us to
remove infringement links.

1225
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,122
When recording to us.

1226
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,257
We were used to piracy,

1227
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:08,492
but there was a quick remedy.

1228
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,693
The r-I, double a.

1229
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,929
Recording industry
association of America.

1230
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,698
Would get in touch with the FBI,
they'd do a raid,

1231
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,433
they'd take it and then
four blocks later,

1232
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,734
they'd go set up again.

1233
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,037
So we dealt with, with piracy.

1234
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,039
But it was piracy
in the hundreds.

1235
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,440
Or the thousands.

1236
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,109
It wasn't piracy in the millions.

1237
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,712
And tens of millions
and ultimately, billions.

1238
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,217
That's scary.

1239
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:36,186
This is a company
that is building a business.

1240
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,222
You know, they've got
venture capital money.

1241
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:42,559
They're out on wall street,
looking for financing.

1242
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,996
This isn't, you know,
just a, a sweet, young guy,

1243
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:49,032
who's looking for some fun
in his college dorm room.

1244
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,567
They're building a business.

1245
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:53,769
By facilitating the stealing
of artists' music.

1246
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:58,308
A lot of the uncertainty,
I think uh, the, I'm sure,

1247
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,545
plenty of lawyers and others,
all kind of put the,

1248
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,314
the industry in a place
where it felt like.

1249
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,149
It needed some protection
or some control,

1250
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,886
to at least exert control
long enough to figure out.

1251
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,388
What to make of this and
play it safe and I think.

1252
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,790
Unfortunately,
that led to the missing.

1253
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,292
Of really big opportunity.

1254
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,861
I can get that the labels
were afraid,

1255
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,496
it was so new, it was so fast,

1256
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,797
that, and, and they
have control issues.

1257
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,468
With legal agreements
and this thing.

1258
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,335
Was like a hacker.

1259
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:27,104
It was, you,

1260
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,506
there are no nation
state boundaries.

1261
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:30,574
On the Internet.

1262
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:31,642
Right? You can't,

1263
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:33,110
laws don't really apply to them.

1264
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,443
Unless you can find them.

1265
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:38,081
For me, it was not about
piracy and consumers.

1266
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,450
Stealing
intellectual property right.

1267
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:44,021
For me, it was like
how great must music be.

1268
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:46,490
That these people
are coming together.

1269
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,226
And sharing
their taste of music.

1270
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:52,129
And the press about
napster was controversial.

1271
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,864
And misleading.

1272
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,566
It was all about control, power.

1273
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,303
And how can we protect
our existing.

1274
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:00,370
Business model.

1275
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,572
I think napster
had 60 million customers.

1276
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,709
Uh, or people you know,
which were...

1277
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,210
Getting their music
through napster.

1278
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:12,281
And uh, that seemed
like an incredible opportunity.

1279
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,085
But because the major eight
record labels were.

1280
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:17,387
Unable to come to any terms
with them,

1281
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,489
they essentially burned it,
burned it down.

1282
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,658
I think like any,
anything in the world,

1283
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,261
those big innovations
rarely come from.

1284
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,229
The big companies that are
already dominating.

1285
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,532
That game. Because it's not
in their interest.

1286
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:31,635
To completely reinvent
what they're doing there,

1287
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,836
so they become actually,
very complacent.

1288
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,873
The music business is a great,
great example.

1289
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:40,711
Of, of that.
Of just complacency being.

1290
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:43,779
A total uh, death sentence.

1291
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:48,018
The five global heads
of the companies at the time.

1292
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,553
Most likely, couldn't agree.

1293
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:51,321
That today was Wednesday.

1294
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,957
And for different reasons.
People had different ideas.

1295
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,425
People had different visions.

1296
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,762
And no one was used to this.

1297
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:02,966
And the word ambush
happened a lot of times.

1298
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,847
In the conversations that
we had with everybody.

1299
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,137
The record business
was kind of ambushed.

1300
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,372
However we want to look at it.

1301
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:09,639
And you gotta deal
with an ambush.

1302
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,474
You dealt with pearl harbor,

1303
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,774
you gotta deal with it, right?

1304
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,077
There was no awareness.

1305
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:16,612
That something like
this was coming.

1306
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,249
Uh, even though uh,
a lot of the technology.

1307
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,118
Of the Internet is
actually based on.

1308
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,686
Peer to peer functionality.

1309
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,490
It had never been
used in this way.

1310
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,659
This was something
entirely different.

1311
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,964
This was all the
content in one place.

1312
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:37,733
It was an amazing experience
and everything was up there.

1313
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,469
Everything.

1314
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,637
But things change.

1315
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,471
And you gotta change with it.

1316
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,175
And to stick your feet
in the mud when the world.

1317
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,577
Is tearing by you
like a bullet train,

1318
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,211
is just laughable.

1319
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,214
And you get real old, real fast.

1320
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,850
And you got into the,
kind of the, the bin.

1321
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:55,919
In about one, one year,

1322
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,087
you're like yesterday's news.

1323
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,822
'Cause you didn't keep up.

1324
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,557
Some of those labels
got caught out there.

1325
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,191
Some of the artists got
caught out there.

1326
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,729
'Cause they have an
older school look.

1327
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,029
At the music industry.

1328
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,334
From the moment that
Hank came in,

1329
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:15,705
he was looking at making
deals and he did.

1330
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,808
Everything but turn
cartwheels on

1331
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,210
Hollywood boulevard in
order to get them.

1332
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:21,278
I think it was, you know,

1333
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,814
we will not negotiate
with terrorists.

1334
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:26,016
You know and I think, you know,
that's literally.

1335
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:27,684
How they perceived napster.

1336
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,619
And I think you know,
in most things,

1337
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,888
um, you know, you need a hero.

1338
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:35,492
And before you can find you
know, that hero,

1339
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,160
you need to clearly
identify the villain.

1340
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,094
And we were that.

1341
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,000
All of a sudden, one day

1342
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,635
I got a call from cliff
Bernstein saying,

1343
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,903
they're playing I disappear.

1344
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,438
On 30 radio stations.

1345
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,273
I go, how can that be possible?

1346
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,607
We haven't even finished it yet?

1347
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,011
And then we sort of, you know,
looked into it.

1348
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,081
And traced it back to some
company called napster.

1349
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,448
And we were like, huh?

1350
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,731
It went straight downhill from
there, boys and girls.

1351
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,260
The moment, the
quintessential moment.

1352
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,162
Where I knew it was
out of control.

1353
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:16,800
Was uh, when metallica
delivered napster.

1354
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,502
User names for us to block.

1355
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,003
The heavy metal band, metallica.

1356
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:22,272
Has been most vocal in it's
opposition to napster.

1357
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,440
And drummer, Lars ulrich.

1358
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,542
Even plans on delivering a
truckload of paper.

1359
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,077
To the company, listing people.

1360
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:30,413
Who use it's software to share
unauthorized mp3s.

1361
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,582
Thus, kicking off
metallica's much-hyped,

1362
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,518
monsters of miniae filled
legal battles tour.

1363
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,188
We could, we couldn't
believe how, you know,

1364
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,189
what, what, how,
how crazy this was.

1365
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,591
You know, metallica was
coming to our office.

1366
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,262
To deliver boxes full of,

1367
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:49,166
I think it was like 260,000
names of infringing users.

1368
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,169
Who were violating
metallica's copyright.

1369
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,704
Uh, they could have put it,

1370
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:58,274
on, on a old three and a half
inch floppy disc.

1371
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,276
But no, nope.

1372
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,579
They printed them all out
on paper and not,

1373
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,849
<i>what metallica has done is harvest
user names from the Internet.</i>

1374
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,319
And from the napster site. Now
anybody can get that.

1375
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,988
It doesn't necessary uh,
correlate to uh,

1376
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,091
to actual legal names of
napster users.

1377
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,660
They simply downloaded anyone.

1378
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,662
Who has a metallica
song available.

1379
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,030
On the napster site.

1380
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,430
There you go.

1381
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,066
Now, once again,

1382
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,601
we're not going after these
people specifically.

1383
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,469
What we're merely doing,
is giving napster.

1384
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,238
The information that
they thought.

1385
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:29,405
That we couldn't gather.

1386
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,474
Which is basically, real people.

1387
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,877
Downloading metallica
master songs.

1388
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,445
Not bootleg live recordings.

1389
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,113
What will they do?

1390
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,149
I think maybe if we could get
the napster people out there,

1391
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,583
they could take that question.

1392
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,920
Do not go anywhere near the
front of the office.

1393
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,689
Because it's gonna be, you know,

1394
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,025
and uh, we were like
opening the windows,

1395
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:51,361
trying to look out to see
what was going on.

1396
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:54,064
Finally, Shawn and Sean are
like, this is done.

1397
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,732
And fanning and I
decided at one point,

1398
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,467
just prior to Lars arriving,

1399
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,603
that we would sneak out the back
door of the office.

1400
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,570
And run across the
street and watch.

1401
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,440
Just watch this whole spectacle.

1402
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,642
And we were like just laughing,
hysterically.

1403
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,579
There's a podium set up
on the sidewalk.

1404
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,983
I mean 25 Mikes from
news organizations.

1405
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:14,217
To get the pearls of wisdom.

1406
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,719
And views of Lars ulrich,

1407
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,821
who then takes a few questions,
but you know,

1408
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:19,756
he's got to actually deliver
the names and so,

1409
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,026
there we are, uh, Bonnie and
Clyde, in the elevator,

1410
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:27,197
uh, where if you had a shot of
it, the doors closed.

1411
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:28,898
And it's Howard king
and Lars ulrich.

1412
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,432
And a couple other thugs.

1413
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,503
And the doors closed and Lars
turns to us and says,

1414
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,405
'hey guys, nothing personal'.

1415
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:37,473
At which point, the door was
open to be like,

1416
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,176
well why didn't we talk to
each other about this?

1417
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,746
I'm sure it's not the
end of the story,

1418
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,114
well I think he probably assumed.

1419
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,850
That he'd walk into a dark,
expansive room.

1420
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,352
And you'd be, you know, sitting
in a chair with like.

1421
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,054
A, a cat. Do you know
what I mean?

1422
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,356
With like TV
monitors in the back.

1423
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:55,725
And I mean the reality
was you know,

1424
00:54:55,726 --> 00:55:00,196
that this was a really low rent,
shitty office building.

1425
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:02,565
With a bunch of kids
running around in it.

1426
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,434
And I'm sure he was blown away.

1427
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,036
But I will tell you that a
few minutes ago,

1428
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:09,806
when I dropped off all the names
that they asked for.

1429
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,910
Uh, I met two really nice
guys up there uh,

1430
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,646
I put a human face to this
whole thing napster.

1431
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,317
And we had a very civil, very
cordial conversation.

1432
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,519
For ten, 15 minutes. They
said their side,

1433
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,486
I said my side.

1434
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,156
And it's sort of like the
ultimate thing.

1435
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,925
In just American society, agree,
disagree.

1436
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,794
Coming from two different
points of view.

1437
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:33,930
But you know, what, to me,
napster keep trying to do,

1438
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,766
is try to sort of you know,
drag it out.

1439
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,835
And make it about
metallica and their fans.

1440
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,404
Or make it you know, why didn't
Lars call us personally?

1441
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:43,106
Come on, you know, like let's
stop bullshitting.

1442
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:44,207
Each other here.

1443
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,642
I think it's about the
most unhip thing.

1444
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,010
That I've seen a big
rock star do.

1445
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,747
I would imagine a Celine
Dion or something.

1446
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,083
Might be the first one out
there, but uh, but nobody,

1447
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,417
uh, nobody that uses napster,

1448
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:55,551
I don't think there's
probably any

1449
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,253
Celine Dion songs being shared.

1450
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,921
So that's probably uh,

1451
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,223
that's probably where it's at.

1452
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,158
There's one picture of this guy,
uh,

1453
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,426
with a metallica t-shirt and,

1454
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:05,261
and standing right next to a guy.

1455
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:06,596
With an aftra t-shirt.

1456
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:07,630
It's like this is,

1457
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,598
this is oh my God, this is
out of control.

1458
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,135
This is the vortex of this.

1459
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:15,472
Crazy tornado
hurricane that we're,

1460
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,672
we're in the center of.

1461
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,107
The center of the debate.

1462
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,842
Do you agree with these guys?

1463
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:21,945
Uh, depends on which guys
you're talking about,

1464
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,178
I agree with metallica.

1465
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,349
That's cool.

1466
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,818
And you know, it's true, for
some reason metallica.

1467
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,053
Had decided that they
were going to be.

1468
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,122
The lightening rod for all
these other artists,

1469
00:56:32,123 --> 00:56:34,057
who were like, you know,
not quite sure.

1470
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,298
What they thought of the thing.

1471
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,227
Um, and, but they were.

1472
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,961
You know, they were angry.

1473
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,498
Like metal was supposed to
be about like being.

1474
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:43,933
Renegade and being like,
anti-establishment.

1475
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,403
And-and-and, you know,
sticking it to the man.

1476
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,271
So it was kind of ironic
that this metal band.

1477
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,538
Was suing us.

1478
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,608
It was like metal and
like gangsta rap.

1479
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,513
Like the two least likely
people to go after us.

1480
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,914
Were the ones who were suing us.

1481
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,949
Napster is stealing from us.
Straight up.

1482
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,430
And I'm gonna fight them
to the death.

1483
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,297
Any time things go to
capital hill,

1484
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,366
you know that the, the shit's
really hit the fan.

1485
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:20,503
Like that's, you know, then,
then it actually means something.

1486
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:21,838
It started to be talked about.

1487
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,406
In all those broader terms.

1488
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,708
So it went beyond just
rights and that issue.

1489
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,210
It became the, the way that we.

1490
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,977
Exchange information period.

1491
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,247
When those concepts started
to be introduced,

1492
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,616
I kind of realized that, there
was no going back.

1493
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,751
At that point. That was,

1494
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,386
this was the future.

1495
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:38,488
There has been an
upheaval of sorts.

1496
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,856
Concerning how music is copied
over the Internet.

1497
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,326
What newsweek magazine dubbed,

1498
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,494
<i>the noisy war over napster,</i>

1499
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,264
involves more parties and
has much broader.

1500
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,699
Implications than that
moniker implies.

1501
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,735
Just like a carpenter who
crafts a table.

1502
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:56,139
Gets to decide whether he wants
to keep it, sell it,

1503
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,373
or give it away,

1504
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:59,208
shouldn't we have the
same options?

1505
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,778
We should decide what
happens to our music.

1506
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,948
Not a company with no rights
in our recordings,

1507
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:07,283
which has never invested a
penny in our music.

1508
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:09,486
Or anything to do with
it's creation.

1509
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:11,788
The choice has been
taken away from us.

1510
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,424
I became a royalty artist when
I signed a contract.

1511
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:15,892
With Columbia records,

1512
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,526
with a group called the byrds.

1513
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,294
And we recorded um,

1514
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,899
15 albums or so,
during that period.

1515
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,934
And aside from modest advances.

1516
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,703
For each of these albums, I
never saw any royalties.

1517
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,006
Even though we've had
number one hits.

1518
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,308
With Mr. tambourine man, and
turn, turn, turn.

1519
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:35,745
I saw nothing but the advance,
which is uh,

1520
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,514
divided five ways. It was only.

1521
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,147
A few thousand dollars a piece.

1522
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,084
And uh,

1523
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,853
with the advent of mp3 dot com,

1524
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,257
I'm getting 50% of the, the cds
that come out now.

1525
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:48,724
I think it's a wonderful thing.

1526
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,928
Thank you, Mr. mcguinn,
that's uh, that's uh,

1527
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:52,962
that's a complaint I've heard.

1528
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,429
From a number of people.

1529
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,266
Uh, Mr. Berry...

1530
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:58,134
Napster simply
facilitates communication.

1531
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,270
Among people
interested in music.

1532
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,438
It's a return to the original
information sharing.

1533
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:03,640
Approach of the Internet.

1534
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:06,543
And it allows for a depth and a
scale of information.

1535
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,110
That is truly revolutionary.

1536
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,580
Napster's helping
and not hurting.

1537
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,014
The recording
industry and artists.

1538
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,317
A chorus of studies show
that napster users.

1539
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,920
Buy more records as a result
of using napster.

1540
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,687
And that sampling music
before buying,

1541
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,323
is the most important reason.

1542
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:21,791
That people use napster.

1543
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:22,892
One of the senate hearings.

1544
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,594
Had a bunch of key personalities.

1545
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:25,562
That were invited.

1546
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:28,263
And Hank Berry was
there on our side.

1547
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,599
And Hank's a lawyer,
he's our ceo.

1548
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,803
So very thoughtful, you know,
well prepared,

1549
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,539
articulate argument, you know,

1550
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,941
having to be defensive at times,

1551
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,509
but at the end of the day,
he's playing fairly.

1552
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,444
And then there was, gene
kan from gnutela.

1553
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:42,612
My name is gene kan,

1554
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,481
I'm a gnutella developer,
one of many.

1555
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:47,050
I'm not the inventor
of gnutella,

1556
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,818
one of the people who
happily talks about it.

1557
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,855
And gene's a pretty mild guy
and he's a nice guy.

1558
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:55,224
He's kind of thoughtful, a
little bit introverted.

1559
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:56,359
But in this role,

1560
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,595
he decided to just
absolutely run with it.

1561
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:00,129
And so he just played the.

1562
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,766
Crazy anarchist destroy
the system role

1563
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,002
I remember being so
entertained by.

1564
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,369
By all the fallout from that.

1565
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,373
Is the holy grail of
distribution channels.

1566
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,441
It is the zero marginal cost
distribution channel.

1567
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,410
Uh, that means that it
cost the same.

1568
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:16,446
To transfer one copy of
intellectual property.

1569
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,781
As it cost to transmit
10,000 copies,

1570
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,549
or one million copies, or
ten million copies.

1571
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:23,186
Old world tactics may
no longer work.

1572
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:23,920
On the Internet.

1573
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,355
This is the new economy.

1574
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,256
Can we stem the tide of
new technologies?

1575
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,458
Highly unlikely.

1576
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,626
So what does the future hold?

1577
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,028
Great things if
profiteers adapt.

1578
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,163
If intellectual property
profiteers adapt.

1579
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:35,498
There's room only for
the leaders.

1580
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,734
The Internet is, is
ignanomously.

1581
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:40,970
Inhospitable to middlemen
and followers.

1582
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,038
Technology moves forward.

1583
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,405
And leaves the
stragglers behind.

1584
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,741
The adopters always win.

1585
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:45,642
And the stalwarts.

1586
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,877
Mechanized farming is a
good example.

1587
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:48,845
You don't see anyone out there.

1588
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:50,480
With a horse and
plow these days.

1589
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:51,414
Very intelligent statement,

1590
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,149
except that I don't
think we infringe.

1591
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,484
When we download
because it's for.

1592
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,218
Educational and
governmental purposes.

1593
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,086
So it's very used.

1594
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,658
And since we, since we
define what that is...

1595
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,929
You know, we went to the
senate hearings,

1596
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,832
expecting you know, to be sort,
I mean it was sort of.

1597
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,100
Established as an information.

1598
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:13,169
Gathering session, so we
expected it to be us giving.

1599
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,470
Them lots of information.

1600
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,072
And, and trying to explain to
them, how things work.

1601
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:19,642
But surprisingly, they
really understood.

1602
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,210
And they were very supportive.
You know, they did not want.

1603
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,780
They understood it was adopted.

1604
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26,616
By you know, 20 million people
and that was really.

1605
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,985
Powerful to them and so they
were all about trying.

1606
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,054
To structure things so that it
would be worked out.

1607
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,088
Between all the people
who had issues.

1608
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:37,860
And um, you know, I, I
suppose that, that maybe.

1609
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,729
You know, I got my hopes up.
That you know,

1610
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,097
everyone would sort of
understand things.

1611
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:42,464
As well as they did.

1612
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:46,601
Prize one, and the webby award
for music goes to...

1613
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,471
Napster.

1614
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,175
The first version of the
product, was pretty much.

1615
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,409
The same set of features.

1616
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:56,312
And it was sort of a very
simple application.

1617
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,948
But once we were sued, we
couldn't really do much.

1618
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,416
With it. So to have
something growing.

1619
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,285
That quickly, to have so
much attention.

1620
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,020
And have so many great ideas.

1621
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:05,388
And so much passion.

1622
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,423
Among the team members and
desire to make it.

1623
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:08,758
Make it work, make it last.

1624
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,893
To uh, not be able to actually.

1625
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,562
Change the product and
make it better,

1626
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:15,164
to not be able to really
pursue a lot of the great.

1627
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:17,734
Ideas for how to make uh, it
a viable business.

1628
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,703
I think it was actually
incredibly frustrating.

1629
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:21,871
You know, there was
all this focus.

1630
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:26,242
On the recording industry uh,
and the legal battle.

1631
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:29,178
From a business perspective, uh,
but.

1632
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,214
Almost no focus whatsoever.

1633
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,015
On the value of the business.

1634
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:34,617
Which was this platform.

1635
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:36,318
And it's capabilities and
what it could do.

1636
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,555
The legal issues
around the product,

1637
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,891
and the interface between
the legal team,

1638
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:44,026
which was becoming an
increasingly large.

1639
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,361
And influential part
of the company,

1640
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:46,996
and the product and
engineering team,

1641
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,598
which was becoming
increasingly small.

1642
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,039
And marginalized part
of the company.

1643
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,767
Eventually the
lawyers took over.

1644
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,370
The first mutiny was when we
moved into that office.

1645
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,772
In redwood city.

1646
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,274
And it was a giant cubicle farm.

1647
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,544
And as soon as Jordan
and I saw it,

1648
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:02,879
we looked at each other.

1649
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,380
And we didn't have to say
anything to each other.

1650
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,252
We were like, this is, we,
we knew it was bad.

1651
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:10,653
The layout of the office.

1652
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:12,755
So we'd gone from
having funky desks,

1653
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:14,157
I, I would call door desks,

1654
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,558
like we would
literally buy doors.

1655
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,426
That have the knob hole there.

1656
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,262
That would be where all
your wires went,

1657
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:22,330
to cubicles with walls.

1658
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,601
We wanted to all sit
together and, you know.

1659
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:26,735
We'd gotten used to that.

1660
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,005
And that's how we work.

1661
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,275
Management offices were
literally up a floor.

1662
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:33,709
Looking down on the floor,

1663
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,871
if you can imagine, it used to
be a factory work floor.

1664
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,049
Horrible metaphor, you know,
sit in your cubicle.

1665
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,017
And shut up, right.

1666
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,887
And you know, you're expendable.

1667
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,422
Oh, these people
need to be is...

1668
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,892
Isolated and that noise.

1669
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,214
Is gonna bother these
other noise.

1670
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,994
Who the fuck are you assholes?

1671
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,398
Do you have any idea what
creativity is about?

1672
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,402
That was a fucking
super buzzkill.

1673
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,505
Uh, and, and you know, we,
we won a few like.

1674
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,340
Minor battles, but the war
was completely lost.

1675
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,909
I had the advantage.

1676
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,511
And uh, Sean Parker didn't
enjoy this luxury.

1677
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:10,780
But I had the advantage of
kind of being able to.

1678
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:11,948
Kind of stick my head
in the sand,

1679
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:13,816
in terms of being able to just
work on the product.

1680
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:18,321
So, I had this attitude of if
things got crazy,

1681
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:21,090
or people seem to be
acting irrationally,

1682
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:24,527
or uh, if we were nervous, I
could just work harder.

1683
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,962
On the product. Write more code,

1684
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:26,863
put my head down.

1685
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,598
So that got me through a
lot of the time.

1686
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,499
First of all, what is your,
what is your name.

1687
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,633
And what do you do here?

1688
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,805
I'm Shawn fanning. I uh,
started the, the company.

1689
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:37,572
And I'm currently an
engineer at napster.

1690
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,442
How 'bout you?

1691
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:42,678
I'm Sean Parker, I am also
a founder and um,

1692
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,212
I do a variety of things.

1693
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,582
Working with the
legal team to uh,

1694
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,184
business related strategy.

1695
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:49,785
Do you have a nickname,
like napster?

1696
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:50,886
Um, no.

1697
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,690
Shawn fanning and I, we
literally went from being.

1698
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:59,028
High school kids leading
relatively normal.

1699
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,030
Mundane lives.

1700
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,867
To...

1701
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:09,672
12 months later, nearly
bringing one of the largest.

1702
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,374
Us industries to it's knees.

1703
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:15,444
And basically fighting what is
uh, in terms of potential.

1704
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,180
Assessed damages, the largest
corporate lawsuit.

1705
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,447
In the history of the world.

1706
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,620
The music swapping website,
napster,

1707
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,489
which for almost a year now,
has provided.

1708
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,424
Millions of music
fans World-Wide.

1709
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,126
With an
unprecedented opportunity.

1710
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:32,561
To copy and trade music
on the Internet,

1711
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,231
was dealt a serious
blow on Wednesday,

1712
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:37,667
when federal court judge
Marilyn patel issued.

1713
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:40,436
A temporary injunction
against napster, pending.

1714
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,838
The outcome of a trial,
which will ultimately.

1715
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:45,141
Determine the future of
the software.

1716
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,811
An Internet community to help
music fans find mp3s,

1717
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:51,079
I didn't' think it would be
embroiled in a legal battle.

1718
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,149
But we are. And as you know,

1719
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,051
the recording industry
has filed a suit.

1720
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,251
To shut napster down.

1721
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,585
To shut you down.

1722
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,754
Today there as an important.

1723
01:05:58,755 --> 01:05:59,722
Hearing in court.

1724
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,323
And the judge ruled against us.

1725
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,925
Hank Barry, napster ceo,

1726
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,259
is here to tell you what
happened today.

1727
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,829
On the 27th of July,
we all gathered.

1728
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,331
In judge patel's courtroom.

1729
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:11,000
And uh, we had a hearing and it
was supposed to be.

1730
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,935
Something relatively low key,
you know...

1731
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,637
It was a hearing on a
preliminary injunction.

1732
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:19,008
Motion that the labels, uh,
were moving.

1733
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,343
And uh, the judge
came in and uh,

1734
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:23,078
right from the outset
didn't look good.

1735
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,083
Uh, this is a preliminary
injunction uh, it's been.

1736
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:30,018
Entered without the basis of any
evidentiary hearing.

1737
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,687
We asked for an
evidentiary hearing.

1738
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:34,123
We asked to have an
opportunity to come in,

1739
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:36,292
cross-examine their witnesses,
to have this.

1740
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,962
Decided not on the basis of uh,
15 minutes for me.

1741
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,231
And 15 minutes for Dan
Johnson argument.

1742
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:46,001
But on the basis of
actual evidence.

1743
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,636
We asked to have this
decided at trial.

1744
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,973
Um, the court decided to do
it on the basis.

1745
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,442
The court decided to do it.

1746
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,778
David boies was a lot of hype.
He had just won.

1747
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,150
The Microsoft thing and had
had that big aetna.

1748
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,051
Thing that he had won etcetera,
etcetera.

1749
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,919
So it was like, we got
the big name.

1750
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,757
But, fundamentally, he did
not understand k.

1751
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:08,823
What was going on.

1752
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,460
At a technical level.

1753
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:16,132
So the legal arguments he was
making didn't fit with.

1754
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,066
What was actually going on.

1755
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,772
And it was a complete and
utter disaster.

1756
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:23,906
I felt like we had
developed a better.

1757
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:26,375
Understanding of the
impact of the tmca.

1758
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,344
And all the complexity
around trying to make.

1759
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:32,415
The case work. To watch it be
handled the way it was.

1760
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:35,417
With patel. It was actually
very disheartening.

1761
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,754
And then you know, Shawn's email
came out.

1762
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:41,223
Uh, there were these early
memos that were.

1763
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,493
Discovered, where um, I made
reference to the fact.

1764
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:45,795
That we were well aware.

1765
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:49,331
Of the fact that our users
were pirating music.

1766
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:51,800
Uh, and given that our users
were pirating music,

1767
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,070
it might be, it might behoove us.

1768
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,037
To protect their anonymity.

1769
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,706
So that our users weren't sued.

1770
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,876
And the documents that
judge patel relied on.

1771
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:02,777
Is the following...

1772
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,781
Users will understand that they
are improving their.

1773
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:08,617
Experience by providing
information about their.

1774
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:12,854
To name or address or other
sensitive data.

1775
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,558
That might endanger them.

1776
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,993
Especially since they
are exchanging.

1777
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,461
Pirated music.

1778
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,098
That is the
co-founder of napster.

1779
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:24,700
Writing what the system is
intended to do.

1780
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:27,837
And it is exactly what the
system has done.

1781
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,840
And this was uh, at a time
when uh, when we.

1782
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:32,508
Believed that what
we were doing,

1783
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,477
basically, just
facilitating relationships.

1784
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,011
Between users so that they
could share music,

1785
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,812
was totally legal under the dmc.

1786
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,049
It was like essentially a
brainstorming document.

1787
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:45,254
Where I used the word piracy. Which was
a, which was a taboo word at napster.

1788
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,424
You're not allowed to talk about
piracy, only allowed.

1789
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,390
To talk about sharing.

1790
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,094
The focus then became the email.

1791
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:58,833
When in fact, there were all
these other issues.

1792
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,004
So Sean became the scapegoat.

1793
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,540
I, I was sort of on this
forced vacation...

1794
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,444
In north Carolina the, the
lawsuit was happening.

1795
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,479
On the other side of the world,

1796
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,982
I was sitting in this beach
house and I got the call.

1797
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,985
From Alicia, who was
Hank's assistant.

1798
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:19,822
And uh, and was writing the
litigation and she said.

1799
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,659
She said Sean it
doesn't look good.

1800
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,395
And your memo is up on it,
it's blown up in a,

1801
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:30,166
you know, 4000 point type on a
huge screen, in the.

1802
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,668
Courtroom. And uh, you know,
they're calling you.

1803
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,703
A music pirate and they're
calling us all music pirates.

1804
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,237
And the judge doesn't like it.

1805
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,974
They needed a nail. They found
the nail and they.

1806
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:42,377
Put it straight into that
coffin and that was it.

1807
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,882
Now, it was easy for the
business guys to say, 'look.

1808
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,819
This guy not only
doesn't add any value.

1809
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,056
In our opinion, but he also
wrote this email.

1810
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,424
And it's all his fault.

1811
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:58,727
There wasn't a whole lot I
could do about it.

1812
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,363
It, it sort of, it sort of
was what it was.

1813
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,165
The company needed to
make a clean break.

1814
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,500
From it's past and try
to move forward.

1815
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,570
Um, and so I sort of realized.

1816
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:08,504
That that was the end.

1817
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:09,605
So I had this one
meeting with Hank,

1818
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:14,076
he walked me through uh, walked
me through, then I.

1819
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:15,843
And that was it.

1820
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,012
I vividly remember the
conversation of him.

1821
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:20,916
Asking me to come to his aid
and help him preserve.

1822
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,183
His role in the company.

1823
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:23,719
And after we talked for a while.

1824
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,754
About what that would be
I just told him that I.

1825
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,755
Thought he was lucky.

1826
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,525
To be able to get out of this
thing and go work.

1827
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:30,692
On something else.

1828
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,828
Um, because it had felt like,

1829
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:37,399
you know, it had been uh,
nothing like the first.

1830
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,169
You know, the first phase that
we had gone through.

1831
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,403
And enjoyed.

1832
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,308
I don't know uh, if that
really contributed to it.

1833
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:47,409
That email. But I do know.

1834
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,410
That it had a huge effect.

1835
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,713
On the judge's perception
of our intent.

1836
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,815
We are pleased with the
court's decision.

1837
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:55,317
We think the decision
will pave the way.

1838
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:56,851
For the future of online music.

1839
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,122
This once again
establishes that the rules.

1840
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:02,758
Of the road are the same online
as they are offline.

1841
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,160
And sends a strong
message to others.

1842
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,463
That they cannot build a
business based on other's.

1843
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:09,565
Copyrighted works
without permission.

1844
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,266
Have you heard from metallica?

1845
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,472
I have not. But I'm sure that
they are very pleased.

1846
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:19,308
And I'm sure that they and Dr.
Dre take great comfort.

1847
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:20,875
In the court's decision today.

1848
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,479
'Cause until napster gets
it's day in court.

1849
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,249
If this injunction is not
stayed it will obviously.

1850
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,153
Have a very severe effect on
napster service.

1851
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,422
So you will seek a stay?
Then obviously?

1852
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:37,159
I still find it difficult,
certainly a bit shocking.

1853
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,061
Uh, some things
happened this week.

1854
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:41,563
That I was certainly not
expecting to have.

1855
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,530
To deal with.

1856
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,301
Napster fights for survival.

1857
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,773
Front page of CNN.

1858
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,309
This is horrible.

1859
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,656
The ninth circuit issued an order, it
was only like two sentences and it said...

1860
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,558
This is a case of
first impression,

1861
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,493
it's the first time we've ever
seen a case like this.

1862
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,462
And we're gonna stay
the enforcement.

1863
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:16,398
'Til such time as we, the
ninth circuit,

1864
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:18,166
have had a chance to
look at the case.

1865
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,236
Lawyers representing napster.

1866
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:22,604
And the recording industry.

1867
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:24,505
Squared off before a
three judge panel.

1868
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,408
At the ninth circuit
court of appeals.

1869
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:27,710
In San Francisco.

1870
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:28,444
And what the supreme court
was saying is you.

1871
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,946
Can't take a snapshot and say,

1872
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,613
how is it being used today?

1873
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,251
What you've gotta ask is what is
what is it capable.

1874
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:37,686
Of being used for?

1875
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,223
Because otherwise, you're gonna
deprive the public.

1876
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:42,858
Of something that can be used.

1877
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,025
For non-infringing uses.

1878
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,029
They designed it to be a
pirate system.

1879
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,298
No, they designed it
for fair use.

1880
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:50,466
Samples?
No, no sir.

1881
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,968
Oh they designed it for
concert work.

1882
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,870
That the authors really.

1883
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,871
Don't care about a copyright.

1884
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,608
Even though they have it out on
a, on a, on a recording.

1885
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,013
That's what they tell us.

1886
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,415
- No that isn't...
- I've read their brief.

1887
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,884
That may be what they tell
you now, your honor,

1888
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,219
but they tell you...

1889
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:14,623
Anything on mp3 file goes
through the napster system.

1890
01:13:14,624 --> 01:13:17,992
Or does it go user to user
on a direct basis?

1891
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,430
It doesn't go through the
napster system...

1892
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,831
You know, their hand,
their fingerprints,

1893
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:24,832
you can't find them on those
things, can you?

1894
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,002
The fingerprints you can't find.

1895
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,504
Because napster
doesn't want you to.

1896
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:30,945
They don't touch them. They never
have anything to do with it.

1897
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:35,644
My fellow in New Jersey, and
my fellow in Guam.

1898
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,079
Will have a direct connection.

1899
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,212
On the Internet, right?

1900
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,682
And that's how the music
is transmitted.

1901
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,985
It is transmitted on the
Internet and we are not.

1902
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,386
Trying to stop the Internet,
certainly.

1903
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,390
That hearing ended about a
half an hour ago,

1904
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,659
here in San Francisco. No
ruling from the court.

1905
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,761
Is expected at lest for
another month,

1906
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,296
but after that ruling
does come down,

1907
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:56,131
many observers believe
that the final word.

1908
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,267
On napster will
eventually and ultimately.

1909
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,401
End up coming from the us
supreme court.

1910
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,673
I worked on several
presidential campaigns.

1911
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:09,044
And I would say that the
pressure that Shawn.

1912
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:13,115
And Hank had on them
was just as much.

1913
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,651
As it would be on a
presidential candidate.

1914
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:17,219
With the difference being.

1915
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,823
That they weren't asking for it.
Either one of them.

1916
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,527
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
very exciting day.

1917
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,396
An element of this alliance
is that napster.

1918
01:14:27,397 --> 01:14:32,301
Today, for napster,
for bertelsmann.

1919
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:36,971
Will develop something like
services.

1920
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,641
Middelhoff was a very
genuine guy.

1921
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,144
He had great energy and he
really believed in it.

1922
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,911
And was trying to do
the right thing.

1923
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,483
Took a big risk in getting
involved, especially given.

1924
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:50,651
The relationship that
bertelsmen had with bmg.

1925
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,323
That being said, it was
incredibly complex deal.

1926
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,657
It was a ton of money.

1927
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,826
None of them really,
none of them.

1928
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,698
Did get the conviction or let me
say, did learn that.

1929
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:06,001
The business model and
still existing.

1930
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,936
Business model of the
music industry,

1931
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,637
isn't working anymore.

1932
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,141
Yeah, and I think this was
clear in 2000, 2001,

1933
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:16,577
when you saw how people
did use napster.

1934
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:19,014
I think this would have
changed the world.

1935
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,182
Much more than Facebook
is doing today.

1936
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:25,053
Just the fact that this huge
German media conglomerate.

1937
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:27,689
Was coming in and gonna be
throwing some money.

1938
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,392
That I might be working for
a few more months.

1939
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:32,593
So I felt okay about that.

1940
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,229
I think that that,

1941
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,098
that mindset was the
company's mindset.

1942
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,200
They were weird, it was
a survival game.

1943
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,636
At that point. It was just, it,
it seemed wrong.

1944
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:42,404
Everything seemed wrong.

1945
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:45,007
There was a line crossed where
they were no longer.

1946
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:46,975
Actually trying to make
a cool product.

1947
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:48,076
We were just trying to survive.

1948
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:51,113
Whatever it was, we were just
trying to find a way.

1949
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:52,748
To survive.

1950
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,583
We developed a new
business model.

1951
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:55,951
For membership based service.

1952
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:57,119
Going forward in the future.

1953
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,821
And uh, we give money to napster.

1954
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:02,791
To develop that model, to
implement it, and then.

1955
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,693
We're gonna join them
and we all hope,

1956
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:06,161
and we're gonna work
jointly on this,

1957
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,864
to make that happen as
soon as possible.

1958
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:10,999
That's why Shawn has to get
back to California.

1959
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,901
To get his cap on and start
decoding again.

1960
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:16,572
Couldn't you preclude a search
under certain song.

1961
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:17,806
Names and if you can do that.

1962
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:22,611
Doesn't that suggest that
your efforts to stop.

1963
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:26,180
The trading of copyrighted
music is disingenuous?

1964
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,717
No, because we have not
been able, ever,

1965
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,719
to work anything out with
the plaintiffs.

1966
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,455
They simply refuse to talk,
refuse to cooperate.

1967
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:36,691
In any effort to solve
this problem.

1968
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,661
No, because, because
you're never going to.

1969
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,096
Come up with a search that's
gonna satisfy them.

1970
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,841
We had an entire row of
computers dedicated to.

1971
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:55,510
Temps who just sat there, coming
up with variations.

1972
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,679
On artists names, that
needed to be blocked.

1973
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,681
So Madonna was one and you know,

1974
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,442
so it was basically this
whack the mole game.

1975
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,386
Blockage is bad.

1976
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:07,322
Motherfucking alias names
like limp hash-brown,

1977
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:10,258
in suck, flu fighters,
pappa crotch,

1978
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,961
dick see chicks and
crotch box 20.

1979
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,198
When the effort went from you
know, trying to make.

1980
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,000
It a successful service and make
the product better,

1981
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,602
to trying to uh, play this
game of whack a mole,

1982
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:23,338
it was kind of you know,
foreshadowing.

1983
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,639
Of a, what was to come.

1984
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,445
Hopefully be able to show
to them that we do.

1985
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,513
Support napster and we do
believe in a cause.

1986
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,583
And that basically, the
music's out there.

1987
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:36,752
I mean they can't erase all
the mp3s that I have.

1988
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:39,987
And all the mp3s that tons of
millions and millions of people...

1989
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,330
Dedicated online music fans
maybe planning to.

1990
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,966
Spend a hard day's night at
their computers.

1991
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,434
Downloading free songs.

1992
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:54,802
Through the popular
napster website.

1993
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,939
A San Francisco federal court
made it clear today.

1994
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,306
The times they are a changing

1995
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,209
it's been a somber week.

1996
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,144
For fans of copyright
infringement.

1997
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,980
As a federal court judge ordered.

1998
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:07,382
Popular file sharing service,
napster,

1999
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,818
to remove millions of
songs that are owned.

2000
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:11,652
By the major record labels.

2001
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,755
Record companies fought
tooth and nail.

2002
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:15,891
Over the issue and the
court's agreed.

2003
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:18,493
It's the record companies
who hold the patent.

2004
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,394
On cheating musicians
out of money.

2005
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,298
American intellectual property.

2006
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:26,501
Is our nation's
greatest trade asset.

2007
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:29,871
We cannot stand idly by as
our nation's assets.

2008
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,572
Are in jeopardy or dismissed.

2009
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,141
By those who would use them for
their own enrichment.

2010
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,744
That's why today's decision.

2011
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,745
Is so especially important.

2012
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,414
<i>Now, napster can take a nap.</i>

2013
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,852
I'd like to add a word or
two about the future.

2014
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:45,420
Of napster.

2015
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:48,790
We've been developing a napster
service that offers.

2016
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:50,692
To members of the community.

2017
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:53,094
And importantly, makes
payments to artists.

2018
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,264
I'm focused on building
this better service.

2019
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,299
And I still hope to have it
in place this year.

2020
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:00,969
The new technologies we
are developing.

2021
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,770
Are amazing.

2022
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:05,006
I hope that by further review,
or by agreement.

2023
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:08,209
We can find a way to share them
with the community.

2024
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,645
I would also like to
thank everyone.

2025
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:12,246
For being so supportive.

2026
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,449
Napster works because
people who love music,

2027
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,416
share and participate.

2028
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:19,353
Many people have said it
would never work.

2029
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,957
We've heard that we
couldn't survive before,

2030
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,759
when we had 700,000 members.

2031
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,060
And when we had 17
million members.

2032
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,029
Today we have more than 50
million members.

2033
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:31,766
To keep this community growing.

2034
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,403
If we work together, I know
this will succeed.

2035
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:36,704
Thanks.

2036
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:44,246
The tipping point for my romance was
uh, after we were injuncted and then.

2037
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:47,948
Reinstated and then reinjuncted.

2038
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,553
That was it. It was like
being broken up,

2039
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:55,190
uh, with, with your favorite
girlfriend uh, and.

2040
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,026
And getting heartbroken and
then her coming back.

2041
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,462
To you and, and your heart
just like okay,

2042
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:03,131
maybe I can look past the wound.

2043
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,801
And, and nope, we reject you
again and I'm out.

2044
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:08,435
It's like, ahhh, this sucks.

2045
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:12,073
That was the point at which huh,
I realized.

2046
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,008
That...

2047
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,378
The cool of what we had done.

2048
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:18,012
Was pretty much over.

2049
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,683
You know, ritter left
because of all this.

2050
01:20:21,684 --> 01:20:26,388
And Parker was shown the door
and Shawn fanning.

2051
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:29,089
Slowly became detached.

2052
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:33,460
He...

2053
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:38,799
He would just sit at his desk
and strum his guitar.

2054
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,570
And if you went up to him, to
ask him a question.

2055
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:42,703
Or to talk to him.

2056
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:46,273
He would just keep
strumming his guitar.

2057
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:50,612
And he'd look at you, he'd
look at you with like,

2058
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,648
some curiosity as if
you're like an alien.

2059
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,651
But he would just keep
strumming his guitar.

2060
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,956
And...

2061
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:07,963
I think that, that was his way
of dealing with this.

2062
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:11,266
That sort of pivotal,
pivotal sort of moment,

2063
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:15,303
where uh, it looked like things
weren't going well.

2064
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:16,704
Fanning was...

2065
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,640
On the cover of
time magazine.

2066
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:21,142
Sort of, which is, in
American culture,

2067
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:24,078
like the peak of public
recognition.

2068
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:28,582
And it all felt, it felt sort
of, it all felt sort of false.

2069
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,352
I think fanning probably
felt the same way.

2070
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:32,120
It's like he was going
through the motions.

2071
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,321
And doing what he had to do...

2072
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:37,058
Doing a huge amount of press.
But you could tell.

2073
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:40,896
That, that the company was
coming unglued.

2074
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,898
Well, what's interesting is,
can I just start,

2075
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:44,598
I'm so sorry, man, okay.

2076
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,469
Well what's interesting is that,
that's not going to change.

2077
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,071
We're going to maintain uh,
napster uh,

2078
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,240
in it's current form, what can
I start over again?

2079
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,141
I'm sorry. I keep
mixing up my words.

2080
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,845
Oh, those days in San mateo,

2081
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:59,648
that was our youth.

2082
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:02,584
We had a lot of energy,
we were excited,

2083
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,952
we were like a little kid
running around.

2084
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,389
And then we became teenagers.

2085
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:12,060
And-and-and then the
lawsuit happened and we.

2086
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:15,462
Started going into adulthood.

2087
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,832
And we get these adult
figures coming in.

2088
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:23,172
And we start to get older
and by the time.

2089
01:22:24,674 --> 01:22:27,509
By the time it had gotten
close to the end.

2090
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:32,180
It was like, we're old,
we're fragile.

2091
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:36,418
It's the end of days, so we're
just letting the time.

2092
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,953
Pass. That's what it was like.

2093
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,756
And I can remember right up
until the day that

2094
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:44,993
I was fired, thinking,
there must be a shot.

2095
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:46,695
There must, there's just no way.

2096
01:22:46,696 --> 01:22:48,929
All this can just go away.

2097
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,232
Uh, and then I
remember being out.

2098
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:52,934
The other end of the company
and still talking.

2099
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,569
To the folks that were there.

2100
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,704
And you'd keep hearing about,
you know,

2101
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:58,640
the next bertelsmann loan,
the next label deal,

2102
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,108
discussions, the next and,
and you know,

2103
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:01,776
and once you're removed from it,
you're just like oh,

2104
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:03,878
like this is not gonna happen.

2105
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:07,215
Uh, but still, maybe
they're right and.

2106
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:09,951
Uh, I don't, that, that, it's
amazing to me now.

2107
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,221
How there was not a
chance in hell.

2108
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:15,924
That any agreement was
gonna be come to.

2109
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:19,094
There was a very long, slow
decline of napster at the end.

2110
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,863
And ultimately getting shut down.

2111
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:26,134
When the filtering
was ineffective.

2112
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:29,069
Because the technology
wasn't there yet.

2113
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:33,108
Um, 98 point something percent,

2114
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,409
wasn't good enough.

2115
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,581
I called Ali aydar and I said,

2116
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:41,016
'you know, we need to turn off.

2117
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:42,283
The file sharing here.

2118
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:45,520
We never talked about this,
but can you do it?

2119
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,322
And he said, 'yeah,
I can do it.

2120
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:48,990
And he left the room.

2121
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:50,925
And he came back in a
couple hours and said,

2122
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:54,161
'I turned everything off, but
it's still working.

2123
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,730
And it found, and we found
out that there were.

2124
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:57,866
A bunch of open nap
servers out there,

2125
01:23:57,867 --> 01:23:59,433
that were not controlled
by the company.

2126
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,169
That other people
had implemented.

2127
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,971
And were around the world,
so the, the.

2128
01:24:02,972 --> 01:24:04,005
Software client was
still working,

2129
01:24:04,006 --> 01:24:06,573
but we, the company had
nothing to do with it.

2130
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,619
Today, napster filed
for bankruptcy.

2131
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,155
Oh man, we, we had
to have raised.

2132
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,389
North of a hundred
million dollars.

2133
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,658
So and that, I don't
think any of us know.

2134
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:24,359
Where that went.

2135
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,494
This was such a common
question from people.

2136
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:28,329
Which was sort of, how do
you make money.

2137
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:30,865
And investment vs.
Actually making money.

2138
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,535
From service, but you know,
the idea is that.

2139
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:35,136
We're not gonna
generate any revenue.

2140
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,571
Until we can actually
pay artists.

2141
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,041
And it's hard to actually think
of a startup that's.

2142
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:42,010
Ever raised that amount of money.

2143
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,244
That went away as quickly.

2144
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,080
Like, usually if you raise a
hundred million dollars,

2145
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:47,916
in a startup, like you got
about five years.

2146
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:48,917
Of, of runway.

2147
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:51,319
Like you've got a ton of runway.

2148
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,720
The thing is 80 million of it
came from bertelsmann.

2149
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,991
Thirty million probably went
back to bertelsmann.

2150
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:59,427
Using all their other services,
right?

2151
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,763
Yeah. But then the b was 15.

2152
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,204
We gave a million dollars to Dr.
Dre.

2153
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:04,932
Another million dollars
to metallica.

2154
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,902
I have no, I mean
it's just crazy.

2155
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:08,937
This is mind boggling dude.

2156
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:11,039
I mean in, in any
investment calculation,

2157
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,575
you say the paying capital let's
say, 115 million dollars.

2158
01:25:13,576 --> 01:25:16,411
And then the company did so
badly that it went to zero.

2159
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:19,847
And so the money lost, was
115 million dollars.

2160
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,017
But wait, there's more. In
napster's case,

2161
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:25,854
you have to now tally the
settlement dollars.

2162
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:27,255
That will float out
of bertelsmann.

2163
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:28,689
And everyone else and hummer.

2164
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:32,927
You're talking about a 500
million dollar sink hole.

2165
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:35,630
Perhaps more that
went on for years.

2166
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,499
After the asset was sold out of
chapter 7 bankruptcy.

2167
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,135
We went to the uh...

2168
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:41,269
Good job.

2169
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,804
Yeah, so thanks...

2170
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,072
Wow, man.

2171
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:45,773
I promised, I
promised I wouldn't,

2172
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:47,475
but yeah, uh, and that's
Shawn's fault,

2173
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:48,610
for the record.

2174
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:50,377
- Uh, no.
- That's kind of crazy.

2175
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,914
But we went to, we took
this awkward drive.

2176
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:53,981
Like a year, I think...

2177
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,365
We thought about going to
the supreme court,

2178
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:11,933
we got advice from the lawyers.

2179
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:13,101
That the timing wasn't right.

2180
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:15,136
That we should wait until
there was more decision.

2181
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:16,236
In the trial.

2182
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:18,306
Do you regret that?

2183
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:19,540
I regret it now, yeah.

2184
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,576
I would have liked to taken it

2185
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:23,645
I would like to have
had a jury trial.

2186
01:26:23,646 --> 01:26:25,046
You know, we never had
a jury trial.

2187
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:28,682
<i>Is the effective shut down
of napster.</i>

2188
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,852
And what that's going to
do is give birth.

2189
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,020
To a thousand of napster spawn.

2190
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,022
And these children.

2191
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:35,556
Are going to be much
better bred.

2192
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,792
So once the record companies.

2193
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:39,861
Went after napster, did that end.

2194
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,629
This kind of illegal
music sharing?

2195
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,598
This pirated music sharing
on the Internet?

2196
01:26:43,599 --> 01:26:46,034
Actually, not at all. There's
a theory out there.

2197
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:48,203
That piracy will be eradicated.

2198
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,271
And no one will ever
share a music file.

2199
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:52,607
But that's really a
pipe dream for

2200
01:26:52,608 --> 01:26:54,375
really
getting everything.

2201
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,842
Getting the Internet
under control.

2202
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,378
What was seen from piracy,

2203
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,280
is that after napster.

2204
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:01,316
People went to other music
sharing software.

2205
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:05,186
Such as limewire, or morpheus,
gnutella or music city.

2206
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:06,920
Things like that.

2207
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,424
A bomb went off and nobody knew.

2208
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:10,491
What the hell was happening.

2209
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:12,960
The cat wasn't going
back in the bag.

2210
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,929
I don't care how many
people we sued.

2211
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:18,266
I don't care how effective or
ineffective the riaa.

2212
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:20,868
Were, was with certain
aspects of it.

2213
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,269
It wasn't going back.

2214
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,272
People are gonna still
download for free.

2215
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:26,541
It's free! It's free.

2216
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:29,110
It's wrong, but it's free.

2217
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:32,813
If there is an under-net of
piracy, that's something.

2218
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,116
That our industry has always
had to live with.

2219
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:38,886
The idea is to keep
commercial pirates out.

2220
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:40,922
Of the marketplace, so that
legitimate commerce.

2221
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:45,627
They were saying was it's just a
matter of copyright is gonna be fixed.

2222
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:48,296
And maintained by, by
some combination of.

2223
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:50,297
Enforcement and education.

2224
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,866
And I said, well this
sounds a lot like.

2225
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:54,669
The war on drugs, guys, I mean,
I don't think.

2226
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,037
This is gonna work.

2227
01:27:56,038 --> 01:27:57,372
That certainly didn't.

2228
01:27:57,373 --> 01:28:00,041
File sharing services allow for
the illegal downloading.

2229
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:02,377
Of copyrighted works,
which can get you.

2230
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:03,578
Into trouble in a hurry.

2231
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:05,980
Many parents may be
surprised to learn.

2232
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:08,716
Those consequences can
include lawsuits.

2233
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:11,452
With penalties and
legal fees costing.

2234
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,686
Thousands of dollars.

2235
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:15,990
Downloading or sharing music
without permission.

2236
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:17,425
Is not okay.

2237
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:19,326
I don't think people are
stealing music.

2238
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,897
I think the record
companies are not.

2239
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:23,997
Adjusting.

2240
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:25,132
To technology.

2241
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,668
But rather than adjust.

2242
01:28:26,669 --> 01:28:29,737
And figure out how to work
with it and use it,

2243
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:30,938
they fought it.

2244
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:33,408
And they started to sue
their customers.

2245
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:37,679
And everything. And I, I think
that alienated them.

2246
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,514
From both the public
and the artists.

2247
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,918
Can you explain again,
what,

2248
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:45,719
if anything, you're doing
to catch thieves?

2249
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:51,459
Well, we have tried to be, uh,
and I think,

2250
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,495
have succeeded in being
as responsible.

2251
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,698
In this space toward
individual users.

2252
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,599
As anyone could hope to expect.

2253
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,368
From the music industry.

2254
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:04,773
We have historically been um,
very uh, tolerant of.

2255
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:08,509
Of downloaders, but
very aggressive.

2256
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,144
Against the uploaders.

2257
01:29:10,145 --> 01:29:13,781
We have tried to be focused on
distribution sites.

2258
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:15,682
With significant
amounts of music.

2259
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,552
I don't think this is about
punishing individuals.

2260
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,622
Well, they did. They sued over
18 thousand regular.

2261
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:24,525
Old normal people and uh,
average settlement size.

2262
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,127
Was about $4000 dollars.

2263
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:28,663
From people who could
hardly afford $4000.

2264
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,031
So I don't think that
was a good move.

2265
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,800
Particularly from a public
relations perspective.

2266
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:35,002
You don't get your
market to like you.

2267
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:36,236
By suing the shit out of them.

2268
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,807
I mean what they've done is to,
is to turn an entire.

2269
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,776
Generation of kids into
electronic Hezbollah.

2270
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,545
Who hate them for
ideological reasons.

2271
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,383
I mean I know a lot of
people that, that won't.

2272
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:49,717
Buy music, period.

2273
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,718
Because they don't want to
enrich those people.

2274
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,554
And they didn't have to
have it like that.

2275
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:03,331
Good hard working people all of
a sudden got laid off.

2276
01:30:03,332 --> 01:30:06,067
As major music industries,
entire floors were turning

2277
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,403
I remember, you know,
people who'd been.

2278
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:10,171
Working so hard, doing
such great work,

2279
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:12,006
there's no longer a need
for them because.

2280
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:14,208
The market shrinking
because these people.

2281
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,944
Kind of caved in on
their own greed.

2282
01:30:16,945 --> 01:30:20,248
Their bosses, their CEOs, their
rock star a&r people.

2283
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:23,217
All of a sudden, realized
they'd been shoveling.

2284
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:25,753
A bunch of mediocre crap to
a bunch of people.

2285
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,355
Who they devalued.

2286
01:30:27,356 --> 01:30:29,823
But now the people
have a choice.

2287
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:31,993
They can cherry pick
the records.

2288
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:35,061
They now can not have to take
it from you for $22.

2289
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,900
They can now spend three bucks
on the three songs.

2290
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:40,434
That got made into videos.

2291
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,771
And everything came loose.

2292
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,206
Well it's the perfect storm,
again.

2293
01:30:45,207 --> 01:30:46,274
It's three sides really,

2294
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,275
when you really think about it.

2295
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:50,343
Free is a pretty big component.

2296
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:56,250
The corporatization of
America and the world.

2297
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:57,951
In creative companies.

2298
01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,386
Right?

2299
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,356
And the downsizing of
the structure.

2300
01:31:02,357 --> 01:31:03,824
Of the music companies.

2301
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,928
The whole crux of the argument,
I guess, is.

2302
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:09,664
That there's great things.

2303
01:31:09,665 --> 01:31:13,301
About modern technology, music
and there's things that's shit.

2304
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:14,669
And there's great things
about the past,

2305
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,504
some of the past stories.

2306
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,538
Had to go because the
people demanded it.

2307
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:21,041
Therein lies the problem.

2308
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,912
I think uh, we dropped
the ball you know,

2309
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:27,014
but I-I-I don't see why.

2310
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:30,818
We can't read you know,
recapture it to some degree.

2311
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:35,290
But uh, it'll it'll never be like it
was, when we controlled everything.

2312
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:39,527
Napster ended up,
unfortunately in the strip.

2313
01:31:39,528 --> 01:31:43,431
They process and
when uh, people like Steve jobs,

2314
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:47,802
they were so smart and business
smart, that they said.

2315
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:51,772
Where is talent okay, we hire
the napster people.

2316
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:55,142
ITunes in the us has an
84% market share.

2317
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:57,611
Last month for all legally
downloaded music.

2318
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,215
I don't think you can point to
any digital music.

2319
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:04,285
Service that exists now that
doesn't uh, tip it's hat.

2320
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:06,220
In some way to napster.

2321
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,623
And I, I can tell you
that you know.

2322
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:11,225
With the first version of iTunes
that was released,

2323
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:15,129
had shocking similarity to the
ui that napster was using.

2324
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,796
And I don't think that
was accidental.

2325
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,768
When we finally, we made
money at napster.

2326
01:32:20,769 --> 01:32:25,139
So, I mean that we, I was left
with pretty significant.

2327
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:29,477
Legal debt. Um, which was you
know, to the extent.

2328
01:32:29,478 --> 01:32:31,245
That napster was like
napster university.

2329
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:33,714
Was actually not that
different from.

2330
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,949
The college debt that most kids
would have at that age.

2331
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,354
Sort of comparable uh, in scale.

2332
01:32:40,355 --> 01:32:43,224
Uh, so, but I had this,
this legal debt.

2333
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,025
And fanning wasn't that
much better off.

2334
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:46,761
After napster was shut down,

2335
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:49,530
Shawn fanning and I co-founded.

2336
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:51,665
A company called snocap.

2337
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:56,304
Which was Shawn's
attempt to rectify.

2338
01:32:56,305 --> 01:32:58,406
The rights issues.

2339
01:32:58,407 --> 01:32:59,607
Having been a bit disillusioned.

2340
01:32:59,608 --> 01:33:00,708
With how the case had gone.

2341
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:02,577
And the way that the
conversation.

2342
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,478
And debate had operated at such
a superficial level

2343
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:07,381
I jumped on this idea of
wanting to create.

2344
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:09,317
An independent
copyright database.

2345
01:33:09,318 --> 01:33:12,887
Where any rights holder,
independent or otherwise.

2346
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:14,455
Could register their work.

2347
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:15,489
And the idea was that.

2348
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:16,490
Everything that was unclaimed,

2349
01:33:16,491 --> 01:33:17,992
would be freely sharable.

2350
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:19,859
Until somebody came in and
said this is mine.

2351
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,530
To try to work back
towards a world.

2352
01:33:22,531 --> 01:33:25,333
Where all this
interesting diverse music.

2353
01:33:25,334 --> 01:33:26,466
Would be available.

2354
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,803
And it was nice and it made
sense in my head,

2355
01:33:28,804 --> 01:33:29,904
but the actual act.

2356
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:31,172
Of trying to get
everyone to buy into.

2357
01:33:31,173 --> 01:33:34,609
As an intermediary was an
incredibly challenging.

2358
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,645
What happened was there was a
lot of excitement.

2359
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:41,449
And, and there was a lot of
interest in snocap.

2360
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:46,087
Until Steve jobs came up
with his deals.

2361
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:49,123
And the iTunes store. Not
because snocap.

2362
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:52,293
Wasn't a great idea, but
because the industry was.

2363
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:54,662
Not prepared. They
felt much safer.

2364
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:57,230
With one retailer.

2365
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:58,966
And once that happened,

2366
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,368
you could just see the air go
out of the tires.

2367
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:04,772
It was, actually, that was one
of the hardest times for me.

2368
01:34:04,773 --> 01:34:07,341
I had just, and then you know,
I, I just uh,

2369
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:11,112
'cause I enjoyed it and uh,
eventually started a,

2370
01:34:11,113 --> 01:34:14,482
you know, a company, but it
took uh, gaming and.

2371
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:15,548
Sold it to ea.

2372
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,056
I'm very fond of both of them,
personally.

2373
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:23,290
And...

2374
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,692
I think Shawn fanning...

2375
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,561
Is coming through it
reasonably well.

2376
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:32,533
I- I-I-I think Sean Parker is
having a difficult time.

2377
01:34:32,534 --> 01:34:35,336
In ways that you know,
I would too.

2378
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,772
I mean it's, first of all, he
was, he was crushed.

2379
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,675
And then he came up with
something else.

2380
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:42,209
That was great, which was plaxo,

2381
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,178
and it never had the opportunity.

2382
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,579
To demonstrate that greatness.

2383
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,380
And he was crushed again.

2384
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,751
And then he attached
himself to Facebook.

2385
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:53,887
And has made an absurd
amount of money.

2386
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,524
He actually came up with,
I think,

2387
01:34:56,525 --> 01:34:57,925
some of the most important ideas.

2388
01:34:57,926 --> 01:35:00,460
That drove the
success of Facebook.

2389
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,064
I mean while he was living
in my apartment.

2390
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:05,065
I, I was there. I
watched it happen.

2391
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:09,503
He's genuinely
trying to reinvent.

2392
01:35:09,504 --> 01:35:10,603
The music business.

2393
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:12,839
With spotify.

2394
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:16,243
It seems incredibly archaic that
we've' come this far.

2395
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:18,179
And we finally started to
figure out that there's.

2396
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:22,016
Models like spotify, models
like iTunes that,

2397
01:35:22,017 --> 01:35:24,552
that work, that are
beginning to restore.

2398
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:25,486
Growth to this industry.

2399
01:35:25,487 --> 01:35:28,856
And, and even as all of this is
starting to click,

2400
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:30,958
you still have these
reactionary lawmakers.

2401
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:33,527
Who think they can legislate.

2402
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:34,761
The problem away.

2403
01:35:35,664 --> 01:35:38,466
That's somehow gonna
solve piracy.

2404
01:35:38,467 --> 01:35:39,400
I mean haven't they
learned anything.

2405
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,501
From watching the
last ten years.

2406
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:43,904
Of peer-to-peer distribution>

2407
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:47,274
it's not connected to any
particular ip address.

2408
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:48,909
It's totally decentralized.

2409
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,978
I think of what we've seen
in the last decade.

2410
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:55,449
Is that this war, which has
basically criminalized a.

2411
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:59,420
Whole generation is uh,
culture's Vietnam.

2412
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:02,423
Uh, it's been a
complete disaster.

2413
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,524
It has not achieved
it's objectives.

2414
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,254
Which should be to pay artists,
uh.

2415
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:10,131
The only people that have
gotten paid in this war.

2416
01:36:10,132 --> 01:36:13,768
Who've been waging the
ever-expanding.

2417
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:16,070
Legal actions against people.

2418
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:18,305
Using culture the way
technology seems.

2419
01:36:18,306 --> 01:36:19,640
To encourage them to use it.

2420
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:22,143
There's always this idea
that the format.

2421
01:36:22,144 --> 01:36:24,779
And the style of the way
people access culture.

2422
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,181
Is gonna destroy an industry,
you know.

2423
01:36:27,182 --> 01:36:29,383
So people tend to get like
psychologically.

2424
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:32,052
Bugged out, you know,
completely not.

2425
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:34,588
Being aware that the
change underneath.

2426
01:36:34,589 --> 01:36:36,357
Their feet is the way we live.

2427
01:36:36,358 --> 01:36:38,424
Alright, here we go.

2428
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,528
♪ In the squares of the city

2429
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:43,164
we live in a very new world.

2430
01:36:43,165 --> 01:36:45,132
You know, technology in the
last ten years,

2431
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,454
has turned the world
on it's head.

2432
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,838
Art and artists are going to
start revolutions.

2433
01:36:50,839 --> 01:36:53,439
We've already seen it in
the year of 2011.

2434
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,343
Art and artists are going to
change governments.

2435
01:36:56,344 --> 01:36:58,444
They're going to change the
direction of rivers.

2436
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:01,682
And it's gonna be done
through flash mobs,

2437
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:02,950
file sharing.

2438
01:37:02,951 --> 01:37:05,786
People vous le vous-ing
half-way across the world.

2439
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:08,354
In a microsecond on their
hand-held device.

2440
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,624
Trading music, trading files.

2441
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,660
This front of
information in music.

2442
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,862
It makes, it makes me hopeful.

2443
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:16,529
And it makes me sleep
well at night.

2444
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:18,866
In that, the more the
music flows,

2445
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:20,167
the more the information flows,

2446
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,870
the more wiki keeps
leak leaking,

2447
01:37:22,871 --> 01:37:25,472
the more governments are going
to be hard pressed.

2448
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:27,373
To be more transparent.

2449
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:41,387
The main thing here is for
people to recognize.

2450
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,993
That what we're
doing is creating.

2451
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:47,461
The foundations of the future.

2452
01:37:47,462 --> 01:37:49,062
In a very fundamental way.

2453
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:53,701
I mean we are building the
future that we all.

2454
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:56,070
Might want or might not want.

2455
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:58,071
Depending on our current
vested interest.

2456
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:03,244
And I think that it takes a
really crummy ancestor.

2457
01:38:03,245 --> 01:38:06,213
To want to maintain his
current business model.

2458
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:10,718
At the expense of his
descendants' ability.

2459
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,720
To understand the
world around them.

2460
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,357
And if you really want
to figure out.

2461
01:38:16,358 --> 01:38:20,361
Which side you're on here, ask
yourself you know,

2462
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:22,328
what's gonna make you a
better ancestor?

2463
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,643
The journey was like a, was
like a theme park ride.

2464
01:38:35,644 --> 01:38:37,644
Or something. It was like
pirates of the Caribbean.

2465
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:39,079
People just like you know,

2466
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,215
weird scary people
popping up at you.

2467
01:38:41,216 --> 01:38:43,650
And you're kind of moving
through this thing.

2468
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:45,319
You're not really in control.

2469
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,823
We're in like a you know, a
little, little, you know, car.

2470
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:52,393
At the top of a giant hill
and we got all the.

2471
01:38:52,394 --> 01:38:53,761
Momentum and inertia
at the start.

2472
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,195
And the rest of it is just
trying to survive.

2473
01:38:55,196 --> 01:38:57,298
The downhill, you know,
slope and...

2474
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:00,433
The drunk skiing or the
pirates of the Caribbean.

2475
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:02,936
Um...

2476
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:07,007
I don't know, if we found a
good analogy for that.

2477
01:39:07,008 --> 01:39:08,274
Experience, I'd be impressed.

2478
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,510
Um, it sort of a...

2479
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:12,078
I get to be Johnny depp.

2480
01:39:12,813 --> 01:39:13,948
Alright.

2481
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,148
Who are you?

2482
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:16,784
- I don't know.
- Who else was in that movie?

2483
01:39:16,785 --> 01:39:19,119
You know, I had something I
really wanted to say.

2484
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,487
I just fucked that all up.

2485
01:39:20,488 --> 01:39:23,756
No, but... I don't even know
if it was important.

2486
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:28,228
If I'd known what it was
actually gonna take.

2487
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:30,230
To solve those problems back
then, I probably.

2488
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:31,731
Never would have done it.

2489
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:33,067
It took, it took that naiveté,

2490
01:39:33,068 --> 01:39:34,835
that maybe these were
problems we were capable.

2491
01:39:34,836 --> 01:39:35,836
Of solving at that time.

2492
01:39:35,837 --> 01:39:37,938
To even, even you know,

2493
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:39,472
get up in the morning
and go to work.

2494
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:43,377
You're born into the world
thinking that you are uh,

2495
01:39:44,879 --> 01:39:46,347
you know, you're entering an
industry that people.

2496
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:48,482
Understand. Or you're
entering a world.

2497
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:49,882
That's been seen before.

2498
01:39:50,951 --> 01:39:53,187
And seldom do you,

2499
01:39:53,188 --> 01:39:56,390
do you, do you sort of wake up
to the realization.

2500
01:39:56,391 --> 01:40:00,361
That you're, you're the uh, um.

2501
01:40:00,362 --> 01:40:02,596
That you're the, the explorer.

2502
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:03,697
In most cases you assume.

2503
01:40:03,698 --> 01:40:05,965
That um, there is some history.

2504
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,003
To what you're doing and that
uh, especially when.

2505
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,740
When you're that age, and you,
and you find yourself.

2506
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:15,943
In an, in an, in a new
industry that's new to you.

2507
01:40:15,944 --> 01:40:17,511
You assume there must be
someone out there,

2508
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:18,644
who has the answers.

2509
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:19,847
And then you wake up and realize.

2510
01:40:19,848 --> 01:40:22,281
The answers are being written.

2511
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:24,583
You know you, you are
the precedent.

2512
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:34,028
The idea itself is out there.
People understand it,

2513
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:37,364
people enjoy it. And so to me,
I mean that was.

2514
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:40,467
Absolutely worth all of the, the
trouble along the way.

2515
01:40:40,468 --> 01:40:44,438
I think um, you know I think
the technology itself.

2516
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:46,940
Is pretty powerful and people
have shown that they love it.

2517
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:50,978
And so um, I think you know, it
will always exist.

2518
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:53,212
Regardless of how it evolves
or how it changes.
