2
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,492
So I wanna sell my home

3
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,493
and I put on the market for 300,000 dollars

4
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:45,494
It's a lovely home you have

5
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:48,736
I'm the agent

6
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,564
Alright so let me start over, that was my ... i'm sorry

7
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:55,327
Alright I wanna sell my home

8
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,004
I  put on the market for 300,000 dollars

9
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,071
I get an offer today for $290k

10
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,072
The question is if I wait a week

11
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,178
and get the offer for the full $300k

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,565
Would I rather wait that week and get the full price?

13
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:10,746
Or take the offer today for $290k

14
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,049
Ah you want to take it now

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,050
I'll be the real estate agent

16
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,882
I'm telling you want to take it right now because

17
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:18,491
because a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush...
The market is starting to really soften up

18
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:20,699
with these things you just can never tell

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,774
If you get a good offer, I really think it's the right thing to take it

20
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:27,049
And I'm not speaking out of self-interest cuz I'm the real estate agent

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,024
and our interests are aligned

22
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:30,025
cuz I'm getting a commission out of your sales

23
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:32,006
I want you to get as much as you can for this house

24
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:32,772
I really do

25
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:39,209
When you think about the incentives

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,652
that the current contract set up

27
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:42,875
between the home seller and the agent

28
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:45,100
representing them, they are not well alligned

29
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,592
But can you ever prove that?

30
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:50,852
Interestingly, if you look at the sales data on real estate agent own homes

31
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,300
It's not their client's home when they sell their own homes

32
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:56,287
They get more money than they sell the same home for their client

33
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,464
Now why would that be?

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,095
What we find in the data is that agent hold out for better price

35
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,949
and leave their own homes on the market for longer

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,417
an average for 10 days longer

37
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:07,145
But when it comes to your house

38
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,819
The agent has the incentive to sell right away

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,539
Why? Cuz sometimes that $10k into his or her pocket

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,932
-Only $150 -I only get $150

41
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,329
Because if you take that $10k that goes to him

42
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,142
6 percent goes to commission but that gets wacked up

43
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,147
Half goes to the buyer's real estate agent

44
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:26,190
So I get half of that six percent

45
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,620
But then I have to kick back half of that to my agency

46
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,672
So I only get one and a half percents

47
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:34,618
So really, in order for me to help him gets the extra $10k

48
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,702
I personally only gets $150

49
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,329
But I have to work for an extra week

50
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:39,961
I have to buy all the marketing

51
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,039
I could be off to another client trying to get another
whole commission on another house

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,350
So I have a strong incentive to say to him this is a great offer

53
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,127
It's the best offer you can get

54
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,528
I really think you should take it

55
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:53,443
So no matter what the real estate agency says

56
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:54,763
I would rather wait a week

57
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:57,264
and pick up the extra $10k

58
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,690
The agent wouldn't

59
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,654
It's not that real estate agents are bad

60
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:04,326
It's just that they're human beings and human beings repsond to incentives

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,439
If there's only one element

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,883
that I say is that almost everything we do

63
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,620
is the idea that incentives matter

64
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,445
and if you can figure out what people's incentives are

65
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,737
you have a good chance to guessing how they're gonna pay it

66
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,496
New prents look at successful families and successful parents

67
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,657
and they just want to copy them and so they try to do the things

68
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,471
they think that they did to get their families so smart
and good and whatever

69
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:47,951
which is really just a ... can be a bad mistake of correlation cuase isolagi

70
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:53,158
You're gonna take your kid to ... you know ... every mommy and me music class

71
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,067
and you gonna take him to the museum
and start looking at all the dreaken roman sculptures

72
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:02,458
you probably already playing mozart in the worm to get the brain really stimulated

73
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,407
and it turns out; that the best that we can tell

74
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:09,093
from looking at data of actual parents and children along these dimensions

75
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,761
that that stuffs don't really matters

76
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:13,924
that it just dones't make your child...better

77
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,660
so it might make you happier, might even
make 'em happier, might also make 'em miserable

78
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:20,609
but it turns out that those are not causo-elements

79
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:25,072
I always said you can teach a kid just as much as in a grocery store

80
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:27,175
you can as in a museum, maybe more

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,021
My entire academic life

82
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:35,080
has been devoted to figuring out tricky ways to get a cause-eality

83
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,492
because the world just doesn't offer you a cause-eality

84
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,259
okay, what you see in the world is correlation

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,751
So what the world gives you is - things are moving together or they aren't

86
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,895
But to be useful, you need to dive down

87
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,839
be able to strip away what's causing what, what's not causing what

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,328
The data we looked at

89
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,714
suggests that, by the time you actually have a kid

90
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:55,348
most of the choices that you make will make you a good parent

91
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,500
you've already made them.

92
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,126
So if you go to the bookstore and buy 10 parenting books,

93
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:02,826
It's probably not really gonna help the kid that much

94
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:04,967
But the fact is that you are the kind of person

95
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:09,320
who as a parent cares enough to buy 10 parenting books even if you dont' read 'em.

96
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,734
That probably means you are a pretty good parent

97
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,937
Just don't think the books are gonna have a magic effect

98
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:37,503
Ah parents, we wanna believe so much that everything we do

99
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,756
is going to make a difference in our children's lives.

100
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,861
What they eat, where they go to school, who they hang out with

101
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,410
But before any of that takes place,

102
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:50,149
parents are confronted wth the one single ominous decision

103
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,669
that could shape the entirety of their children's future

104
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,386
what is going to be their name?!

105
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,922
These days, there's an entire industry devoted to naming your baby.

106
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:12,165
And business is booming

107
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,460
There's magazines, books, websites

108
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:18,711
There's even high profile baby naming experts.

109
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm a baby name expert

110
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:24,584
I study names, I ask the parents how they choose names for their children

111
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,552
and I look at how names are changing,

112
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,436
because baby names are changing today faster than ever before.

113
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:33,778
Names are important, because they have a lot to do with your family, your heritage.

114
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,210
Names represent huge, you know what I mean, street creditbility all of that.

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,073
Names are definitely a big part of meeting someone

116
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,001
A name can make you popular, and a legend.

117
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:50,292
Without a name, u're nobody you've got to have a name. It tells your whole identity.

118
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,501
But just how important can name really be?

119
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,286
I mean, unless you're Rockefella or Gates

120
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,287
Can your name have some sort of magical power over your entire destiny?

121
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,720
Not convinced? What about the following stories?

122
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,426
Once upon a time, there was a young mother who thought

123
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:12,699
she was naming her daughter after her favorite actress on the Cosby show

124
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,542
The smart and firery Tempestt Bledsoe

125
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,899
This is the most humiliating moment of my entire life

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,051
and there had been many

127
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,813
But having never seen the way it was spelled

128
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:27,212
The young mother mistakenly named her new born daughter

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,307
Temptress

130
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,276
Well, little Ms. Temptress didn't have an easy life growing up

131
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,090
-I don't even know          -What do you mean?

132
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,892
As a teenager, she became sexually promiscuous

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,859
Got into a whole bunch of trouble

134
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,687
Back here you little shit

135
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:46,517
That's right. I better not let me catch you

136
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,817
And ended up in court

137
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,151
All Rise!

138
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,397
Leaving the judge to ask her mother

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,108
Is young temptress just living up to the expectation of her name?

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,153
Was that just one little misplaced 'T' and 'R'

141
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:05,518
all that stood the life of ease and huxtable success,

142
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,235
verses those long hard days in court ... and 'juvie'

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,422
Harvard professor Dr. Roland Fryer was determined to find out just that

144
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,218
What happened to Temptress has NOTHING

145
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,772
to do with her name, has everything to do with where she grew up

146
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,857
It turns out, Temptress grew up in a poor black neighborhood

147
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,992
The kind of neighborhood Dr. Fryer has been studying for years

148
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:35,993
As a world leading renowned economist and an leading expert on race in America

149
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,444
Fryer has been long been interested in what he calls

150
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,944
Cultural Segregation

151
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:43,155
The gap between White Culture and Black Culture

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,242
One embodiment of that culture is

153
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,416
what you name your kid

154
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:50,760
is probably one of the few cultural items that we can really measure

155
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,400
precisely

156
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:55,132
What we did was we looked at the effects of your kid's first name

157
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,977
on their life outcomes

158
00:09:56,978 --> 00:10:01,664
Dr. Fryer analyzed the naming records of every baby born in the states of California

159
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,029
over the last forty years

160
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,934
and those names tell an unmistakable story

161
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:09,711
African American parents are more likely than any other ethnic group

162
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:11,620
to give their children unique names

163
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,147
There is definitely a distinction between names ...

164
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,040
... for white people and names for black people

165
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,698
Black names will be Molique, JAQuan, NayShan, Naheem

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,853
-TaSha and Shamika          -Shaniqua and NaShan and KayShan

167
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,778
I know this girl, her name is "treasure", TREZURE

168
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,299
struck me as typically that's more like an african american name

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,905
I like the names that begin with SHA, like Shaheem, Shahee, Shamur

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,149
Shakeem, ShaKoor

171
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,275
You know - Oprah. It's popular

172
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,276
It was actually in the fifties

173
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,223
and the early sisties that we saw

174
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:49,351
huge overlaps in the naming patterns of blacks and whites

175
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,731
So people name their kids John and Michael

176
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:52,732
and names like that

177
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:57,829
And what you saw was around 19 ... in the 1968 or so

178
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,639
kind of the black power movement actually

179
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,734
you saw distinct biofabrication

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,404
with black names getting more disctinctively black

181
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,844
and a lot of them are islamic names

182
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,700
Because the black power movement is about identity - who are we?

183
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,586
Who are you? Are you part of us?

184
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,047
It wasn't until the late 80s and 90s that we started to get

185
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:19,486
you know, kind of the ... made up, concatenated names

186
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:20,487
that you see now

187
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:24,701
This is generation today, they saw the change the whole name change concept

188
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:29,065
they have names that are 30 letters long you know

189
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,623
Everybody try to do something, um ... how do you say, unique

190
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,400
they try to name their kids over something different you know

191
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:41,982
We had 228 unique versions of the name "Unique"

192
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,516
Again, my favorite was ...

193
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,432
UNEQQEE

194
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:46,715
another one of my favorite was

195
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,514
UNEEK

196
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:52,546
ah ... so there are a lot of people trying to be unique

197
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,099
So what happened to all these uniquely named kids?

198
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,361
Kids like poor little temptress

199
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:02,000
I think it's not the name that's doing the damage to temptress

200
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,484
It's that they grow up in the type of situation

201
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:06,715
where someone would name their kids Temptress

202
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,739
The person would  actually names their kids that

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,001
probably has a host of other issues

204
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,734
that are influcing their kids' lifetime outcomes

205
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,197
Not just the name itself

206
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:15,430
What kinds of issues?

207
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:18,084
Let's look at a boy with the most studied white name

208
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:21,706
and a boy with the most studied african american name

209
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,831
The person who gives their kid a distinctively biased name

210
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:26,636
on average is more likely

211
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,718
to live in poverty

212
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,967
and to be kind of on the lower wrongs of the socio-economic ladder

213
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,552
You see, this is where Jake lives

214
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,108
and this is where Deshawn lives

215
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,694
The schools are not functiong - the teachers in those shcools aren't the same quality

216
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,228
as would be in Jake's neighborhood

217
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:50,341
In those neighborhoods, 80% of the households are female headed only

218
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:53,872
and what we found is that, names don't matter so much

219
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,904
they type of mother you have, the type of family you have

220
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:56,905
the type of community you grow up in

221
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,397
those things matter a lot

222
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,510
but what they name you, just doesn't matter

223
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,409
So name doesn't define your destiny?

224
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:07,256
Maybe if you name someone destiny, I don't know

225
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:12,540
But ... No. I mean your name doesn't define your desinty

226
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,411
A name may not define your destiny

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,014
But it can dictate the ways other people perceive you

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,869
Meet Harvard professor Dr. Sendhil Mullainathan

229
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,781
I'm very familiar with Roland Fryer's work

230
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,296
We both worked on the impact of names

231
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,478
I think Roland has emphasized that

232
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,134
people who choose names that are very black are different

233
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,668
from other people that choose names that are not very black

234
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:36,240
whereas, we emphasize that holding everything else cosntant

235
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:39,673
that people who end up with very black names are treated very differently

236
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:42,810
We know that in the data African Americans earn a lot less

237
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:44,897
We are interested in how much of that earning less

238
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:46,807
is simply they find it harder to get a job

239
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:51,080
are all African Americans treated very differently in the labor market than whites

240
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,612
Dr. Mullaninathan conducted his own study

241
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,539
This time in Boston and Chicago

242
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,532
What we did is we made up 5,000 resumes

243
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,555
Half of them we put an African American name, half of them we put a White name

244
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,239
Otherwise, the resumes were the same. And we send them out

245
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,164
And we said, which gets callback more?

246
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:11,558
What we found was that the same resume when it had an African American name

247
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,868
was about 33% less likely to get an interview than it had a white name

248
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,386
It means that, if a White person searching for jobs for 10 weeks

249
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:24,822
an equivalent skilled African American will search for 15 weeks

250
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,269
and those are 5 long weeks if you were unemployed

251
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,581
You can judge somebody by their names

252
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,060
It's not right, but people do it

253
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,215
They assume that, just because your name is Monique

254
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:36,824
or your name is LaVongue,or Shenanig, or that

255
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,749
that you're African American and you are not qualified because

256
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,767
your name has an ethnicity to it.

257
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,416
One time, there was a girl name LaKeisha talked on the phone

258
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,551
and I thought she was black but when I met her I was totally shocked that

259
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,068
she was a white southern girl

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,158
When I picture LaShandra, yea she's black

261
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:58,189
The names we used in our studies  were names like Lakisha, Jamal, Tyrone

262
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
Based on the results, it raises a question

263
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,083
I'm an African American parent, I'm thinking naming my child

264
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,338
Tyrone sounds like a very good name, I might have a grand father named Tyrone

265
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,931
Should I name my child Tyrone?

266
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:14,563
Yes, name your kid Tyrone, you've made it harder for him in the labor market

267
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:17,468
On the other hand, should you give in to that?

268
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:20,815
Should I give in to the prevailing norm, or should I express my individuality?

269
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,307
as I want

270
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,200
It's a bit of an ethical quandary

271
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,648
My friend got a drug dealer named Tyrone and I assume it's a black guy

272
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,115
Todd is a white name, Tyrone is a black name

273
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,406
I mean that's sort of how it goes, right?

274
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,713
You might choose a distinctively black name

275
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,942
as a way to signal something about yourself

276
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,822
and about your commitment to the black community

277
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:45,157
and that's the way to show other
African Americans  look I am really black

278
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:48,087
and I think there're distinctively black names already tell you

279
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:52,143
that there's a cultrual divide at some core, visible, noticeable level

280
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:54,778
and we see it sometimes in clothings, we see it in names

281
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,344
and in fact that's true, there're quite a few distinctively white names

282
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,678
names like Emily, Brandon, ... ah ...

283
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,862
... forgetting what those ... if you give me a minute I can count the others

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,447
White names are like Sarah, Megan

285
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,688
Mariah, Mary

286
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,400
Billy

287
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,810
Beckys, Johns

288
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,755
Tadd

289
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,750
Joe, Mike

290
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,000
Ryan, Sam

291
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,682
Chester

292
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,167
My brother and I were talking about how we have white sounding names

293
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,626
He's Abner, I'm Harper

294
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,968
Stone, Stone Phillips, that's like perfectly sutited for a white guy

295
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:25,800
that's the best white guy name you can have.

296
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,519
We live in different cultures and your name is largely determined by your culture

297
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,300
and the difference in the incident of LaKeysha among African Americans vs. white

298
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,898
might be a good way to understand how truely there are

299
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,837
different culutures African American inhabit and white inhabit

300
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,340
Today, there is more evidence than ever that the cultures we come from

301
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,137
influence the names we choose

302
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,176
Just ask the baby naming expert

303
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,202
More and more today,

304
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:51,880
you see parents choosing a namealmost as if launching a product

305
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:54,334
that you're tryint to position a child

306
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,453
for the best chance of success in the global market place

307
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:00,020
So in an oversaturated market place

308
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,080
which names garner the most attention?

309
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:04,512
Are some names destined for the top self,

310
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,522
while the others are headed for the bargain basement?

311
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,123
Let's take a look at the two product lines

312
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:12,710
Turns out, there is a such a thing as a knock off name

313
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:18,343
The top 5 middle class white girls names from Fryer's studies are:

314
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:20,144
(in order of popularity)

315
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:24,948
Ashley, Lauren, Jessica, Emily and Sarah

316
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,036
While the top 5 lower income white girls names are:

317
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:32,844
Brittney, Samantha, Amanda, Jessica and Ashley

318
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,246
So what happens to Ashleys?!

319
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:38,052
She's fast loosing popularity in the middle class list

320
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:41,069
But she's no.1 in the WalMart crowd

321
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,199
As those wealthier folks see their names popping up everywhere

322
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,123
they quickly discard them in favor of less merchandise

323
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:48,799
And just like that,

324
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,657
Today's high end Ashley, becomes tomorrow's low rent Trashley

325
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,176
On the lower strung of the ladder,

326
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,835
are the names that most signify lower class parents.

327
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:05,174
Like Misty, Destiny, Bobbi, Brandy or Cyndi

328
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:07,043
Now if you are over 40

329
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,223
and actually remember a time these names did't belong up here on stage

330
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:11,234
You're right!

331
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:14,671
Years ago, these names wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,849
But the years have not been kind to a name like Bobbi

333
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,446
And even though she once was at the top of the social-economic ladder

334
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:25,795
Today, she's just clinging to her former glory

335
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,294
Please don't name your kid Barbie or Bambi or

336
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:34,528
anything like that, they might end up being a dancer one day because of it

337
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:34,604
And if you do end up with a name that's bound for stripperdom

338
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,889
at least you can change it

339
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,152
I mean, hey, it works in Hollywood

340
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:45,997
Think about it, would John Wayne has been as tough if his name is Marion Morrison?

341
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,990
Would we think Marilyn Monroe as beautiful if her name was still Norma Jean?

342
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,219
And would we think as Ice Cube rocking the crowd if his name is still O'Shea Jackson

343
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,299
Actually, I always wanted to change my names to Max Powers

344
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,300
cuz it seems like a name that everybody like once they hear that they're like

345
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:07,762
this guy must be really cool

346
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,880
I want to change my name when I was younger, I never liked it

347
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,210
If my name was, um, Henry O'Barma

348
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,546
You know what I mean?

349
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:18,583
I think that would mean something to people

350
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,615
and I would have more doors opened for me

351
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,524
I did want to change it but now I'm sort of cool with it

352
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,630
You just sort of like

353
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,352
jumps on your back and rides along with you through life you know

354
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,460
As much as you may hate your name, at least your dad isn't this guy

355
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,771
Meet Robert Lane

356
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,681
He has two sons. He named his first son Winner.

357
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:42,007
3 years later, he named his next son Loser

358
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,864
So Winner and Loser Lane set off in the world to claim their destinies

359
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:47,704
And what happened?

360
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,588
Well, Loser went to prep school on a scholarship

361
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,952
Graduated from college, joined the NYPD

362
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:56,923
and eventually became a detective. And then, a sergeant

363
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:58,217
He goes by Lou now

364
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,409
And his brother?

365
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,193
Well, the most note worthy achievement of Winner Lane is

366
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:03,752
the sheer length of his criminal record

367
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:06,178
Nearly 3 dozen arrests for burglary,

368
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,183
domestic violence, trespassing and other mayhem

369
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:12,275
Is there one name that you can give a kid that

370
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,114
guaranteer that won't become screwed up?

371
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,025
No

372
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,521
Sorry, there's not one name that you can give a kid that

373
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,140
guaranteer they won't become a screw up

374
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,279
And there's not one name that you can give a kid that

375
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,960
guaranteer they will become a success

376
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,678
You know, it is a crab-shoot when it comes to names

377
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,762
I don't think there's any name

378
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,132
that can guaranteer success, at least none that we found

379
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,574
The world is full of ...

380
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:39,189
... excellent people and terrible people with all sorts of names

381
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,237
The vast majority of the reason people choose is left unexplained

382
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:46,244
It's like, why did you choose your child's name?

383
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,956
Sounded nice

384
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,936
Who really knows what parents are thinking when they choose a name

385
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:55,095
Maybe your parents went with something traditional

386
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,181
Or something bohemian

387
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,207
Something unique

388
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:01,722
Or something perfectly trendy

389
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,143
And maybe your parents didn't have the best taste

390
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,175
and you can't stand your names

391
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,546
Or maybe, they got it just right

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,297
Actually, my name means intelligent hero

393
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,505
So, that describes me to the fullest

394
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,222
I was actually named after a horse . My dad is a horse trainer.

395
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,611
My middle name is comfort, because an angel came down to comfort my mother

396
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,534
and told her she's gonna have a daughter with dark hair

397
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,600
and blue eyes who would be a great comfort to her

398
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,209
The prophet Mohammed

399
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,296
My name says that I'm named after my grand father

400
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:33,449
who was named after his great grandfather

401
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,719
that was it says

402
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,843
In the end, most parents just want the best for their children

403
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:42,555
and if they believe a particular name they give can give their kid the extra edge

404
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,323
Then why not?!

405
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:45,324
I mean who konws?

406
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:47,873
It just might work

407
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,856
CHEATING

408
00:21:55,857 --> 00:22:00,689
As W.C. Fields once said, "A thing worth having,
is worth cheating for."

409
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,845
Or as Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs once said

410
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,729
"If you ain't cheating, you aint trying."

411
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:10,207
Everybody understands why a kid would want to cheat on SATs right?

412
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,884
They have huge gains of ...

413
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:16,427
get into Harvard and have a good life as a result of cheating on a test

414
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:19,109
What's hard to think is why would a teacher cheat?

415
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,153
for a kid on a test

416
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:23,842
And, when you go to Chicago and goes back a few years ago

417
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,477
We find that lots and lots of teachers were cheating

418
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,478
Why would they cheat?

419
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,597
Well, because there was tremendous pressures on the teachers

420
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,865
to produce high test scores so their schools wouldn't get into troubles

421
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:40,149
First of all, to a very expedient ... to go to the end of the test

422
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,221
Cuz at the end of the test, a lot of the kids've left them blank

423
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,416
So instead of having to erase something and fill it back in,

424
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,100
you can just fill in the answers

425
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,622
It might look kind offunny

426
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,949
cuz how often would kids take a test

427
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,316
and they answered the first 20 questions,

428
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:55,888
leave 17 questions blank, and then fill in the last 8 questions

429
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,440
maybe be even a little funnier when

430
00:22:57,441 --> 00:23:00,099
they fill out the last 8 questions and they all all the questions right

431
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,096
and those happens to be the hardest quesitons on the exam

432
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,120
THE EVIDENCE

433
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,121
When I got the data from this guy from public school

434
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:11,671
I mean we are talking about millions and millions of answers

435
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,469
thousands of kids, over years and years

436
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,231
and I looked at the data, I couldn't see anything.

437
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:18,595
How can you see anything?!

438
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:22,306
If you can think like a teacher who cheats, and look again at the sea of data

439
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:23,982
These patterns come to light

440
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:28,509
Patterns, which are suttle. Burried under mounts and mounts of data

441
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,431
When looked at through the varied length, suddenly

442
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:34,176
It just as clear as day. And when you know what to look for

443
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,596
You can't help but say it has to be cheating

444
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:40,822
What he's really good at, is pretend he's a cheater

445
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:43,584
a criminal, a thief, a cheat, all these things because

446
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:46,773
cuz really he's not far from it; I mean if you really think about what an economist is

447
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:50,354
the line between an economist and criminal is terribly thin

448
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:52,472
-And what about journalists?          -Um, no line

449
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:56,716
Because he can put himself in the shoes of someone

450
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:59,095
who would behave criminally or who's a cheater

451
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:02,396
then you can back up the process and reverse engineer it

452
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,765
And that's what you have to do.

453
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:07,035
Because unless you are in the room with cheaters, it's really hard to catch them

454
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:11,916
It's not that some people cheat at every second or some people never cheat

455
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,955
We all cheat sometimes and others

456
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:15,598
Everyone got their own moral encompass

457
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,292
to determine what they'll do and what they won't do

458
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:41,054
Economic tries to be a pure science in an impure world

459
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:44,945
Economists imagine men and women are rational actors

460
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:48,321
In a market place that hides nothing from buyers and sellers

461
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,654
But what happens to market when people cheat?

462
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,537
10 years I've been interested in cheating

463
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:57,911
and I was in Washington DC

464
00:25:57,912 --> 00:26:00,262
I remember just seeing a little blur in the Washington Post

465
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:03,800
that said there have been allegations of cheatings in Sumo Wrestling

466
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:05,810
My view has always been,

467
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:07,789
if some insiders come forward and say there's cheating,

468
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,351
probably there's something to it

469
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:14,626
If you had said, where is a sport where you would not find cheating

470
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:19,635
I'd have said Sumo Wrestling, one's that got 2,000 years of history

471
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:22,235
it's all about purification, ritual and honor

472
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:23,714
It's located in a culture,

473
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,900
which on all of the rankings of corruption across the country is really really low

474
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:34,468
The ancient sport of Sumo Wrestling, is the essence of pure competition

475
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,490
Two naked men, fighting in a sandpit

476
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:42,203
Under the watchful eyes of a referee, dressed as a Shinto priest

477
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,671
Shinto, means ways of the Gods

478
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:50,984
A religion that celebrates the purity and harmony of men and nature

479
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:56,522
In Sumo, you do your ceremonial stuff

480
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:59,051
One is the clapping of the hands

481
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,760
as to awake the Gods

482
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:05,981
Two is when we show our hands and flip our hands over and

483
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:08,645
stuff to show that we have no conceal weapons

484
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,797
You come here and you want to fight fair with your bare hands

485
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,021
and to tell the Gods you're coming in with

486
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,284
a fresh and clean might and heart vessel.

487
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:23,150
The stomping of the feet in the Shinto religion is to stomp out evil spirits

488
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:26,906
and throwing of the salt is purify

489
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:45,222
I think purity is a good mask,

490
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:49,373
for corruption, perhaps most so it discourages inquiry.

491
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:55,009
It's true that Sumo might seem to be immune from corruption

492
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,399
because of its purity, history, and so on

493
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,506
On the other hands, the stakes are high

494
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:04,838
When stakes are high, and when there's an incentive to cheat

495
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,289
A small percentage of people always will

496
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,150
Just as in medieval Japan

497
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,112
The wrestlers, known as Rikshi or strong man

498
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,052
spent years in apprenticeship

499
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:24,774
Living together around the clock and training in stables or Biar

500
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:29,632
Subject to strict moral and physical displine

501
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,612
If you're a Sumo Wrestler in the top ranks

502
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:34,317
Your life is very very good

503
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,197
and you can live like a king

504
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:39,395
Once you fall belows those ranks or never attained those ranks,

505
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:40,983
your life is not very good at all

506
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,953
So, it's a very steep pyramid, at the top life is great,

507
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:47,071
and there's lots of people down below life is not so great

508
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,238
But there are so many of them,

509
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:51,166
because they're all aspired to get to the top obviously

510
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:55,900
It's a battle 24/7, being a Sumo Wrestler

511
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,781
It's not just two big fat guy trying to ...

512
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:01,357
... to kill each other but it's a lot of work to be big

513
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,255
and at the same time active

514
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:05,520
6 major touraments a year

515
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,188
you have to wrestle with injuries

516
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:10,548
they throw you in a jungle and see how you can come out alive

517
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,162
The objective of the game is to push your opponent outside of the ring

518
00:29:19,163 --> 00:29:20,736
or pushing him into the ring

519
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:27,167
But how can you tell if a Sumo Wrestler is cheating?

520
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,456
Is it a slip on purpose?

521
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,898
Is the fall rigged?

522
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:36,452
It's hard to tell unless you look at patterns over time

523
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,489
People who are actively corrupted always try to cover their trails

524
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,549
So corruption, by its nature is hard to identify, hard to prove

525
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,419
Murders are really great,

526
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,501
cuz almost always when someone is murdered, there's always a corsp

527
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:55,233
You might say "How would you know someone's cheating?"

528
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:56,958
and the answer is - look in the data

529
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,568
I don't have to ever seen a sumo match

530
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,214
I can look into data, I can look at it

531
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,668
And I can tell you, with almost complete certainty,

532
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,651
that there's rampage cheating going

533
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:15,262
In professional Sumo touraments, the wrestler
fights one bout per day for 15 days

534
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:20,657
If you win 8 out of the 15 matches, you can move up in rank - half a slot

535
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:25,185
The difference of half a rank can be maybe 5,000 dollars in paychecque a month

536
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:28,031
The respects you get in the Sumo Association

537
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:32,600
So when you talk about stuff like that, that 8 win is real critical

538
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,485
A Rikshi entering a tourament final 15 match

539
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:42,245
with a 7 and 7 record, has far more to gain from a victory

540
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:45,749
than an opponent, say 8 and 6 has to loose

541
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:50,531
If a wrestler has 8 wins under his belts, he's guaranteed to advance

542
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:53,601
Even if he looses that last match

543
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,975
So he could afford to take a fall

544
00:30:58,054 --> 00:31:02,257
In Japan, there's a term for match rigging - YAOCHO

545
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:05,415
Many suspected that Sumo matches might be rigged

546
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:11,042
But it's nearly impossible to prove, unless you look closely at the numbers

547
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:14,767
2 wrestlers that I would expect to have an even match

548
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:17,892
When 1 of them needs the eigth win and the other doesn't

549
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:20,496
The one who needs it wins 75% at a time

550
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:21,669
Rather than 50% a time

551
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,619
That's a huge deviation

552
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,981
I (8-6 wrestler) let you (7-7 wrestler)

553
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:31,302
let you win this deciding match cuz you my friend

554
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,041
gonna fall down the pyramid if you don't

555
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:36,084
In return, the next time those 2 guys meet

556
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,908
Lo and Behold, the 8-6 wrestler almost always wins those matches

557
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:51,494
"Honne" is Real Truth and "Tatemae" will be the surface of things, the faced

558
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:54,677
They are unusually important in Japanese culture

559
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,983
That's why the Japanese have given them names

560
00:33:56,984 --> 00:34:01,135
But being human, living in any society, I think we can all understand

561
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,900
the concepts themselves

562
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:07,707
That Tatemae's going to be a great spectacle of honest competition

563
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:11,623
but in the surface of creating that pleasing faced

564
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:15,743
the actual players are engaging in a form of corruption

565
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,381
To have the "Honne" exposed produces discomfort

566
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,653
When you think of the financial scandals

567
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:26,771
That have racked America recently

568
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:30,242
A lot of people who were supposedly to be not just incredibly wise

569
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:32,930
but incredibly honest, has been exposed as neither

570
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,511
Those of us who have looked looked to the self-interest of lending institutions

571
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:42,111
to protect shareholder's equity, myself especially,

572
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:45,431
are in the state of shocked disbelief.

573
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,800
That produces a kind of dissolution, in any society that formerly looked

574
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,692
to those people or those institutions ...

575
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:56,050
... are somehow representatives of what's best in our society

576
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,278
Sumo would be an example of that in Japan

577
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,643
While I would not put the Bernie Madoff pre-arrest reputation,

578
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,015
I wouldn't necessarily call that one of purity

579
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:09,543
The way we would talk about Sumo Wrestling,

580
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:11,691
or the way we might talk about the Catholic Cleregy

581
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,559
The S.C.C. had an image of this guy -

582
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,100
that was almost sacred saint in that he's running the exchange,

583
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,101
he'd been a market maker.

584
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:24,842
His reputation was so large that it discourages them

585
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:27,923
from coming in with a bias toward corruption,

586
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:29,905
and instead, they brought a bias against it.

587
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,237
Mr. Madoff, what do you have to say for yourelf?

588
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:36,822
What do you have to say to the public, your investors?

589
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:44,059
The realm of high finance and the world of sumo

590
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,086
both demonstrate the illusion of purity

591
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:48,087
cannot only hide corruption, it can help to make it possible.

592
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,109
In Sumo, when whistle blower step forward to expose corruption

593
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,110
they were not treated kindly.

594
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,185
In 1996, two summo vetrans, including a recently retired stable master,

595
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:10,429
collaborated in a tell-all expos that was serialized in the Shukan Post

596
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,800
The Sumo Association dismissed the allegation as lies,

597
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,278
told by a revengeful stable master

598
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,341
seeking to cash in on publicity.

599
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,282
To defend their claims, the whistle blowers decided to hold a press conference.

600
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,900
But two weeks before the press conference, both men died.

601
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,697
In the same hospital, on the same day

602
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,773
From the same ... myterious respitory illness.

603
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:39,723
Yet  no one questioned the way they died, there were no autopsies

604
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,162
The police did not investigate the sudden and simultaneous deaths.

605
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,352
"It's a very good hospital", a police spokesman told reporters.

606
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,726
So, there were no grounds for suspecison.

607
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,338
Concerns about the sport resurfaced when another mysterious death haunted Sumo

608
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,675
This time it was a young "Rikichi" in training named Takashi Saito

609
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:29,734
Whose corpse showed visible signs of assault and multilation.

610
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Hiromasa Saikawa took note of the death of the young wrestler

611
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:28,688
Sakawa is one of the nation's most vocal critics

612
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:30,765
of how murders are investigated in Japan.

613
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,171
He quit his post on the Tokyo Police Force

614
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,118
When the gap between the "Honne" (the hidden truth)

615
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,241
and the "Tatemae" (the facet propriety) had grown too wide

616
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,961
The job of any police force is to help keep crime at low enough levels

617
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:05,962
so that society can properly function.

618
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:11,952
The "Tatemae" of the police force is to be seen doing that

619
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:17,335
If the police can tell society, we solved 96% of crimes,

620
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,942
they have certainly fulfilled their "Tatemae" function.

621
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:22,653
In comforting society, making society feel safe.

622
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,433
But to achieve that level of "Tatemae"

623
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:28,541
The police might select only cases for investigation

624
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,770
that they think they have an extremely high chance of solving

625
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:43,892
Despite clear evidence of brutality,

626
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:47,394
the police declared that the young man died of natural causes.

627
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,704
And the stable master quickly asked for the young boy's body,

628
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:52,293
so it can be creamated.

629
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,945
But the angry father of the young man insisted autopsy,

630
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:00,510
which revealed that he has been burned with cigarettes;

631
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,222
and beaten to death with beer bottles and baseball bats.

632
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,413
The young boy has died at the hands of fellow wrestlers

633
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:12,289
who're ordered by the stable master to punished the boy

634
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,608
for trying to run away from the world of Sumo

635
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:41,043
Sumo counter-criticism with lawsuit against Takeda and his magazine

636
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,806
Juries ruled against Takeda in cases where he accused individuals of match rigging

637
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,137
But Sumo had no defence against the revelation of violence.

638
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,431
To defend its reputation, the Sumo Association shores up its image

639
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,141
By building on notions of purity from Shinto

640
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,481
that are essential to be what it means to be Japanese

641
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,356
Publicly, it insists that Yaocho is a myth.

642
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,631
I hope ... there was none of that going on

643
00:43:16,632 --> 00:43:18,385
in the bottom ranks. But

644
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:22,317
where I was ... No.

645
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,885
A retired Rikshi who wrote to Komosubi - the 4th highest ranked in Sumo.

646
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,161
Keisuke Itai came forward, and publicly admitted to fixing many matches.

647
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:54,435
And named names of others, who did the same.

648
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,707
In Japanese media, there's a certain form of self-censorship

649
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,336
giving interviews in japanese,

650
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:50,363
the media will not quote me if I use the word "Daraku"

651
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:51,809
which is corruption in japanese

652
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,742
and they'll change it instead to something like "Konran" - confusion.

653
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:57,762
We certainly have the very same thing in America today.

654
00:45:57,763 --> 00:46:01,304
The New York Times, for example, will not use the word TORTURE

655
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:04,787
to describe anything that's been carried out by Americans ...

656
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:08,016
... operating in our prison system and the war on terror.

657
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:12,343
However, if it's the Chinese who've done these things to an American airman,

658
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:15,909
the NY Times has no compunctions about calling those things TORTURE

659
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,535
The only way to combat corruption, to Steven Levitt,

660
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:26,460
is to change rules to undo corruption incentives

661
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,590
Unleash more investigative reporters

662
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:31,250
and develop strong protections for whistle blowers.

663
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,611
But that's easier said than done when cultural slogans

664
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:39,368
in American and Japan that we are honest, straight-forward

665
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,691
and fundamentally good.

666
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,151
Those who expose corruption

667
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:46,690
are challenging the very nature of who we imagine we're supposed to be

668
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,028
The irony of our Sumo Wrestling

669
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:53,641
was when it became public, the Sumo Wrestlers stopped cheating.

670
00:46:53,642 --> 00:46:56,111
and they're not for good, they actually stopped cheating for a year or two

671
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:58,383
and once people stopped thinking about it, they went back to it.

672
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:02,091
but that I think is the answer how you stopped cheating. Louis Brandeis

673
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:03,092
said that sunlight was the best disinfantant.

674
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,343
What keeps us from seeing corruptions are our illusions

675
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:12,528
that our economy is a rational system.

676
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,622
A free market, opened to all

677
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,578
The fact is that rigging markets and matches is good business

678
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,608
If the rigging is hidden from all but a few

679
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,914
In Shinto, the mirror is an important symbol

680
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:27,359
reflecting a sense of who we are

681
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,086
In that mirror, the bad heart is a hidden heart

682
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:34,101
The pure heart is the one that hides nothing

683
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,910
Looking at the numbers and accept what they tell us

684
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:40,992
is a way of wiping dust away from the mirror

685
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,200


686
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,584
Hi there boys and girls

687
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,500
this is Captain Kangaroo

688
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,759
Say, I like you to meet a friend of mine

689
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,298
say, you know it's a lot and lot of fun to have a pet

690
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,581
that you can run, jump and play with, isn't it?

691
00:47:59,582 --> 00:48:03,116
But did you know there're kids that cannot run, jump and play?

692
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,816
It's all because a thing called Polio

693
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,953
When I think of bad historical assumptions about

694
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,901
correlations and causeality, I think of Polio 100 years ago.

695
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:17,736
When it was this horrible mystery that claiming a lot of lives

696
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:20,179
And it was really scary cuz it mostly struck children.

697
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,989
And there was a strong line of resarch that suggested ice-cream

698
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,818
cause polio, that ice-cream consumption cause Polio.

699
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,933
Here comes Mr. Softy, the soft ice-cream man.

700
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,172
The reason that correlation was thought to be causal

701
00:48:41,173 --> 00:48:44,673
was that Polio spiked in the summer time

702
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:47,784
For reasons, that weren't really understood, but it did.

703
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:50,154
And ice-cream sales spiked in the summer time.

704
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:53,208
So, these researchers're seeing that whenever a lot of ice-cream are being sold,

705
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:55,066
and consumed, there was a lot more Polio.

706
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:59,455
And that was literally the beginning of ice-cream prosecution

707
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:02,176
to try to stomp out Polio. And it sounds rediculous,

708
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,072
but you see it all the time now -

709
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:07,266
people try to fight against or build up something that they're sure

710
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:09,991
that's connected to something else, but turns out it just isn't.

711
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:22,324
We have a crime problem that is not out of control

712
00:49:22,325 --> 00:49:24,272
-all over the country                  -I am pro-choice

713
00:49:25,758 --> 00:49:29,113
extremists bombed more than 30 clinics across the country

714
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:30,642
People like you allows baby ...

715
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,248
When I started studying crimes in the early 1990s,

716
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:41,234
it was rough at its peak

717
00:49:41,235 --> 00:49:43,140
the highest it's ever been in the history of United States

718
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:45,604
and all the experts expect it to go higher and higher

719
00:49:45,605 --> 00:49:46,952
The warnings are everywhere.

720
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:50,257
But then, to everyone's surprise, something happened.

721
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,864
I don't know, I guess you're right

722
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,951
Supposed it'd be better off never been born at all.

723
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:05,739
-What did you say?          -I said, "I wish I have never been born."

724
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,641
Homocide rate went up in half of the nation's cities

725
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:11,181
(Christmas, 1989)  373 homocides last year

726
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:14,433
up 65.7% over 1987

727
00:50:14,434 --> 00:50:16,342
Murder is a national problem -

728
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:18,673
up an average 11% across the country.

729
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,095
In Bucharest tonight, the post communist leader Nicolae Ceauseascu

730
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:24,769
and his wife, had been executed.

731
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,728
Pictures of the former communist dictator lying in state

732
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,330
-excuted by the firing squad       -Crime and violence are now

733
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:32,312
... the top concerns of many Americans.

734
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:34,780
You've been given a great gift George.

735
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,259
A chance to see what the world would be like without you.

736
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,172
As the 1980s drew to a close, law enforcement experts predicted

737
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,529
that the crime rate that has been preceeding decades

738
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,041
would continue to rise.

739
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,655
Would be the decade of the mega criminal

740
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,597
There was only one problem ... it didn't happen.

741
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:03,977
Across America, the crime rate is down.

742
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,502
The FBI has some good news about crime, it's down.

743
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:11,100
It's clear the numbers are dropping, what's not clear is why.

744
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,410
What's behind this dramatic change?

745
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:15,445
Primarily it's the Police, the police strategies.

746
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:18,795
We've incarcerated our criminals and thus taken out the population.

747
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:20,228
With those people, who did the crimes.

748
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:24,592
Experts and officials lined up to offer explanations for the drop in crime

749
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,432
Community police officers, better prevention

750
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:30,700
Their explanation included more innovative policing,

751
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:33,739
harsher criminal sentences, changes in the crack market,

752
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,631
increase gun control, a strong economy, more police on the streets

753
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,787
But economist Steven Levitt examined these explanations.

754
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,931
Evaluated the most popular ones.

755
00:51:44,932 --> 00:51:46,712
When you looked at the data carefully,

756
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:50,379
it's just not clear that they really have the impact people suspected.

757
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,354
By ananlyzing the reasons most often cited by those in the press,

758
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:57,131
Levitt was able to separate the more likely factors

759
00:51:57,132 --> 00:51:58,598
from the less likely ones

760
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,205
The crime drop explanation most often cited

761
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,230
was that innovative policing strategies

762
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:06,212
had been introduced to some cities.

763
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,703
NY City, for example, implementeded sweeping law enforcement changes

764
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,590
from Police Chief Willam Bratton's ComStat System

765
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:19,961
to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's crack down on small street crime

766
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,622
The reductions in crime that has been taken place in NY City

767
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:23,845
are pretty close to miraculous

768
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:27,195
NY City, had among the biggest declines in crime

769
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:28,438
of any city in the country.

770
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:30,388
So, there's an enormous amount of fan fair ...

771
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:32,833
... given to the strategies of Guliani and Bratton.

772
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:34,494
But crime felt everywhere,

773
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:37,483
it's hard to find any city in United States where crime didn't plunge.

774
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:41,759
And also, crime was down 20-30% before Gulian ever took office.

775
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,840
So, a number of things make me suspecious

776
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:45,591
that it was really the Placing Strategies.

777
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,709
The second reason most cited for the crime drop,

778
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,800
was an increase in reliance on prisons.

779
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,911
We've locked up a million more americans since the 1990s

780
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,870
There are now 2 millions americans in prison,

781
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,462
and that's got to reduce crime.

782
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,055
Levitt recognizes that in prison more people will ...

783
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,569
in short term, bring crime rate down.

784
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,780
By my estimate, about 30% of the decline in crime

785
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:13,409
can be attributed to the fact that we got very tough on crime

786
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,567
in terms of locking up criminals.

787
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,224
This is crack cocaine

788
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,842
The 3rd explanation for the crime drop, most often cited in the press,

789
00:53:22,843 --> 00:53:24,470
were changes in the crack market.

790
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:28,371
Now experets say, crack cocaine may finally be on the decline.

791
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,656
The peak of the crack epidemics came in at the late 80s and the early 90s

792
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:36,961
At that time, an enormous amount of the homocide in particular

793
00:53:36,962 --> 00:53:38,042
can be attributed to the crack.

794
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:39,389
But for various reasons

795
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,567
the amount of violence that has been associated with the crack trade

796
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:42,600
really faded.

797
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,863
That's not the move no more

798
00:53:43,864 --> 00:53:48,059
So that can explain 15% of the decline in crime.

799
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,792
Other possible reasons for the crime drop examined by Levitt include:

800
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:53,044
tougher gun laws.

801
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:57,943
the 1990s economic boom and an increase in police nation wide.

802
00:53:58,596 --> 00:54:01,480
So Levitt did not entirely discount these

803
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:03,992
He sees these only account for a small fraction

804
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:05,573
of the overall crime drop

805
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:07,741
There are millions factors that drive crime,

806
00:54:07,742 --> 00:54:10,850
but how do you determine the particular competition?

807
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,563
Overall, what Levitt found from all these reasons

808
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:18,346
was taken together, they only explain half of 1990s crime drop.

809
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,043
The other half remained a mystery.

810
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,100
So what happened?

811
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,548
Well, let's remind

812
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:29,152
to what many Americans may have seen as irrelevant incident

813
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:30,424
in a far away place.

814
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,708
When Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu

815
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:43,505
was executed by his own people on Christmas Day 1989,

816
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:46,703
it marked the end of the brutal totalitarian rein

817
00:54:46,704 --> 00:54:48,804
that has lasted 24 years.

818
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,414
In his earliest days, Ceausescu's Romania faces struggling economy

819
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,021
and he sought to vastly increase the workforce.

820
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:01,880
To achieve this, Ceausescu outlawed abortion in 1966.

821
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:04,200
Agents known as the Montrose Police

822
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,378
rounded up women to give pregnancy tests

823
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:08,074
and attacks the infertiles.

824
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,730
Across Romania, women were forced to have children

825
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:14,896
and they could no longer choose whether it was right to do so.

826
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,748
Romania's birthrate doubled.

827
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:22,733
But more and more births across the country were, not surprisingly unwanted.

828
00:55:22,734 --> 00:55:24,659
And result in trouble up bringing.

829
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,054
Of the infants forcibly born in the first year,

830
00:55:28,055 --> 00:55:31,487
more disenroll school, suffered more job performance,

831
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:33,672
and with thus more likely to become criminals,

832
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:35,426
than those born of the previous year.

833
00:55:35,427 --> 00:55:40,126
Even controlling for the aids, income, health and education of the mother

834
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,025
But what do winds in Romania a long time ago,

835
00:55:44,026 --> 00:55:47,118
have to do with crimes in US in 1990s?

836
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,224
According to Steven Levitt ... a lot.

837
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,539
You've been given a great gift George, a chance to see

838
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,587
what the world would be like without you.

839
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,607
What I believe to be true and the evidence supports it,

840
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:09,476
is a hypothesis which many people find jarring and disturbing.

841
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:12,091
But nonetheless, I think it's probably right.

842
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:16,808
Good evening, in a landmark ruling that Supreme Court today legalize abortions.

843
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:20,789
In 1973, in a case called "Roe V. Wade"

844
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:26,167
the Supreme Cort rules that abortion, which has been only legal in 5 US states,

845
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:28,220
would now be legal nation wide.

846
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,778
Precisely the opposiste of what happened in Romania,

847
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,263
The legalized abortions in 1970s,

848
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:38,313
was one of the prime reason why crime felt in the 1990s.

849
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:42,958
Because the whole generation of unwanted children were never born,

850
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,375
because of legalization of abortion.

851
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,304
If you fast-forward 20 years

852
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:49,529
to the point in time when they were going to be their peak crime ages,

853
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,229
they simply weren't there to do the crime.

854
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:55,279
You see George, you really had a wonderful life.

855
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,333
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to ... throw it away?

856
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:02,978
The trouble, of course, is that life isn't like the movies.

857
00:57:03,531 --> 00:57:06,514
For so many children who without "Roe V. Wade"

858
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:08,681
would have been born in 1973,

859
00:57:08,682 --> 00:57:11,381
their lives might not have been a wonderful life

860
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:15,731
that've been born in a loving family, in yesterday's small town America.

861
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,151
Rather, they'd be a far harder road -

862
00:57:19,152 --> 00:57:22,310
been born into a potentially unwanted household

863
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:26,010
in American's crumbling little cities, or forsaken heartland.

864
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,618
Levitt's conclusion: "As much as half of the 1990s crime drop,

865
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:34,901
was an unintended consequence of Roe V. Wade."

866
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,350
The theory behind it was quite simple,

867
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,371
Unwanted children, have been shown to be at high risk for crime.

868
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:44,607
With legalized abortion, fewer unwanted children were born.

869
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:48,417
Therefore, the theory would be that there'd be less crime in 15-20 years later.

870
00:57:48,418 --> 00:57:51,020
When those quahogs reach their peak crime ages

871
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,786
And the data support that hypothesis,quite strongly.

872
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:56,799
If you follow the data,

873
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,836
there were 5 states that legalized abortions, 3 years before "Roe Vs. Wade"

874
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:03,952
and about 15 years later, their crimes begins to fall,

875
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:05,925
3 years before the rest of the country.

876
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:10,000
Then if you look at states where abortion was not just legal,

877
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:12,771
but is available to people who wanna get them ...

878
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:15,328
... 16, 17 years after "Roe Vs. Wade"

879
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,885
you see a 30% difference

880
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:20,242
between the states doing a lot of abortions and ones that are doing very few.

881
00:58:21,117 --> 00:58:24,774
Finally, all of the effect we see in a in a diverse in crime,

882
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:27,978
all of that is concentrated among people under the age of 25.

883
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:30,535
People young enough to have been exposed to legalized abortion.

884
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:32,500
People older than 25,

885
00:58:32,503 --> 00:58:34,009
here's no difference whatsoever

886
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,355
between the high abortion state and the low abortion states.

887
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,523
And I think in some way that's the best evidence we have,

888
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:42,860
that legalized abortions is responsible for a big chunk of the decline in crime.

889
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:47,740
Levitt's controversal theory has provoked strong reactions among critics.

890
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:52,621
Is he, for example, avocating abortions as a crime fighting tool.

891
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,506
In no way, would I take this as advocacy in favor of legalized abortion.

892
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,657
I don't think anyone's opinion about whether abortion should be legal or not

893
00:59:01,658 --> 00:59:03,802
should be affected by our result.

894
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:05,769
Some of Levitt's critics suggested that

895
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,824
his theory holds what might have been classed a racial implications.

896
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,348
He argues though that raising class has nothing to do with the matter.

897
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:18,016
That his theory targets no specific group,

898
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:21,209
other than mothers-to-bes of all backgrounds.

899
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:25,488
And since, as Levitt points out, women who're led to abort

900
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:29,635
go on to become child bearers consistent
with the general populations.

901
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:32,750
Levitt's argument could thus be undertood to suggest that

902
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:35,806
legalized abortion does not so much prevent birth,

903
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,057
as delay it.

904
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:40,605
This turns an unwanted birth by a too young mother, for example

905
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:44,548
into a wanted birth by that mother
when she feels more ready.

906
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,999
So, if Levitt is not advocating abortion as a crime fighting tool,

907
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,525
what is he advocating?

908
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,514
Well, whether one is pro-life, pro-choice or somewhere in between

909
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:02,070
there's a meaningful and today unpeached connection

910
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:04,427
between giving women the right to choose

911
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:05,827
and the reduction in crime.

912
01:00:46,973 --> 01:00:49,631
We started offin a normal interview post

913
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:53,006
and now you're lying down, swinging a pillow aaround

914
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,000
What ... What's going on here?

915
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:58,259
If I give you a slice of juicy fruit,  will you say whatever I want

916
01:00:58,828 --> 01:00:59,343
No

917
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,400
No?!

918
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,282
Wait, I heard that you'll do anything for a slice of juicy fruit

919
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,924
No matter how smart you are,

920
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,834
and I kind of think they're pretty smart,

921
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,599
you come up with some incentive scheme that you think is a perfect one

922
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,877
to enties the behavior you have in mind.

923
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:17,043
And you send an army of people with nothing to do all day

924
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:18,997
but to figure out how to beat this incentive scheme

925
01:01:18,998 --> 01:01:20,861
-and absolutely it'll be beaten                             -Well, tell me about ...

926
01:01:20,862 --> 01:01:22,243
... about Amdanda

927
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,858
This is a long story

928
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:27,334
I'll give you an example, so

929
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,007
We were trying to potty train Amanda

930
01:01:30,008 --> 01:01:34,463
and my wife went books and did all the things you're told to do

931
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:35,914
Amanda had been potty trained

932
01:01:35,915 --> 01:01:38,991
and she just decided she wouldn't use the toilet ... anymore.

933
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:41,912
And this went on for months, my wife was frusttrated.

934
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:46,090
And I said, I'm an economist, I understand I'll take over.

935
01:01:46,091 --> 01:01:49,680
And I got right down on Amanda's level on my knees and I knew what ...

936
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:51,634
she likes more than anything else, she's about 3 years old, were MMs.

937
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:56,755
And I said,"If you go pee pee in the potty, I'll give you a bag of MMs."

938
01:01:57,439 --> 01:01:58,797
she said,"Right now?", I said "Yeah".

939
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,000
said,"Ok"; and she hopped on the potty went, went to the bathroom

940
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:05,228
I turned to my wife and said,"Let the economist handle it, you know."

941
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:10,261
And indeed, for the next couple of days, it worked to perfection.

942
01:02:10,262 --> 01:02:12,207
And everytime she has to go bathroom, she announced it.

943
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,815
She went to the bathroom, we gave her the MMs.

944
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,190
Everything had gone great.

945
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,676
But 3 days later, she said "I have to go to the bathroom"

946
01:02:19,046 --> 01:02:22,969
She went and took a lot of few drops, I gave her the MMs

947
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:25,699
She got off, she said "I have to go again"

948
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,203
She sat down the potty,

949
01:02:27,204 --> 01:02:29,054
taking a few more drops, I gave her the MMs.

950
01:02:29,055 --> 01:02:30,252
"Got to go again"

951
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:34,100
Basically, in 3 days she's gone from someone with no blatter control

952
01:02:34,128 --> 01:02:41,220
to a pro that she can complete control the flow at a whimp

953
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:45,141
And had a 3 year old had basically come up with

954
01:02:45,142 --> 01:02:46,999
a way to beat the incentive scheme I had developed ...

955
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,104
... within 3 days. In a million years I would never have imagined.

956
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:55,185
If an economist can't trick a 3 year old for more than 3 days,

957
01:02:55,186 --> 01:03:00,050
What hope does an economist have tricking the whole country for even 3 hours?

958
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:03,117
So, that's kind of the beauty of incentives

959
01:03:03,118 --> 01:03:06,251
You don't really know what works and government think

960
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:09,517
they know what works and they spend a huge amount of resources

961
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,343
establishing incentives

962
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:13,788
and they gonna do all these things seem to make lots of sense

963
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,879
it sounds really great and may work out well in some measure

964
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,826
But they're gonna backfire in so many different ways

965
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:21,660
That we can't predict yet.

966
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:25,393
And people will claugh and people will cry. And that's what incentives are.

967
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:35,500
CAN A 9TH GRADER BE BRIBED TO SUCCEED?

968
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,400
ITE103

969
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,000
What you guys putting in this?

970
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,500
Get it right over there, you wanna do it right now.

971
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:15,790
Right now you stupid ass.

972
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,157
Clear!

973
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:22,000
It's going

974
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:23,172
That was nothing

975
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,171
Make another one.

976
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,525
I know I can do good in school but I don't

977
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:31,227
I have a reputation of bad child

978
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:35,004
Parents are way too uptight in kids' business, like ...

979
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:37,762
Where you gonna go? What you doing? When are you coming home?

980
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,090
It maybe like "Hey you have homework?" and  I'll say "No"

981
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:46,174
or "I forget my books, I'll do it in the morning."

982
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,614
-That works?                                        -Ah huh

983
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,194
Gets them off my dick

984
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,195
What's up?

985
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,090
Hopefully, I'll mkae it to highschool if I fail

986
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:59,295
I guess I'll try to get a GED through the millitary or something

987
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,760
I have no clue

988
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:06,200
ITE104

989
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,719
In the modern economy, not graduating from highschool,

990
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,125
is like an economic death sentence.

991
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,485
When you talking about highschool kids,

992
01:05:18,486 --> 01:05:20,270
what matters to them is what happens today,

993
01:05:20,271 --> 01:05:22,663
a month from now or 6 months from now.

994
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:26,509
You have a very forward looking mindset

995
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,273
I think ... most kids are dull

996
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:34,219
In designing incentives to help kids get through school,

997
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,472
we've got to have that conundrum in mind

998
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:44,097
The idea was for the University of Chicago to see if

999
01:05:44,098 --> 01:05:47,961
students could increase their test scores

1000
01:05:47,962 --> 01:05:52,711
simply by giving them a financial ... incentive.

1001
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:59,460
If it works for 1 student, then it's good enough for me because

1002
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:02,196
we have no stake in it financially.

1003
01:06:02,197 --> 01:06:05,671
The University of Chicago is picking up the tab.

1004
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:09,577
Why wouldn't we at least try it?

1005
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:13,564
I'm thinking, it's going to work.

1006
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:19,327
Opportunity - you'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

1007
01:06:20,128 --> 01:06:22,452
And, that's my message to the students.

1008
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:25,161
I don't need to put my degrees up on the wall,

1009
01:06:25,162 --> 01:06:26,955
I already have those.

1010
01:06:26,956 --> 01:06:28,430
I want them to get those.

1011
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,914
How has it been starting a new school?

1012
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,685
It's actually not that bad, I like it here

1013
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:44,135
-Yea?       -It's really easy       -Oh the classes are really easy?      -Oh, yea

1014
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:47,993
Let's see, pull out your report card and see how you're doing right now.

1015
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:50,038
-So, we can see your grades                    -Yea, not that good

1016
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,358
Alright, so what do you need to improve on?

1017
01:06:52,733 --> 01:06:53,428
Everything

1018
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,778
Ok, but you know I'm seeing grades go up a lot so ...

1019
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,836
... so you'd probaly wanna know what to get right, if you ...

1020
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:02,000
do meet the monthly achievement standards?!

1021
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:04,216
-Sure                       -Ok, so open up your folder

1022
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,353
Fifty bucks?

1023
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:10,824
Yea, you get the $50 every month as long as you keep your grades up

1024
01:07:10,825 --> 01:07:11,241
Alright

1025
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,608
I think a lot of people here are gonna do their homeworks then

1026
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:17,568
-Yea, what about you, why you?           -$50 can buy a lot ...ah

1027
01:07:18,332 --> 01:07:21,911
-It can buy                     -You know, it can pay for my skateboards

1028
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,560
So then I could get sponsored, get free clothse and stuffs.

1029
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:28,955
Till I graduate

1030
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,168
-How's school today, ok?                    -Amazing                     -Good

1031
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,969
Kevin came home from school and says, "Mom ..."

1032
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,304
" ... if I do really good, I can get paid for it."

1033
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,558
Mom, I could really make money.

1034
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,635
I'm like, "Fine, Kevin, go for it."

1035
01:07:58,636 --> 01:08:01,782
I said, "And I'll tell you what, you keep your grades up ..."

1036
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:07,572
"you're gonna get the money, .... mom will double it."

1037
01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:11,488
Whatever they give you, mom will match it.

1038
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:13,359
-Alright                     -Then you'll have double the money.

1039
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,500
-If the grades go up                     -Right

1040
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,175
A little bit of bribery? What parent doesn't do that?!

1041
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,386
We all bribed our kids one way or another

1042
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,072
-One, two, three, four,five           -Bribery works for my kids

1043
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,433
They love to be bribed

1044
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:32,400
-Eight, nine, ten

1045
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:35,285
For 50 cents, I can buy whatever I want in my household

1046
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,635
Oh I forgot this dollar

1047
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,838
The closest thing to figurig out habbits is that incentives matter

1048
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,118
Not just financial incentives but social incentives and moral incentives.

1049
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:48,886
Our goal was to figure out:

1050
01:08:48,887 --> 01:08:54,012
Can we cheaply and quickly move the needle at a school?

1051
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:57,659
Can we get kids to achieve more as quickly as possible

1052
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,260
with spending very little money.

1053
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,396
There are 900 freshmen in our experiment,

1054
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:11,991
At the end of every month, we hold a payout event

1055
01:09:11,992 --> 01:09:15,894
where all kids who got all Cs or above receive $50 in cash.

1056
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,868
In addition, those who quality are also elegible for lottery,

1057
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,969
where they can win $500.

1058
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,955
To win the money,

1059
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:30,102
They have to have no more than 1 unexcused absence

1060
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:32,171
No all day suspensions

1061
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,300
And all your grades at the end of the month have to be a C or higher

1062
01:09:37,777 --> 01:09:39,933
It's great to give them this financial reward,

1063
01:09:39,934 --> 01:09:42,650
but it's also about having a lot of fanfair around it

1064
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:48,105
Giving them this big checque, sending them home in a Hummer limo.

1065
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,812
You think, there's definitely a limo effect.

1066
01:09:58,801 --> 01:09:59,999
That is so cool

1067
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,409
Are you serious?! They got to ride in it?!

1068
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,369
Aw, that is so awsome!

1069
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:12,720
Oh My God! This is awsome!

1070
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,438
Oh yes, yes, you're getting straight As from me.

1071
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:18,501
Yes!

1072
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,884
There's lot of things I'd do for money I mean

1073
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:23,095
I work all year round

1074
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,220
Hi, I'm a representative of ....

1075
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,646
we charge $3 for a walkway and $5 for a driveway

1076
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:30,117
would you like to hire us for our services today?

1077
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,642
Hook, line, and sinker

1078
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,989
They say money doesn't buy happiness,

1079
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,950
and I agree but I disagree.

1080
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,155
Depends how you look at it,

1081
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:39,668
Because when they say money cannot buy happiness,

1082
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,174
they're saying materials things cannot make a person happy.

1083
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:43,408
Wanna bet?

1084
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:53,780
Okay, BPL083, unfortunate that person did not meet the standards this month

1085
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:55,898
we cannot give them the money.

1086
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,446
You know what you need to do next month, right?

1087
01:10:57,447 --> 01:11:01,350
-Yea   -So you think you'll be meeting the standards next month?  -Oh yea

1088
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,866
-Alright            -I took a look into the limo thing and I was like ...

1089
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:05,630
Oh, you've seen the limosine outside?

1090
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,121
It was awsome!

1091
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:11,909
The lights, the way it was layed out ...

1092
01:11:13,323 --> 01:11:17,381
Take us home, Jekins ... it's gonna be so cool!

1093
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:20,877
These are my halls! These are my halls!

1094
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:22,951
Cuz I'm a King that's my last name.

1095
01:11:22,952 --> 01:11:24,584
The King~

1096
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,996
-5 or 7 of prime, so that's ...                     -Write it!

1097
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:35,583
-Show your work

1098
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,266
-5, you can't break down 5 because it is a prime number

1099
01:11:38,267 --> 01:11:41,175
Show your work ... I need you to ... do

1100
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:45,270
-I'm gonna do 7 through 12                     -No, I said 1 through 6

1101
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:48,000
You don't get to pick

1102
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:52,316
It's really important for me for him to finish school,

1103
01:11:52,317 --> 01:11:53,785
because I didn't.

1104
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,063
He's very intelligent, he needs to focus.

1105
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,382
They got to find something to get these kids

1106
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:03,799
into going to school and get their grades up.

1107
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:15,089
Hello?

1108
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:20,043
Hi, my name is Eliah, I'm calling on behalf of the Chicago High School

1109
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,561
Is Guela Lupaia available?

1110
01:12:21,562 --> 01:12:22,562
Is Hector available?

1111
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:23,563
Is Mark available?

1112
01:12:23,564 --> 01:12:25,360
This is a message for Jessica Richardson,

1113
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:28,854
wanted to congratulate her on meeting
the monthly achievement this month

1114
01:12:28,855 --> 01:12:31,771
so she's eligible to win $500

1115
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:36,000
And also, just let you know to have her keep an eye on her
math and biology grades

1116
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,542
cuz they're on a C right now.

1117
01:12:39,374 --> 01:12:42,390
Hi, this is Sally Sladoth from the University of Chicago,

1118
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:43,485
Is Kevin Muncy there?

1119
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:46,017
Hi this is Kevin

1120
01:12:46,018 --> 01:12:47,816
Hi Kevin, I'm looking at your grades,

1121
01:12:47,817 --> 01:12:49,328
and it looks like you need to bring some of them up,

1122
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,703
are you doing something to work on bringing up your grades?

1123
01:12:51,704 --> 01:12:57,342
I'm not gonna lie, I haven't done every assignment, so far

1124
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,235
So are you going to your teachers and

1125
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:01,673
ask if you can make up the missing assignments?

1126
01:13:01,674 --> 01:13:04,362
Ah yeah, they're actually making a list for me right now.

1127
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,210
-That's great, so you gonna try to make those up                        -Yea

1128
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:09,514
Cuz the thing is if you can trun in missing assignments,

1129
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,751
you can bring up the grade a lot.

1130
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:14,019
because you go from having no credit for the assignment,

1131
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,962
to getting some credit or even a lot of credit

1132
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:20,005
-that'll make your grades bounce up a lot.                               -Yea

1133
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,314
-So, you going to get the $50 for this month?

1134
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,602
-Are you gonna be doing your best?                      -Yea

1135
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:30,687
Alright, that's what I like to hear

1136
01:13:30,688 --> 01:13:33,704
-Alright, take care, have a good day.      -Alright, you too, bye.      -Bye

1137
01:13:36,615 --> 01:13:38,800
Huh, what? what? what? what?

1138
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,638
Go duct tape him.

1139
01:13:47,277 --> 01:13:50,925
Little drawing over here, chromosomal #21, down syndrome are clear

1140
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,180
So, if you have normal splitting,

1141
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:55,278
this is what happens, we're making sperm here ....

1142
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,886
-Mr. Garshorn, can you Tyler come help me?             -Sure

1143
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:11,774
You just wanna copy Lindsey's?

1144
01:14:13,642 --> 01:14:14,870
No, just tell her to come back here.

1145
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,632
Lindsey

1146
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,264
Do you have that?

1147
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,444
Congratulations, you met the standards

1148
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:46,752
Congratulations, you get the $50 this month.

1149
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,976
-Unfortunately, you didn't meet the standards this month          -Great

1150
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,327
It's just on the grey category, you need to bring up these ...

1151
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,896
grades to ... to be passing

1152
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,118
So, let's take a look here ... Algebra you're passing that's good

1153
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:07,781
So, what's going on in Biology and World History?

1154
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:09,254
Are you missing assignments?

1155
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,605
His history teacher said he should be in his honor class

1156
01:15:12,606 --> 01:15:15,756
but the simple fact that he's not doing the work,
that's why he's not there.

1157
01:15:15,757 --> 01:15:16,703
Have to do the work.

1158
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,237
The trouble between me and my mom is mostly about homework.

1159
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:25,289
Because, the way it is with her she's always "When I was in school, ... "

1160
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,887
... we have homework everyday."

1161
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:30,470
And I'm trying to get her to understand it's 21st century.

1162
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:31,960
That was then and it is now.

1163
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:38,536
Teachers are now more lenient, and no offence, care less ...

1164
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,388
Ok, so what do we have?

1165
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:45,330
I think the results are great this month,

1166
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:47,392
where you see the control at 28,

1167
01:15:47,393 --> 01:15:50,410
then all the treatment at 36-38

1168
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,850
So, that seems great to me, you know ...

1169
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:55,745
When you go from 28-37,

1170
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:57,668
-Right           -I mean you're talking about ...

1171
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,919
... close to a 30% increase right?

1172
01:16:00,271 --> 01:16:03,282
So, seems like we are taking all the D kids to C

1173
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:05,242
-and we're not doing anything for the E kids                -Right

1174
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,884
The question is the kids moved from D to C this year,

1175
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:10,016
are they gonna have a better life?

1176
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:13,634
-Right  -I don't think we've the answer to that, overtime we'll find out ...

1177
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,653
But I've definitely been surprised by how important ...

1178
01:16:16,654 --> 01:16:18,522
... how well the parents groups are doing that ...

1179
01:16:18,523 --> 01:16:21,174
... parents still make a difference in 9th grades it looks like.

1180
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,683
Mom, I took a quiz on this book

1181
01:16:24,684 --> 01:16:27,718
the Maken TerryBerry book, I took a quiz on that

1182
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:28,498
Did you read the book?

1183
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:29,369
I read the book

1184
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:30,465
Did you?

1185
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:33,434
I read the book, I read the book, I read the book but I ...

1186
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:34,808
-Did you READ the book?           -Yes!

1187
01:16:34,809 --> 01:16:37,387
Cuz we have to search and read to find the answers

1188
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:39,110
we have to read the book to find the answers

1189
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:40,795
So, stop

1190
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,374
Did you read the book or you just skim over the book?

1191
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,222
... to find the answer to the question that you were looking for?

1192
01:16:47,498 --> 01:16:49,200
Because, there's a difference

1193
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:51,529
We read it as a class, but when we took the test ...

1194
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,841
he gives out the page and we have to look for the answers.

1195
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,156
Did you read the book without the class?

1196
01:16:56,157 --> 01:17:00,597
Did you read the book from cover to cover?

1197
01:17:01,087 --> 01:17:03,295
-Not from cover to cover                      -So, you didn't read the book

1198
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:05,053
-We have ...           -You didn't read the book!

1199
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:08,375
-We didn't ...          -You didn't read the book

1200
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:10,719
You didn't read the book from cover to cover,

1201
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,785
outside of class, with no help, no instructions from your teacher

1202
01:17:14,786 --> 01:17:17,210
along with your classmate, you didn't read the book

1203
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:18,733
that's why you failed the test.

1204
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:37,450
Look, I made a tattoo gun out of toothbrush

1205
01:17:37,451 --> 01:17:39,678
and I was giving myself a tattoo in class

1206
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,004
-You have a tattoo?                 -I'm giving it to myself

1207
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:44,558
I only did like a little bit

1208
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:45,982
I got to do it a lot better

1209
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,080
I can't let them see cuz I'll get into trouble, but ...

1210
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,421
I made it out of toothbrush, and then just turn it on

1211
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:54,771
I made it out of guitar string

1212
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,701
I don't think I'll take money for giving up my social life

1213
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,866
I wanna be the class clown

1214
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I'm doing better cuz I went up 6% to ... almost a D

1215
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,346
He always likes to be the class clown,

1216
01:18:26,347 --> 01:18:30,240
always likes get the laughing; impressing everybody around him

1217
01:18:30,241 --> 01:18:32,319
That could be his incentive

1218
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,958
But you'd think that ...

1219
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:37,297
to impress everybody around you, your grade will be with that too.

1220
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:42,362
He's got something in the mail that showed the list of all his grades

1221
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:43,255
E,E,E,E,E ...

1222
01:18:43,256 --> 01:18:46,500
and I said, oh he's enjoying 9th grade he's doing it again, so ...

1223
01:18:46,585 --> 01:18:48,870
Now what I need to do, is ...

1224
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:51,983
... whenever he asks me for money now, he's not gonna get it.

1225
01:18:51,984 --> 01:18:53,148
End of story.

1226
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:56,290
Yea. when the skateboard running out of wheels or getting bad ...

1227
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:59,975
Well then, just grinding them down, or hit the books or soemthing

1228
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,021
Urail, what does it mean to say a genotype is homozygous

1229
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,064
-When all the "aline" are the same          -When all of the Alios are the same

1230
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,309
This is my last chance to win $500

1231
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:40,214
I'm at the line, I'm splitting ... splitting a hair.

1232
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,639
My brain's been going up and down. There's always something that'd distract me.

1233
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,835
You know what I mean?!

1234
01:19:50,836 --> 01:19:54,945
What's distracting me was ... trying to be cool ...

1235
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:58,208
... trying to keep up with the Johnsons basically.

1236
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,600
ITE103

1237
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,132
Congratulations, you made the standard achivement for the last month.

1238
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,130
So, here's your report card and the bracelet.

1239
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:28,018
Here's the front and here's the back.

1240
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:30,609
Congratulations

1241
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,579
Great grades.

1242
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,273
If I fail, I'm done, I'm dropping out.

1243
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:07,336
Army, marines, coast guard, go to Iraq or something like that. I've no clue.

1244
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:25,000
-Urail King     -Yes!

1245
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,550
Take us home, Jekins

1246
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,928
What are the final results are like?

1247
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:52,349
Our program is getting 35-50% more students to pass 9th grade.

1248
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,523
5-7% boost in 9th grade passing rates.

1249
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:57,987
We sure expect a lot higher rates than that.

1250
01:21:58,815 --> 01:22:00,926
We hope for a lot higher rates than that.

1251
01:22:00,927 --> 01:22:04,354
If we give them $50k ... to pass the 9th grade ...

1252
01:22:05,395 --> 01:22:07,029
what share do you think would pass?

1253
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:09,923
Would we move 10% of the kids? 20% of the kids?

1254
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:11,397
All of them?

1255
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,569
I don't know

1256
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:17,365
I think we need to, attack the problem at a ... much younger age ...

1257
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:21,024
the dollar will be better spent during the earlier years

1258
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,925
So what are we going to do next year?

1259
01:22:23,926 --> 01:22:26,254
What about preschool, did they find a preschool yet?

1260
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:30,160
Yea, we've got a few perschools lined up and they seem excited.

1261
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:32,304
So, we're talking about preschoolers ...

1262
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:35,025
are we talking about taking parenting out of the hands of parents?

1263
01:22:35,026 --> 01:22:37,636
Or teaching the parents how to parent? Or both?

1264
01:22:37,637 --> 01:22:39,134
It's a little bit of both.

1265
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,248
That could be fun.

1266
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,971
The way I see it, learning is like a virus.

1267
01:22:47,972 --> 01:22:51,494
a virus that most adolesents don't want to catch ...

1268
01:22:51,495 --> 01:22:52,939
... until later on in life.

1269
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,100
Next year, I'm gonna be a sophomore.

1270
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,888
I'm gonna tell you, I'm doing great and I'm getting As and Bs.

1271
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,345
Next year when I'm gonna be a sophomore.

1272
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:09,291
If not As and Bs then straight Bs ... or Bs and Cs.

1273
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,874
Hey, that's difficult, that's not as easy as it looks.

1274
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,094
I can promise you milk and cookies, but if ...

1275
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,173
... the oven is broken then you just gonna get milk.

1276
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,530
ITE104

1277
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,670
Our incentives, unlike everyone else's, are to be honest ...

1278
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:38,710
If we build our reputation on, we're honest about this issue, and other issues ....

1279
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:41,618
... then people will believe us about everything.

1280
01:23:41,619 --> 01:23:44,843
The worst thing we could do, the only way we can ruin our reputation ...

1281
01:23:44,844 --> 01:23:46,897
... is by starting to take sides and fights.

1282
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:53,958
This peculiar beast, which actually has the right incentives, you just seek the truth.

1283
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:55,961
And not have an agenda.

1284
01:23:56,349 --> 01:23:59,203
So, I don't think, anything we've ever written or thought is gonna save ...

1285
01:23:59,204 --> 01:24:03,187
any lives really, or ... make people better or smarter anyway. But ...

1286
01:24:03,188 --> 01:24:07,656
... we kind of give people permission to challenge conventional wisdom sometimes ...

1287
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,146
And ask a different kind of questions entirely ...

1288
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:14,601
and a lot of times the sort of questions you ask his children,

1289
01:24:14,602 --> 01:24:17,823
and ah, people kind of chuckle at you.

1290
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:19,756
But once in a while, they turn out to be rather good.

1291
01:24:19,757 --> 01:24:25,578
The problem is, as you get older, you ask them as adults in a meeting or friends,

1292
01:24:25,579 --> 01:24:29,061
they'll laugh at you hard and you stop entirely.

1293
01:24:29,062 --> 01:24:31,132
And we just kind of keep doing it.

1294
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:34,800
We kind of say, what if this thing everybody think is so really isn't.

1295
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,179
What if that didn't cause this, what if this cause it?

1296
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:42,421
I think that's just need to be a lot more permission for people to think like that

1297
01:24:45,358 --> 01:24:46,856
Total bs, was't it?

1298
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,000
