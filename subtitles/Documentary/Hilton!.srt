13
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:43,521
We worked harder because we built Egypt.

14
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:47,984
That time is over. The big
task is now complete.

15
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:53,239
Today, we are asked to
take care of our children.

16
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:58,703
From the highest levels of the government,
education has become a priority.

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,042
But ordinary Egyptians are unable
to provide for their children,

18
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:09,631
the values, education and
perspective required.

19
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:13,343
Can we truly educate our children?
I say no.

20
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,034
Where were you, you moron?

21
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,912
The satellite dish repair
guy made me wait 3 hours.

22
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,497
You had to wait for him?

23
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,542
I didn't wait out the whole day, I swear.

24
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,087
These big companies, you can't trust them.

25
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:52,048
Saleh, I didn't ask you to free Jerusalem.

26
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,759
You had to just open the door.

27
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,177
OK sir.

28
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,555
OK? What does that mean, OK?

29
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,725
My cousin can fix that for you.

30
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:06,104
Get a genie out of a lamp if
you must, but get it done.

31
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,189
Be careful.

32
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,409
Takes long to load.

33
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:23,746
Look, Chief.

34
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,457
Here you put your interests.

35
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:30,253
You like to read, write, play football...

36
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,380
Write it here.

37
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,801
And here you put your pictures.

38
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,595
Photos taken by you

39
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,265
or that of your friends posted on Facebook.

40
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,269
And here you have your friends.

41
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,772
All these are my friends.

42
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,109
Full of strangers, especially girls.

43
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,486
Look at this one.

44
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,031
I will meet her.

45
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,950
She looks like a pink baby elephant!

46
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,117
I know.

47
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,455
She just liked my picture.

48
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:06,722
What?

49
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,725
She put a "Like".

50
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:11,836
We "Like" pictures of our
friends and they "Like" ours.

51
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,380
That means she likes my picture.

52
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:18,092
Come on, Casanova, back to work.

53
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,900
What did you talk to Mr.Kammal about?

54
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:35,860
That you're welcome.

55
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,655
And you could come any day.

56
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,239
Lets go with that.

57
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,254
Good evening, Chef.

58
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,925
We sell nothing anymore. Mr.Walid
allowed the Chinese to sell.

59
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:02,261
Don't tell us about your life.
Where's our share?

60
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:06,849
Business is bad.
Listen. I want my money.

61
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,351
I'll tell the boss.

62
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:29,288
Do you work with the Chinese?
Mr.Kammal agreed prior.

63
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,374
Did you transact behind my back?

64
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,250
Never, Chief.

65
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
Go.

66
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,548
Chief? Chief?

67
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,466
A word? A word.

68
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,012
They don't respect us anymore.

69
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:34,520
Now here's our Supreme Commander,

70
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,192
President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak.

71
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,446
Thank you.
MkvCage.com

72
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,997
I congratulate the Police for
capturing the terrorists

73
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:57,001
who perpetrated the attack on Alexandria.

74
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:11,933
As we prepare to celebrate Police Day,

75
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,062
Egypt suffers yet another terrorist attack.

76
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:21,901
You just heard the Minister
of the Interior...

77
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,109
I sacrificed everything for you!
You promised me!

78
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,572
Bastard!

79
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,365
Get out!

80
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,618
Go away! Bastard!

81
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,081
Yes, sir.

82
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,960
Very well, sir.

83
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,878
Good bye, sir.

84
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,592
Captain?

85
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,886
I was observing the aggression.

86
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,054
The Prosecutor.

87
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,310
What brings you here?

88
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,687
Mr.Kammal called me.

89
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,440
Where are the forensics?

90
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,358
They are still asleep.

91
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,987
But... does he have confidence in you?

92
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,825
Who covered her face?

93
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,971
It's a professional job.

94
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:22,016
It's a crime of passion.

95
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,520
A girl so beautiful, it's
inevitably passionate.

96
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,689
I have seen it elsewhere.

97
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,274
It looks like a singer.

98
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,027
If you aim to be a great detective!

99
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,322
File this and get me some coffee.

100
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,662
Someone ordered some mango and...

101
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,206
Yeah, over here.

102
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,167
Give it to me.

103
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,087
Bill this on the room.

104
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,172
Thank you. Leave us.

105
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,592
What do you want? I'm hungry.

106
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,845
I will not feed you. Fend for yourself.
Get out!

107
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,305
Yes, sir. Yes...

108
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:16,637
Salaam alekum. Walekum salaam.

109
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,531
Hello, Mr.Kammal.

110
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,574
How are you? Fine, sir.

111
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,451
How are you, nephew?

112
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,870
And your father?

113
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,497
He's okay. Thank you for asking.

114
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,833
Do you have a lead?

115
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,336
The killer is a professional.

116
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,923
Trend with tweezers on this case.

117
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,135
According to my sources, this
is a very delicate case.

118
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,222
As you know, some of the her clients...

119
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,142
No I don't know. Who paid for the room?

120
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,690
This is a special type of booking.

121
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,152
Only the owner knows who paid.

122
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,695
The owner?

123
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,405
Mr.Shafiq.

124
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,747
Take this, sir.

125
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,301
A modest compliment from the hotel.

126
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,147
Who discovered the body?

127
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,982
The cleaning maid.

128
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,817
Bring her here.

129
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,778
We let her go early today.

130
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,154
Her name?

131
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,658
Salwa. We don't have her last name.

132
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,203
She is Sudanese and paid daily.

133
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,746
And her address?

134
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:53,709
In Arba Wa Nuss district. We
don't have the exact address.

135
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,876
You kidding?

136
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,126
Get the head of the neighborhood.

137
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,293
Clinton!

138
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,006
Get over here. Your papers?

139
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,092
Your papers!

140
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,562
You are the head of the neighborhood?

141
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,728
Yes.

142
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:58,983
We are looking for a certain
Salwa who works at the Hilton.

143
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,276
You know her?

144
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,027
Yes.

145
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,947
Bring her and we will return your papers.

146
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,740
I need it.

147
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,577
Enter your hole and close it.

148
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,587
I'm learning German.

149
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,589
Very ambitious.

150
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,426
Are you aiming for the biggest
fool's tag in the force?

151
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,219
I'm already there.

152
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,083
Hello?

153
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,477
Hi, brother. Where are you?

154
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,104
What's up?

155
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,274
You have to take care of dad. I'm tired.

156
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,150
I can't.

157
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,235
Scramble to then.

158
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,362
Is that a request or an order?

159
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,823
I have to leave. Until when?

160
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,576
Until my return. You kidding?

161
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,531
Dad, I received money. We
could go to the hospital.

162
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:34,244
For pity's sake, don't say
you "received" money.

163
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,458
Be honest and admit, you "stole" money.

164
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,585
As you wish.

165
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,005
Dignity can't be bought, my son.

166
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,559
Goodbye.

167
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,706
Do you have Lalena CDs?

168
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,583
"Your love is not enough".

169
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,396
This is an illegal copy.

170
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,071
You have reached Club Solitaire.

171
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,491
If you are a dancer or a singer,

172
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,619
please send us a full body picture to us.

173
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:42,289
For any other services, please
leave your name and number.

174
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,879
* O you, lonely traveler *

175
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,802
* O you, lonely traveler *

176
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,680
* Who passes in front of me *

177
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,060
* Why are you leaving me? *

178
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,062
* Why do you leave me *

179
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,816
* Alone with my regrets? *

180
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:14,738
* You went away without a word *

181
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:27,100
* My heart has already told you *

182
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,209
* Goodbye *

183
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,790
Salaam walekum. Walekum salaam.

184
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,692
We have a house.
We have a house.

185
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,529
He has a dog. He has a dog.

186
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,992
She has a cat. She has a cat.

187
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,413
James has a parrot.
James has a parrot.

188
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,043
It has a floor. It has a floor.

189
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,308
"We are building the future of Cairo".

190
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,172
We had a complaint.

191
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:42,302
Money was stolen from a room.
Did you know anything?

192
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,448
Have you ever ironed shirts?

193
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,663
What's this?

194
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,873
Students who protested?

195
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:16,712
They distributed leaflets at
the college to incite a revolution.

196
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,798
Three days after the
Tunisian President fled...

197
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,341
What do you think?

198
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,883
We are barely floating,

199
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,013
and you let the Chinese flood the market?

200
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,515
Very patriotic. Kiss my ass!

201
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,975
We're struggling here.

202
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,061
Momo and I, we kill ourselves
to control everything.

203
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,731
If you don't like it,
we could switch areas.

204
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,357
Calm down, gentlemen.

205
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,027
You're not the only one here.

206
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:40,986
Exactly.

207
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,529
Did we jump you?

208
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,743
I want to see sharing again,
but believe me, you will lose.

209
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,704
It's me who decides what to share.

210
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,873
Is that clear? Of course.

211
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,541
Mr.Kammal... Is that clear?

212
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,544
And you, move over.

213
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:02,507
If you don't report, we'll have
to re-assess the situation.

214
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,013
Even at the brothel, Tunisia
beats us to football.

215
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,347
It's a shame.

216
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,975
Forget the Hilton.

217
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,811
The Prosecutor labeled it "a suicide".

218
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,104
Sorry?

219
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,855
A suicide?

220
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,900
She slit herself?

221
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,319
Congratulations.

222
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:40,003
Don't loiter. You don't
buy, you don't read.

223
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,800
I can't read, I look at the pictures.

224
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,471
Give me something for the laundry.

225
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,141
And some chocolate.

226
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,234
Hello. Did Majok call?

227
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,193
No.

228
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,905
Here's the chocolate you like.

229
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,367
Can anyone read Arabic?

230
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,120
Clinton.

231
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,999
And apart from this asshole?
Little Mohammed.

232
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:28,718
Shafiq Holding Group.

233
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,348
Hatem Shafiq, CEO of Shafiq Holding,

234
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:39,479
leader in construction and
in the cement industry.

235
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,858
We are building the future of Cairo...

236
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,702
Which one of you is Hamada Mansour?

237
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,078
They took him away.

238
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,295
Who wants to overthrow the President?

239
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,506
Do you want to say anything?

240
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,134
I'm getting impatient.

241
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,554
I want to get back to the game.

242
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,097
Go on.

243
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,600
You going to spit out his name?

244
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,937
What's his name?

245
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,730
His name.

246
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,535
We are starting a major
movement of reconstruction.

247
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,205
This is the first collaboration

248
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,249
between public and private sectors.

249
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,461
The level of competitiveness
achieved by Egypt

250
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,630
on the international market

251
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:51,551
gives us the means to invest
in our infrastructure

252
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,471
at the level of road networks,

253
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:59,059
communications, agriculture and water...

254
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:43,330
This will be the largest
International School in Egypt.

255
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,089
I guarantee you,

256
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,718
in a few days, you will
be proud of the results.

257
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,693
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

258
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,279
I have a question, if you allow me.

259
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,449
Did you know this woman?

260
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,415
Absolutely not.

261
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,712
May I ask you to look again?

262
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,925
Are you sure you've never seen her?

263
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,676
Remind me your name?

264
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,763
Commander Noureddine Mostafa.

265
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,264
Noureddine.

266
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:50,522
The Police are supposed protect
honest people, not harass them.

267
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,112
Is the car ready? Yes, sir.

268
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,820
Why were the Police looking for you?

269
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:21,988
I don't know.

270
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,323
You don't know?

271
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,159
I'm taking you back home.

272
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,493
Stop!

273
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,914
Someone got murdered at the hotel.

274
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,373
A woman.

275
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,084
I saw the murderer.

276
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,962
I will show you.

277
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,095
This is the man I saw.

278
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:55,647
I told him, $10,000 for a pilgrimage?
That's insane!

279
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,734
Are you trying to pull my chain, Egyptian?

280
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:05,114
He said, "It's cheap to find a
pure soul like that of a baby".

281
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,079
It was worth it and I prayed for him.

282
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,246
God looks over you.

283
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,042
We'll take leave, Chief.

284
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,711
Stay back, Nour, I want to talk to you.

285
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,297
What?

286
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,509
You went to see Hatem Shafiq?

287
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,431
He is related to the murdered singer.

288
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,685
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

289
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,354
Didn't I tell you to let it go?

290
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,897
Yes.

291
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,777
Nour, you are my nephew,

292
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:46,489
but a simple call from these people and
I can't do anything for you.

293
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,533
He is a friend of the President's son.

294
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,162
Look after yourself.

295
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:16,019
Shafiq has agreed to see me.

296
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:24,944
But... it could be a trap.

297
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,157
I will demand for $1 million.

298
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,242
$1 million?

299
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,501
That's way too much. Salwa...

300
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,589
Demand $100,000, keep it small...

301
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,092
If someone gets killed, that would be me.

302
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,095
Don't you trust me?

303
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,642
I trust people.

304
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,395
We will have to share the money three-ways.

305
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,108
Okay.

306
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:07,778
No problem.

307
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:11,783
We don't have internet.

308
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,701
I just want Facebook.

309
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,453
That needs the internet.

310
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,581
The internet is on Facebook?
No, the opposite.

311
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:21,834
What are you confusing me for?
Are you kidding me?

312
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
No sir.

313
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:28,132
Where are you going? Put me
on that fucking Facebook.

314
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,134
I'm looking into it.

315
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,434
Gina, the Tunisian singer,
is waiting for you.

316
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,602
Calm down.

317
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,152
Good evening. Good evening.

318
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,785
My friend is gone.

319
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,621
I don't know where she is.

320
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,875
She was to meet someone at the Nile Hilton.

321
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,669
Since then, she is missing.

322
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,012
What's her name?

323
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:16,514
Lalena.

324
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,149
The singer?

325
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,906
Who was she meeting?

326
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,325
A friend.

327
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,291
You know something?

328
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,086
Your friend has been killed.

329
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,558
She had pictures.

330
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,562
Intimate photos.

331
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,317
I don't want anyone to see them.

332
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,208
How much do you want?

333
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,669
We don't have any photos.

334
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:38,471
$20,000... is all I have.

335
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,894
A lady like you should not be here.

336
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:49,941
Your name and address, please.

337
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,334
We are done here. Show's over.

338
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,920
Sir.

339
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:11,921
Saleh.

340
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,632
Fadl repaired the satellite
dish, it works like new.

341
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:15,508
Finally!

342
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,178
Strange enough, it picks-up
only Italian channels.

343
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:21,806
What?

344
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,850
There will be only Italian channels.

345
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,518
Italian... is good.

346
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,562
Is that your cousin? Yes.

347
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,234
Hello?

348
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,906
Who is this?

349
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,992
Commander Noureddine? Yes.

350
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:27,556
Sir.

351
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,185
Where is the men's?

352
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:06,262
Open it.

353
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,019
I was with her that night.

354
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,160
He kept the negatives.

355
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,332
He will frame me for murder if I don't pay.

356
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,049
He considered himself her owner.

357
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:47,636
His agent, Nagui the Tunisian.

358
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,395
You are a member of the Parliament.
You benefit from immunity.

359
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,273
Not against the scandal.

360
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,196
The case was closed.

361
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,201
I will re-open the investigation.

362
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,996
What do you expect of me?

363
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:23,130
When you came to question me,
I could've broken you, finished you.

364
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,676
I never asked anyone for help,

365
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,639
but I need your now.

366
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,683
I loved her.

367
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,312
And she loved me.

368
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:42,024
She wanted me to leave my wife.

369
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,570
She was going to get the negatives.

370
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,540
How did you know her?

371
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,667
From the Club Solitaire.

372
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,382
Wearing gold is forbidden for men.

373
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:11,345
It is said, on the Day of
Judgment, gold becomes hot iron.

374
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,308
But for some, gold is worth the punishment.

375
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,148
Where's the negatives, Amir?

376
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,491
A policeman took them.

377
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,786
A policeman?

378
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,372
Calm down, Nagui.

379
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,624
I'm telling you the truth.

380
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,058
I believe you, Amir.

381
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,776
Love one another, live in harmony.

382
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:14,283
You will all enter Paradise.

383
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:23,125
Each one of you here,
have a duty to realize

384
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,752
and dedicate your life to it.

385
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,212
Even to yourself,

386
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,924
without the entire Muslim brethren,

387
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,011
I swear by God that if you
live for these duties...

388
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,852
I pay 180 pounds a day to rent the car.

389
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:44,855
Give them to me and I
will install the meter.

390
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,526
These rotten people who
govern us, tax us to death

391
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,862
and they get treated abroad.

392
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:55,366
We can't even afford cigarettes.

393
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:58,911
But for a gentleman like you...

394
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:08,462
Did you see what they did to
the young man in Alexandria?

395
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:13,550
Those cop fuckers beat him to death.
Did you know?

396
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,136
Son of a bitch!

397
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:25,771
The smart guys on the
Internet published photos.

398
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,607
There will be a demonstration
on January 25th.

399
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,193
On Police Day, to rub it in.

400
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,155
We will show those pigs what
the people think of them.

401
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,325
I'm going there.

402
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,661
And you, will you go?

403
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:41,828
There's no choice.

404
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,915
I'm part of the pigs.

405
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:52,673
The people of Alexandria are
all assholes and myths.

406
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,677
This young man was surely a drug addict.
Otherwise, it's impossible.

407
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,472
They wouldn't have hit him for no reason.

408
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,187
Inspection. Open up.

409
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:08,688
Welcome.

410
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:11,692
Hi beauty.

411
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,465
Look who's here?

412
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:37,259
You're okay?

413
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:38,510
What an honor!

414
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:41,513
What's up?
It's okay, as you can see.

415
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:45,559
I'm going to sell this shack.
They can put up a mosque.

416
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:50,022
Do you know what makes
me happy, Noureddine?

417
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,276
Tell me, do you know a certain Nagui?

418
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:56,862
Mac? No, the artistic agent.

419
00:44:57,905 --> 00:44:59,239
Artistic?

420
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:05,204
He has two girls working who
think they are artists.

421
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,624
They pickup VIPs and he takes pictures.

422
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,585
Clic-clac, he snaps. Clic-clac, he snaps.

423
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,671
It's his business. He uses an old camera

424
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,674
and he makes it more troublesome
with the negatives.

425
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,301
Where can I find him?

426
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,929
He has a club, the club... I forget what.

427
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:24,807
The Solitaire Club? That's it.

428
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:27,017
You see, you know everything.

429
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,770
What do you want of him?
I want to sing.

430
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,944
Is there any way to get a drink?
You are at home. C'mon, let's go.

431
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,113
Don't worry, I'll pay.

432
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,210
Congratulations, Chief.

433
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:56,213
Bravo! Congratulations.

434
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,090
Congratulations.

435
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,137
Goodbye.

436
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:05,013
What is that?

437
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,974
Congratulations, Colonel.

438
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,225
Colonel?

439
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,353
Go ahead, try it.

440
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,580
You are a genius and I'm an idiot.

441
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,027
What did you get on Shafiq?

442
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:23,031
The singer was his mistress
and he fears a scandal.

443
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:26,201
He says it was her agent who killed her.

444
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,620
Of course it's him.

445
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:31,623
The Prosecutor will re-open
the investigation,

446
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,543
he will be released for 100,000 pounds.

447
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,963
We will share the rest. Easy money.

448
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,176
You can buy a Peugeot to
replace your metal cage.

449
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,342
God willing.

450
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,221
I'm really proud of you.

451
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:50,184
Thanks to you, we deal directly with VIPs.

452
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,770
Soon you will be in this chair.

453
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:00,985
What did you ask?

454
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,742
He's OK for $1 million.

455
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,204
You are crazy? What if he followed you?

456
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,831
I told you to ask for 100,000.

457
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:16,043
You will have to share that with us.
Understand?

458
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,015
Good evening. Welcome, sir.

459
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:24,611
* O you, lonely traveler *

460
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,991
* O you, lonely traveler *

461
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,038
* Who passes in front of me *

462
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:40,085
* Why are you leaving me? *

463
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:43,589
* Why do you leave me? *

464
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,842
* Alone with my regrets? *

465
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,432
* You went away *

466
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:58,520
* Without a word *

467
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,609
* My heart has already bid you farewell *

468
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,029
* You went away *

469
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:12,034
* Without a word *

470
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:21,001
* My heart has already bid you farewell *

471
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:25,297
* My eyes speak to you *

472
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,300
* Talk to you with tears *

473
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,136
* My eyes speak to you *

474
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,473
* Talk to you with tears *

475
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:40,103
* O you, lonely traveler *

476
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:45,025
* Who passes in front of me *

477
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:49,071
* Why do you leave me *

478
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,824
* Why do you leave me *

479
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:56,495
* Alone with my regrets? *

480
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,682
Commander, what brings you here?

481
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,685
Colonel. I was promoted.

482
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:25,732
Your voice is superb.

483
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,528
I don't drink.

484
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:37,786
Come meet my friends. Hmm?

485
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,204
No. No.

486
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,332
Mido!

487
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,459
You were wonderful.

488
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:45,669
Thank you.

489
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,422
Let me introduce you,
my friend, Noureddine.

490
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:51,049
You are one lucky fella.

491
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,427
What do you do?

492
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:55,220
Well...

493
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,055
He's into ceramic wares.

494
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:00,308
He is the largest manufacturer
in the Middle East.

495
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,811
Noureddine Sanitary ware,
didn't he tell you anything?

496
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:08,358
You must have pissed in it, some day.

497
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:14,990
Tell them about the golden toilets
you made for the President.

498
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:20,203
My darling, we avoid revealing
the privacy of our customers.

499
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:38,824
Do you like the view?

500
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,371
I work tomorrow.

501
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,049
Did Lalena tell you about her affair
with a very influential man?

502
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,720
She said she was in love.

503
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,688
Do you know Nagui the Tunisian?

504
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:12,983
Come in.

505
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,615
Go wait for me upstairs.

506
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,800
We suspect a certain Nagui,

507
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,802
Nagui the Tunisian,

508
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:29,596
who might've killed your friend.

509
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:43,485
What do you want from me?

510
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,280
Do you want to put me in danger?

511
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:49,616
Are you in danger?

512
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:53,745
No.

513
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,623
I don't know him.

514
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:14,682
Tell me, why did you leave your country?

515
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:20,396
I wanted to chase my dreams.

516
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,402
I'm an artist.

517
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,699
But people who have money

518
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,037
want to buy and lock me in a golden cage.

519
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:42,252
Even if you have the
key, you can't run away.

520
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,094
And you?

521
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:57,600
Your thing, is it the money or...?

522
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:11,156
Can I see you again?

523
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,333
Realize.

524
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:25,587
Realize?

525
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:31,843
Realize.

526
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:34,596
Okay. Realize.

527
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,266
Realize.

528
00:58:58,286 --> 00:58:59,746
Do you know the time?

529
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,341
Salwa!

530
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:14,594
Salwa!

531
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:16,804
The Police are here for you.

532
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,265
Salwa, come here.

533
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:28,399
Hold on.

534
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,118
I'll say you're not here.

535
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,134
Get moving! Hurry up.

536
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:44,595
What's going on, Ali?

537
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,515
Reinforcements are being
sent to Arba Wa Nuss.

538
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:50,351
Apparently, a Policeman
killed two Sudanese.

539
01:02:50,518 --> 01:02:53,938
The neighborhood Chief and a girl.

540
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,399
You kidding?
It's good, we manage.

541
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:04,824
Yes, Nour?

542
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:07,201
The maid was killed.

543
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,579
From the Hilton. Are you sure?

544
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,123
It's my fault.

545
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:16,169
Don't worry. Do you want
me to take care of it?

546
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,420
It's not worth it.

547
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,088
I know where to find Nagui.

548
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,645
Call Ms.Gina.

549
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,230
She's not here.

550
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,275
I'm telling you to call her!

551
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:56,459
He's my bodyguard.

552
01:04:05,468 --> 01:04:06,511
Nagui, get out of there!

553
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,305
Get out or I shoot!

554
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,064
Nagui!

555
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,075
Noureddine?

556
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,496
Calm down, Noureddine. You are angry?

557
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:03,664
Move.

558
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:05,958
Gently.

559
01:08:18,722 --> 01:08:21,056
Salaam Alekum Shut your mouth.

560
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:24,351
Who are you, asshole?

561
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,481
Colonel Noureddine Mostafa.

562
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,398
Colonel?

563
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:30,565
Yes.

564
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:31,859
What Police station?

565
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,236
Qasr Al-Nil.

566
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:37,615
Qasr Al-Nil between my two's!

567
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,366
You're not in Qasr Al-Nil.

568
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:45,956
This man is accused of murder.

569
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:50,294
With all due respect, Colonel,
I'm the one here who decides

570
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:52,254
who is guilty or and who is not?

571
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:54,590
Well said, Mr.Khalil. Well said.

572
01:08:55,674 --> 01:09:00,721
You, stay where you are.
You shit of a junkie.

573
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,100
Why do you let this fag hit me?

574
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,311
Shut your mouth. Do we know each other?

575
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:09,355
Have we met before?

576
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,107
My apologies, Colonel.

577
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,162
That's not fair, Mr.Khalil.
I pay you more than that.

578
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,749
Son of a bitch. You take me corrupt?

579
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,835
Never, Mr.Khalil, ever.

580
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,589
Do you have a lawyer?

581
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:42,680
Kill me, let's finish it.

582
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,474
I swear I will not denounce you.

583
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,268
As you wish.

584
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:49,562
Empty your pockets.

585
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:17,171
This too.

586
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:27,057
I have nothing more.

587
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,991
Did he want a lawyer?
He refused.

588
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,915
This is not an hour to interrogate people.

589
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,083
I didn't even have breakfast.

590
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:55,044
Shafiq's photos.

591
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:58,339
You don't have them?

592
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,258
Lalena stole them from you, right?

593
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:04,803
Mr.Policeman did his job well!

594
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:08,641
Do you think you're doing
a real investigation?

595
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:11,393
Watch your tongue or I cut it out.

596
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:15,606
Where were you the night of the murder?

597
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:18,442
With Gina. Can she confirm this?

598
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,986
If she lives again.

599
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:27,576
You are suspected in Lalena's murder.

600
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,081
You will be in custody for 15 days.

601
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:42,215
Momo!

602
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,257
What?

603
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:47,388
Watch him, but be careful. He's a snake.

604
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:48,554
Where are you going?

605
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:30,431
Where's he? I don't know.

606
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,683
Where's he? I don't know.

607
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:36,520
Wake up.

608
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:43,569
Stand.

609
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:57,958
Very well, sir.

610
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,045
I will talk to the personnel department.

611
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,505
Can I have his file?

612
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:04,965
Where's Momo?

613
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:08,969
State Security wants to see you.
What do you have?

614
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:10,678
Nagui is dead.

615
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,932
Don't worry, it's not a problem.

616
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:16,894
Tell me what you are going
to say to State Security.

617
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:20,689
There's nothing to say.
You will go in uniform.

618
01:13:20,856 --> 01:13:21,857
Is that all?

619
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:25,986
If they sniff the money,
they will want their share.

620
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:29,323
I'll hide the Mercedes at my cousin's.

621
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:35,079
I couldn't do anything about it.
I was ordered.

622
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:36,622
Listen to me, Chief.

623
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:38,791
You take me for a clown?

624
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,086
I should've never trusted you!

625
01:14:00,521 --> 01:14:01,521
Colonel Noureddine.

626
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:04,900
State Security summoned me.

627
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,027
What can I do?

628
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,577
Where's Gina? Be careful.

629
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:17,621
Where's she? Keep it down.

630
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:20,373
Nagui is dead.

631
01:14:25,754 --> 01:14:27,548
Did he have the photos?

632
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:29,675
No.

633
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,057
You are a good man.

634
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:39,726
You are doing a good job.

635
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,562
Sit.

636
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:32,738
Your name appeared in our files.

637
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,950
Do you know that singer Gina?

638
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:38,117
No.

639
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:41,496
We found her dead 2 hours ago.

640
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,626
Sowed and thrown on a pile of garbage.

641
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:16,031
Is Kammal Mostafa your uncle?

642
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,533
We have our suspicions about him.

643
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,036
Have you noticed anything lately?

644
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:22,203
No.

645
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:31,004
Two Sudanese were killed.

646
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:36,927
One worked at the Hilton and
witnessed the murder there.

647
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:39,429
You met her?

648
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,932
I searched for her, without success.

649
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:45,185
What is your relationship
with Hatem Shafiq?

650
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:47,020
Nothing.

651
01:16:51,066 --> 01:16:53,235
Mr.Shafiq is a member of the Parliament.

652
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:56,655
Any investigation involving
him is our responsibility.

653
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,329
Dismissed.

654
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:50,625
Welcome, Sir.

655
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:51,792
By the way,

656
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,047
the technician came by and
the dish is working fine.

657
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:59,259
You have all Europe, God forgive
me, with the naughty girls.

658
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:00,969
Noureddine!

659
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:10,771
Saleh!

660
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:14,649
Wake up!

661
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:16,193
Saleh!

662
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:51,937
Hey, you!

663
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:53,605
Where are you going?

664
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:54,981
Move, bitch.

665
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:05,117
Stop!

666
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:06,952
What is this?

667
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:09,663
I can't take them into custody.

668
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:13,250
By whose order? There's
a bus to Sudan outside.

669
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,752
This place, here is for Egyptians only.

670
01:19:15,919 --> 01:19:18,213
I will have to report
this to the Brigadier.

671
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:19,423
So be it.

672
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:24,761
Sir, I saw what happened at the Hilton.

673
01:19:30,517 --> 01:19:32,686
Let these kids out and clear up.

674
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:33,937
Momo! Yes?

675
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:36,231
We have the Hilton's maid.

676
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:38,150
Call the Prosecutor.

677
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,901
Okay.

678
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,200
There's no answer.

679
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,368
Be persistent.

680
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:50,162
Yes, sir.

681
01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:51,955
I'll try again.

682
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,799
I have something important to show you.

683
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:04,259
At your service.

684
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:15,437
Ali?

685
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:17,397
We are in operation mode.

686
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:36,249
You. Come.

687
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,376
Don't be afraid.

688
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,550
I have Salwa, the maid from the hotel.

689
01:20:47,344 --> 01:20:49,262
With me, in the car.

690
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:53,266
Youssef put her in a
cell, but I got her out.

691
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:10,742
She was arrested in Tahrir Square.

692
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:13,203
And you bring her to me in a Police car?

693
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,705
She is the only witness. I thought...

694
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:19,876
You tell Mr.Kammal that I
ordered you to release her.

695
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:23,046
And tell him that Shafiq
is trying to kill me.

696
01:21:23,213 --> 01:21:25,215
Speak only to Mr.Kammal.

697
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:30,929
Salwa.

698
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:34,808
Don't be afraid.

699
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:36,935
Come with me.

700
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:57,163
You are tired?

701
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,002
You are hungry?

702
01:22:57,807 --> 01:22:59,976
You know that I love you like a brother.

703
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:04,397
So?

704
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,775
Do you want to say something?

705
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:46,898
What did you see exactly?

706
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,117
I saw Shafiq come out of the room.

707
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:00,870
He put his watch back on.

708
01:24:02,706 --> 01:24:06,751
I heard a woman in the room, who said:

709
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,212
You promised me.

710
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,299
He took the elevator and left.

711
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:16,761
I went back to work.

712
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:22,100
A little later, I heard screams.

713
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:27,522
Another man came out of the room.

714
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:33,069
How long was that after Shafiq left?

715
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,113
Not long.

716
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:40,535
I was in the hall next door.

717
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:56,676
He is the same man who came to Clinton.

718
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,640
Shafiq thinks you are dead.

719
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,769
He is after me now.

720
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:44,516
Why are you here, officer?

721
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:47,644
I'm here to see Mr.Shafiq.
And it's Colonel Noureddine.

722
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:49,479
Mr.Shafiq is playing golf.

723
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,064
Tell him it's urgent.

724
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:55,777
I'm sorry, sir. You need an invitation.

725
01:25:55,944 --> 01:25:57,904
Does he want to see her?
That's my invitation.

726
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:10,685
Sorry to disturb you.

727
01:27:11,436 --> 01:27:13,271
Can we talk in private?

728
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,524
We are at the 11th hole. Can it wait?

729
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:18,151
Unfortunately no.

730
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:29,245
Lalena had the receipt for the
photos when she was killed.

731
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,205
I have the photos.

732
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:33,082
And the negatives.

733
01:27:34,626 --> 01:27:35,960
And a witness.

734
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:55,939
Excuse me, gentlemen.

735
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:07,033
I thought you were clever.

736
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,745
In reality, you are an idiot.

737
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,873
A fucking idiot.

738
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:16,668
Do you believe in Utopia?

739
01:28:18,169 --> 01:28:20,129
Justice does not exist here.

740
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:26,427
What is this? What are you doing?

741
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:28,179
Come, Mr.Shafiq.

742
01:28:28,972 --> 01:28:31,516
No. I want my lawyer.

743
01:28:31,683 --> 01:28:33,518
Sit in my office.

744
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,311
My lawyer, I said.

745
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:40,066
They are in force. We are double barreled.

746
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:50,076
Have you been treated well, Mr.Shafiq?

747
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,665
You are guilty of kidnapping a Deputy.

748
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:58,876
Calm down. My nephew has made a mistake,

749
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:01,462
we can talk like civilized people.

750
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:05,216
Who is the Prosecutor?
Me, sir. Hello.

751
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,594
Do you realize the
magnitude of your mistake?

752
01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:18,479
Yes, sir?

753
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:22,107
Yes, sir?

754
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:26,069
Yes, sir.

755
01:29:27,155 --> 01:29:28,614
Very well, sir.

756
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:31,159
Very well, sir.

757
01:29:31,743 --> 01:29:33,036
Good bye, sir.

758
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:34,996
Goodbye.

759
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:45,298
The Attorney General has ordered
the arrest of Hatem Shafiq

760
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,676
for the murder of Lalena at the hotel.

761
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:59,520
Send my wife and children to Dubai.

762
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:00,730
Very well, sir.

763
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:03,483
Keep all the documents safe.

764
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:09,447
You saw me?

765
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,618
You know I didn't kill her.

766
01:30:14,786 --> 01:30:16,204
You know it, right?

767
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:19,207
I loved her.

768
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:51,322
Your room is over there.

769
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:04,627
She your wife?

770
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:06,712
She is beautiful.

771
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,174
Where's she?

772
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:14,512
Killed in a car crash.

773
01:31:42,373 --> 01:31:44,667
Shafiq didn't kill that woman.

774
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:47,753
He said he loved her.

775
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,384
What's that?

776
01:31:57,555 --> 01:31:58,806
Stamps.

777
01:32:03,186 --> 01:32:04,729
Stamps for what?

778
01:32:04,896 --> 01:32:06,647
To empty my head.

779
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:05,498
Qasr Al-Nil, are you receiving me?

780
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:06,707
Yes, sir.

781
01:33:06,874 --> 01:33:09,585
Order from the Ministry: Open fire.

782
01:33:10,544 --> 01:33:11,671
Received.

783
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:13,673
We have the orders.

784
01:33:13,881 --> 01:33:15,341
Open fire.

785
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:16,592
On who?

786
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:18,135
On them, Youssef!

787
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:19,804
Execute.

788
01:33:34,235 --> 01:33:35,403
Kammal! Kammal!

789
01:34:05,016 --> 01:34:07,518
Tahrir Square, Cairo,

790
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:11,647
the number of protesters
is estimated to be 10,000.

791
01:34:11,814 --> 01:34:14,191
Stone throwers targeted

792
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:17,361
the security forces in Qasr Al-Aini street,

793
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:19,447
adjacent to Tahrir Square.

794
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:25,411
Some isolated rioters
attacked public facilities.

795
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:28,539
Mr.Kammal!

796
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,000
I'm waiting for you.

797
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:33,586
No, Youssef, go for it!

798
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:35,296
What?

799
01:34:35,463 --> 01:34:39,467
Power to the people! Down
with the military regime!

800
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:45,931
From what was stated by the
Commander-in-Chief Of Army,

801
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:50,311
a curfew is imminent.

802
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:55,149
What is the situation on the street?

803
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:57,905
The urgency for the citizens, right now,

804
01:34:57,995 --> 01:35:04,325
is to ensure their needs
with bread, fruit and water.

805
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:10,748
The ordinary citizen puts his wife and
children before thinking anything.

806
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:13,000
Good. We are live...

807
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:14,876
Uncle?

808
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,297
The situation seems to have calmed down...

809
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:20,256
Uncle?

810
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:26,222
The populace complies with the orders
of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army,

811
01:35:26,389 --> 01:35:29,308
President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak.

812
01:35:29,475 --> 01:35:36,607
Curfew will take effect from 6:00 PM
following the incident...

813
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,256
Is there anyone?

814
01:36:02,508 --> 01:36:03,508
Is there anyone?

815
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:04,718
Hey!

816
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:06,137
Coming. Coming.

817
01:36:10,516 --> 01:36:12,309
Three packs of Cleopatra.

818
01:36:14,103 --> 01:36:15,103
There.

819
01:36:44,842 --> 01:36:45,843
Salwa!

820
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:00,649
Where are you going?

821
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:03,068
You are the only one who knows the truth!

822
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:08,199
The man you just shot,
did you see him before?

823
01:37:09,283 --> 01:37:10,451
At the Hilton?

824
01:37:28,344 --> 01:37:29,428
Here.

825
01:37:33,766 --> 01:37:34,934
Go away.

826
01:37:35,518 --> 01:37:38,437
Leave this country. You
have no future here.

827
01:37:49,782 --> 01:37:52,243
Police! Go back. Inside!

828
01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:02,336
State Security.

829
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:27,528
Uncle? Uncle?

830
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:30,488
Where are you?

831
01:39:31,925 --> 01:39:33,344
Where's Mr.Kammal?

832
01:39:34,553 --> 01:39:35,721
Mr.Kammal!

833
01:39:37,056 --> 01:39:38,265
Goodbye.

834
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:43,478
Let's go.

835
01:39:55,783 --> 01:39:57,868
You let him go? You let him go?

836
01:39:58,285 --> 01:39:59,995
We have our money, right?

837
01:40:00,162 --> 01:40:02,081
We don't have the proof that he killed her.

838
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:05,250
No. He just fell in love with a bad girl.

839
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,127
That's good, we have the money.

840
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:30,484
Why did you let him go?

841
01:40:34,363 --> 01:40:35,155
Why?

842
01:40:35,322 --> 01:40:38,742
Relax a bit. It's over, we have our money.

843
01:40:41,537 --> 01:40:44,581
I have a corpse in my car. The murderer.

844
01:40:45,082 --> 01:40:47,000
He is an officer of State Security.

845
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:09,416
In a day or two, this mess will be over.

846
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:14,338
The President will involve the
army, and who will he want?

847
01:42:14,505 --> 01:42:15,964
Us!

848
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:20,093
Are you involved in the murder of Lalena?

849
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:24,306
Bloody heartburn. I need to eat.

850
01:42:25,349 --> 01:42:26,767
You killed her?

851
01:42:26,934 --> 01:42:29,853
What are you talking about? Of course not.

852
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:34,608
I knew about the Nagui business.

853
01:42:35,442 --> 01:42:37,361
I knew what he was doing.

854
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:41,240
He trapped businessmen with his girls.

855
01:42:41,824 --> 01:42:45,410
I got a percentage. Made me a lot of money.

856
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:49,665
But with the photos of
Shafiq, it got complicated.

857
01:42:50,374 --> 01:42:52,668
State Security contacted me.

858
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:56,505
I thought we had gone too far.

859
01:42:57,464 --> 01:43:00,801
Except that they actually
wanted their piece of the pie.

860
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:04,263
They made a real carnage.

861
01:43:05,556 --> 01:43:08,475
Poor little girl. She died for nothing.

862
01:43:10,686 --> 01:43:13,480
That's life. May she rest in peace.

863
01:43:14,064 --> 01:43:15,440
What do you want to do there?

864
01:43:26,785 --> 01:43:31,248
We are always live to
describe the situation

865
01:43:31,415 --> 01:43:35,752
in the streets of Cairo, and
especially in the city center...

866
01:43:36,003 --> 01:43:37,087
Nur...

867
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:38,922
Are you not OK?

868
01:43:40,215 --> 01:43:41,592
What did you have?

869
01:43:44,303 --> 01:43:45,971
Don't feel good?

870
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:49,016
You killed Gina too.

871
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:00,694
Get out of the bad mood.

872
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,018
Have you gone mad?

873
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:17,104
Do you want to kill me?

874
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:19,815
I treated you like a son.

875
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:23,026
Shame on you!

876
01:45:23,944 --> 01:45:26,113
Very good. Do you want to kill me?

877
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:28,490
Kill me, sir.

878
01:45:28,657 --> 01:45:29,657
Kill me!

879
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,034
He has a revolver!

880
01:45:58,186 --> 01:45:59,186
Stop!

881
01:46:00,814 --> 01:46:03,233
That's enough! We are not like them!

882
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,579
Freedom! Freedom!
