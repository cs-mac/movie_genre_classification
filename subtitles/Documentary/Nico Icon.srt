1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,544
I was born in Palermo, Sicily.

2
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:35,731
We came to this country when I was seven.
We immigrated to Chicago.

3
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:40,072
We were always raised to be very patriotic,
to love our country.

4
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:40,708
And we did.

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,723
When I was a little boy,
my father took me to a baseball game.

6
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:49,065
They had a martial arts demonstration
and I saw this old Japanese man...

7
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,960
...doing things that I thought
were magical...

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,055
...and I developed a crazy dream
to go to the Far East.

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,392
By the time I was 1 7, I was there,
studying with the masters.

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:02:49,616
In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.

11
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:54,722
While I was there, there was a crazy,
drunk guy named Nelson Fox.

12
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:56,482
He recruited me into the CIA.

13
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,911
I was 22 at the time.

14
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:01,579
My eyes were about to be opened.

15
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:39,986
My friends, let me make one thing clear:

16
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,016
This is a nation of laws.

17
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,198
And as Abraham Lincoln had said:

18
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,568
""No one is above the law,
no one is below the law. ""

19
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,869
And we"re going to enforce the law!

20
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,824
And Americans should remember that,
if we are to have law and order!

21
00:03:52,824 --> 00:05:07,249
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

22
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,120
These assholes are Agency?

23
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,628
We all get paid by the ClA.

24
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,711
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

25
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:41,138
Don't die on me, you sucker!

26
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:42,268
What the hell's wrong?

27
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:47,016
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

28
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:51,231
Doc, he's dead.

29
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,289
Get him the fuck out of here.

30
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,539
-Move it. Let's go.
-Come on!

31
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:02,335
-Get him out.
-Get him out of here.

32
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:14,002
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

33
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:15,434
l'm not scared.

34
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:18,326
You speak English.

35
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:19,671
How nice.

36
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,227
Where's the load, Colonel?

37
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:34,197
l'm gonna teach you never...

38
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,299
...never to fuck with my opium.

39
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,859
Oh, boy.

40
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,240
He's a hard one, Doc.

41
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,880
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

42
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,664
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

43
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:51,488
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

44
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:54,587
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

45
00:06:54,587 --> 00:07:01,224
Who the fuck is this cherry?

46
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:04,976
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

47
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,926
Just back off, partner.

48
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:17,812
l'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

49
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:22,807
Then l'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

50
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,009
Cute, huh?

51
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,581
Shut up, Nico.

52
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:29,887
Look, l can make you disappear.

53
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:34,994
Grab his leg.

54
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:38,092
-What the hell are you doing, man?
-Nico!

55
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:46,172
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

56
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:49,374
Get out!

57
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:56,920
Get back to the LZ.

58
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,038
lf l don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

59
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,799
l'll call a chopper in for us. l'll cover this.

60
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,856
Just get the hell out of here!

61
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:06,014
Come on, move!

62
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,360
Bring him back here!

63
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,124
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

64
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:16,728
Go, Nico!

65
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:23,015
Nelson, l'm through. l'm finished!

66
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:36,267
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

67
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:37,629
Giuliano Nicola.

68
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,695
Giuliano...

69
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:43,196
...you have become a new creation.

70
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:45,888
With the help of your family and friends...

71
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:48,883
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

72
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:51,415
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

73
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:56,427
-Come on. You always make me late.
-l'm the boss. You have to drive me!

74
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:59,422
l'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

75
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,715
...and l invite your parents to do the same.

76
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:07,930
ln the name of the Father, the Son...

77
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,661
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

78
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,557
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

79
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:22,573
That's beautiful.

80
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:39,596
-l know you're the boss but--
-That's right. Remember that.

81
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,339
Hi, guys.

82
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,003
Hey, how are you?

83
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:45,384
You guys look so good!

84
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,626
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

85
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:52,258
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

86
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,460
Parts of you, anyway.

87
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,422
You see this cop?

88
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:58,310
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

89
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,619
Look at that! Look at that!

90
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,339
-This is the partner?
-This is the partner.

91
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,373
l got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

92
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:07,810
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

93
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:10,128
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

94
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:14,342
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

95
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:20,908
l told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

96
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:23,305
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

97
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,749
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

98
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,170
Look at those stiff dicks.

99
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,126
A free meal and they come out like flies.

100
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:33,913
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

101
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,183
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

102
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:43,521
Rosa, l'm so worried. So worried.

103
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:50,996
-What's wrong?
-Nico!

104
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:53,903
lsn't today a day you should be happy?

105
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,535
-What's wrong?
-lt's Lucia. She's gone again.

106
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:00,570
-ls it that boy?
-SÌ, Nico.

107
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:07,558
l have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

108
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:08,512
SÌ.

109
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:10,845
l'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe l can do something.

110
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,852
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

111
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:20,820
Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.

112
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,540
We're up and clear. You got that?

113
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,145
Delores, Toscani told me he"ll watch
over you and take care of you real good...

114
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,362
...your last week on the street.

115
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,616
Never had a friend who was a DA before.

116
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:37,452
l'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

117
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,315
-Here?
-Yeah.

118
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:49,643
She's fine, ain't she?

119
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:55,300
Excuse me, l just had to stop and tell you...

120
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,542
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

121
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:02,190
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

122
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,639
You ain't got to be--

123
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:09,072
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

124
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,673
But you have a nice day, just the same.

125
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:18,330
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

126
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,715
l know this one.

127
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:24,870
You seen this girl?

128
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,099
l ain't seen shit.

129
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,122
You haven't seen this girl?

130
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:34,133
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

131
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:38,323
-You seen this girl?
-You know l quit messing with that stuff.

132
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,617
-l ain't into this shit anymore.
-What are you into?

133
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,990
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

134
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,881
-l paid your boy off Monday night.
-My boys, huh?

135
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,804
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

136
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:53,903
l thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

137
00:12:53,904 --> 00:13:02,390
Say, man, you seen this girl?

138
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,735
l seen the top of her head.

139
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:10,822
That's good.

140
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:22,055
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

141
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:27,194
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

142
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:28,594
He's a fucking ltalian puke!

143
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:32,243
Freeze, motherfucker!

144
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:37,660
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

145
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:52,555
All right. Who else wants some?

146
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:53,804
You're destroying the image of my place.

147
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,807
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

148
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:57,921
Get over here!

149
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,900
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

150
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,918
Listen. l know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

151
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,436
-Yeah? She's upstairs?
-2-C. l swear, man. lt's 2-C.

152
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:16,954
This isn't what it looks like.

153
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:19,454
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

154
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,230
l didn't know they had all of this.

155
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,192
Get out of here.

156
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,699
You having a good time?

157
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,202
Pretty good time.

158
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:32,851
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

159
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,104
You wanna get high?

160
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,469
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

161
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,242
Stop. You playing the cop, l'm tired of it.

162
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,863
l'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

163
00:14:46,863 --> 00:14:50,654
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. lt's in the mattress.

164
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,278
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

165
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,281
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

166
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,387
Stop it.

167
00:14:56,387 --> 00:15:00,537
l'm tired of you. You shut up!

168
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,759
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

169
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,837
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

170
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,976
ln my business!

171
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:11,481
ls this your school stuff?

172
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:16,444
lt's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

173
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:18,028
Come on. We're going home.

174
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,019
No, you go home. l'm tired.

175
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,946
l'll give you something, something big.

176
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,080
Oh, yeah?

177
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,406
This is huge, my man.
lt's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

178
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:31,664
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

179
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,463
This is square, on my mother's soul.

180
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:36,027
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

181
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:41,644
l heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

182
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:42,806
-What lawyer?
-l don't know.

183
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,111
What do you mean you don't know?

184
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:49,290
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

185
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,934
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

186
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,387
...or l'll come back and tear your heart out.
Let's go.

187
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,920
Who are you?

188
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,787
Get back!

189
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:00,932
l own this place!

190
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:04,063
l own this joint.

191
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,364
There's a guy upstairs.
l want to get him arrested!

192
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:12,661
-That's the motherfucker right there!
-These two guys are under arrest.

193
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:15,223
lt's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

194
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:19,653
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

195
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,675
l'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

196
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:24,048
l don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

197
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:57,306
Jax, l hate these cocaine lawyers.

198
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,461
And this shitty weather.

199
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:05,296
They're gonna have me serving time.

200
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:09,120
l wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

201
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,713
Except against us.

202
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:14,998
l don't care how
l have to get at these guys--

203
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,280
Let me reiterate.

204
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,574
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

205
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,656
Hang on, hang on.

206
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:25,034
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

207
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:29,160
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

208
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,469
Fulton Meat Market.

209
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:34,870
An engine block?

210
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:43,126
Clever, clever, guys.

211
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:55,063
l'd like an '86 Lincoln...

212
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:58,512
...lllinois 354-DOG-67, please.

213
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:05,819
Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
a Salvadoran national with quite a record.

214
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,463
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

215
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,056
Dream on, baby.

216
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,831
l want to tell you, what l turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

217
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:17,767
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

218
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,526
...with that imagination you got.

219
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:20,688
You're right.

220
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:29,509
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

221
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,966
Chi Chi, how you doing?

222
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:43,851
-l do not like this place.
-You do not like this place?

223
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:46,934
No, l don't want to go into this place.
You know l hate places like this.

224
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,714
-What don't you like about it?
-The element!

225
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:52,310
You know something, darling?

226
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,699
l really think that you should lighten up,
because...

227
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,602
...we're gonna party.

228
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:07,145
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

229
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:14,459
-Two for dinner?
-Just drinks.

230
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:26,875
Good work.

231
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,097
l don't believe it.

232
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:33,709
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. l promise.

233
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,805
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

234
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:44,434
l don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

235
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:52,944
That is beautiful.

236
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:56,106
Excuse me.

237
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,236
l love it.

238
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,342
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

239
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:04,875
lf this happened a week from Tuesday,
l could read about it in the paper.

240
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,006
Relax. lt'll make you famous.

241
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,550
Just what l need, to be famous.

242
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:23,169
Can you believe this?

243
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:31,209
Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
in the back alley.

244
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:38,229
We got it down pretty good.

245
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:40,180
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

246
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,613
Sealed off pretty good.

247
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,803
Three of our best guys.
l handpicked each one.

248
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,288
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

249
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,079
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

250
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,264
l can tell how much you love it here.

251
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,654
God! Now l know why l'm a vegetarian.

252
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:56,116
You eat meat. l know you eat meat.

253
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,280
-l'm gonna throw up.
-l've heard you eat meat.

254
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:03,898
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

255
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:07,562
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

256
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,337
Definitely the Feds.

257
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:14,763
Frank, it"s fucking infested down here.
What are you trying to do to us?

258
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,033
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

259
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,461
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

260
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:22,432
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

261
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,674
l don't believe this.

262
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:29,259
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

263
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:35,984
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

264
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:44,749
l think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

265
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:46,007
lt's going down, boys. Let's go.

266
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:49,408
Keep your heads up.

267
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,685
Woman, let's do it.

268
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:58,817
The cars are going around the corner.

269
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:09,375
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

270
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:22,508
What do you think?

271
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,332
Looks good.

272
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:27,343
Let's get on with it.

273
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:43,536
-What the fuck are you assholes doing?
-Feds!

274
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:44,945
Shit! They jumped too soon!

275
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:50,068
What the fuck is this?

276
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,245
Freeze! Police!

277
00:22:51,245 --> 00:23:04,060
Get back!

278
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:29,634
Nico, the Lincoln!

279
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:40,177
Nico!

280
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:57,805
Chi Chi!

281
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,812
Nico!

282
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:00,487
Nico!

283
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:03,171
Fucking animal!

284
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:05,529
Get rid of him!

285
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,241
l'm out! Do him!

286
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:18,580
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

287
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:25,321
Where do l go? What do l do?

288
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:27,168
Hit those hooks over there!

289
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:50,136
What do l do?

290
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:53,362
Stop the fucking car!

291
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:57,250
Stop the fucking car!

292
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:12,407
Hands up! Out of the car!

293
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:21,061
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

294
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,573
Nico, you okay?

295
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:26,086
-Wait till you hear about--
-Shut the fuck up!

296
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:28,723
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

297
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,024
-Come on!
-Gotta get this garbage out of here.

298
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:35,836
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

299
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:42,322
Let's go.

300
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:46,273
What do we got here?

301
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:51,348
What kind of high is this?

302
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:54,749
Sky-high.

303
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,776
Military explosives.

304
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:02,923
C-4, my man.

305
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:12,039
Hey, Boss...

306
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,002
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBl.

307
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:16,817
Ain't that something?

308
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,195
-Your name again?
-Agent Neeley, Chicago office.

309
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:25,645
The arresting officer, Toscani.
What does he do?

310
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:29,492
-He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
-Hold on a minute--

311
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:31,045
l'll tell you what this cop is.

312
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:33,720
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

313
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,410
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

314
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,818
lt should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

315
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:43,342
l don't know who's running
this outfit here...

316
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:47,134
...but l'll tell you one thing:
somebody better get his wires straight.

317
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:50,376
You don't know who you're dealing with.

318
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:54,893
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

319
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:58,271
-The director does not want a problem.
-There won't be one.

320
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:59,791
And I don"t want any problems.

321
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,921
l understand.

322
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:04,091
Just listen.
They are to be released immediately.

323
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,452
You can count on it.

324
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:07,323
Avoid all contacts.

325
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:09,401
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

326
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:17,396
You're free to go.

327
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:21,592
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

328
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:40,854
Good work. l loved the face of that
FBl guy when the call came through.

329
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:42,367
Salvano.

330
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:49,163
l don't want any more problems.

331
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:52,230
l don't enjoy babysitting.

332
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,735
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

333
00:27:57,735 --> 00:28:00,300
l promise you, Mr. Zagon.

334
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:11,894
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

335
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,459
l just want to get a few things
straightened out.

336
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,155
A few minutes ago, l received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

337
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:22,832
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

338
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:27,253
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

339
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:28,502
What kind of bullshit is that?

340
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:32,996
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

341
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:34,062
And that's no answer.

342
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,722
lt's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

343
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:38,641
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

344
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:42,122
Keep it in your pants, all right. These men
have a job to do, just like we do.

345
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:43,897
lt's their game, let them play it.

346
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:49,476
What l'm about to say
does not leave this room. ls that clear?

347
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:54,175
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

348
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:56,373
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

349
00:28:56,373 --> 00:29:01,304
l'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

350
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:04,100
l just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

351
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,844
One thing l can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

352
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,735
...is crucial to an extremely sensitive,
ongoing investigation.

353
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,949
Any surveillance...

354
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:16,773
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

355
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:21,314
l order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

356
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,555
...to stand down.

357
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:27,861
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

358
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:38,245
You're gonna need me.

359
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,849
Need you. For what?

360
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,007
To get your ass out of jail.

361
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:44,934
You think you can afford my bail?

362
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,183
No.

363
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,476
Neither do l. Not on this pay.

364
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:51,894
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
l have the strangest feeling.

365
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:54,155
You're jealous 'cause l'm gonna stay a cop.

366
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:57,174
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

367
00:29:57,174 --> 00:30:03,708
Here we go.

368
00:30:03,708 --> 00:31:09,078
What are you thinking?

369
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:32,086
lsn't this your mother's church?

370
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:35,998
Yes, but l'll bet she hasn't seen these boys
in the choir.

371
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:59,150
Hey, Nico!

372
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,176
l can't believe you're in church
without your family.

373
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:01,577
Hello, Father. How are you?

374
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:03,699
This must be your partner in crime.

375
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,299
-Delores Jackson.
-l'm Father Gennaro.

376
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,361
l saw you at the baptismal party.

377
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:09,897
-Nico, we gotta go!
-No, please. Wait.

378
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:12,342
God, it's good you're here.

379
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,971
lf you got a few minutes,
there's something l'd like to show you.

380
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:15,893
Please.

381
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:19,454
l haven't been down here since l was a kid.

382
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:31,017
What's this?

383
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:33,175
The rats are getting bigger.

384
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:38,601
-When did this happen?
-Two nights ago. l didn't call the police.

385
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,878
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

386
00:32:40,878 --> 00:33:13,785
These are friends.

387
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,342
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

388
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,069
-Mucho gusto, Padre.
-How do you do?

389
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,869
-Sister Mary.
-Hi, Nico.

390
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:22,521
-Delores.
-How do you do, Father?

391
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,766
-Señora, mucho gusto.
-Hello.

392
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:29,252
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

393
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:30,684
He's visiting...

394
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:34,349
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

395
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:39,511
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

396
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:42,395
Gracias.

397
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,310
Nice meeting you, sir.

398
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,217
Bye-bye.

399
00:33:48,217 --> 00:34:05,000
-How long have those people been here?
-Too long.

400
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,075
At least the children go to our school.

401
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,990
Who do you think broke into the room?

402
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,711
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
lt's not the first time.

403
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:18,662
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

404
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:21,880
No, please. Police frighten these people.

405
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,261
l know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

406
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:30,555
lt's too far out of your way.
l can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

407
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:32,394
Look, l really don't mind coming by.

408
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,891
Promise, okay? All right?

409
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:38,854
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

410
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:41,339
My last confession?

411
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:45,139
l'm a married man.
l have no sins to confess.

412
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,449
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

413
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,523
He's got your number!

414
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:55,327
-ls that your impression of police officers?
-l want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

415
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,963
l feel better when you're in church, okay?

416
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:00,814
You don't show up, l'll call your mother!

417
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:03,108
l wish you would. She loves you.

418
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:07,171
Why don't you go to church?
lt'll be good for you.

419
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,042
Get your soul saved.

420
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:28,121
Our leaders tell us...

421
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:31,841
...and talk to us about them and us.

422
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:35,202
But almighty God talks to us...

423
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:38,396
...about all of mankind...

424
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,682
...as one.

425
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,892
Now, we have an obligation...

426
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:48,019
...to find out what is the truth.

427
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:51,675
We need to study. We need to question.

428
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:54,885
We need to read and we need to find out...

429
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:58,677
...what they are doing in our name.

430
00:35:58,677 --> 00:36:03,584
And we must support those brave souls...

431
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,376
...who seek...

432
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,693
...the truth.

433
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:12,537
God bless us. Amen.

434
00:36:12,537 --> 00:37:01,058
Get down!

435
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:50,424
There's nothing else we can do.

436
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:57,612
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

437
00:37:57,612 --> 00:38:01,682
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

438
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:09,778
Come on.

439
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:19,683
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

440
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:22,001
Find those sanctuary people...

441
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,717
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

442
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:29,640
l want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

443
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,747
Where are you gonna be?

444
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:34,713
Just stay by the radio. l'll find you.

445
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:54,310
-He didn't make it.
-Oh, Nico!

446
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,950
Oh, no!

447
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:10,287
Lieutenant Strozah, these are FBl agents:
Halloran, Neeley.

448
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:18,279
Sweetheart, go to the car.
l'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

449
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:27,467
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

450
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,613
Excuse me. l'd like to have a word
with you.

451
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,564
Alone.

452
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:46,167
What the hell is it?

453
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,325
lt's you, that's what the fuck it is!

454
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:51,168
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

455
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:52,800
-You let Salvano walk.
-Salvano?

456
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah.

457
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,713
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

458
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:57,521
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

459
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,994
l've used that shit. l know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

460
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:05,200
Salvano never came near that C-4.
lt's in federal holding right now.

461
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,131
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

462
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:09,564
l tailed him two days ago.

463
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,858
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

464
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,140
l saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

465
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,780
Now, l want some fucking answers.

466
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,129
You tailed him after l ordered you off?

467
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,805
l want to know where Salvano is.

468
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:26,481
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

469
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:29,436
You think you're rough stuff.

470
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:33,507
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

471
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:36,326
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

472
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:39,385
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

473
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:42,858
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

474
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,602
l want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

475
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:49,278
You do your job, l'll do mine.

476
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:50,854
Bank on it, pal.

477
00:40:50,854 --> 00:42:01,716
-Gentlemen.
-Hello.

478
00:42:01,716 --> 00:42:02,615
Hi, how are you doing?

479
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:13,078
-How are you doing?
-Terrific.

480
00:42:13,078 --> 00:42:17,116
The wallet. Let me see it.

481
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:23,148
Aide to Senator Harrison.

482
00:42:23,148 --> 00:42:37,915
l hope l find you, you greasy mother!
l'm gonna kick your ass!

483
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:40,176
Who the fuck do you think you are?

484
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:52,313
l'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb--

485
00:42:52,313 --> 00:43:32,673
-You guys stay out of trouble.
-Okay, Nico.

486
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:40,537
-l hear you're looking for Salvano.
-You heard that?

487
00:43:40,538 --> 00:43:41,715
l know where he's at.

488
00:43:41,715 --> 00:43:43,985
-Where's that?
-Right here, motherfucker!

489
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:48,789
-lt's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
-Relax, man. Relax.

490
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,469
l won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

491
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:54,300
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

492
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,227
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

493
00:43:56,227 --> 00:44:21,116
We need a doctor!

494
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:25,179
Fuck him up!

495
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:27,489
You motherfucker!

496
00:44:27,489 --> 00:45:23,773
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

497
00:45:23,773 --> 00:45:27,015
-Who sent you?
-Nobody!

498
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,021
''Nobody?'' You did this for fun?

499
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:33,634
Jimmy Costanza!

500
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:39,004
lf l find out you're lying, l'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

501
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,508
Salvano!

502
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:42,634
Bautista Salvano!

503
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:48,515
-That's my buddy, man.
-Yeah, man, l know him.

504
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:53,207
Sic him, Bulldog.

505
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,369
-Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
-l'm not in the mood.

506
00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:57,786
Fuck your mood, man.

507
00:45:57,786 --> 00:46:05,922
-What's happening?
-What it be like, homey?

508
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:07,920
-That was real good, man.
-Peace, brother.

509
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,656
The mayor has announced the city"s offer
of a $25,000 reward for information...

510
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:14,635
...leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible...

511
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:17,024
...for today"s tragic
St. Mary"s church bombing.

512
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,286
Why were we in church?

513
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:21,531
l'll tell you what.

514
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:26,862
l'm willing to break the rules and
l'm willing to tell you everything l know.

515
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:29,602
l just want some time.

516
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:33,887
lt's probably Jax.

517
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:36,763
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

518
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:38,140
lt's bad, Nico.

519
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,645
Long time, Nelson.

520
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:47,142
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

521
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:52,265
l'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then l'm getting off.

522
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:58,416
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

523
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,411
Really? That's fascinating.

524
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:04,477
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

525
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:07,903
l've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. l just haven't had time.

526
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:11,790
You hear me? Now!
l'm risking my ass by telling you this.

527
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,048
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

528
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:16,879
Good luck, paisà.

529
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:33,671
Why is the ClA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

530
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:37,893
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

531
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:42,968
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

532
00:47:42,968 --> 00:47:49,590
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

533
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,716
Listen, don't be that way.

534
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:56,902
-l'm just so scared.
-Don't be.

535
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:59,992
l'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

536
00:47:59,993 --> 00:48:03,210
All right?

537
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:14,478
Nico, who's there?

538
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:32,298
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
lsn't it a little early for breakfast?

539
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:33,261
Nico, how you doing?

540
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:36,112
l'm sorry. l gotta take you downtown.

541
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:38,310
The Feds want to talk. lt'll work out.

542
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,671
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

543
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:45,439
You fucking piece of shit.

544
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:46,649
l'll take that, thank you.

545
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:51,078
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
lt's gonna work out. Let's go.

546
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:54,216
lt'll work out. l'm real sorry about this.

547
00:48:54,217 --> 00:49:03,245
lt's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

548
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:06,949
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

549
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:10,685
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

550
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:11,631
Who do you think you are?

551
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:15,631
-Just stop it! There's an infant here!
-Easy, easy.

552
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:19,454
-Check that coat.
-Why don't you come check it, asshole.

553
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:22,266
Take it easy!

554
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:24,137
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

555
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:30,336
-Get him out of here!
-Everything's gonna work out.

556
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:32,693
Come on. l'll be back in three hours!

557
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:37,075
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

558
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,396
You can't do this!

559
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:51,417
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

560
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:52,818
He assaults my customers.

561
00:49:52,818 --> 00:49:58,069
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

562
00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:02,984
l remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

563
00:50:02,984 --> 00:50:04,704
Look, this is my boy, right here.

564
00:50:04,704 --> 00:50:07,005
They finally got you, huh?

565
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,780
They finally got you, motherfucker.

566
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,999
l told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened--

567
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:11,825
There he is.

568
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:14,833
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

569
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,242
l got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

570
00:50:17,242 --> 00:50:20,658
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

571
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:29,659
Put your ass in that chair.

572
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:36,575
lllegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

573
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,068
When was this guy born?

574
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,429
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

575
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:44,651
-Where's Jax?
-She's out of this!

576
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:47,231
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

577
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:50,282
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

578
00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:51,499
-You, mother--
-Nico!

579
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:54,080
Do you want to go to prison?

580
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,995
Unlawful entry.

581
00:50:56,995 --> 00:51:00,691
-lllegal search and seizure.
-Deputy....

582
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:05,009
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

583
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:08,338
Who do you think they work for?

584
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,445
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

585
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:14,304
l suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

586
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:17,817
You can't be in on this, Fred.

587
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:21,825
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

588
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:24,078
l want your badge and your gun.

589
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:33,066
You gonna hold me?

590
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:35,448
You can walk for now.

591
00:51:35,448 --> 00:51:38,139
Don't walk far.

592
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:50,332
Sara, l'm all right.

593
00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:51,960
lt's okay, and l love you.

594
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,071
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

595
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:59,157
l love you. 'Bye.

596
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,917
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

597
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:08,056
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

598
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:10,493
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

599
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:14,173
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

600
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,905
Alan Singletary.

601
00:52:16,905 --> 00:52:22,482
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

602
00:52:22,482 --> 00:52:24,983
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

603
00:52:24,983 --> 00:52:28,400
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

604
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,025
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

605
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:36,135
lt implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

606
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:37,831
They'll release it next week.

607
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:42,189
-So that's how Fox knew.
-Who?

608
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:46,124
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

609
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:48,306
Luke, l need a favor.

610
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:52,050
l need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

611
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,009
Get the family ready to move out.

612
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:57,466
You got it, buddy.
They took away your pistola, right?

613
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:58,480
Yeah.

614
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,192
Thanks.

615
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:02,178
l don't believe this.

616
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:18,539
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up--

617
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,550
Listen.

618
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,879
You know me.

619
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:25,475
Please, tell these people...

620
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:27,195
...they don't have anything to worry about.

621
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:31,417
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

622
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,595
l know, Sister.

623
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:42,938
Father Tomasino.

624
00:53:42,938 --> 00:53:46,866
He came alone...

625
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:51,303
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

626
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,278
...papers to give to the senator.

627
00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:57,715
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

628
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:01,244
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

629
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:03,713
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

630
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:07,066
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

631
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:11,448
Where is Father Tomasino?

632
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,865
He go, mister. He ran away.

633
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:18,195
lf anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because l know l can help him.

634
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:19,476
We don't know, mister.

635
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:34,698
Jax, l'm serious. You're out of this.

636
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:39,358
Wait a minute. l got a list.
You told me to get a list.

637
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,094
l'm telling you, you're finished.
l mean it. Out.

638
00:54:43,094 --> 00:54:46,009
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

639
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,012
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and l'll call you.

640
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:54,661
Paperwork only!

641
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:55,847
l'm gonna do what l have to do.

642
00:54:55,847 --> 00:55:00,364
Thank you!

643
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

644
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:23,625
Hi, Nico!

645
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:49,001
-Call the police.
-Come on!

646
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:54,410
Freeze, motherfucker!

647
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,337
Anybody moves, he dies.

648
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:59,005
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

649
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:03,435
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

650
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:06,246
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

651
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:08,356
Now, you.

652
00:56:08,356 --> 00:56:10,243
Now, you.

653
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:13,661
Put your hands on your head.

654
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,906
All right, fall in behind the last man.

655
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:18,510
l don't think you can drop us all, badass.

656
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:22,215
You're right, but l'll get an ''A'' for effort.

657
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,046
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

658
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,407
Put your hands on your head.

659
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:27,525
Come on, you! Move!

660
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:36,545
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

661
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:38,520
Not in my store.

662
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,610
lt's a police emergency. l'm a cop.

663
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:45,283
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

664
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:48,421
-This guy's gotta work, too.
-Get down, asshole.

665
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:50,268
Get the fuck down!

666
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:51,621
You wanna get down?

667
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:53,325
Get down on your fucking knees!

668
00:56:53,325 --> 00:57:15,982
They tell me, ''Come to America! ''

669
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:20,178
No, not in my store!

670
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:23,821
There's the police!

671
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:29,374
No, mister!

672
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:51,809
Another police car.

673
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:57,713
Look! My store.

674
00:57:57,713 --> 00:58:03,338
Come on, come on. ls it clear?

675
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:07,815
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

676
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:11,790
Family goes in the Lincoln.
l'll ride in front.

677
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:25,338
l'll be five minutes behind you.
lt's got to be this way.

678
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:28,811
Let's go.

679
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:31,909
Where's Jax?

680
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:34,115
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

681
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:38,473
They killed the wrong priest.

682
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,101
What are you talking about?

683
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:47,874
l'll tell you what l'm talking about.

684
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:52,407
The second priest from Costa Rica...

685
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:58,096
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

686
00:58:58,096 --> 00:58:59,497
You know where to find this guy?

687
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,073
No, l do not.

688
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:04,139
Then you're gonna need help.

689
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,058
Yeah, l'd like you to help me.

690
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:07,881
Watch my family.

691
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,912
What are you gonna do?

692
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:12,516
You don't want to know.

693
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:28,048
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

694
00:59:28,048 --> 00:59:30,055
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

695
00:59:30,055 --> 00:59:35,265
Special Agent Neeley, what were you doing
with that woman up there?

696
00:59:35,265 --> 00:59:41,153
Were you engaging in some kind
of unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

697
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:43,208
She must be 15!

698
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,971
That's illegal in some states, you know.

699
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:47,715
What are you talking about?

700
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:50,503
l thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

701
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,095
Does your wife know about this?

702
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:55,799
Sex is not the only thing in life.

703
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,072
Get in.

704
00:59:57,072 --> 01:00:08,858
-So, how has your day been?
-Okay.

705
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:13,694
Listen, Toscani, l want to congratulate you.

706
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,864
You just made number four
on the ''most-wanted'' list.

707
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,405
Number four? l want to be number one.

708
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:22,025
The day is young.

709
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:27,172
What can l do for you?

710
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:30,884
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

711
01:00:30,884 --> 01:00:32,747
Hell, that's gone.

712
01:00:32,747 --> 01:00:34,570
-When?
-Right away.

713
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:37,175
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

714
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,504
You know who took it?

715
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:40,144
ClA.

716
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:45,052
Let me see the paperwork on it.

717
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:46,667
You got to sign.

718
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:51,599
Yeah, l remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

719
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,749
Real nice fellow.

720
01:00:53,749 --> 01:00:55,588
-l'll bet.
-Here it is.

721
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:57,045
''Fox.''

722
01:00:57,045 --> 01:00:58,517
''Nelson Fox.''

723
01:00:58,517 --> 01:01:04,828
-Thanks.
-Right.

724
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,599
Now what?

725
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,778
Yes, sir. The agent has been with
the Central American desk since 1984.

726
01:01:12,778 --> 01:01:15,430
Thank you. That's what l wanted to know.

727
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,497
All right, take your shoes off.

728
01:01:18,497 --> 01:01:20,487
Come on, let's go.

729
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:25,387
So you think l'm a bad cop, Neeley?

730
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:28,031
You know something? Maybe l am.

731
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:31,467
But at least l don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

732
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:34,204
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe l've judged you a little harshly.

733
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:35,878
l think you have.
And you know something?

734
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:38,839
What l'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

735
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:42,081
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
l'd like you to get up...

736
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:44,565
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

737
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:47,202
lf you don't hurry,
l'll empty this gun in your butt.

738
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:48,929
Move it, Agent Neeley!

739
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:52,777
Let's go!

740
01:01:52,777 --> 01:02:03,439
Jump, Neeley!

741
01:02:03,439 --> 01:02:35,605
Nico, what are you doing here?

742
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:38,114
-l need a favor.
-Sure.

743
01:02:38,114 --> 01:02:41,962
-How late are you gonna be here today?
-l'm off at 6:00.

744
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:43,490
l'll be here.

745
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:52,901
Don't be too long, lady.
l got a crew coming in.

746
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:54,708
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

747
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,460
We don't have much time.

748
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,295
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

749
01:02:59,295 --> 01:03:02,529
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

750
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,907
...but l got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

751
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:10,121
How the hell did you get in this mess?

752
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:12,837
l thought you were finished with the ClA.

753
01:03:12,837 --> 01:03:18,127
Trap door.

754
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:29,929
We'll wriggle up these two...

755
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:33,402
...operative dossiers.

756
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:36,261
Start with my friend, Nelson.

757
01:03:36,261 --> 01:03:52,040
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

758
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:56,318
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

759
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:03,386
Nico, what is going on here?

760
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:06,588
Here we go.

761
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:11,137
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

762
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:15,662
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

763
01:04:15,663 --> 01:04:19,462
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

764
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:21,381
lt looks that way.

765
01:04:21,381 --> 01:04:27,246
Thanks.

766
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,160
l owe you one.

767
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,720
-Where are you going?
-l gotta find that priest.

768
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:35,194
Be careful.

769
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:41,480
I find this totally incredulous.

770
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,982
You, being a station chief at the CIA,
didn"t know what was going on?

771
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,972
Mr. Senator,
I"d like to explain a few things.

772
01:04:47,972 --> 01:04:52,170
Either you perjured yourself earlier,
or you"re lying to us now.

773
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,357
Take a few moments
before you answer this.

774
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:57,682
And remember that you"re under oath.

775
01:04:57,682 --> 01:05:01,665
It was agreed this was a valuable asset
and that I had to work out a way...

776
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:05,321
...they had to work out a way
in which to take over.

777
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:07,655
And did that include
giving money to the enterprise?

778
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:09,470
Not insofar as I knew.

779
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,939
-And the colonel never told you?
-No.

780
01:05:11,939 --> 01:05:15,157
Are you saying that this was going
to be a donation for the CIA...

781
01:05:15,157 --> 01:05:16,565
...as far as you were concerned?

782
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:17,926
We were going to walk away from it.

783
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:18,785
Hello.

784
01:05:18,785 --> 01:05:22,258
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

785
01:05:22,258 --> 01:05:23,683
Sister Mary, right.

786
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:29,252
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

787
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:30,446
Now where are you?

788
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:43,914
Who is it?

789
01:05:43,914 --> 01:06:14,749
Father!

790
01:06:14,749 --> 01:06:15,679
Get her out of here.

791
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,994
This way, Father.

792
01:06:20,994 --> 01:07:13,866
Where did you find this guy?

793
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:18,360
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

794
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,235
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

795
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:23,608
l got papers from that senator's aide.

796
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:27,615
Everything Harrison has been working on.
lt's unbelievable. lt's over at my place.

797
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:31,423
l need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

798
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:35,932
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

799
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:40,457
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

800
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:43,867
When we hit the joint,
l don't want you celling with me.

801
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:46,455
Jax, we'll work out something.

802
01:07:46,455 --> 01:08:03,366
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

803
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:04,312
Sure.

804
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:17,453
lf l were you, l would listen
to what this man has to say.

805
01:08:17,454 --> 01:08:20,265
He knows what's best for you.

806
01:08:20,265 --> 01:08:34,179
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

807
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:36,967
lt's a sin.

808
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:39,252
Look at me!

809
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:43,610
lf you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

810
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,298
...tell me now...

811
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,946
...and l won't have to use this.

812
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:52,898
This is from confession. l tell no one.

813
01:08:52,898 --> 01:09:10,398
Let's go.

814
01:09:10,398 --> 01:09:17,689
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

815
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:18,755
Just stay here, all right?

816
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:25,663
Take a nice look at it.

817
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:27,686
l got it just for you.

818
01:09:27,686 --> 01:09:36,325
Do you feel that? Nice?

819
01:09:36,326 --> 01:09:38,258
You like that?

820
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:44,314
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

821
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,117
Very warm and wonderful.

822
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:48,725
Think about it.

823
01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:51,688
Warm. l love it!

824
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:56,126
l enjoy this. l really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

825
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:57,622
We'll enjoy it together.

826
01:09:57,622 --> 01:10:02,020
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

827
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:22,286
l want to know who you told.

828
01:10:22,286 --> 01:10:23,631
l told them...

829
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:27,033
...you make...

830
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:28,927
...the children see you...

831
01:10:28,928 --> 01:10:32,416
...mutilating their mothers...

832
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,630
...and sometimes...

833
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,115
...you do these things...

834
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:38,851
...to the children.

835
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,845
Did you tell anybody?

836
01:10:41,845 --> 01:10:47,072
Damn it, tell me now!

837
01:10:47,072 --> 01:10:48,768
Tell me now!

838
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:58,051
Father, I have had enough of this.

839
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:02,010
Father, l want you to tell me the truth.

840
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:04,885
Can we kill him?

841
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:09,450
lf you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

842
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:11,505
...we cannot kill him!

843
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:14,021
Nothing!

844
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:24,261
Phase two.

845
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:30,309
Christ!

846
01:11:30,309 --> 01:11:53,700
-Move it!
-What are you doing? Get out of here.

847
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:58,448
Jax, get the hell out of here!

848
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:07,373
Nico!

849
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:15,724
Jax!

850
01:12:15,724 --> 01:12:24,473
-Go!
-l got him!

851
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:45,122
Where is he?

852
01:12:45,122 --> 01:12:48,141
Down there!

853
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:57,352
l got a bona fide emergency here.
What am l supposed to do?

854
01:12:57,352 --> 01:13:03,854
-Shut the fuck up!
-Yes, sir.

855
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:05,215
Get inside! Come on!

856
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:09,198
l hear sirens but l don't see any cops.

857
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:12,353
lf they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

858
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,479
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

859
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,103
Get up front!

860
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:22,293
-Shut up! Be quiet!
-What the hell am l supposed to do?

861
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:26,747
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

862
01:13:26,747 --> 01:13:28,729
They got guns all over the place.
l got a carload of passengers.

863
01:13:28,730 --> 01:14:39,703
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

864
01:14:39,703 --> 01:14:41,566
Shut up and save your strength.

865
01:14:41,566 --> 01:14:44,059
l'm okay. l'm okay.

866
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,000
-Where are we going?
-Cubicle D.

867
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,899
l got on my vest.

868
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:51,654
Where is he?

869
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,134
What do you mean you don't know?

870
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:56,000
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

871
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,497
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

872
01:14:57,497 --> 01:15:01,137
You hear anything, you let me know.

873
01:15:01,137 --> 01:15:02,044
Capisci?

874
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:07,729
lt's Nico.

875
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:11,457
Jesus Christ.

876
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:21,418
The motherfuckers got Jax.

877
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:23,623
Lukich called. She's not dead.

878
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:25,781
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

879
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:44,406
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

880
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,122
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

881
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:48,929
...they're gonna get to your family.

882
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:51,924
-You've got to do it, Nico.
-Tell him, Sara.

883
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,102
You know you have to.

884
01:15:53,102 --> 01:15:55,291
Listen to her, Nicola.

885
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:56,916
This is your family.

886
01:15:56,917 --> 01:16:01,879
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

887
01:16:01,879 --> 01:16:14,749
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

888
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:20,414
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

889
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:27,999
Do you know why l love you?

890
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,473
What it is about you
that l've always loved?

891
01:16:31,473 --> 01:16:33,144
lt's pride.

892
01:16:33,144 --> 01:16:39,224
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

893
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:45,638
Swallow your pride.

894
01:16:45,638 --> 01:16:50,522
Choke on it, if you have to.

895
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:54,784
-Lay it down, please.
-You know something?

896
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:59,325
There's nothing in this world
that l wouldn't do for my family.

897
01:16:59,325 --> 01:17:01,252
Nobody will harm us.

898
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:04,828
l don't want you to worry. Okay?

899
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:43,395
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

900
01:17:43,395 --> 01:17:47,019
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

901
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:48,236
Close range?

902
01:17:48,236 --> 01:17:52,507
lt'd never work. lt's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

903
01:17:52,507 --> 01:17:55,238
l was thinking of a claymore on the roof--

904
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:56,966
No!

905
01:17:56,966 --> 01:18:01,746
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

906
01:18:01,746 --> 01:18:03,537
Okay. Now you can move.

907
01:18:03,537 --> 01:18:06,078
-lt's me. You don't have to treat me like--
-Slow!

908
01:18:06,078 --> 01:18:09,838
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

909
01:18:09,838 --> 01:18:12,729
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

910
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:15,995
l figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

911
01:18:15,995 --> 01:18:21,963
-You're looking fit.
-l'm getting a bit of a tire.

912
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:24,296
-ls that your own tailor?
-Hong Kong.

913
01:18:24,296 --> 01:18:27,849
-You've come a long way.
-Yeah.

914
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,082
Just walk.

915
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:32,197
l don't believe you.

916
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:37,019
What's so hard to believe?
l want to help you, you dumb guinea.

917
01:18:37,019 --> 01:18:39,270
l've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

918
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,101
You're still ''Fox the Fixer.''

919
01:18:41,102 --> 01:18:45,507
lf l wanted to cap you,
l'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

920
01:18:45,507 --> 01:18:48,624
l'd make big points for myself
if l brought your scalp in.

921
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:50,883
Shit, l'd be White House material.

922
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:53,431
ls that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

923
01:18:53,432 --> 01:18:57,470
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

924
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,884
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

925
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:04,640
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

926
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,432
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

927
01:19:08,432 --> 01:19:09,386
Legal tender.

928
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:13,529
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

929
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:17,631
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

930
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:23,193
Nobody would believe me if l told them
the bankers were the ClA.

931
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:26,179
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

932
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,704
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

933
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:32,998
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

934
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:36,081
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

935
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:37,792
Just keep walking, asshole.

936
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:40,915
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

937
01:19:40,915 --> 01:19:44,093
But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the padre has talked.

938
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:49,367
So Zagon comes in, ''Tell me,'' with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, l'm in on it.

939
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:52,458
And you fucking know
l'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

940
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:56,823
lf your name would've been Joe Smith,
l never would've caught it.

941
01:19:56,823 --> 01:19:58,989
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

942
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:04,064
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

943
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:06,182
Why not? The Romans did.

944
01:20:06,182 --> 01:20:08,890
-Are we the fucking Romans?
-We're an empire, too.

945
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:11,040
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

946
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,163
Just walk. Go!

947
01:20:14,163 --> 01:20:24,673
Hold it, Nico.

948
01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:30,402
-Here's your key, sir.
-My buddy will drive.

949
01:20:30,402 --> 01:20:37,693
You know something?

950
01:20:37,693 --> 01:20:43,438
ln Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

951
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,329
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

952
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:49,491
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

953
01:20:49,491 --> 01:20:51,936
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

954
01:20:51,936 --> 01:20:53,376
But you and l...

955
01:20:53,377 --> 01:20:56,754
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

956
01:20:56,754 --> 01:21:00,554
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

957
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:04,983
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

958
01:21:04,983 --> 01:21:06,775
We've wiped out entire cultures.

959
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:08,606
And for what?

960
01:21:08,606 --> 01:21:13,474
Not one ClA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

961
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:18,389
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

962
01:21:18,389 --> 01:21:25,600
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

963
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:49,693
l've been waiting for the day
l'd catch up with this motherfucker.

964
01:21:49,693 --> 01:21:59,653
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

965
01:21:59,654 --> 01:22:02,497
What a team we got here.

966
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:04,806
l told you, you'd never be the man.

967
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:08,335
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

968
01:22:08,335 --> 01:22:10,111
l see that you...

969
01:22:10,111 --> 01:22:12,149
...found our friend.

970
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:14,060
Thanks, Fox.

971
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,577
l didn't bring him. l swear it.

972
01:22:16,577 --> 01:22:19,452
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

973
01:22:19,452 --> 01:22:22,973
Reminiscing about the good old days?

974
01:22:22,973 --> 01:22:23,728
Stay still!

975
01:22:23,728 --> 01:22:26,970
Just fucking don't move.

976
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:30,379
Nelson, bring our friend in.

977
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:37,088
Come on, be a good boy.

978
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:38,736
Dive, Nico!

979
01:22:38,736 --> 01:22:56,898
Get that motherfucker!

980
01:22:56,898 --> 01:23:13,642
Move it!

981
01:23:13,642 --> 01:23:17,474
Get him!

982
01:23:17,474 --> 01:23:48,890
Stop the car, you fuck!

983
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:56,986
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

984
01:23:56,986 --> 01:23:58,706
Stop it!

985
01:23:58,706 --> 01:24:17,633
Fox's car!

986
01:24:17,633 --> 01:25:01,898
He"s on the ramp now.

987
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:05,427
He"s coming out the Wabash entrance.
Get there, Deep Throat.

988
01:25:05,427 --> 01:25:07,904
Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.

989
01:25:07,904 --> 01:25:17,745
Get out of the car!

990
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,975
l want him alive.

991
01:25:19,975 --> 01:25:28,103
He's clean.

992
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,420
Bring him over.

993
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,383
Let's go!

994
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:39,741
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

995
01:25:39,741 --> 01:25:44,506
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

996
01:25:44,506 --> 01:26:01,552
Now, our honored guest,
Senator Ernest Harrison.

997
01:26:01,552 --> 01:26:24,847
l hope this don't take too long
'cause l'm getting hungry.

998
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:34,802
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

999
01:26:34,802 --> 01:26:38,441
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

1000
01:26:38,441 --> 01:26:43,906
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

1001
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:46,598
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

1002
01:26:46,598 --> 01:26:50,159
...smell the roses.

1003
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,712
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

1004
01:26:53,712 --> 01:26:56,667
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

1005
01:26:56,667 --> 01:27:07,520
Put his face up.

1006
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,148
Hold it up.

1007
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:14,235
Here you go, Toscani. ''Dr. Feelgood.''

1008
01:27:14,235 --> 01:27:28,468
l've used these little beauties many times
to extract information.

1009
01:27:28,468 --> 01:27:29,965
For the first time in my life...

1010
01:27:29,965 --> 01:27:32,983
...l'm gonna do it just for the fun.

1011
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:39,063
Get away from me with that,
you piece of shit!

1012
01:27:39,063 --> 01:27:41,006
That's it, fight it!

1013
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:41,848
Fight it, cherry...

1014
01:27:41,848 --> 01:27:43,122
...so it speeds right on its way.

1015
01:27:43,122 --> 01:27:43,972
Fight it!

1016
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:44,927
Keep fighting it!

1017
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:45,865
Oh, you're a good boy, now.

1018
01:27:45,865 --> 01:27:46,844
That's what l've been waiting for.

1019
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,515
Let him go.

1020
01:27:48,516 --> 01:28:00,668
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

1021
01:28:00,668 --> 01:28:03,344
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1022
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:05,383
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

1023
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:11,526
Jake! Look out!

1024
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:38,224
Say something. Nico?

1025
01:28:38,224 --> 01:28:41,554
ls there a doctor here?

1026
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:42,851
Quick! Call an ambulance!

1027
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:50,907
Agent Neeley, FBl. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

1028
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:57,680
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

1029
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:03,560
We are standing in front of the home
of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.

1030
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,953
Behind me, the entourage
of Senator Harrison is arriving.

1031
01:29:06,953 --> 01:29:11,391
Lots of security here. We have police
officers on the scene and federal agents.

1032
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:14,258
Of course, there is concern
of a possible assassination attempt.

1033
01:29:14,258 --> 01:29:17,293
That"s why you"ve got
so many law enforcement officers here.

1034
01:29:17,293 --> 01:29:25,438
-This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
-How do you do?

1035
01:29:25,438 --> 01:29:26,534
Please, don't get up.

1036
01:29:26,534 --> 01:29:28,469
Detective Toscani...

1037
01:29:28,469 --> 01:29:32,803
...l just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

1038
01:29:32,803 --> 01:29:36,387
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

1039
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:38,290
...to bring these men to justice...

1040
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:42,034
...and to ensure that this type of behavior
will never be tolerated again.

1041
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:45,029
That would be nice.

1042
01:29:45,029 --> 01:29:49,260
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

1043
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,417
How do you do, ma'am?

1044
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,177
Are you sure you're well enough?

1045
01:29:53,177 --> 01:29:57,511
l'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

1046
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:59,135
All right.

1047
01:29:59,135 --> 01:30:02,592
-Miss Jackson, l'll leave you now.
-Senator, thank you.

1048
01:30:02,592 --> 01:30:07,906
-We'll be leaving for Washington.
-Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

1049
01:30:07,906 --> 01:30:13,587
Mr. Toscani...

1050
01:30:13,587 --> 01:30:16,398
...can you tell us about
your military background?

1051
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:24,678
ln 1973, l worked for
a special operations group...

1052
01:30:24,678 --> 01:30:27,043
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

1053
01:30:27,043 --> 01:30:30,691
l was involved with gathering intelligence.

1054
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:34,889
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the ClA...

1055
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:39,303
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

1056
01:30:39,303 --> 01:30:54,261
Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
of individuals...

1057
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:57,184
...who are beyond any investigation...

1058
01:30:57,184 --> 01:31:01,893
...who can manipulate the press,
judges, members of our Congress...

1059
01:31:01,893 --> 01:31:06,849
...you"ll have within our government
those who are above the law.

1060
01:31:06,849 --> 01:32:06,849
