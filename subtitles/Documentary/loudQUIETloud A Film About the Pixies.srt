1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,430
A SERBIAN FILM

2
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,176
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

3
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:52,929
Are you insane?

4
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,300
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

5
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,810
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

6
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Sorry, but it's
not a big deal.

7
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,399
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

8
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,019
How are you, kiddo?

9
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,779
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

10
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,118
Maria, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,288
I dug up that DVD because...

12
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,618
Laylah called and
wanted to see me today.

13
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,917
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

14
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,707
The jumping bread!

15
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:36,086
Mom, what was dad
doing there?

16
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:38,846
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

17
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,056
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

18
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,252
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

19
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:55,788
Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

20
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:08,757
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

21
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,217
That's why I drink it.

22
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:22,356
So, how's family life?
- Nice.

23
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,735
How are Petar and... Maria?

24
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,405
Yes, Maria.
They're fine.

25
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,275
Next year Petar's
starting school.

26
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:35,324
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

27
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,074
his father's occupation.

28
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:41,784
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

29
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:47,003
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

30
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:48,953
How much do you have
stashed? 5 or 10 grand?

31
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:57,422
Milos, you were more
than just a porn star

32
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,552
you were an artist.

33
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,222
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

34
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,311
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

35
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,320
And I'm your guardian angel.
Listen.

36
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,530
Something big is about to
happen. Artistic pornography

37
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,070
of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

38
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,409
In Serbia? -Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

39
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,829
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid. If you accept

40
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,628
your family will be settled
till the end of Petar's life.

41
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,847
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

42
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,257
Be nice to him.

43
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,517
Here's something for the junior.

44
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,486
Wow, where's his pussy?

45
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:03,275
You didn't tell me you brought
your copper bro to the meeting.

46
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:08,575
I came on my own. I knew you'd
be here and couldn't miss

47
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,704
a chance to see you.
I'm your great admirer.

48
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,293
You're well preserved.

49
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,923
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

50
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:34,642
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

51
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:37,892
Everybody needs it.

52
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,061
These don't

53
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,860
So long, fags.
Milos, you heard my advice.

54
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,370
A hooker!
- A porn star.

55
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,080
Has-been.

56
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,959
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

57
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,829
I know.

58
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,088
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

59
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,008
A natural talent.

60
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:20,518
Funny she hasn't
contacted her dealer

61
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,518
in the past few years.

62
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:24,977
Is she off drugs?

63
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,147
Doubtful. A new,
rich provider, more likely.

64
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,106
You'll alienate me
from my friends

65
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,906
if you keep checking on them.

66
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,826
Friends, in Serbia?

67
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,865
You can't check them enough.

68
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,995
I gotta go.

69
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,875
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

70
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,884
I'm paying for the bite.

71
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:01,424
So long.
- Bye.

72
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:32,081
Sleeping time, hands up.

73
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,870
Dad?
- Yes?

74
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,210
Know that friend of yours

75
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,790
that you were
beating in the video

76
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,879
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

77
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,009
I know, but while
I was watching it

78
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:51,299
I felt something
strange. - What?

79
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,718
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

80
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:59,308
A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

81
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:03,277
Several of them,
like a family, travelling.

82
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,907
Do they live in me?

83
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:13,196
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

84
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:17,406
Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

85
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,455
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

86
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,585
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

87
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,974
What language is that?

88
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,224
I'm translating
for some Swedes.

89
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,893
Swedish? I'm great in it.

90
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,393
That's right.

91
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,732
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

92
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:06,121
You would be a mega star.

93
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,890
So, you say Laylah is
offering you a serious job?

94
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,509
So she said.
It's strange.

95
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,729
Why would anyone
offer me big money

96
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,558
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

97
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:42,068
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

98
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:58,046
Maybe they need
the only porn star

99
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,126
a university diploma.

100
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,715
Do you miss it?

101
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,894
What?
- The job.

102
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,724
I don't know. No.

103
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:23,313
I miss the money so we could
escape away from here.

104
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:36,782
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

105
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,081
How come you've never
done me like them?

106
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,131
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

107
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,939
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

108
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:01,668
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

109
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,797
<i>Nikola Tesla of
world pornography?</i>

110
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,297
You must be Vukmir?

111
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:10,047
<i>Of course. Milos, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

112
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:13,676
<i>right now and provide
your family for good</i>

113
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:17,476
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

114
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:22,145
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

115
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,185
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

116
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:28,235
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

117
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:54,342
I'm honored to shake hands
to such an artist, I'm Vukmir.

118
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,422
I'm Milos, nice to meet you.

119
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,761
Right hand is the
sex center in any man,

120
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:08,141
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

121
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,901
Ever since you childhood.

122
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,440
Your hand is special

123
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,820
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

124
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,109
Milos, it's an honor

125
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,279
to shake a hand
to such an artist of fuck.

126
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,788
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

127
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:37,788
Why not?

128
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:41,718
Because they just want
to jizz into a napkin

129
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,967
what they can't
into a woman.

130
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,557
These movies are
mostly made so that

131
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:50,137
those who can't
get laid can cum.

132
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,976
They're made by butchers

133
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:59,226
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

134
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:04,405
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

135
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,985
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

136
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:10,695
Do you know
what proves that

137
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:13,204
there is art in pornography?

138
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,114
What?

139
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,294
You, Milos.

140
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,133
You are the proof!

141
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:29,423
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

142
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:33,342
of exhausting her,
your talent to umiliate her,

143
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,102
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

144
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:40,642
And your love for it,
that's art.

145
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:48,651
Sadly, this is
no country for real art.

146
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,950
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

147
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,030
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

148
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,290
are giving press conferences.

149
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,209
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

150
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,799
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

151
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,048
Just for the selected clients.

152
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:16,258
All right, but what is it?

153
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:21,058
Art, naked art!

154
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:24,927
Truth.

155
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:29,727
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

156
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,026
minimal editing.

157
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,696
There's a serious script.

158
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:42,945
We know it, you don't!

159
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,874
And what am I
supposed to do?

160
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:58,714
The same as always, Milos.
Just stand before the cameras,

161
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:03,053
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

162
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:08,763
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

163
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:12,432
You're also tired of
humping scum

164
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:15,642
any time your family
needs money.

165
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:21,402
Kissing some
wretched cunts

166
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:24,941
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

167
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,000
Thanks, doctor.

168
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,089
What's that?
- The contract.

169
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,678
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

170
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,196
Something wrong?

171
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,665
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

172
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,795
You're not supposed to know.

173
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,215
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

174
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:28,809
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill</i>

175
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:34,688
<i>A creek was fozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

176
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:41,318
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

177
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:47,027
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

178
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:53,866
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

179
00:20:55,246 --> 00:21:01,256
<i>perhaps he' after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

180
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:08,715
Vukmir! Sounds like a name
of one of your guys

181
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:11,015
at the Hague tribunal.

182
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:13,634
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

183
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,854
No, he's some kind of
an artist philosopher

184
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,024
with a grand plan.

185
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:22,393
So, is it grand?

186
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:26,483
Dunno, but seems like he
desperately needs me

187
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:30,943
since he's willing
to offer such cash.

188
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:37,322
How much?

189
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:41,122
I won't tell you.

190
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:47,421
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

191
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,501
OK, I'll tell you,
just let go.

192
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,519
Don't tell me you refused?

193
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,649
Of course I did.

194
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:12,398
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

195
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,778
If I were,
I'd have dumped you

196
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,068
for your brother long ago.

197
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:27,667
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

198
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:40,046
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

199
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,385
Remember what
you told me

200
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:46,885
when I asked
if you missed your job?

201
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:52,064
Milos, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

202
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,604
If it's true...

203
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:58,014
If what is true?

204
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:01,693
That you were always
able to have it erected

205
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:04,363
with no touching
or looking.

206
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:10,533
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

207
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:14,872
I also know that
you filmed all your scenes

208
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,082
in the first take.

209
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,532
Don't be so modest,

210
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,711
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

211
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:12,350
How long do you
think it would take?

212
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,900
A few days.

213
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,530
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

214
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:32,038
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

215
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,038
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

216
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,136
Want one?
- Yes.

217
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:02,105
No thanks.

218
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,315
You said you would.

219
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,985
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

220
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,114
I miss female company.

221
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,414
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

222
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,834
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

223
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:26,793
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

224
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:32,302
You stopped
hoping too soon.

225
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:34,472
Women here like
men in uniform.

226
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:36,972
Especially if
they're not wearing it.

227
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,141
Sorry, gotta go
to the bathroom.

228
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:25,281
You know what
they say about rye.

229
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:31,241
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

230
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,910
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

231
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,910
Whe, exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

232
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,670
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

233
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,209
Milos, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

234
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,669
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

235
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,928
It's a bit absurd.

236
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:55,388
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

237
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:01,597
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

238
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:03,687
Nothing is left to accident.

239
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:07,727
Milos, that is
a serious organization.

240
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:13,276
My clients know
exactly what they want,

241
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,236
and I know
what I'm doing.

242
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:19,996
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

243
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:22,665
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

244
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:27,165
relax and react
as Milos would.

245
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:32,834
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

246
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,464
but a live
transmission of sex.

247
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:37,834
<i>Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

248
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:41,303
Remember the little wheels?

249
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:43,933
I do.

250
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:47,013
Do you know how
to make them spin?

251
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:52,232
I do. But you
must do it yourself.

252
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:53,692
We all do it alone.

253
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:55,772
Tell me how.

254
00:29:57,402 --> 00:30:02,611
When you feel them,
try to follow them

255
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:07,161
It's a familiy travelling

256
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:13,040
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

257
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,339
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

258
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:10,345
Put it in your ear.

259
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:37,992
<i>Enter the building,
relaxed.</i>

260
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,670
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

261
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:21,277
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

262
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:27,037
Be natural.

263
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,760
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

264
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,810
than giving birth to you!

265
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,519
Haven't told you not to let
the villains take you away?

266
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,479
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

267
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,069
What are you staring at?

268
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:58,528
<i>Bravo.</i>

269
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,457
What was it like?

270
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,916
Fine.

271
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,216
We were filming at
a Home for orphaned children.

272
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,626
Where?

273
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,395
Drag yourself over here!

274
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:26,185
Look at yourself.
You can't raise a dick,

275
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,435
how will you raise a child?

276
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:31,814
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

277
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:34,654
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

278
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:39,784
Let me go, villains!

279
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:42,743
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

280
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,352
<i>Honey?
- Hi.</i>

281
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:18,812
<i>What are you doing?</i>

282
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,231
I picked up
Petar from classes.

283
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:24,441
I'm taking him to a costume
party. Are you coming?

284
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:27,941
No, I'm tired.
Must get some sleep.

285
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:29,691
<i>Everything all right?</i>

286
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,110
Sure. Just you
enjoy yourselves.

287
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,200
Talk to you later,
must park now. Bye.

288
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,290
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

289
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,579
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

290
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,129
<i>Aren't you in action?
- Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

291
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,588
I'm all dick.

292
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:55,848
<i>I need a detailed check
on my director,</i>

293
00:38:56,848 --> 00:39:00,388
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

294
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:04,807
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

295
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:10,986
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

296
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:15,406
Look, it's important
and urgent.

297
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:19,656
Understood.
Everything OK with you?

298
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,615
Yes, so far.
How about you?

299
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,325
Working on it.

300
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:37,634
<i>Light the candles.</i>

301
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,933
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

302
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,482
Baby, the time is flying
and your animal

303
00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,232
is snoozing again.

304
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:06,491
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

305
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:12,000
Blow harder.
Bravo!

306
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,840
<i>Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.</i>

307
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,129
This is the present
from your uncle.

308
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,839
How do you open this?

309
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,348
Happy birthday,
my sweet son.

310
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:32,272
What do you think, how does he
manage to be so hard so long?

311
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,452
It's not a dick,
it's a police stick!

312
00:41:37,902 --> 00:41:41,371
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

313
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:48,121
The bitches are leaking all over,
he's servicing all three of them.

314
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,000
How come he's not tired?

315
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,300
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

316
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,889
You're at it again!

317
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:10,189
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

318
00:42:12,558 --> 00:42:14,688
What was so urgent?

319
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:17,988
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

320
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:23,327
Are those cameramen real cops?
Are they protection? What from?

321
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:27,197
Cut the crap!

322
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:31,536
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

323
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:34,586
I may be dumb,
but not naive.

324
00:42:35,206 --> 00:42:38,716
Vukimr knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

325
00:42:39,296 --> 00:42:42,085
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

326
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:45,805
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

327
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:50,385
Don't take it all on me cause
I fuck animals for art's sake,

328
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:54,014
while you can't take
a bit of uncertainty

329
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:55,854
for some big bucks.

330
00:42:56,184 --> 00:42:59,734
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

331
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:02,403
It's not so bad,
trust me.

332
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:06,113
Better than the crap
you've been lately.

333
00:43:11,662 --> 00:43:15,162
You know I miss that.
- What?

334
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:17,742
The certainty of that crap.

335
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:20,162
At least I knew
what I was filming.

336
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:24,041
Do you miss this?

337
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,720
You're losing it.

338
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,680
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

339
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,158
You're resting
from healthy life.

340
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:04,617
How was the
costume party?

341
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:10,666
Hey, what's that?
- It's a stand up balloon.

342
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:37,904
Your Raiko was
a war hero.

343
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:43,823
If only he knew about
his whife's whoring!

344
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:52,792
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

345
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:03,605
What the hell
is all this, people?

346
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:06,395
Hello, I can't work
like this!

347
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:26,123
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

348
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,923
Hit her.

349
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:20,927
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

350
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:28,387
Milos?

351
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:37,926
Milos, what's wrong?

352
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:39,646
I'm not doing this.
I'm not beating women

353
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,485
in front of kids or cameras.

354
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:45,695
Milos, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

355
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:49,035
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

356
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,494
You're like
a Sunday picnic for her.

357
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,494
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

358
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,534
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

359
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:57,374
You're doing against mine.

360
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,914
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

361
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:02,833
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

362
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:06,003
Did you enjoy less than
a midget woman whoom

363
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,263
you locked up in an oven in
Stuttgart and pierced a hole

364
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:11,682
in it so she could
suck you up for hours?

365
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:19,472
At least your
dick enjoyed it,

366
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:26,271
and he never lies.

367
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:31,950
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

368
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,870
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

369
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,629
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

370
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:47,339
of the State TV. It's
getting better and better!

371
00:48:47,879 --> 00:48:50,508
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

372
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:56,428
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

373
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,178
with data from
the State Security.

374
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:03,977
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

375
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:09,567
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

376
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:14,276
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

377
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:20,285
That's about it.

378
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:23,615
I don't know
what bothers you.

379
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:27,285
According to this

380
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:29,625
you've never worked
with a more educated man.

381
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:32,084
Who are you gonna trust
if not a child psychologist.

382
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:34,044
who is working
for the Security?

383
00:50:45,437 --> 00:50:51,946
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.

384
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:41,701
Want something to eat?

385
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:44,031
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

386
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,339
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

387
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:04,889
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

388
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,233
Today we're shooting
at home again.

389
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,523
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

390
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:16,662
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

391
00:53:17,412 --> 00:53:18,612
No.

392
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:24,461
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

393
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,921
I fully understand you.

394
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,760
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

395
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,180
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

396
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,099
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

397
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:46,439
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

398
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,608
What did you say,
kindergarten?

399
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:55,818
That's a good term.

400
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:01,787
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

401
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,037
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

402
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:09,087
Do you know
what it feels like?

403
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,586
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

404
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:15,676
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

405
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,596
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

406
00:54:19,846 --> 00:54:21,965
drink, bleed, earn money...

407
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,975
do whatever it takes
to survive, until you die

408
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:32,064
Would you believe m
if I told you that me and

409
00:54:32,474 --> 00:54:36,444
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

410
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:41,483
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

411
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:47,453
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

412
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,202
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

413
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:56,122
and useful for anything.

414
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:03,511
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that

415
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:07,381
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

416
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,520
No, Milos, no, no!

417
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,569
Not pornography,
but life itself!

418
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:25,989
That's life of a victim.

419
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:29,779
Love, art, blood...

420
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:34,538
Flesh and soul of a victim.

421
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:38,788
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

422
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:42,627
and now is paying
to watch that

423
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:45,957
from the comfort
of an armchair.

424
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:49,587
I have no doubt
that it sells well

425
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:52,216
based on the sum
you offered me.

426
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:56,096
Victim sells, Milos.

427
00:55:59,386 --> 00:56:02,895
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

428
00:56:03,815 --> 00:56:07,315
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

429
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:10,904
We are victim, Milos.

430
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:14,154
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

431
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:16,994
We're just too retarded.

432
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,413
And I won't be
a victim because of that.

433
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:23,653
But Milos...

434
00:56:23,953 --> 00:56:26,703
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

435
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:30,163
Is that so?

436
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,262
Allow me,
as your shepherd

437
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,592
to show you
the power of a real victim.

438
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:07,897
Can it be that you
don't get it?

439
00:59:08,687 --> 00:59:11,226
This is a new genre, Milos!

440
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:15,356
Newborn porn!

441
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:18,526
Newborn!

442
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:36,464
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

443
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:40,343
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

444
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:50,554
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

445
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,893
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

446
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,519
If you only
knew how easily

447
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:23,899
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluited in whiskey.

448
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:26,939
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

449
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:32,118
Viagra for bulls!

450
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:35,868
A special recipe concockted
by our sexy doctor who is

451
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:39,158
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

452
01:05:39,997 --> 01:05:41,327
Can he follow
my words?

453
01:05:43,877 --> 01:05:45,207
Now, that's our stud!

454
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:47,797
Look at him, look at him!

455
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:49,966
Bravo, bravo!

456
01:06:38,592 --> 01:06:41,221
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

457
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,971
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

458
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:48,141
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

459
01:06:48,391 --> 01:06:51,940
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

460
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,980
Yeah, you bitch!

461
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,489
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

462
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:03,909
<i>who conceive
babies in lust</i>

463
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:05,989
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

464
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:07,949
<i>The lustful
brood of wenches</i>

465
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:10,448
<i>with endless
gashes in them.</i>

466
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:22,757
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

467
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:25,637
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

468
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:28,217
<i>Imagine that, Milos!</i>

469
01:07:31,516 --> 01:07:33,346
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

470
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:54,614
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

471
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:58,494
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

472
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:40,187
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

473
01:10:43,557 --> 01:10:45,317
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

474
01:10:49,566 --> 01:10:51,356
<i>What?</i>

475
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:56,286
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.
Don't worry, he will.</i>

476
01:10:59,245 --> 01:11:02,745
<i>Fucking hell.
OK, run now.</i>

477
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,772
<i>This one is on me.</i>

478
01:12:06,139 --> 01:12:08,429
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

479
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:10,098
<i>I did what? How?</i>

480
01:12:10,348 --> 01:12:13,558
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

481
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:17,978
<i>You had Milos. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

482
01:12:19,267 --> 01:12:21,777
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

483
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:24,567
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

484
01:12:25,277 --> 01:12:28,487
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

485
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:33,326
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

486
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:37,206
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

487
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:39,955
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

488
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:44,295
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

489
01:12:44,675 --> 01:12:47,505
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

490
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:50,504
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

491
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,634
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

492
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:58,434
<i>What do you
know of ecstasy?</i>

493
01:12:59,353 --> 01:13:02,023
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

494
01:13:03,523 --> 01:13:05,983
<i>I'm not working
for you anymore.</i>

495
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:08,863
<i>Nor is Milos.
I'm taking him home.</i>

496
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:39,367
Get away from me!

497
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:54,466
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

498
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:59,765
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

499
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:03,805
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

500
01:16:05,805 --> 01:16:10,434
She was a shame
to our house.

501
01:16:11,444 --> 01:16:16,904
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

502
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:24,493
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

503
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:31,752
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

504
01:16:38,881 --> 01:16:44,591
There's not only house, but a
daughter to take care of, too.

505
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:52,230
Our poor Jeca
became an orphan.

506
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,770
My Alice in Wonderland.

507
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:01,779
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

508
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,159
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

509
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:10,118
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

510
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:16,288
You'll have the honor
of giving her

511
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:20,497
a virgin's communion.
To make her a woman.

512
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:27,047
Like my late father
did with me.

513
01:17:38,226 --> 01:17:41,645
Come on, come on...

514
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:47,355
Now!

515
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:02,913
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

516
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:04,713
No, Milos, no...

517
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,222
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

518
01:18:18,552 --> 01:18:20,181
<i>What are you waiting
for? After him!</i>

519
01:20:56,486 --> 01:21:00,745
<i>Marko, it's me. Come for me.
Milos, what's wrong?</i>

520
01:21:00,995 --> 01:21:04,995
<i>Where are you?
I'm in the Celopecka street, no 7.</i>

521
01:21:05,245 --> 01:21:07,495
<i>Milos!</i>

522
01:21:42,651 --> 01:21:46,201
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

523
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:50,160
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

524
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,250
Be polite,
the girl is underage.

525
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:59,419
So what if
I am underage?

526
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,509
Look at this jerk!

527
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:34,076
No, Rasa, don't.

528
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,795
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

529
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:47,255
<i>into a shed
during summer.</i>

530
01:22:48,085 --> 01:22:51,044
<i>They leave them
for a month</i>

531
01:22:51,254 --> 01:22:54,214
<i>until their balls
are like mellons.</i>

532
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:58,803
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

533
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,303
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

534
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,023
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

535
01:23:07,903 --> 01:23:12,522
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

536
01:23:13,942 --> 01:23:18,571
<i>You're a he-goat, Milos.
I'm your monk.</i>

537
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,791
Don't worry, my child.

538
01:23:27,751 --> 01:23:30,250
My he-goat.

539
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,470
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

540
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:53,930
Welcome to a
warm family home.

541
01:29:48,762 --> 01:29:52,842
A real, happy
Serbian family.

542

543
01:29:58,971 --> 01:30:00,351
Art.

544
01:31:29,562 --> 01:31:33,232
That's it, Milos.
That's the cinema.

545
01:32:49,754 --> 01:32:51,794
That's film!

546
01:33:06,233 --> 01:33:07,693
Get away from me!

549
01:39:34,824 --> 01:39:36,414
Come on.

550
01:39:40,753 --> 01:39:42,753
