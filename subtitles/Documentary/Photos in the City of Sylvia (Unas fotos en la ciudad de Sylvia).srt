1
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,752
Dying is an art.

2
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,161
Like everything else,

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,222
I do it exceptionally well.

4
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,065
I do it so it feels like hell.

5
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,268
I do it so it feels real.

6
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,143
I guess you could say I have a call.

7
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,764
New edition
of The Saint Botolph's Review.

8
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,494
New edition
of The Saint Botolph's Review.

9
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,128
New edition
ofThe Saint Botolph's Review.

10
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,004
Tom.

11
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,509
Tom.

12
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,171
Excuse me.

13
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,511
Tom.

14
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,447
Tom, where are the magazines?

15
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,460
They got held up at the printers.

16
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,621
I saw you selling them.

17
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,221
Oh, that's right.

18
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,290
They didn't review me, did they?

19
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,304
No, they...
reviewed you all right.

20
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,275
It's Poetry, page 1 1 .

21
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,811
Essentially commercial.

22
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,891
Bourgeois poetic.

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,226
Nakedly ambitious.
It's not very flattering.

24
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,289
Who the hell
do they think they are?

25
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,164
Well, you can ask them yourself
if you want.

26
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,830
There's a launch party
at the Women's Union tonight.

27
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,772
8:00.

28
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,283
Where is he?
Who?

29
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,345
The one who wrote it.
What, that stuff about you?

30
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,451
No. The one who wrote
Fallgrief s Girlfriend.

31
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,519
This Edward Hughes.

32
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,862
Ted. He's over there.

33
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,167
- I read your poems.
- What?

34
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,543
As soon as I saw them,
I knew they were the real thing.

35
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,845
Great, big, crashing poems.

36
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,784
Not blubbering baby stuff
like the others.

37
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,961
They're colossal.

38
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,365
Magnificent.

39
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,429
Great blowing winds
on steel girders.

40
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,907
You like?
I like.

41
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,912
Oh, most dear,
unscratchable diamond.

42
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,110
Who the hell are you?

43
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,786
Sylvia Plath.

44
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,850
Sylvia Plath.

45
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,520
The one whose poem--
You tore to shreds.

46
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,088
No. No.
Yes.

47
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,464
It was the editor.

48
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,662
He must have known
you were very beautiful.

49
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,372
You're all there, aren't you?
Yes,

50
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,439
I am.

51
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,666
I have an obligation
in the other room.

52
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,574
Oh,Jesus Christ!

53
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,226
This I'll keep.

54
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,862
Black marauder.

55
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,396
One day I'll have my death ofhim.

56
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,723
One day I'll have
my death of him?

57
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,158
It's a bit morbid, isn't it?
He's my black marauder.

58
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,219
Well, don't get your hopes up.

59
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:21,096
Why? What have you heard?
Him and his crowd,
all they care about is poetry.

60
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,034
Anything else is a distraction.

61
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,264
Including steady girlfriends.

62
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,137
Even pretty American ones...

63
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,870
with Fulbright scholarships
and red bicycles.

64
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,572
Ted Hughes.
Ted Hughes.

65
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,241
Edward Hughes. Edward Hughes.

66
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,750
Sylvia Plath.
Ted Hughes.

67
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,050
Mrs. Sylvia Hughes.

68
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,984
Get over.

69
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,426
Quiet!
Oh, shit!

70
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,429
- Wh-Which one?
- That one.

71
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,233
How the bloody hell do you know?
The light's on.

72
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,773
What are you doing?
Stand back.

73
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,903
Oh, bugger.

74
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,311
Give us a shot.

75
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,577
Here. Ooh!

76
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,677
What are you trying to do?
Bloody hell!

77
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,824
Oh, shit. Shit!

78
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,019
Shh!

79
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,494
Who is it?
Who's there?

80
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,964
I'm looking
for Miss Sylvia Plath.

81
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,934
Well, she's not here,
so just bugger off.

82
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,765
Excuse me.

83
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,103
Please, could you tell her
that Edward Hughes--

84
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,838
Ted Hughes called for her.

85
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,949
You're late.

86
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,794
He was here.
Who?

87
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,626
Your black marauder.

88
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,466
Him and his little playmate, legless,
chucking clods at my window.

89
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,563
- Thought it was yours apparently.
- What did he say?

90
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,131
Nothing comprehensible.

91
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,240
Sylvia, he left an address.

92
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,515
The chief defect of Henry King
was chewing little bits of string.

93
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,918
At last he swallowed some
which tied itself in ugly knots inside.

94
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,287
Physicians of the utmost fame
were called at once--

95
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,690
No, no, no. It's-- It's magic.

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,388
It's not about magic.
It's not like magic.

97
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,864
- It is magic.
- When Henry with his latest breath,
cried, Oh, my friends--

98
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,527
It's real magic.
It's not conjuring tricks...

99
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,502
- or pulling rabbits
out ofbloody hats.
- Bugger!

100
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,732
Incantations,

101
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,105
spells, ceremonies, rituals--
wh-what are they?

102
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,077
They're poems.
But if it comes to slaughter--

103
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,671
So what's a poet?
He's a shaman,
that's what he is.

104
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,273
Or she.

105
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,480
-Now in Injia's sunny clime,
where I used to spend my time--
- A fucking good poem is a weapon.

106
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,114
It's-- and not like a--
a popgun or something.

107
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,682
- It was Din! Din! Din!
- It's a bomb.
It's like a bloody big bomb.

108
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,491
That's why they make children
learn them in school.

109
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,497
Hitherao!
Water, get it.! Panee lao!

110
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,090
They don't want them messing about
with them on their own.

111
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,331
I mean,just imagine
if a sonnet went off accidentally.

112
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,373
Boom.

113
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,101
Drink.! Drink.!
Bollocks.

114
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,803
Sylvia.

115
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,313
Come on, Sylvia.
Go on.Just get up.

116
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,873
Give us some of your American poetry.
Go on.

117
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,621
If it be you that stir
these daughters' hearts...

118
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,627
against their father,

119
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,324
let not women's weapons,
water-drops,
stain my cheeks.!

120
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,129
- No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both...
- Faster!

121
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,227
that all the world shall--
I will do such things--

122
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,501
- What they are, yet I know not,
but they shall be the terrors of the earth.
- Faster!

123
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,771
You think I'll weep.
No, I'll not weep:
I'll have full cause of weeping:

124
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,577
but this heart shall break
into a hundred thousand flaws,
or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!''

125
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,085
Come on, Ted.

126
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,622
I know you all,
and will awhile uphold
the unyok'd humor of your idleness:

127
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,931
Yet herein will I imitate the sun
who doth permit the base contagious clouds
to smother up his beauty from the world.

128
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,597
That, when he please again to be himself,
being wanted, he may be more wondered at...

129
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,870
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
of vapors that did seem to strangle him.

130
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,242
Faster.
If all the years were playing holiday,
to sport would be as tedious as to work:

131
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,043
And when they seldom come,
they wish'd-for come,
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.

132
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,017
So, when this loose behavior I throw off
and pay the debt I never promised,

133
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,111
by how much better than my word I am,
by so much shall I falsify men's hopes:

134
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,817
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
my reformation, glitt'ring o'er my fault,
Faster.

135
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:44,295
shall show more goodly
and attract more eyes
than that which hath no foil to set it off.

136
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,831
I'll so offend to make offense a skill,

137
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,062
redeeming time
when men think least I will.

138
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,629
You buggers.

139
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,034
Morecambe, again.
- Okay.

140
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,546
Ah, dearJuliet,
why art thou yet so fair?

141
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,885
Shall I believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous,

142
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,049
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour?''

143
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,421
For fear of that
I still will stay with thee,

144
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,130
and never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

145
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,293
Here.

146
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,964
Here will I remain
with worms that are thy chambermaids.

147
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,074
O you...

148
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,909
the doors of breath,
seal with a righteous kiss...

149
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,347
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!''

150
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,287
Here's to my love.''

151
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,263
Thus with a kiss...

152
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,298
I die.

153
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,013
How did you get the scar?

154
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,927
I tried to kill myself three years ago.

155
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,970
I broke into the box
where my mother kept
the sleeping pills.

156
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,778
Went down to the basement,
into the crawl space
underneath the house.

157
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,750
And I took them,
and I went to sleep.

158
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,663
Did you ever have something
that you wanted to erase?

159
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,397
No.

160
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,101
And?

161
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,674
And I took too many
of the damn things,
and I puked them up.

162
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,088
Then three days later
my mother and brother found me
and pulled me out.

163
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,190
And what about the scar?

164
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,333
I ripped my cheek on the concrete
when they pulled me out.

165
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,839
A memento mori.

166
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,242
Yes.

167
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,814
Because I was dead.

168
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,986
Only I rose up again.

169
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,232
Like Lazarus-- Lady Lazarus.
That's me.

170
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,108
You wouldn't do that if you knew.

171
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,652
What?

172
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,416
What was down there.

173
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,451
-Jesus Christ! What's that?

174
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,794
Look.

175
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,405
Very intelligent, cows.
Did you know that?

176
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,446
Really?

177
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,914
Not a lot of people give them credit.

178
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,278
What do you think they'd prefer?

179
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,289
Milton or Chaucer?

180
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,789
Chaucer. Obviously.

181
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,564
Ladies, I give you
The Wife of Bath.

182
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,200
Experience,

183
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,336

186
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,356

Oh, that's beautiful.

187
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,261
Housbondes at chirche dore...

188
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,458
I have had five.

189
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,401
Twenty-third of August, 1 956.

190
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,566
We thank you for the manuscript
you submitted recently,

191
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,667
but we cannot use this at present.

192
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,372
It is herewith returned
with our compliments.

193
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,642
Yours faithfully--
blah, blah, blah.

194
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,809
How many today?
Two.

195
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,285
They went straight back out.

196
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,021
And I typed up four more copies
of your manuscript,

197
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,150
so now there are seven in circulation.

198
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,600
Sylvia!

199
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,549
Come on. Wake up.

200
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,559
Mmm. What time is it?

201
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,721
It doesn't matter about
the bloody time.
Look at this. Look, look, look.

202
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,523
Our congratulations that
Hawk in the Rain...

203
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,092
judged winning volume
Poetry Center first prize publica--''
You won!

204
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,105
I've fucking won.
You won.

205
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,869
I've fucking won.

206
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,577
I didn't even know I'd entered.

207
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,113
You know what this means,
don't you?

208
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,087
You're going to be a published poet.

209
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,615
And?
We're going to America?

210
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,127
And?

211
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,304
Those whom God hath joined together,

212
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,407
let no man put asunder.

213
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,922
Oh, no, Daniel, don't--
Not there, dear.

214
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,965
Put it over there.
That looks much better. Yes.

215
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,327
Great.

216
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,894
I'd like to tie this back if I could.
Goodness.

217
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,806
Mommy!
Oh, darling.

218
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,473
Welcome home, my darling.

219
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:30,214
Oh! God.
Oh, you look beautiful.

220
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh, my sweet.
So this is the Übermensch?

221
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,855
Hmm?

222
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,919
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Plath.
Sylvia's told me a lot about you.

223
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:43,263
Mmm. Well, let's hope
for both our sakes
that some of it's true.

224
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,203
Leave the bags.
I'll have Sam and Daniel get them.
Sam, Daniel.

225
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,143
What do you think?

226
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,510
Still too runny.

227
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,742
About Ted.

228
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,346
He's very--

229
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,684
What?

230
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,788
I don't know.

231
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,851
Different.

232
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,196
Why can't you ever
just be pleased for me?

233
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,204
How is he going to support you?

234
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,968
I don't want to be supported.

235
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,101
He's gonna be a great poet.

236
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,412
He just won this poetry prize
that was judged by W.H. Auden.

237
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,474
Really?

238
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,447
And I've got money saved up.

239
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,750
And when that runs out?

240
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,264
Mother, I just got this teaching job.

241
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,670
And I could always sell stories
to those stupid magazines.
It doesn't matter.

242
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,571
Darling, you know I've only wanted
what's best for you.

243
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,870
Well, he is the best for me.

244
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,343
Then what do you want me to say?

245
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,509
That you like him.

246
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,610
Do you love him?

247
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,350
I love him.

248
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,484
Then I like him.

249
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,542
Hey, Bob.
Hey.

250
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,443
- Oh, Mrs. Bergstrom. Hello.
How are you?
- Sylvia.

251
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,504
It's so lovely to see you.

252
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,709
And you. You're looking beautiful.
Thank you.
This is my husband, Ted.

253
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,946
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

254
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,147
We've heard a lot about you.
Likewise.

255
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,680
How are you enjoying yourselves?
Hello. Oh, we're having
such a nice time.

256
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,954
Good.
Thank you.

257
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,053
You've made us feel so at home.
Hasn't she?

258
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,997
If I close my eyes,
I could be back in Mytholmroyd.

259
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,057
Your hem's up in the front, darling.

260
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,194
Oh.
Elizabeth, meet Ted.

261
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,831
Ted, Elizabeth Brooks.
How do you do?

262
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,570
My, aren't you
the catch of the day.
Ted is going to be a great poet.

263
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,078
His last book won--
What was that?

264
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,205
The New York Center Poetry Prize.

265
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,308
It's rather good.
It's the, uh,
Hawk in the Rain.

266
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,319
Really wonderful.
You read it?

267
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,582
Yes. Of course.

268
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,022
What did you think
of the poem about the giraffe?

269
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,491
Oh, listen
to that accent.

270
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,258
There wasn't a poem
about a giraffe.
Say something else.

271
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,893
I need a drink.
Uh, excuse me, ladies.

272
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,456
This Sylvia's father?

273
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,898
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Bumblebees were his specialty.

274
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,562
It's all he ever thought about.

275
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,696
Before the war,
back in Germany,

276
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,264
his colleagues always called him
der Bienenkönig.

277
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,278
That means--
King of the Bees.

278
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,371
Yes, that's right.

279
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,541
That was Otto.
King of the Bees.

280
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,321
You must forgive my friends, Ted.

281
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,550
They, uh, haven't had
the advantages you have.

282
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,417
And what might they be?

283
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,430
Having to fight for what you want.

284
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,801
That's why she's in love
with you, you know.
Sylvia, I mean.

285
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,397
Oh, my God. There were--
Oh, there were--

286
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,136
I don't--
I don't mean to sound disloyal,
but there were...

287
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,144
a lot of other boys,

288
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,442
but they didn't scare her.

289
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,574
She rather frightened them, I think.

290
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,950
You're--

291
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,548
You're very different.

292
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,823
But I think you frightened her,
and that's why she likes you.

293
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,024
You think I'd hurt her.
No, I wouldn't hurt her.

294
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:16,303
Do you know that we found her
right where you're standing?
Right under there, near the boards.

295
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,739
We thought she was dead,
she was so pale, so white.

296
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,708
Some people want to be found.
Sylvia didn't.

297
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,910
She just...

298
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,886
crawled into a hole
and waited to die.

299
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,753
Be good to her.

300
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,952
Always.

301
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,406
Hi.
Hope you like fish.

302
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,281
Wow, look at those.
My God.

303
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,753
Did you have fun?
Uh-huh.

304
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,588
It finally cooled down.
It was so hot earlier, wasn't it?
You tell me.

305
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,719
I look a bit... messy because
I started baking, and I made--

306
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,788
Baking?
I made one real cream cake,
but it went a bit funny in the center.

307
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,425
I just decided to throw it out
and start over.

308
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,800
But the funny thing is,
the second one looks nicer than
the first one anyway.

309
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,135
I thought you were gonna write.

310
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,076
Do you know, some husbands
would be happy that their wives...

311
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,409
stayed home
and baked them some nice cakes.

312
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:43,018
I am happy.
I'd just be happier
if you were writing.

313
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,147
I've got the whole summer to write.

314
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,239
How was your walk?
Good.

315
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,146
Got a poem. A good one.

316
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,845
You?

317
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,911
I'm dried up.

318
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,980
That's 'cause you've got nothing to say.

319
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,150
I'm not a real writer.
Never will be.

320
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,093
I'm no good.
You make great cakes.

321
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,537
You know what your trouble is?

322
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,671
I have a husband who thinks
he can tell me how to write poetry?

323
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,736
There's no secret to it.

324
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,374
You've just gotta
pick a subject and...

325
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,417
stick your head into it.

326
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,418
You've got to write.
That's what poets do.

327
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,356
Yes, well, that's easy for you to say.

328
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,585
You go out for a bike ride
and come back with
an epic in hexameters.

329
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,725
I sit down to write,
I get a bake sale.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,774
Do you know what--

331
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,833
Do you know what my trouble is?

332
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,741
Is that I don't have a subject.

333
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,418
The novel, Falcon Yard,
what's that about?

334
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,520
It's... about a girl who meets a boy.

335
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,993
No. What's it really about?
You and me.

336
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,927
What's it really about?

337
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,158
Me.

338
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,031
A girl who spends her summer
at the beach?

339
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,332
No, see--
No, that's not really me.

340
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,498
Yes, it is.
You told me it was about you.

341
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:22,012
What I'm trying to say is
that you've already got your subject.
It's you.

342
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,571
And you keep skirting
round the issue.

343
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,141
- You keep flowering it up. You keep--
- All right, all right, all right.

344
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,812
Shit.

345
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,291
- jesus Christ.
- What?

346
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,296
The tide's dragging us out.

347
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,332
I'm not gonna get us back in.

348
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,628
People drown like this.

349
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,608
I tried to drown myself once.

350
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,214
I swam out in the sea
as far as I could,

351
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,692
but it just spat me out like a cork.

352
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,292
I guess it didn't want me.

353
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,893
You know, it's funny,

354
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,902
I was always happy
until I was nine years old.

355
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,044
I was always in one piece.

356
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,443
Then my father died.

357
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,830
Full fathom five my father lies:

358
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,995
Of his bones were coral made:
Those were pearls that were his eyes.''

359
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,352
Destroy.! Destroy.! Destroy.!

360
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,295
hums the underconsciousness.

361
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,698
Love and produce!
Love and produce!

362
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,759
cackles the upper consciousness.

363
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,204
And the world hears only
the love and produce cackle.

364
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:33,437
Refuses to hear the hum
of destruction underneath...

365
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,911
until such time as it
will have to hear.

366
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,882
The American has got to destroy!

367
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,619
It is his destiny.

368
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,088
And finally, this...

369
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,551
poem by Yeats, I think...

370
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,525
illustrates...

371
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,590
that point rather well.

372
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,165
Well, at least I hope it does.

373
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,399
Excuse me.

374
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,174
The Sorrow of Love.

375
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,012
The quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves,

376
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:19,022
the full round moon
and the star-laden sky,

377
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,526
and the loud song
of the ever-singing leaves,

378
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,653
had hid away earth's old and weary cry.

379
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,290
And then you came...

380
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,699
with those red mournful lips,

381
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,533
and with you came
the whole of the world's tears,

382
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,870
and all the sorrows ofher laboring ships,

383
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,105
and all the burden ofher myriad years.

384
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,580
And now the sparrows warring in the eaves,

385
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,483
the crumbling moon,
the white stars in the sky,

386
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,818
and the loud chanting of the unquiet leaves,

387
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,791
are shaken with earth's old and weary cry.

388
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,119
Thank you.

389
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,796
Thank you.

390
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,312
Thank you very much.
That's very kind. Take care.
I was so impressed.

391
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,212
Bye.
Yeah. Bye-bye. Thank you.

392
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,979
Mr. Hughes, uh, your voice--

393
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,180
so powerful.

394
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,315
But, uh, what did you think
of the words?

395
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,586
The words?

396
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,493
So when is your next book
coming out?

397
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,827
Well, when I've written it.

398
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,099
Oh, it must be wonderful
to be married to such a great poet.

399
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,731
Yes, it is. It is.

400
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,832
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

401
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,036
Sure.
Excuse me.

402
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,211
I'm sorry. I just--
I'm so exhausted,

403
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,683
and I've got a stack of papers
this high to get through.

404
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,879
Do you mind
if we go now or in a minute?

405
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,117
I'm gonna have to say thanks
to Merwin for that review.

406
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,659
And Len Baskin's here, so I--
Who's Len Baskin?

407
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,128
Len Baskin. He organized all this.
Oh, right. Right.

408
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,564
So, look, take the car.

409
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,102
All right.

410
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,161
I'll see you later.

411
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,538
Right.

412
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,487
Is Mr. Hughes in?

413
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,999
No.

414
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,038
He said he'd look at my poetry.

415
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,642
He said it would be okay.

416
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,750
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

417
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,991
Yeah.

418
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,269
Who is she?

419
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,444
She's nobody.

420
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,213
A student. She was...

421
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,753
in that creative writing class I--
I talked to.

422
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,453
She'd written all these poems.
I took pity on her.

423
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,928
- You think I'm fucking her.
- Are you?

424
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,495
Oh, for Christ's sake!

425
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,837
This place is really
getting to you, isn't it?

426
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,810
This bunch of dried up,
malicious old women...

427
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,406
who think their men
are gonna get a taste for fresh meat.

428
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,543
As a matter of fact,
I'm not fucking her.

429
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,283
But if I do start fucking the students,
you'll be the first to know.

430
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,596
Last night--
I--

431
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,189
I was very tired. I--

432
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,462
I've organized everything so I won't--
I won't be quite so tired, um--

433
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,473
I'm sorry.

434
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,041
It's not just you.
It's me as well.

435
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,770
I can't write here.

436
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,612
We should go back to England.

437
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,680
And live on what?

438
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,219
We'll survive, lovely.

439
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,672
Do you see that?

440
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,815
That's the world.

441
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,762
Page 1 4,

442
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,024
on line--line 1 4.

443
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,965
Yes. Page 1 4, line 1 4.

444
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,002
There is an E-- Yes.

445
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,904
No, two. Two P's.
Will you get that?

446
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,602
Uh, page 40.

447
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,637
Yes. Next--
Line eight.

448
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,583
Next the new moon's curve.''

449
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,711
Oh, those guys are all the same.

450
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,880
I mean, I wouldn't have thought--
Right.

451
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,655
Right.
I mean, after Hawk in the Rain,
they, uh--

452
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:53,060
No.
the literary establishment were all hoping
your next book would be an...

453
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,098
anticlimax.

454
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,032
But I'm pleased to say you've
confounded them and outdone yourself.

455
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,400
- It's really quite wonderful.
- On the back page.

456
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,401
In the back jacket.

457
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,841
Uh, I've just made some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

458
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,209
Well, I think you can speak
to the agent about that.
All right?

459
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

460
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,078
You must be Mr. Alvarez.
Yes, indeed.
And you must be Mrs. Hughes?

461
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,782
Night Shift?

462
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,950
Uh

463
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,790
Night Shift. It's a poem
you printed in the Observer.

464
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,626
Oh, yes.
Night Shift. Yes.
It was a good poem.

465
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,861
Well, yes, I know. I wrote it.

466
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,459
Oh, you're Sylvia Plath.
I am.

467
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,370
Oh. Nice to meet you.
And you.

468
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,204
Uh, tell me, have you written
any others or--
Yes, I have.

469
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,267
Actually, I have a, uh,

470
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,405
book of poems coming out
very shortly called The Colossus.

471
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,712
I'd love to read them.
Thank you. It would be an honor.

472
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,482
I spoke to George about it last week
and, uh, he was quite optimistic.

473
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,491
It might take another six months.

474
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,153
The whole thing,
it's about putting a face to a name.

475
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:01,061
For them to put, you know,
your name to duh, duh, duh,
and likewise.

476
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,691
I mean, we've got Charlie Hetheringham
here from the T.L.S.

477
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,429
There's Robinson
from the Critical Quarterly.
That one there?

478
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:09,336
Yeah. And, um, there's, uh,
the Telegraph there and the Times.

479
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:12,170
And, uh--
Oh,yes,you see that chap with
the big ears?

480
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,176
He's easy. He's from the Listener.

481
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,269
So, it's a good turnout,you know.

482
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,179
That's a good sign, isn't it,
that they all came?

483
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:23,310
Well, yes, of course.
I mean, don't get your hopes up too high,
but, yes it is. It really is.

484
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,948
They're all bloody
civil servants moonlighting
as journalists.

485
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,857
It's their job to protect
the status quo.

486
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,660
That's the toughest.
Mr. Robinson.

487
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,724
Mr. Robinson.

488
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,735
You forgot this.

489
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,169
Oh, uh, thanks.

490
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,104
Do you think
you might be reviewing it?

491
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,540
This? I shouldn't think so.
We just got the new Pasternak.

492
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,478
Then Betjeman's out next week,
and there's an e.e. cummings
in the pipeline.

493
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:54,278
Not in the same league,
really, is she, this Sylvia--

494
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,953
Plath.

495
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,047
Poor thing. Can't be easy for her,

496
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,116
being married to that.

497
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,062
Still, good party.

498
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,189
Thank the boss.

499
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,050
This is good.
What?

500
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,090
By Alvarez.
Very good.

501
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,922
Listen.

502
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,828
Her poems rest secure
in a mass of experience...

503
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,890
that is never quite brought out
into daylight.''

504
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,731
Then there's a quote, and it says,

505
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,934
It is this sense of threat,
as though she were
continually menaced...

506
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,808
by something she could see
only out of the corner of her eye...

507
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,438
that gives her work its distinction.''

508
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,240
What about the rest?

509
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,947
It's a good review.
One review?

510
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,081
But it's a good review.

511
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,993
Look, it's hard.
You know it's gonna be hard.

512
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,895
My first book--
Won prizes.

513
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,002
I'll get it.

514
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,271
Hello.

515
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,943
No, no.
No, no. No problem.

516
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,145
Yes.

517
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:40,657
Yeah. Oh, no, certainly. Certainly.

518
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,715
Um

519
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,762
Yes. No, no.
That's no problem. I'll

520
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,059
Good. All right.

521
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,758
Good-bye. Bye.

522
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,061
That was Moira Doolan,
the lady from the BBC I told you about.

523
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,633
I sent her that idea
for the children's radio series.
You remember?

524
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,076
No.
Well, she wants to
have lunch.

525
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,113
I think she's interested.

526
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,582
A bit short notice, isn't it?

527
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,815
I'll see you later.

528
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,691
Bye.

529
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,942
Yes, is that the BBC?

530
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,913
May I-- May I speak to a Moira Doolan
in children's radio, please?

531
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,579
Do you have any idea
what time she left?

532
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,760
Did you happen to notice
if she left by herself?

533
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:29,593
Well, have you any idea
if she plans on coming back there
this evening?

534
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:37,062
I understand. It--
I-- I'm looking for someone
who might have been with her.

535
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,074
His name is Edward Hughes.

536
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,475
My name is Sylvia Plath Hughes, and I--

537
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,779
Don't take that
tone of voice with me.

538
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,441
- What the fuck is going on?
- Where have you been?

539
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,106
What is going on?

540
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,242
I've been sitting here for 1 2 hours!
Where have you been?

541
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,787
- I was at a meeting!
- That was 1 2 hours ago!

542
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,323
It was a lunch meeting.
It went into dinner!

543
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,918
I called the BBC,
and they said Moira Doolan left!

544
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,452
- She had another meeting!
We met later!
- Fiction really isn't your gift, is it?

545
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,431
- We had dinner!
- Why don't you tell me where you were?

546
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,900
- She's a middle-aged woman.
- Fucking liar!

547
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,039
I love you.

548
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,344
Do you?

549
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,490
A month in advance,
that'll do as a deposit.

550
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,997
You've got, uh, a bedroom, kitchen,

551
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:19,434
uh, another bedroom or a study,
or whatever you want to use it for.

552
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,802
And this is the living room,
which you've seen already.
That's it.

553
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,205
Not much to it, I'm afraid.

554
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,800
No, it's fantastic.

555
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,210
It would be great for David.

556
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,339
Why? What is it that you do?
I'm a poet.

557
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:36,112
Ah. So are we.

558
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,246
You're

559
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,051
Ted Hughes.
I'll get some wine.

560
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,561
- I'm Sylvia Plath.
- Oh, my God. That's--

561
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,128
I gave Assia a copy
of your book, The Colossus.

562
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,224
That's amazing.

563
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,633
Yes, I love your poems.
Mmm.

564
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,728
They're very beautiful.
They're frightening.

565
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,764
Mmm.
They have this--
this haunting quality.

566
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,943
What?

567
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,312
No, it's just...

568
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,783
that's the best review
I've ever gotten.

569
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:14,617
I'm looking forward
to moving to the country.
Yes, I'm sure.

570
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,888
I think the fresh air
will help with the writing.
You think it will be isolated? Devon, I mean?

571
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,556
You know, you should come down
and spend a weekend with us.
Thank you.

572
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,565
Shouldn't they?
Shouldn't they what?

573
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,658
Come down to Devon
and spend a weekend.
They should.

574
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,135
Get out of the city.
Would be nice.
I'd love to.

575
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,417
Do you want to go higher?

576
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,144
Whoa.

577
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,556
Oopsy.

578
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,435
I'll get it.

579
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,040
Hello.

580
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,843
Hello.

581
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,847
No, I'm fine.

582
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,749
We're both fiine.
How are you?

583
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,549
How's David?

584
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,716
Oh, he has?
Oh, that's good.

585
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,758
No, that would be great,yes.

586
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,528
Well, Saturday's fiine.

587
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:44,370
Yes, yes. Yes.

588
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,046
I'll look forward to it.

589
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:53,514
Cheerio. Bye-bye. Bye.

590
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,085
That was Assia and David.

591
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:04,718
They wanna come down this Saturday.
That'll be nice, no?

592
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:11,756
God, it's so inspiring up here.

593
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,170
It's good to see you
and Ted again.

594
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:39,320
- Here, take my hand. It's muddy.
- Oh, my God. Would you mind?

595
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,695
- There you go.
- Thank you.

596
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:50,061
Thank you, Ted.
Oh, this country air.

597
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,173
Well, this soup is extraordinary.

598
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,345
Mm.
Have some more.

599
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,447
- No, I couldn't. Thank you.
- Please. Here, let me help you.

600
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,389
Ah, there's plenty.

601
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,893
Oh.Just a little, please.

602
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:16,523
- There you go.
- Whoops. Thanks. Always loved my food.

603
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,869
Ted says you have
the new Robert Lowell recording.

604
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,346
What?

605
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:33,905
The new Robert Lowell... recording.
What about it?

606
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,211
Well, perhaps we could
listen to it later?

607
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,118
Fine.

608
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,133
Thank you. Thank you.

609
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,299
Thank you.

610
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,502
Excuse me.

611
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,381
Do you mind telling me
what's going on?
I see you.

612
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:21,226
You see what?
Why do you insist on
humiliating me?

613
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,892
Sylvia, nobody's humiliating you.

614
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,199
I mean, why bother?
You do such a bloody
good job of it yourself.

615
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,669
Can I give you a top-up?
Please.

616
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:55,328
Oh, my God. Look at this.
Well,you shouldn't
have gone to all this trouble.

617
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,993
- I'm beginning to think the same thing myself.
- Oh,Jesus Christ.

618
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:09,738
Thank you.
That's enough for me. Thank you.

619
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,718
Thank you.

620
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,849
- You're not eating.
- No, I'm waiting for you.

621
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,092
I shall be very insulted
if you don't eat.

622
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,833
Would you like some?

623
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,846
No, you help yourself.

624
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,392
Thanks.

625
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,765
So, are you managing to write
at all, with the baby?

626
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,804
Me? Oh, no.

627
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,964
No. But Ted is.

628
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,600
And that's really all
that matters, isn't it?

629
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,406
I mean, he's the real poet
in the house.

630
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:31,960
The sea was still breaking violently
and night had steamed...

631
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:36,055
into our North Atlantic fleet
when the drowned sailor
clutched the dragnet.

632
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,528
Light flashed from his matted head
and marble feet.

633
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:46,132
He grappled at the net with the coiled,
hurdling muscles of his thighs.

634
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,205
The corpse was bloodless--
a botch of reds and whites--

635
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,213
I'm gonna do the washing up.
I'll help.

636
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,182
No, I'm fine.
No, I insist.

637
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,152
...on a stranded hulk
heavy with sand.

638
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,424
I'll wash, you dry.
Yes.

639
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:06,360
...and heave it seaward
whence it came...

640
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,920
where the heel-headed dogfish barks...

641
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,263
its nose on Ahab's void and forehead...

642
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,031
and the name is blocked
in yellow chalk.

643
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,669
What is going on?

644
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,167
Nothing's going on.

645
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:59,180
Assia was just telling me
about a dream she'd had.
Can I help with anything?

646
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,706
I'd like you and Assia to leave
first thing in the morning.

647
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:09,356
It's just that I'm tired.
I'm so tired, and I--

648
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,916
You don't know what I've been through.
I've got two small children.

649
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,656
If you had children of your own,
you would understand.

650
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,722
I'm sorry.

651
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,926
Of course.

652
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,856
When will you be back?

653
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,619
I don't know.

654
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:47,459
A couple of days, maybe three.

655
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,464
Depends how long it takes.

656
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,396
What number will you be at?
I haven't decided
who I'm gonna stay with yet.

657
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,904
I think people are getting pretty sick
of me sleeping on their floors.

658
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:00,409
So, I'll probably just
check into a bed-and-breakfast.

659
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:09,451
You don't have to go,
you know.

660
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,188
Yes, I do.

661
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,887
Sylvia?

662
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,588
The truth comes to me.

663
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,694
The truth loves me.

664
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,442
Hello?

665
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,523
I know who you are.

666
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,221
Hello.

667
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,578
Get out.

668
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,249
This is the light of the mind.

669
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:10,588
If the moon smiled,
she would resemble you.
Their redness talks to my wound.

670
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,692
She would drag me, cruelly,
being barren.

671
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,260
Thick, red and slipping--

672
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,330
Your nakedness shadows our safety.

673
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,237
Whose is that long white box
on the grove?

674
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:27,612
They can die, I need feed them nothing.

675
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,617
I sizzled in his blue--

676
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,677
Our cheesecloth gauntlets
neat and sweet--

677
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:38,660
Bare-handed I hand the combs.
The man in white smiles--

678
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:42,458
So I can't see what is in there.
Some god got hold of me--

679
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:46,399
Lightly, through their white swaddlings,
like an awful baby--

680
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:50,165
A world of bald white days
in a shadeless socket.

681
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,640
I cannot undo myself,
and the train is steaming--

682
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,643
The upflight of the murderess--

683
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,307
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.

684
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,816
They always knew it was you.

685
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:07,117
Daddy, Daddy, you bastard, I'm through.''

686
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,289
It's, uh

687
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,266
It's what? What is it?

688
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,033
Is it any good?

689
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,803
Good?

690
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,366
Oh, God, yes.

691
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,786
That Daddy'' poem,
the use of metaphor,

692
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,821
the way it builds at the end...

693
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:43,984
out of the blackness
into an explosion of fury,

694
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,391
it's just stunning.

695
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,455
I'm thinking of moving back
to London.

696
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,160
I'll send you some more
as soon as I'm settled.

697
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,533
I'd like that.

698
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,165
Sylvia.

699
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,611
I know this must
have been hard on you.

700
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,015
No.

701
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:13,486
Really, I've never been happier.

702
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,451
And I've never written more.
It's as if...

703
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,894
now he's gone, I'm free.

704
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,659
I can fiinally write.

705
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:32,502
I wake up between 3:00 and 4:00,
'cause that's the worst time,

706
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,065
and I write till dawn.

707
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:40,714
I really feel like
God is speaking through me.

708
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:00,260
And now we need
the little purple star.

709
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,269
Go up here.

710
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,703
Put all of them on.

711
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:15,105
We've got the snowflake.

712
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,118
All right.

713
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,088
Where's he gonna live?
Mm, there.

714
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:32,063
She looks beautiful.

715
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,639
Hello?

716
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,109
Hello?
All right.

717
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,972
I'm very sorry to bother you.
I'm-I'm-I'm--

718
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,349
I live upstairs and my lights have gone out.
I've got no hot water.

719
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,912
I've got my children up there and I'm--
There's been a power cut.

720
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,086
The moment you need heat
and light to sustain life itself,

721
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,527
the government cuts the electricity.

722
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,531
Why?

723
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:08,662
To build the national character.
Now, leave your stove on for heat
and to boil water for washing.

724
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,570
Here's some spare candles,

725
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,404
yeah, and some-- and some matches.

726
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,377
There you are.
Thank you.

727
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:21,007
You must think
I'm some stupid American bitch.

728
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,449
Oh, no, not at all.
I assumed you were Canadian.

729
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,184
Yes. Well, thank you.
Pleasure.

730
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,191
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

731
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,574
Hello, sweetheart.
This one's for you.

732
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,812
Happy Christmas, darling.

733
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,781
I didn't just come to see them.
I wanted to see you.

734
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,789
Wanted to see how you are.

735
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:12,224
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.

736
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,034
Christmas is bloody hard.

737
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:25,443
Can we-- Can we talk?
Can we sit down?

738
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,557
Are you still fucking her?

739
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:17,055
I have fallen a long way.

740
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,259
The moon sees nothing of this.

741
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:28,437
And the message of the yew tree
is blackness--

742
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,871
blackness and silence.

743
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,313
I don't know what else to do.

744
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,554
I can't

745
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:57,026
I can't go back to her,
but I love her so much it's--

746
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,487
Do you want another one?
Mm.

747
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,290
Thank you.

748
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,422
This one is extraordinary.

749
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:58,023
And, uh, ''Lady Lazarus, ''
the one about the, uh--

750
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,866
the failed suicides--
the despair,

751
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:05,566
the overpowering sense of foreboding,
and yet without a trace...

752
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,404
of anger or hysteria...

753
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:11,412
or any appeal for sympathy.

754
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:16,407
The-- The wealth of imagery.

755
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,146
Such horrors,

756
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,282
but expressed with, um--

757
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,718
with a coolness,

758
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:31,630
like a--
like a murderer's confession.

759
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,130
So

760
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:42,040
have you got a title
for your novel yet?

761
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,602
The Bell Jar.
When's it coming out?

762
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,083
The New Year.

763
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,984
Are you gonna let me read it?

764
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,988
It's a potboiler.

765
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,121
Could you get me an ashtray?

766
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,221
Sure.

767
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,394
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.

768
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,937
But I'm starting.

769
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,473
I'm thinking of trying
some new things.

770
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,567
Really? Like what?

771
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:20,243
I'm thinking of taking a lover.

772
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,341
Oh, how glamorous.

773
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,352
Who is he?

774
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:59,014
Look, I know how you feel.

775
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,853
No, you don't.
I do.

776
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,717
We have-- We share in common a--

777
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,361
I...

778
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:17,064
I tried to-- I tried to--

779
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,342
How?

780
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,776
Uh, same as you. Sleeping pills.

781
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:32,745
I, uh-- I took too many.

782
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:35,415
Everybody does, don't they?

783
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:52,037
Sometimes I feel like I'm not... solid.

784
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,168
I'm hollow.

785
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,236
There's...

786
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,850
nothing behind my eyes.

787
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,409
I'm a negative of a person.

788
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,056
It's as if I never--

789
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,757
I never thought anything.

790
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:22,701
I never wrote... anything,
I never felt anything.

791
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:29,343
All I want is blackness--

792
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,673
blackness and silence.

793
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,049
Look,

794
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,718
one thing I do know about death...

795
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,389
is it is not a--

796
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:53,400
a reunion or a homecoming.

797
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:57,268
There's-- There's no--

798
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,831
Your life doesn't flash before you and
the missing piece of you clicks into place.

799
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,675
It's just-- There's just fuck all.

800
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,839
There's nothing.

801
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,779
So what do you do when your life...

802
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:16,085
gets as bad as it can...

803
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,421
and just keeps getting worse?

804
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:23,657
You just keep going.

805
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,992
Look.

806
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,063
Listen.

807
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:37,441
You are so beautiful.

808
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,640
And you've--you've
a wonderful mind.

809
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:47,353
And you are a great--
a great poet.

810
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,984
And you and Ted,

811
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,858
you understand each other
in ways that--

812
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:59,025
that other people
can only dream about.

813
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,500
So, for God's sakes, don't throw
it all away just because--

814
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:05,335
I don't want to hear her name.

815
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:10,902
I was gonna say
just because of an affair.

816
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,238
Are you all right? Come in.

817
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,947
Sit here.

818
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,952
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die soon.
Who's gonna take care of my babies?

819
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:29,489
Mrs. Hughes, I don't understand.
What do you mean, you're going to die?

820
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,957
Are you ill?
Have you been ill or--

821
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:35,325
No, I'm not ill.
I think I really
should call the doctor.

822
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:39,332
No, no, don't call a doctor.

823
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,463
Don't you know what they do?
They hook you up to the eastern grid
and fill you full of sparks.

824
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,440
Yeah. I'm sorry.

825
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:49,875
No, I'm sorry.

826
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,105
I'm just so on edge, I--

827
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,049
I'm just so on edge, I--

828
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:03,580
Oh, God, it's all my fault,
it's all my fault, it's all my fault.

829
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,149
All I could think about is
what would happen if...

830
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:09,196
somebody took him away from me.

831
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:12,427
You see, if you fear
something enough,

832
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,094
you can make it happen.

833
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,104
That woman,

834
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,198
I conjured her.

835
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,368
I invented her.
Do you understand?

836
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,003
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

837
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:33,819
It's just that I'm so tired,
I'm so tired, I'm--

838
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,749
If I could just sleep a little bit,
just a little bit--

839
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:42,728
I'm just so exhausted.

840
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:47,097
Perhaps we could get someone
to look after your children.
Oh, my God! I left them upstairs!

841
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:52,128
No, don't go. I'll go and check,
see if they're all right.
Would you like me to do that?

842
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,937
You stay there.

843
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,977
You're a very nice man.

844
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,479
Mm, no.

845
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:03,244
You remind me a little of my father.

846
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:47,186
Yes, hello, Kate. It's Sylvia.

847
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,289
I'm all right. I'm--

848
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:55,325
I was wondering if I could
come round and see you.

849
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,409
I see. Okay.

850
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:25,261
Dr. Hawkins, it's Sylvia.

851
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:31,298
I...

852
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:34,864
I need help. I...

853
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:38,275
I don't think I can...

854
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,405
manage.

855
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:39,765
You look... very nice.

856
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,529
You'd better come in.

857
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:04,118
Would you like a drink?

858
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,229
Please.

859
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,004
What do you want, Sylvia?

860
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:31,082
I wanted to see you.

861
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,819
I thought that you...

862
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:40,156
might like to see us.

863
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,526
I thought there was
something wrong.

864
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,862
Alvarez said you tried
to make a pass at him.

865
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:56,073
And I've been told
you've been taking pills.
No.

866
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:07,173
God, I missed you.

867
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,451
I almost went mad.

868
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,381
We're not even two people.

869
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:25,659
Even before we met,
we were just...

870
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:28,998
these two halves...

871
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,971
walking around with big...

872
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:36,237
gaping holes in us
shaped like the other person.

873
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:41,643
And then we found each other
and we were finally a whole.

874
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:50,424
But then it's as if we couldn't
stand being happy,

875
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:54,552
so we ripped-- we ripped
ourselves in half again.

876
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:10,509
In the spring,
we should go back to Devon.

877
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:15,242
We'll go back to Devon
and it'll just be us...

878
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:18,649
and the children and our work.

879
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:24,656
It'll be like this
whole thing never happened.

880
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:30,255
And the summer and the fall
and this awful winter--

881
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:36,002
it'll all fade by the time
the leaves come out.

882
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:42,665
And it'll just seem like some nightmare
that was never real.

883
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:56,556
You don't love her
like you love me.

884
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:03,793
You'll never have with her
what you have with me.
You know that.

885
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,100
I know.

886
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:14,438
Leave her.

887
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,974
I can't.

888
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:31,247
She's pregnant.

889
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,874
Oh. Everything all right?

890
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:30,942
Do you have any stamps?

891
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:35,148
It's silly, I know, but I've got, uh--

892
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:38,851
I've gotta post some letters
to America tonight and I--

893
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,121
airmail, and I don't have any stamps.

894
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:44,255
Well, can't you post them
in the morning?

895
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:52,002
No. No, I've got-- I've got
a nurse coming in the morning.
You see, there's a nurse coming.

896
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:55,064
And, anyway, I won't
be here in the morning.

897
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:58,339
Oh, I see.
Yes, I think I've got some.

898
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:07,578
Here we are.
Thank you.

899
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,522
Stamps. Thanks.

900
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:12,616
Thank you.

901
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:14,923
Well, good night.
Good night.

902
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:01,905
Look, do you want me
to call someone?

903
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,870
No.

904
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,409
No, I was just having--

905
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:15,819
I just had the most beautiful... dream.

906
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,106
I love you, sweetheart.

907
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:14,132
The box is locked.
It is dangerous.

908
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:18,508
There are no windows,
so I can't see what is in there.

909
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:21,605
There is only a little grid.

910
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,344
No exit.

911
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:08,445
Hearing impaired by --TDB--
